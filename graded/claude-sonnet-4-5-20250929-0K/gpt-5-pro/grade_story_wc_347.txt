<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The caretaker is internally consistent—driven by debt and resentment, yet compelled to guide. Contradictory impulses appear simultaneously: "I resented it the way rust resents salt, swelling, bright, inevitable, and strangely clean." The grandmother backstory anchors method without derailing present pressure. Embodied reaction under stress ("rolled it in my palm") and the final renunciation (pressing the nut into another's hand while advising against blueprint-knowledge) earn the cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis. The caretaker returns to duty after guiding travelers safely, explicitly articulating the trade-off: "giving directions empties me of myself, leaving shapes others can survive within." Cost is legible in the final line ("leaving myself behind where no one could touch"). The orchard-labyrinth anchors by line four; the nut's blueprint seed appears early and charges the ending. One tightening (strangers arrive, night approaching) deepens into the final choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The cliffside labyrinth, mechanical birds, and terraces constrain every tactic: shaking branches to redirect shadows, snapping reeds to shape dust impressions, flicking the nut into bird gears. The nut itself (micro-setting object) charges the closure when passed to the youngest stranger. Sensory selection reflects urgency: "copper and thyme," "penny bright mourning." Spatial choreography tracks cleanly across ledges and switchbacks. The orchard's voice and the birds' patrols pressure the protagonist's method throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: guide three strangers to safety before frost and bird patrols close the paths. The travelers' arrival tightens options; night descending forces the sequence of subtle interventions. Agency is renunciation with visible cost—the caretaker empties the self to create survivable shapes for others. The nut wedged into the oldest bird's gear establishes the tactic, reused at climax. Coincidence does not resolve; every turn follows caretaker choice under mechanical and temporal pressure. The orchard's disappointment signals a live opposing force.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from image and act: guidance as self-erasure, the curse as civil trap offering perfect direction that costs autonomy. The nut's blueprint recurs with shifting weight—memory, tool, gift, warning. The ending reweights the premise without moralizing: "You could assemble a life from too much knowing…and never taste the crooked sweetness that keeps a heart surprising." The orchard whispers names, inviting bites that plant paths inside sleep—subtext charges every offered apple. No thematic echo; the caretaker's contradictory motive (resentment and inevitability) sustains ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct and stable: "reluctant as a door reluctant to open on a winter morning," "graceless beauty…all beaks and angles." Diction remains orchard-specific and sensory under pressure. Dialogue ("Follow the turn where the olives taste of iron") carries goal and subtext. Distance is controlled—first-person interiority modulates with emotional intensity without head-hopping. No filter-verb stacks; purposeful compression ("I spoke of it to travelers offhandedly exact") matches voice. The told truth versus "deeper truth" layering shows psychic distance shift at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (image, motive, world rule). Rhythm varies purposefully: short declaratives at peak beats, longer syntactic waves in reflection. Minor template cadence appears in the traveler-guidance passage ("I shook…I snapped…I spoke…I flicked") but propulsion holds and the pattern reads as tactical sequence under time pressure. No paraphrase loops. Figurative language is controlled and vehicle-coherent: "rust resents salt," "trees drank the cliff's marrow." Opening and closing lines charge prior motifs. Zero scaffolding or synonym churn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes cursed orchard, mechanical surveillance, and self-erasure as guidance into a coherent whole. The reluctant caretaker archetype is freshened by the offhandedly exact voice and the method of impressions-without-touching. The nut as blueprint-seed is specific and irreplaceable. Risk: lyric-accumulative structure with extended reflection could stall, but interleaved micro-choices (shaking branch, snapping reed, flicking nut) keep pressure live. The grandmother slap and brine-exit feel lived-in rather than invented. Emotional specificity (resentment "swelling, bright, inevitable, and strangely clean") avoids template language.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Present by line one. Drives guidance beats (shaking branch, snapping reed, flicking nut into bird gear) and the final choice to pass the nut and return to duty. Caretaker status constrains method (must look like wind) and motive (debt, resentment, grandmother's legacy). Closure hinges on caretaker's self-erasure. Cost is explicit: "leaving myself behind where no one could touch." Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Appears early (grandmother's method, line 18; "small nut wedged in a gear," line 11). Used in three beats: memory anchor, tactic (flicked into bird feathers), gift at closure. Blueprint spiral etched on shell enables path assembly. Final transfer charges ending with warning against over-knowing. Irreplaceable; no other object provides map, tool, and thematic payload. Visible cost tied to its surrender.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Signaled early: nut shell shows "corridors where trees drank the cliff's marrow." Enables path assembly tactic ("With its pattern I could assemble their path"). Shapes final warning: "You could assemble a life from too much knowing." Appears in setup, middle (enabling guidance), and payoff (thematic charge). Causal role in middle beat and conceptual repricing at end, but swappable with "hidden map" or "secret pattern" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Established early: "offhandedly exact, as if discussing weather, because certainty calms panic." Enacted on-page: precise directions ("Follow the turn where the olives taste of iron") and the final understatement ("the nearest truth…the deeper truth"). Constrains method—voice must sound casual to avoid bird suspicion. Costs relational intimacy; travelers ask why caretaker stays, receive only surface answer. Drives tone and tactic across multiple beats; removing it flattens voice and method.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Signaled midpoint: "With its pattern I could assemble their path, not by building, but by waking what already wanted to become a guide." Enacted through sequence: shake branch (shadows lean), snap reed (dust shivers, footprints appear), flick nut (bird pauses). Shapes climax tactics and enables safe passage. Final line revisits self-assembly theme. Present in two gates (middle, closure); causal in middle beat. Could swap with "construct" or "arrange" without breaking logic, limiting top range.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Signaled early: "learned to leave impressions without touching, persuading dust, light, and scent to mark paths." Mechanics matter throughout: shaking branch "so gently the leaves only thought of stirring," snapping reed "not touching the dust, only singing near it until the skin of grit shivered." Grandmother marked route with cane (model).Constrains all guidance beats—birds "read disturbances, not footsteps." Indispensable; removing it collapses the method and stakes. Cost: precision labor that exhausts.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Anchors by line three. Birds patrol, measure, report disturbances—forcing impressions-without-touching method. Terraces and ladders supply spatial pressure. Birds' cold thermals "carve the orchard into separate islands" at night, raising stakes. Nut wedged in bird gear enables one beat; flicked into feathers enables climax corridor. Final switchback marks closure boundary. Setting drives every tactic and the time constraint. Irreplaceable; story logic fails without mechanical surveillance and vertical maze.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Signaled early: "my task was to guide them to safety before the night frost forms." Repeated: "Night would lower its frost soon, and the birds tighten their patrols." Drives urgency in guidance sequence and forces pace ("setting their pace against the tide of wings"). Closure beat: "We reached the last switchback before the frost." Clock is live and tracked; removing it deflates pressure. Present in all three gates with causal force, but could swap "nightfall" or "storm" with edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Stated early: "my task was to guide them to safety." Friction dramatized: "I resented it the way rust resents salt, swelling, bright, inevitable." Guides all tactics (shaking, snapping, flicking, speaking directions). Conflicted at closure: saves them yet feels "uglier and tender, that giving directions empties me of myself." Cost legible in final return to duty. Drives three beats and ending. Strong integration, but "protect" or "save" could substitute with minor tonal edits.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Established early: birds "beautiful in a graceless way, all beaks and angles, clattering music." Modulates under pressure: orchard's "crooked sweetness," rust resenting salt "swelling, bright, inevitable, and strangely clean." Final line reprises: "graceless beauty that still required me." Tone charges closure image and reflects protagonist's contradictory stance. Coherent through lyric reflection and high-pressure beats. Distinct and consistent; could not swap with "harsh elegance" without flattening specificity.</comment>
