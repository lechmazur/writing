<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The storm-recorder POV delivers consistent interiority shaped by professional habit ("I study the wind the way I study people"), with embodied stakes ("I felt the courtyard breathe"). The follower's arrival and her quiet test of the narrator's integrity creates relational pressure, and the final vow to keep the report "unowned even if it costs comfort" names a visible cost. However, the protagonist's choices operate mostly in reflection rather than in-scene micro-decisions under immediate pressure, and the internal voice occasionally drifts into therapeutic phrasing ("integrity likes a solitary room").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening paragraph; the inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure (the quarantine zone and follower converge to test the narrator's stance). Closure lands as Charged Poise: the narrator commits to the unowned report, crystallizing options with felt cost ("keep the report unowned even if it costs comfort"). The pigeon's return and the simple plan with the follower deepen stakes without requiring a causal reversal, consistent with the textural mode. Minor cost ambiguity: the vow names future discomfort but does not demonstrate immediate forfeiture on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The courtyard provides sensory detail (fountain, pigeons, balustrade) that grounds the narrator's patient observation, and the pigeon's arrival supplies the message tube that drives the turn. The rusted footbridge inference ("metallic as pennies") demonstrates professional perception filtering setting detail. The courtyard's spatial logic remains coherent, and the recurring image of "layered tranquility" modulates slightly with the follower's arrival. The environment does not directly constrain a choice but charges the reflective frame throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—maintaining integrity by recording unowned truth—is signaled early and tested by the follower's implicit question (will the narrator sell the weather?). The pressure deepens when the pigeon delivers the message, and the narrator's decision to form a plan "not head on but by progressing laterally" narrows options. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as thematic intensification rather than causal tightening; the plan itself is stated, not dramatized with on-page friction. The cost is named at closure ("even if it costs comfort") but not felt in a forfeited option during the scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—integrity as patient, lateral attention to unowned truth—emerges from concrete images (the pigeon's tube, the wire on fences, the map at the window) and the narrator's professional method rather than assertion. The final image ("the wind choose the order of my vows") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to how one maintains exact witnessing under surveillance. Subtext operates strongly in the follower's careful test ("to see if I would sell our weather"). One line edges toward thematic summary ("Truth has a grain like wood or wind"), slightly over-articulating the metaphor, but the closure image reweights the material without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The first-person voice maintains a distinct perceptual signature (storm metaphors, lateral observation, professional patience) and stays character-bound throughout. Dialogue with the follower is sparse, purposeful, and carries subtext ("her voice was careful, unsuspicious"). The prose occasionally inflates into elevated register ("layered tranquility," "velvet motor") that reads slightly decorative rather than voice-motivated under peak pressure. Distance control is stable, and focalization remains consistent; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks obscure immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and generally coherent ("quiet courtyard at dusk holding the day's last breaths like folded paper boats"), but several constructions border on overwriting without payoff: "air still felt classified, as if stamped reluctantly with approval" mixes metaphors; "the sky practiced remaining undecided" stacks personification. A paraphrase loop appears mid-story: "I would go once more to the perimeter, not to sneak but to stand where wind shifts, and write what the fences cannot muffle" recaps the lateral-approach idea stated two paragraphs prior. Information density is strong in the pigeon sequence and closing vow; rhythm modulates appropriately. Aggregate artifact penalty totals approximately −0.6 in Q7 for density and minor loop, escalated slightly because one figurative clash occurs in the closure third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of storm-recording as surveillance resistance and the carrier pigeon as an old tech bypass within a modern quarantine zone offers a fresh angle. The lateral-observation frame is executed consistently rather than merely claimed. Emotional specificity (the follower's "rain under her coat," the pigeon's "small confession") avoids generic templates. The premise risks echoing familiar "witness under surveillance" templates, but the occupational detail (measuring gutters, counting raindrops aloud) and the metaphorical consistency (weather as truth-telling) transform it. The story commits fully to its lyric-textural mode without retreat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The meticulous storm recorder appears in setup (opening sentence), constrains middle choices (reading the pigeon's clues via professional lens, inferring the footbridge), and shapes closure (the vow to count raindrops aloud and keep the report unowned). Observation drives several key beats, and the final decision to walk the river path is grounded in the recorder's method. The character's professional identity is indispensable to the story's logic and tone.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The carrier pigeon's message tube is handled on the page in at least three beats: arrival, inspection of contents (map, hair, pencil note), and refastening to the bird. The tube's scuffed, salt-crusted state and metallic smear provide clues that the narrator uses to infer the footbridge route. It returns with reweighted meaning when the narrator promises to wait for "another thread" as proof the route is breathing. The object is essential to the turn and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The rogue quarantine zone is seeded early (the red-ringed map, the private weather, the fences), shapes the narrator's professional focus (measuring moods where officials measure only air), and motivates the follower's arrival (her brother lives inside). The zone's constraints (guards, fences, tightening perimeter) inform the lateral-approach plan. It does not directly alter on-page choices in a single causal beat but coheres the dominant stake throughout.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Credibly curious" is named twice: the narrator self-identifies at the opening and uses the phrase to assess the follower. It functions as a trait filter (the narrator waits to see if the follower will respect unowned work) but does not visibly constrain an action with cost on the page. The trait operates more as thematic color than a lever that changes a choice. Label-only trend and late explicit reprise lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Intuit" is signaled early ("to intuit the safest way I read not only clouds but intentions") and demonstrated when the narrator infers the footbridge from the tube's metallic smear and the kinked hair matching quarantine wire. The method enables the plan to approach the perimeter. However, the action itself does not force a major turn with visible cost; it facilitates but does not redefine options. Present in setup and middle, contributes to closure framing.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Progressing laterally" is taught in the opening third ("by progressing laterally across what they avoid saying") and returns twice: the narrator describes the simple plan as lateral rather than head-on, and the closing vow reaffirms the method. The method shapes the tactical approach to the quarantine zone and distinguishes the narrator's professional stance. It appears in setup, middle tactical decision, and closure reflection, earning strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The quiet courtyard at dusk is anchored immediately and provides spatial grounding (fountain, balustrade, tiles) for the pigeon's arrival and the follower's entry. The courtyard's stillness supports the narrator's reflective stance and contrasts with the quarantine zone's tension. It does not directly constrain a choice but charges the tone and enables the pivotal beats. Present in setup and closure image ("I felt the courtyard breathe"), with coherent micro-setting detail.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"After being followed home" frames the opening tension and recurs in the penultimate paragraph ("after being followed home no longer means hunted"). The timeframe signals a recent event that primes the narrator's wariness and the follower's test. It does not impose a live clock that tightens decisions within the scene; the story operates in reflective aftermath rather than urgent present. Setup and closure reprise earn mid-band placement, but lack of tactical pressure from the temporal frame limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To nurture integrity in solitude" is stated in the opening lines and tested when the follower arrives (the narrator must decide whether to collaborate). The motivation drives the narrator's patient waiting, the choice to share the plan, and the closing vow to "keep faith by remaining specific." Friction arises between solitary integrity and the need for alliance. The desire is dramatized in choices (forming the plan, refastening the tube) and conflicted on the page. Strong thematic presence and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Layered tranquility" is seeded in the opening line and modulates coherently: the courtyard holds stillness, the air feels "classified," the pigeon lands with a "velvet motor," and the night "touched my shoulders" at closure. Tone remains consistent through the follower's arrival and the plan, never breaking into panic or melodrama. The final image ("letting the wind choose the order of my vows") charges the tone with patient resolve. The tone supports pressure and shapes the final resonance without static repetition.</comment>
