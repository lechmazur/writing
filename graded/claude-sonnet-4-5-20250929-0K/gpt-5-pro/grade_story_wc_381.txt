<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The summoner remains abstract—intention and listening are asserted but no interior contradiction or embodied struggle emerges. The final action (turning the origami wing, folding a crease) reads as ritual gesture rather than a choice with visible cost that forecloses a path. Interiority consists of poetic perception without character-particular diction or micro-choices under pressure. The piece maintains a stable, distant observational stance but does not dramatize flawed decision-making or renunciation that would earn higher credibility.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered imagery (brook, wing, hush) and a cadence shift at closure. Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by the opening paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (hush achieved, code dispersed, haven restored to ordinary quiet) but the cost remains conceptual and oblique—no visible forfeiture or altered option is shown on the page, only assertion that the prophecy "lost its way." The final image reweights prior material but lacks the on-page felt price required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven, brook, reeds, and origami wing anchor the setting and appear across multiple beats. The wing constrains the summoner's method (anchored to twig, creases catch starlight, turned once to redirect the brook's thought) and participates in the closure image. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through a poetic, elevated register. Economy is sometimes lost to extended metaphor, but the setting genuinely shapes the action and charges the final reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—hushing a prophecy before it unlocks a sky door—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates via imagery and ritual steps (listening, anchoring the wing, breathing with banks, turning the wing) but no reversal or narrowing of options occurs; the summoner faces no setback, adaptation, or trade-off. The resolution is achieved by method rather than agency under opposition, and no visible cost or foreclosed path appears on the page. Under the Accumulative lens one meaningful deepening suffices, but the lack of felt price or contested choice caps the score.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the ethics of silencing versus opening, listening as power, the tension between intention and impatience. The piece resists overt moralizing and offers ambiguity (the door "trying to be an answer for every question that pain had asked"). The final image—a map drawn where everyone could find it without words—provides a resonant, non-literal answer. Elevated diction occasionally abstracts ("terrestrially cosmic," "almosts") but does not collapse into platitude, and the core question about doors and hinges coheres across the arc.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; no head-hopping. The narrative voice is distinct, lyric, and elevated with controlled rhythm and lexical specificity (chirred, sibilants, crosshatched, cauterized). Perceptual signature is poetic but consistent. However, the register remains uniformly high throughout—no modulation under pressure, and the diction (e.g., "smoothed hush," "tranquil blaze," "terrestrially cosmic") risks sounding essayistic rather than embodied in the summoner's mind. The prose reads as narrated *about* the character rather than filtered *through* lived experience, limiting intimacy and urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled and sentences vary in length and structure. Information density is generally high, though some lines loop concepts: "hush a prophecy spoken in code" appears three times with minor variation, and "tranquil blaze" recurs without evolving function. Figurative language is dense (every paragraph carries metaphor or simile) but largely coherent; one mixed moment: "smoothed hush gathered like dew, a skin of calm that could bear delicate steps" conflates liquid and solid without clear vehicle. Elevated diction ("terrestrially cosmic," "lucid intention scrawled through weather") drifts toward abstraction in peak beats, reducing immediacy. No severe artifacts, but density and register constrain momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—silencing a prophecy by mapping silence with origami—offers a fresh synthesis of ritual, semiotics, and environmental listening. The summoner's humility and the "tranquil blaze" motif avoid stock heroic modes. Execution is specific (horsehair, twig, crane wing creases as star map) and the moral calculus (not every hinge should be found by longing) feels earned. However, the arc follows a familiar wizard-prevents-calamity template without meaningful friction or cost, and the elevated lyric register risks obscuring emotional particularity. Risk-taking is present in tone and method but does not fully transform the structural familiarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The solitary summoner is present throughout and makes decisions (comes to the haven, listens, anchors the wing, turns it, folds a final crease). These choices drive the sequence but operate more as ritual steps than contested turns; no alternative is weighed or foreclosed with visible cost. The character is essential to the frame but remains an observer-agent whose interiority is asserted rather than dramatized, limiting causal indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The crane's origami wing appears in setup (saved from a festival, carries a star map), development (anchored to twig, creases catch starlight and crosshatch water), and closure (turned once to redirect the brook, folded with a gratitude crease). It is handled in multiple beats and its specific properties (creases, paper, star map) constrain the method. The wing is causally active and participates in the ending, making it essential to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Smoothed hush" is introduced early, recurs across the middle (gathering like dew, receiving a syllable, drawn over the clearing), and is explicitly achieved at closure ("where the prophecy sought a chorus, the smoothed hush offered a solo"). It shapes the summoner's goal and the ending's reconfiguration, but the mechanics of how hush disperses code remain abstract—label and metaphor rather than dramatized constraint or cost. It is thematically central and present in closure but not irreplaceable as a causal mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Terrestrially cosmic" appears twice as descriptive label (the origami map is "terrestrially cosmic, a paradox"; later "the terrestrially cosmic click of things set back in their proportions"). It does not constrain or enable a specific action; it functions as thematic coloring. The attribute is ornamental, present but not causally integrated.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Flow" anchors the method: the summoner reads the brook's flow, imagines unspoken letters as hollows in the flow, cups hands over it, turns the wing so the brook "relearned its thought," and the "gentled current" remains as trace. Flow is signaled early, used in the central ritual, and present in closure. However, the action is not unique—"current," "stream," "water" could substitute with minor edits—and the consequences of altering flow are told rather than shown with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Mapping silence" is explicitly named as the summoner's tool and shapes the method: the origami creases form a star map of silences, the summoner names intervals between frog songs, reads creases and water as shared tongue. The concept is present in setup and middle beats. However, the mechanics remain metaphorical—how mapping silence disperses code is asserted, not demonstrated with on-page friction or cost. It is thematically central but not irreplaceable as a causal lever.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven beside the quiet brook is established in the opening line and supplies resources throughout: the brook's body and sound, reeds, crickets, the far bank where the heron lifts. The setting constrains the summoner's choices (he listens to the brook, anchors the wing to a twig, uses the flow to redirect the prophecy) and is inseparable from the closure effect (the haven feels ordinary again, the gentled current remains). The location is causally active across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Amid whispered secrets" appears in the opening paragraph as atmospheric descriptor but does not function as a legible timeframe or ticking clock. Time passes (night, moon swings low, the summoner stays until the haven feels ordinary again) but is vague and does not tighten decisions. The phrase recurs thematically (reeds trade rumors, code drifts) but does not constrain tactics or escalate pressure. It is ornamental rather than mechanical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation—to hush a prophecy spoken in code—is stated early, pursued through the summoner's actions (listening, anchoring the wing, turning it), and achieved at closure (the prophecy disperses, the chorus becomes a solo no one can hear). The desire is clear and drives the sequence. However, no internal conflict or competing want appears; the summoner faces no temptation, doubt, or cost that creates friction. The motivation is functional and present across beats but lacks dramatized complication.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" is introduced early (a small coal that warms without smoke) and reprised at closure (a tranquil blaze that cauterizes the code without burning). The tone is coherent—calm, elevated, ritualistic—and modulates subtly as the hush gathers and the haven is restored. However, the tone remains static at one register throughout; no crescendo or breakdown under pressure. The phrase charges the final image but does not constrain choice or create cost, limiting its causal indispensability.</comment>
