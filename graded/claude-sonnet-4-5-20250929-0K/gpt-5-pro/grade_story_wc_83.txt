<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is sharply embodied—"I taste iron in my mouth, and the air thins as if the past is a vacuum pump"—and the wedding-survivor trauma constrains every choice with felt cost. The decision to withhold extraction at the closure ("this pool stays intact, a grave we refused to mine") is earned by the accumulating weight of backstory anchored to present stimuli: the geode, the valley map, the breath count. Internal contradiction operates continuously: the need to function versus the refusal to harvest trauma. Minor slip: Liyun remains underdeveloped, present mainly to enable the narrator's stance rather than applying independent pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a situational accent; the piece builds density through layered imagery (geode, salt flats, interferometer readings) and reaches closure via Resonant Reconfiguration—Earned Stasis when the narrator refuses extraction and locks the coordinates, foreclosing institutional approval with visible professional cost ("the institution will hate us by morning"). Orientation anchors by line 4 (floating observatory, salt flats, survivor status). The causality is light but sufficient under this lens: the hunt sequence structures pressure, the valley discovery triggers memory, and the refusal to harvest is motivated by the geode's symbolic weight and the narrator's need to "leave a wound unharvested." Cost is on the page: professional consequences, defiance of the grant/board, and the crystallized posture in the final lines.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The floating observatory, geode, and salt flats function as both literal setting and charged constraint: the observatory's "tethered by cables and guilt" frames the narrator's suspension, the geode under the interferometer translates "micro shudders into notes even trauma can read," and the desert below serves as palm-line metaphor that refuses interpretation. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"steam hoods shiver," "dragonflies trapped in bottles"—filtered through the narrator's hypervigilant attention. The geode anchors the final choice: placing it on the boundary stabilizes the readout and enables the refusal. The salt flats' passive acceptance in the penultimate line charges the narrator's attempt to learn that acceptance, closing the spatial arc.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: finding where unused potential pools while navigating survivor trauma. One meaningful tightening occurs when the spectral map reveals the crater-rim pool ("right where the convoy dust once hung like a flag"), forcing the narrator to choose between extraction (grant/board/turbines) and refusal (letting ghosts sleep). Agency is renunciation with visible cost: professional defiance, locked coordinates, and the knowledge that "the institution will hate us by morning." The choice is earned by prior pressure—geode placement, breath monitoring, memory intrusion—and forecloses the institutional path. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation reads as density increase and pattern break: the hunt protocol stalls when personal history floods the readout, reweighting the technical mission into moral calculus.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: refusal as mercy, the ethics of harvesting trauma, and motion as trauma's only language. The geode shifts meaning across beats—wedding gift, listening ear, boundary stabilizer—culminating in "a small planet of quartz keeping my tide in check." The final image offers a non-literal answer: "the sky no longer feels like a verdict, only a jury with a thousand blinking eyes, unsure, awake," reweighting the opening's "sky became a verdict" without moralizing. Subtext operates through the charged pool metaphor ("every site of murder is a reservoir") and the refusal note signed with survivor status—both avoid therapeutic label-speak by embedding insight in action. No thematic echo; complexity remains unresolved but embodied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV distance is stable first-person, perceptually filtered through survivor hypervigilance: "I hold the geode crystal to my ear and it becomes a room inside a room." Diction stays consistent—lyric compression ("unused potential pools," "topography of ache and almost") matches the narrator's contemplative remove from raw crisis. Liyun's brief dialogue ("There") and the narrator's muttered "Give it back" feel natural and goal-driven. Purposeful compression ("We hunt not for monsters but for minima") is pattern-taught and legible. Minor slip: occasional elevated register ("perturbation theory," "damping to the edge of instability") risks mismatch, but the technical idiom is anchored to the narrator's role and remains voice-consistent under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully—short beats ("The Hunt begins again") alternate with longer lyric lines ("Those fields feel Intangibly tangible, like heat seen on the road"). Information density is high: most sentences layer image, memory, and present action without redundancy. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent: "dragonflies trapped in bottles," "waterline is my breath right now," "maps fade like phosphors after a kiss." Two frictions: "perturbation theory, we whisper disturbances into the equations" risks technical opacity for non-specialist readers, and the sequence "tilt, gimbals breathe, decks hum" compresses three actions into one breath without clear causal order—both momentarily slow momentum but recover quickly. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. The final lines propel without scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of floating-observatory SF with survivor testimony and abstract field-mapping offers a fresh, non-obvious angle: grief as topography, potential as extractable resource, refusal as data-lock. The geode-as-interferometer-calibration tool is specific and purposeful, not quirky ornament. The emotional arc—using technical work to manage trauma, then refusing to commodify it—feels inevitable in hindsight and resists template "healing journey" arcs. Minor constraint: the core premise (scientist processes trauma through work, makes ethical refusal) echoes familiar ground; transformation is achieved through the unusual setting and the charged pool metaphor, but the underlying arc is not fully novel. Risk-taking in lyric compression and the quiet, defiant ending elevate without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The drone strike wedding survivor frames the opening, seeds every beat (hypervigilance, memory intrusion, the covenant dust line), and drives the climactic refusal to harvest the pool. The status appears in the opening paragraph, motivates the choice of sky-based work ("the only ceiling I trust now"), and charges the final signature ("I sign the note with my name and my status"). Two major beats: the memory flood when the valley appears, and the decision to lock coordinates. The choice to withhold extraction is causally rooted in survivor ethics and foreclosed institutional approval with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The geode crystal appears in four distinct beats: held to the ear (structural metaphor), described as wedding gift and survivor relic, placed under the interferometer to translate shudders, and positioned on the boundary to stabilize the readout and enable the refusal. It returns in the penultimate line as "a small planet of quartz keeping my tide in check," reweighting its function from tool to anchor. The object constrains the final choice—its placement on the boundary allows the damping adjustment—and carries layered cost (wedding memory, fragility, stubborn survival). Specificity is high; no generic crystal would carry this charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Unfiltered awakening" is named once ("Unfiltered awakening arrives not as light but as a draft, cold, total") at the memory-flood beat and again obliquely in the final paragraph ("I feel the unfiltered awakening knit a new scar"). It shapes the stakes by marking the moment when the narrator's past overwhelms the present and forces the ethical choice, but it functions more as thematic claim than on-page constraint. The concept is present in two beats and participates in closure (the scar line reweights the opening question), but does not alter tactics—the refusal stems from survivor ethics, not the awakening itself. Mid-band for lyric reprise without middle causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Intangibly tangible" is applied once to the fields ("Those fields feel Intangibly tangible, like heat seen on the road, wavering yet undeniable once you step through") and echoes in the geode's "caverns glitter like bottled starlight." The attribute describes perceptual texture but does not constrain a choice with visible cost. It enriches the narrator's way of noticing—hypervigilance renders invisible forces palpable—but remains label-level rather than dramatized in action. Present in one beat, poetically apt, but swappable with another paradoxical descriptor without breaking logic. Lyric resonance is moderate; causal pressure is minimal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The hunt structures the entire piece: opens with "The Hunt begins again," proceeds through calibration and noise-seed release, discovers the valley pool, and culminates in the refusal to extract. The hunt is signaled in the opening third, drives two major beats (the spectral map discovery and the damping adjustment), and shapes the closure—the decision to "lock the access" and the promise that "tomorrow we will hunt again" reconfigures the hunt from extraction to preservation. The action is irreplaceable: removing the hunt removes the technical scaffold and the ethical dilemma. Specific cost: professional consequences and the knowledge that future hunts will operate under the new ethic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Perturbation theory is named once ("Through perturbation theory, we whisper disturbances into the equations and see which harmonies refuse to be drowned") and operationalized when the narrator releases "a seed of noise into the field" to generate the spectral map. It appears in the middle third, enables the discovery beat, but does not return at closure or constrain the final choice—the refusal hinges on the narrator's ethics, not the method. The mechanics are present but remain abstract; the theory is mentioned more than used. Functional but replaceable with another signal-processing technique.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The floating observatory anchors the opening line, supplies the technical infrastructure (interferometer, circuit breakers, gimbals, cooling fans), and embodies the narrator's post-trauma refuge ("the only ceiling I trust now"). It appears in every section: opening anchor, hunt protocol, and closing drift. The setting pressures the choice by enabling the discovery and providing the institutional context (grant, board) that the narrator defies. The salt flats below function as counterpoint and final lesson. Specificity is high—the observatory's suspension "tethered by cables and guilt" charges the narrator's ethical suspension—but the setting's causal role is structural rather than tactically decisive at the climax.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"While circuit breakers cool" appears in the opening and again when "the Hunt begins again when the cooling fans steady." The timeframe marks the window for the hunt sequence and provides a rhythm (cooling, hunt, decision, drift), but the clock is loose—no precise urgency tightens tactics. The breakers cool again in the final third, bracketing the action, but the narrator's choice to lock coordinates is not pressured by time running out. The timeframe is present in two beats and structures pacing, but does not alter moves or escalate stakes. Lyric reprise without causal tightening.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The motivation to find where unused potential pools is declared in the opening third ("I am here to find where unused potential pools, and to map the silent topography of might have been"), drives the hunt action, and is fulfilled when Liyun points to the valley. The discovery triggers the climactic conflict: extract the pool or leave it intact. The motivation is friction-laden—"our method is written on a taped index card, a prayer learned by physicists and refugees alike"—and the final choice redefines the goal from extraction to preservation. Cost is visible: professional defiance and the shift from institutional mission to personal ethic. The motivation appears in three beats and shapes closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Bleak exhilaration is named once in the final third ("Bleak exhilaration lifts me, the rush of saving nothing on purpose") and pervades the piece: the opening's "tethered by cables and guilt," the geode's "trapped thunder," the refusal's professional defiance, and the closing image of the jury sky "unsure, awake." The tone modulates from survivor hypervigilance (early beats) to ethical clarity (closure) without losing its bleak-hope register. The tone charges the final image—motion as trauma's language, the observatory adrift, acceptance without expectation. Coherent through turns and essential to the ending's resonance, though the explicit label in the final third is slightly late for full top-band credit.</comment>
