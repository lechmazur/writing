<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interior voice is specific and lyrical, with concrete physical engagement (lifting camera, signing). However, interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The advisor's motivation and decisions remain opaque—she orchestrates but we never see her weigh costs or face internal conflict. The final "keep this" moment feels declarative rather than earned through prior struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of signing → harbor response → crowd involvement that builds through density and cadence. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (the empty photograph "contains the whole harbor breathing"), but cost remains conceptual and diffuse—no specific path is foreclosed on the page. The police captain's sudden shift ("his face softens") lacks causal grounding. Orientation is clear early (harbor, moonlight, narrator with camera).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The luminous harbor, chalk constellations, and vintage camera constrain the performance's staging and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("salt-shined hush," "rope fibers sighing"). The camera's emptiness becomes a recurring constraint that shapes how the narrator "conducts." Spatial choreography across jetties and the police launch remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translate silence into music for the grieving) is signaled early and accumulates through choreographed signing. However, pressure plateaus rather than escalates—the police captain's capitulation removes opposition without cost, and boats simply "slow, then stop" by curiosity alone. No live option is foreclosed; the regatta disruption succeeds without tactical sacrifice or visible tradeoff. One meaningful deepening occurs (the crowd's "joyful sorrow" ripple) but lacks an on-page price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme (remembering as tide, silence as fullness) emerges from the vintage camera's emptiness and the sign-language performance without overt moralizing. The final image—camera placed on table, "a harbor that will remember for me"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer. "Joyful sorrow" operates through concrete gestures (the deckhand signing "home") rather than label-only abstraction. However, "absence teaches presence" edges toward platitude in the advisor's closing speech.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and rhythmically controlled, with lyric compression consistent throughout ("their wrists draw harbors; their palms make moons"). No head-hopping; focalization remains stable on the narrator. However, perceptual signature occasionally slips into elevated diction ("seethe," "fletching arrows of meaning") that feels more authorial than character-bound. The advisor's dialogue carries subtext but her voice converges with the narrator's poetic register under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally and information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. However, figurative language saturates nearly every sentence without taught pattern ("gulls sleep and tides hum their patient arithmetic," "fingers fletching arrows of meaning," "grief thrums too low for common ears"), creating mild overwriting that slows momentum in the middle third. Two paraphrase loops appear: "the harbor begins to answer" restates the prior "tugs the watching city inward" effect, and the advisor's two consecutive metaphors about tides and shores in successive paragraphs. No major artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of sign language, silent disruption, and filmless camera offers a non-obvious angle on performance art and grief. Specificity (chalk constellations, "rope fibers sighing") anchors the lyric mode. However, the core premise (art installation interrupts regatta to honor the forgotten) follows a familiar template of benevolent intervention without moral friction. The transformation test is borderline: plot and emotional arc could transfer to other performance settings with moderate edits. Risk-taking in lyric density is offset by the lack of genuine opposition.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Whispering advisor is present in setup and closure, offering guidance and taking the final photograph. She enables the narrator's plan but makes no on-page choice with visible cost; her role is observational and supportive rather than decision-driven.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Vintage camera with no film appears in four distinct beats: arrival, advisor's tap, conductor gesture, and final placement on table. Its emptiness constrains how the narrator "records" and charges the closure image. However, swappability is moderate—a similar symbolic object (empty notebook, silent instrument) could serve with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sign language shapes the performance's mechanics across multiple beats (narrator and advisor converse, volunteers practice, crowd signs from jetty to jetty, deckhand signs "home"). It directly enables the disruption tactic and appears in the closure reprise ("your hands have become an instrument"). Causal pressure is strong; the story would break without it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Quietly charismatic is mentioned twice ("quietly charismatic figure," "quietly charismatic enough to make a hush seem like a festival drum") but remains label-only. No on-page action demonstrates the trait through visible tradeoff or cost; it does not constrain or enable a key choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Disrupt drives the central action (plan stated, volunteers gathered, performance executed, regatta boats stop). The disruption redefines the harbor's social options and participates in closure (the mapped silence left "like a score for future voyagers"). Removing it would collapse the narrative arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mapping silence is signaled in the plan ("to change the music of the harbor by mapping silence"), executed through chalk constellations that create "quiet pockets where footsteps cancel," and referenced in closure ("we leave the map of silence like a score"). Its mechanics matter to the performance's spatial logic, though the mechanism (how chalk creates silence) remains abstract.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Luminous harbor by moonlight frames the opening, grounds spatial choreography (jetties, mooring stones, police launch), and charges the closure reprise ("the moon remembers"). However, the harbor's specific properties (tides, gulls, oars) do not constrain tactical choices during the performance; it functions more as atmospheric backdrop than pressure-shaping micro-setting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Timeframe "when no one remembers you" is stated thematically in the advisor's line and the closing reflection, but does not tighten on-page decisions or create a live clock. It remains conceptual context rather than a temporal constraint that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Motivation to translate silence into music is dramatized through the plan, volunteer practice, and performance execution. The narrator's prior hospital work ("I translated hospital whispers into touch") primes the desire. Friction appears in the joyful sorrow tone and the difficulty of making "quiet be honored," though no on-page moment shows the narrator weighing competing costs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Joyful sorrow is embodied consistently: the crowd's ripple when the deckhand signs "home," the narrator's tingling fingers and "melody I do not rush to finish," the harbor's "quiet that is not absence but fullness." The tone modulates through the performance's pressure and charges the final image without static flatness.</comment>
