<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The translator's motive is concrete and particular—"to graft new meaning onto old wounds"—and drives the decryption task with genuine stakes. Internal contradiction surfaces in the weighing of truth ("not every truth heals") and the final act of selective translation that balances protection and honesty. Embodied emotion appears in "lotus-hearted ache" and "unknot my scarf to pad the rail," both gestures grounded in physical action. Minor weakness: Sifa remains thinly drawn beyond his symbolic function, and the waiting families are more schematic than individuated, though their convergence at closure is earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure is on-page and legible: the translator's decryption of the cast notes leads to a negotiated solution ("hand him to the auntie at the jetty at sunrise") with visible cost—selective withholding of truths. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: layered notes, coral grooves, family proverbs, and the brain-coral fragment accumulate meaning until the final image reweights the premise of translation as "a graft, and the graft holds because it drinks from both roots." Orientation anchors who (translator), where (hospital atrium), and when (twilight/after anesthetic) clearly. One causal tightening occurs when the translator realizes the notes "map, and they plead," shifting the task from passive observation to active mediation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium with palms and ferns supplies atmosphere and the brain-coral fragment functions as micro-setting, constraining the translator's interpretive method and charging the final exchange with the auntie who "recognizes the shore encoded in its ridges." Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "windows breathe salt," "night-birds test the rafters," "the atrium glows with a strange inland moon." Spatial choreography is clear across moves—from bedside to waiting families to return. The jetty as off-stage anchor directs the resolution and ties the coral fragment's grooves to geography, making setting active rather than decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: securing safe passage for Sifa amid competing family claims. Pressure coheres as the translator decrypts the cast, then carries notes to "people waiting, and they stand as if rocks might start walking," escalating to negotiation. One meaningful tightening occurs when both families "hear their own mother in the slant" of the proverb, shifting from accusation to shared terms. Agency is decision with visible cost: the translator withholds certain truths ("not every truth heals") and proposes the jetty handoff with witnesses, a compromise that forecloses other paths. The resolution is earned by the translator's choices under the inferred Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image and event: translation as grafting, shared anxieties as common ground, innocence as coded plea. The brain-coral fragment recurs with escalating meaning—pocket talisman, decryption key, shared recognition token—each return reweighting its role. The ending offers a non-literal answer: "translation is not a bridge but a graft, and the graft holds because it drinks from both roots," which synthesizes prior particulars (bent proverb, coral grooves, unknotted scarf) without moral statement. Subtext operates in the families' convergence around the proverb and the auntie's reverent hover over the coral. No thematic echo or prompt-language intrusion mars the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single third-person-limited POV with stable psychic distance; the translator's perceptual signature is consistent (conflict-zone professional, attuned to "tremors of borders and to lullabies") and filters all detail through mediation instincts. Diction is elevated and lyric but remains coherent: "lotus-hearted ache," "shrewdly innocent," "tide-pool" breathing, "unknot" as both literal and metaphoric act. Purposeful compression and patterned repetition ("I translate," "I unknot," "I carry") anchor beats without template cadence. No head-hopping; the families' interiority is inferred through gesture and speech, not accessed. Minor slip: "shrewdly innocent" and "lotus-hearted" border on ornamental when first introduced, though both are later dramatized in action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences do more than one job (e.g., "One side calls him kin and the other calls him proof" compresses conflict and stakes). Rhythm varies purposefully, especially in the decryption sequence where short clauses accumulate pressure. No paraphrase loops or template cadence across the full text. Weakness: "shrewdly innocent" recurs as both attribute and phrase three times without evolving meaning between uses, trending toward synonym churn. "Lotus-hearted ache" appears twice, once as label and once as action ("let the lotus-hearted ache open and gentle"), the second use rescuing the first. Figurative density is high in the opening third but thins under pressure, allowing clarity at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of conflict mediation, palimpsest decryption, and the brain-coral fragment as both mnemonic device and kinship token feels specific and non-obvious. The premise—child's cast as coded plea—transforms a familiar trope (hidden message) through particular detail (lunar fish list, bent proverb spine, canoe-date drawing). The translator's selective withholding and final metaphor ("graft…drinks from both roots") avoid neat resolution while delivering emotional truth. Risk: lyric compression and patterned parallelism heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor proximity concern: "unknot" as both literal and thematic gesture echoes common writing-prompt language, though the execution through scarf-padding and note-decryption grounds it in scene.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The translator drives all key turns: decrypts the cast, selects which truths to carry, proposes the jetty handoff, and mediates the family argument to consensus. Present by the opening line, shapes middle decryption beats, and articulates the final graft metaphor. Cost is visible: withholding truths and the emotional labor of mediation. Causal pressure is strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The brain-coral fragment appears in five distinct beats: pocket talisman, grooves traced during decryption, shown to seal the agreement, recognized by the auntie, and held beneath ferns at closure. Each use reweights its meaning—from personal anchor to interpretive key to kinship proof. The final image ("hand around coral") charges the ending. Strong irreplaceability: its labyrinthine grooves mirror both the cast's code and the shore's map.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Shared anxieties" frames the conflict ("each with reasons sharpened by shared anxieties") and reappears when families "start to list what they fear most, and at last there is room for shared anxieties without the sharpness of blame." This shift enables the negotiated resolution. The concept is dramatized through the families' convergence around the proverb and their recognition of mutual vulnerability. Present in setup and directly shapes closure tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Shrewdly innocent" labels Sifa early, recurs as "their choice of innocence is shrewdly innocent, a disguise that begs decoding," and is dramatized when the translator realizes the cast notes are coded plea rather than child's play. The trait constrains the translator's approach (must decode rather than read literally) and charges the final whisper ("his plan worked"). Moderate cost: the translator bears the interpretive burden. Swappability concern: "clever disguise" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Unknot" drives three beats: unknotting the scarf to pad the rail (literal), unknotting the cast's meanings (metaphoric decryption), and the closing vow ("unknot what I can without tearing"). The action is irreplaceable: it ties care, interpretation, and mediation into one gesture. Present in setup and shapes the final stance with visible cost (the translator accepts the burden of selective truth). Strong causal linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Decryption anchors the middle third: the translator identifies the bent proverb spine, lunar fish list, canoe-date, and coral-grooved patterns, each step narrowing interpretive options. The method is signaled ("I begin by decrypting") and its mechanics matter (ink run into plaster veins, smudged vowels, reordering by lunar cycle). The discovery that notes "map, and they plead" is the story's hinge. Without this exact method, the negotiated resolution would lack foundation. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The atrium supplies atmosphere ("mist-clad," "palms blew like metronomes," "ferns," "windows breathe salt") and anchors all action. The setting does not constrain choices but charges the mood and the final image ("the atrium glows with a strange inland moon"). Micro-setting (Sifa's body, the cast as artifact) does more causal work. The jetty is named as future destination but remains off-stage. Functional across beats but not essential to tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe ("after the anesthetic kicks in") is signaled and creates a window of solitude for decryption. It does not tighten decisions visibly—the translator works without a live clock—but it motivates the structure (Sifa asleep, translator alone with the cast). Present in setup, shapes the middle sequence, and the resolution occurs within the same evening. Functional but easily replaceable with "while he sleeps" or similar framing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation to "graft new meaning onto old wounds" is stated early and dramatized through the decryption task and selective translation. Friction surfaces when the translator weighs "not every truth heals" against the families' need for clarity. The final metaphor ("translation…is a graft, and the graft holds because it drinks from both roots") closes the desire with visible cost: the translator accepts ongoing labor ("more words to carry, more knots"). Strong thematic integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Lotus-hearted ache" names the tone early and recurs at closure ("let the lotus-hearted ache open and gentle"), modulating from tension to earned tenderness. The tone coheres through the piece—reverent, careful, compassionate—and charges the final image when Sifa's mouth lifts and the atrium glows. Moderate cost: the ache is a persistent emotional state the translator chooses to carry. Swappability concern: the phrase borders on ornamental lyricism, though the closing reprise rescues it with action.</comment>
