<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The carpenter's interiority remains consistent—patient, interpretive, driven by the promise to "interpret silence as possibility"—and his embodied micro-choices (reaching without ripples, tightening screws, breathing a note) accumulate toward the ending. However, motivation is delivered primarily through reflective summary ("He had promised himself...," "He remembered the last rider...") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene, and the final choice (singing the carousel awake) lacks visible cost or foreclosed path; the carousel responds obligingly. The lack of on-page stakes friction or renunciation caps Q1 below 6.0.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece teaches an accumulative/textural lens by ~25%: the carpenter moves through the train, gathers the halo fragment, installs it, and sings the carousel into motion—a coherent arc of restoration. Orientation (who, where, when) lands by the second paragraph. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the carousel beginning to move is a reweighted state), but the cost is invisible; the final image ("the horses felt the idea of movement pass through their legs") is evocative yet offers no legible price paid or option foreclosed. The lack of on-page felt cost at closure prevents entry into high bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The abandoned circus train is vividly realized through specific anchors—lion cage, cookhouse car, tent car with moths, calliope swallowing sand, carousel horses "hung like stilled constellations"—and the hidden oasis supplies the halo fragment that drives the climax. Spatial choreography is clean, and sensory detail (misting hush, wind bells, crabgrass chimneys) is filtered through the carpenter's attentive perspective. The environment constrains the search and charges the final image, satisfying the Q3 9+ quick test and earning high-band eligibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring the carousel—is signaled early and coheres throughout. However, escalation is mild: the carpenter hunts, finds, installs, and sings without meaningful opposition, narrowing of options, or visible trade-off. The wrong turn that leads to the oasis is serendipitous rather than earned by protagonist agency, and the ending action (breathing a note) succeeds immediately without a prior failure or cost. Under the accumulative lens, one meaningful tightening or deepening is required; here the arc is smooth accretion without a pressure point that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—restoration as patient listening, silence as possibility, objects remembering through human attention—emerges organically from the carpenter's actions and the charged objects (halo fragment, wind bells, carousel). The final image (the horses feeling movement) offers a resonant answer to the central question without stating a moral. However, the piece flirts with thesis articulation ("possibility had begun to show its work, not as a miracle but as carpentry") and the tightrope singer's lesson ("wood, too, learns how to sing by being listened to") reads as thematic echo. These moments do not fully collapse into sermonizing but reduce ambiguity and cap the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third limited, closely aligned with the carpenter's perceptual signature: he "listened to the rails," "traced chalk notes," "held it up to the bells." Diction is lyric and controlled ("luminous piece," "reliquaries," "answer trembled through it"), with consistent register. However, figurative density is high across most sentences without clear pattern-teaching, and several constructions drift toward elevated narration that occasionally distances from the carpenter's embodied experience ("a plan more patient than longing," "showed its work, not as a miracle but as carpentry"). The voice is distinctive but overwritten in places, preventing entry into high bands.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Rhythm is purposefully lyric, with recurring motifs ("misting hush," "inside the chime of wind bells") that build texture. However, figurative language saturates the prose without respite—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated descriptor—creating density that slows momentum rather than accelerating it. Template cadence is evident in repeated structures ("He [verb]," "The [noun] [verb]"), and several paraphrase loops appear (e.g., the misting hush is described three times across paragraphs without new information). Patterned-artifact penalty pack (−0.6 for template cadence and paraphrase loops) and overwriting friction (−0.4 for figurative density without pattern payoff) apply, totaling −1.0 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The premise—a carousel carpenter restoring an abandoned circus train through patient attention—offers a fresh angle on restoration narratives, and the specific details (wind bells, halo fragment, tightrope singer who lost her voice) particularize the world. The wrong-turn-to-oasis beat and the singing-as-activation final turn feel organic to the established logic. However, the emotional arc (solitary craftsman finds fulfillment through quiet work) is familiar, and the ending avoids bold risk by delivering satisfaction without meaningful ambiguity or cost. The piece transforms its tropes through vivid texture but does not synthesize them into a non-obvious synthesis that redefines stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The silent carousel carpenter is present throughout, and his actions (opening the tent car, squeezing into thornbrush, fitting the halo fragment, singing the note) create the story's arc. He appears in the opening, middle search, and ending activation—satisfying all three gates (setup, development, payoff). However, his choices do not narrow options or face visible cost; each move succeeds without friction. The "quietly persistent" attribute is demonstrated through repeated attempts, but no single decision alters tactics or stakes under pressure. Two-gate satisfaction with mild causal pressure places the score in the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The halo fragment is discovered in the hidden oasis (middle beat), installed in the carousel crown (penultimate beat), and answers with "a whispering gleam" at the ending, satisfying all three gates. It is handled on the page ("reached without ripples, lifted"), and its installation enables the carousel's awakening. However, the fragment does not constrain prior choices or force trade-offs; it is simply found and used. The object shapes two distinct beats and participates in closure, earning eligibility above 6.0, but lacks the irreplaceability or causal pressure (no cost tied to its use) required for ≥7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "misting hush" recurs as atmospheric texture ("A misting hush drifted," "a misting hush so tender," "inside the chime of wind bells, the morning narrowed") but does not constrain choices or alter tactics. It is present throughout (setup) and returns in the ending paragraph (payoff), satisfying two gates, but does not shape a middle decision (missing development gate). The concept reads as tone and motif rather than stake-shaping force. Two-gate fulfillment with ornamental use caps the score at ~4.6; lyric reprise lifts it slightly within that band to 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Quietly persistent" is demonstrated through the carpenter's repeated returns ("he had returned each dawn") and methodical actions (easing open the tent car, tracing chalk notes, tightening screws). The trait is present early (setup) and shapes his middle search (development) and final sustained effort (payoff), satisfying all three gates. However, it does not impose visible cost or force a trade-off; persistence succeeds without friction. The attribute enables action but lacks the specificity or consequence required to reach ≥7.0, placing it in the upper-5s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The carpenter's act of singing ("he stood by the crown and let a breath curl into a note") is the pivot that awakens the carousel in the final beat. The action is prepared by the tightrope singer's teaching ("a throat can do more than speak, that wood, too, learns how to sing"), appears at closure, and redefines the restoration from mechanical repair to embodied activation. However, it is introduced late (final third) as resolution rather than attempted earlier with friction. Late-arrival penalty (−0.3) applies, but strong closure linkage and causal necessity elevate the score into the 7-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The wrong turn into thornbrush leads directly to the hidden oasis where the halo fragment is found—a clear middle-beat payoff. The method is signaled in the setup ("Following a smear shaped like an arrow, he took a wrong turn") and delivers the key object that enables closure. However, the mechanics are passive (serendipity) rather than protagonist-driven, and the method does not constrain earlier attempts or shape multiple beats. Two-gate satisfaction (setup, development via discovery) with mild causal work places the score in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned circus train supplies the spatial structure (cars, cages, carousel platform), the hidden oasis yields the halo fragment, and the setting's relics (wind bells, calliope, rails) are integrated into the carpenter's search and final activation. The setting is present early (setup), constrains the middle search (development through spatial exploration), and the carousel car is the locus of closure (payoff). Specific details (lion cage, tent car with moths, carousel horses "hung like stilled constellations") are handled and reweighted. All three gates satisfied with causal pressure and closure linkage earn high-band eligibility.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The phrase "inside the chime of wind bells" recurs as atmospheric frame (opening, middle, and ending paragraphs) but does not function as a ticking clock or constraint. Time is loose ("each dawn," "morning"), and the carpenter's actions unfold without urgency or deadline. The timeframe is present (setup and payoff via reprise) but missing clear development pressure (no middle tightening tied to time). Two-gate satisfaction with ornamental use and no visible cost caps the score below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"To interpret silence as possibility" is articulated early ("He had promised himself not to hunt noise, but to interpret silence as possibility") and demonstrated through the carpenter's listening to rails, tracing chalk notes, and breathing a note into the carousel. The motivation shapes his method (patient attention) and is dramatized in the ending beat (singing rather than forcing). Setup, development (listening guides the search), and payoff (the note activates the carousel) are all satisfied. However, the desire is more explained than conflicted; no on-page friction tests the promise. Three-gate fulfillment with mild dramatization places the score in the low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The tone—"whispering gleam"—is established through lyric diction, soft consonants, and recurrent images (misting hush, wind bells, luminous fragments). The tone is coherent throughout and modulates slightly as the carpenter moves from search to discovery to activation, culminating in the carousel's gentle awakening. However, the tone is static (consistently hushed and reverent) rather than shifting with pressure; no sharp turn or charged final image reweights it. Setup and payoff are clear, but development (middle modulation under pressure) is weak. Two-gate satisfaction with mild modulation places the score in the mid-5s.</comment>
