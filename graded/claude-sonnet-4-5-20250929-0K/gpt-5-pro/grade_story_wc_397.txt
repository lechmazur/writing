<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's internal conflict between seeking ending and discovering solace is concrete and embodied, particularly through the parasol tip as "tuning fork" and hands preferring "ropes to pens." Micro-choices accumulate meaningfully: postponing the appointment "not as surrender but as a seamstress's pause." The piece occasionally edges toward poetic abstraction ("vocabulary of loss, the consonants of collapse"), but the protagonist's renunciation at closure—choosing to trawl again tomorrow—forecloses the scheduled death with visible cost (remaining a tourist, living in suspension). The change is earned through the disaster work teaching her "the notes."</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure operates as Earned Stasis with Charged Poise: the narrator postpones again, choosing continued trawling over the clinic, a refusal that forecloses the initial path with felt cost ("I am still a euthanasia tourist"). Orientation anchors early (drift-ice marina, post-storm, waiting period). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through災害 work discoveries (crate of tapes, photograph, ice crack saving the boy) until the cadence shifts in the final paragraph to reweight "learning the sound of approaching endings" from death-seeking to life-sustaining vigilance. One meaningful deepening is clear when the boy-rescue moment teaches her that "endings travel with us like luggage." Cost is legible: she remains in liminal suspension, her "loose grip" now stabilized by disaster work rather than resolved.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is sensuously rendered and constrains action: "ice drifted between hulls," "whole place hummed like a throat clearing," the crack that "leapt with a violin's mercy" directly enables the boy-rescue beat. Tools (magnets, ropes, skiff, parasol tip) are handled across beats and charge the final image. The setting is filtered through the narrator's tuned attention to "frequencies" and "hollow places." Minor slip: "mouth of the breakwater" and specific dock choreography occasionally blur, but the marina's pressure on choice (trawling daily, listening to pilings) is consistent and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: learning the grammar of endings to resolve her "changed" state and mistrust of mirrors. Pressure tightens through disaster work discoveries, culminating in the ice-crack rescue where "an ending arriving and not arriving" crystallizes her understanding. The postponement decision forecloses the clinic path with visible cost (continued tourist status, living in "a fold in patience"). One friction: the boy's near-fall feels slightly convenient, though it does teach the lesson that endings can be averted. Agency is consistent—her repeated choice to trawl and postpone—and the final stance (tomorrow she'll trawl again) reconfigures the initial death-seeking into vigilant apprenticeship.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—approaching endings as something to learn rather than enact—emerges organically from the trawling work and Mikko's teaching without statement. The parasol tip, initially a "metronome of waiting," becomes a "tuning fork," then a tool to "coax" the photograph, charging the motif across the arc. The final image answers the premise implicitly: postponing is not retreat but "a seamstress's pause," another fold that holds without tearing. "Windborne solace" teaching her "the notes" reweights the euthanasia frame into apprenticeship. No moralizing; the piece trusts image and accumulation to carry meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, compressed, and perceptually distinct: "wind testing each rib of the docks like a breath practicing how to stay," "confetti" splinters, "talky boards." Psychic distance remains stable in first-person reflection anchored to present sensory cues. Mikko's brief dialogue ("Endings announce themselves like weather") contrasts the narrator's interior cadence without leaking register. One tension: the density of figurative language is high throughout, yet it remains legible and voice-consistent, reading as the narrator's way of processing rather than ornament. No head-hopping; focalization is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is purposeful but occasionally stacks without rest: "consonants of collapse and the vowels of hush," "future reverse in the squeal of wet reels," "feathery quiet that kept arriving like snow." Most images clarify rather than obscure, and the piece teaches its lyric pattern early. Minor loop: "a fold in patience" recurs three times with slight variation; the repetition charges the motif but edges toward churn. Information density is high; no scaffold. Syntax varies, and the final line propels without summarizing. The overwriting remains voice-motivated and does not flatten the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The euthanasia-tourist frame combined with disaster-relief trawling is a fresh synthesis; the specific choice to "learn the sound of approaching endings" rather than enact one transforms the premise. The drift-ice marina and post-storm setting are particular, not generic. The parasol tip as tuning fork and the boy-rescue turning point feel earned in hindsight. One modest friction: the "waking up changed" inciting detail remains abstract, though it serves the mystery. The piece commits fully to its lyric-accumulative mode and follows through without retreat, risking density for coherence and succeeding.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The euthanasia tourist framing is signaled immediately ("reservation stamped in a clean envelope"), drives the waiting-period structure, and recurs in the ending ("I am still a euthanasia tourist"). The protagonist's repeated choice to postpone the appointment creates the central turn and forecloses the death path with visible cost. Present across setup, middle (postponement decisions), and closure (final postponement + commitment to trawl tomorrow). The character's status as tourist—liminal, suspended—charges the final image and shapes all tactics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The heirloom lace parasol tip appears early ("ticked against my chest like a metronome"), is reweighted by Mikko ("tuning fork"), and is used on-page to coax the photograph from the ice. Three beats with evolving meaning. However, it does not constrain a key choice or directly shape the closure image; the narrator could complete the same arc without it. The object enriches texture and carries thematic charge (waiting, tuning) but remains more resonant than indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"A fold in patience" is seeded early ("days felt like a fold in patience, creating a crease I could live in"), recurs at the postponement decision ("as if creasing could make a shelter"), and anchors the final stance ("another fold in patience"). The concept shapes the narrator's tactic of serial postponement and charges the ending: choosing to fold again rather than tear the sheet. The metaphor constrains her approach—she does not flee or commit, but folds—and the closure image depends on it. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Grips reality loosely" is introduced early ("Something in me grips reality loosely, like a mittened hand on a rail") and explains her mistrust of mirrors and need to "listen instead." The trait motivates her turn to sensory apprenticeship (learning by sound, not sight). However, it does not visibly constrain a later choice or return with reweighted cost; after setup, it fades into general uncertainty rather than enabling a specific tradeoff. Functional but underdeveloped past the first third.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Trawling structures the entire middle: "trawl the drift-ice marina each morning," recovering the crate of tapes, the photograph, and enabling the boy-rescue beat where the narrator learns that endings can arrive and not arrive. The action is repeated across multiple beats, each discovery teaching a new note. The closure commits to trawling again tomorrow, making the action indispensable to both escalation and final stance. Swapping "trawl" for a generic "search" would break the maritime specificity and the metaphor of patient recovery that charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Disaster relief volunteering is seeded early ("signed up through disaster relief volunteering"), motivates the trawling work, and recurs in the final line ("through disaster relief volunteering that steadies my loose grip"). The method provides the structure and community (Mikko, pairs walking "talky boards") that enable the narrator's shift from death-seeking to life-sustaining vigilance. It shapes her daily attempts and charges the ending by grounding the new stance in ongoing collective work. Present across all three gates with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is anchored immediately and pressures choices throughout: ice nudging cleats, floes pressing piers, the breakwater mouth where the crate surfaces, pilings that "whisper their grainy aches," the ice crack that saves the boy. The setting supplies the tools (ropes, magnets, skiff) and the sensory grammar (wind harmonies, harbor bells) that the narrator learns. The marina is irreplaceable; the story's logic and final image depend on this exact environment. Strong setup, development, and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After waking up changed" is mentioned once in the opening and once when the narrator tells Mikko ("after waking up changed I could not trust my mirrors"). It frames the inciting condition but does not tighten decisions or track as a live clock. The timeframe is more about the waiting period (referenced) than the moment of waking. The change itself remains abstract and does not shape tactics on the page. Present in setup but not developed or paid off at closure; functional but replaceable with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"To learn the sound of approaching endings" is stated early as the "stranger" reason for coming, dramatized through the trawling work (listening to wind harmonies, pilings, the ice crack's "violin's mercy"), and directly charged in the ending ("windborne solace was finally teaching me the notes" / "learning the sound of approaching endings with the others"). The motivation is tested: she must choose between enacting an ending (the clinic) and continuing to learn endings (trawling). The desire forecloses the death path with visible cost. Indispensable across setup, escalation, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Windborne solace" is introduced early ("gulls stitched windborne solace through their cries"), recurs subtly in sensory texture (the "softness" of morning, "feathery quiet"), and anchors the penultimate sentence ("the windborne solace was finally teaching me the notes"). The tone modulates from waiting to active learning without breaking coherence. It charges the final image by naming the quality the narrator has found. However, the tone phrase itself appears only twice explicitly; its presence is more pervasive in mood than in recurring motif. Strong closure linkage elevates it into the 7+ band.</comment>
