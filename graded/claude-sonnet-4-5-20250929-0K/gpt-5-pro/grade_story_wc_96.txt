<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The vagrant penny poet's "molts personalities monthly" trait appears as a label without constraining an on-page choice with visible cost; the narrator shifts from "ledger" to "firelight" but this change doesn't alter tactics or force a tradeoff. Mara's prison backstory and her handling of the bars ("remembers her cell, and does not speak") embodies her past through gesture, but the friendship's formation is told rather than shown pressuring present choices. Interiority is concrete and metaphor-rich ("My skull molts personalities monthly"), yet the poet's interior contradictions don't compel a difficult choice under pressure—the rebuilding proceeds steadily without internal friction forcing a costly decision.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through braided tasks (rebar with ivy, seeds between brick and book) and the final image ("our rebuilt rumor finally names itself library") reweights the opening premise with conceptual cost (trespassers → keepers). Orientation anchors who, where, and when by the first 120 words. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the library's restoration forecloses the vagrant/trespasser path, and the sign "Enter Quietly, Leave Carrying More Than You Brought" crystallizes the new stance with undeniable social cost (defying developers, inviting community scrutiny). One meaningful deepening occurs when the neighbor and others join, shifting the work from two outlaws to a collective claim.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The rusted library setting constrains choices: Mara pries bars, they braid rebar with ivy, stack crates into steps—each detail alters tactics on the page. The coffee tin, bolts, twine, and nails are handled tools that shape the work. Micro-setting (the collapsed window, the threshold, the yard) directs action rather than serving as backdrop. The moon's progression ("as the moon clears the skyline" → "under the luminous fracture of dawn") tracks time and charges the final image, though spatial choreography occasionally blurs when multiple small objects (screws, plank, tarps) appear in quick succession without clear positional anchors.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—forge beauty from anarchy by rebuilding the condemned library—is signaled early and tightens when the patrol car prowls past and the protagonists choose not to stop, foreclosing the compliant path. A second tightening occurs when the neighbor and others join, raising the social cost and widening the gate, which narrows options for retreat. The final sign and the child's question crystallize the new stance with visible community exposure. No antagonist appears on the page to apply direct opposition, and the escalation reads as accumulative deepening rather than reversals, fitting the inferred Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the coffee tin's false bottom holding letters, seeds, and a map concretizes "blooming resistance"; the line "a library cannot be killed if its sentences keep walking the sidewalks" integrates metaphor with the rebuilding action. The final image—"our rebuilt rumor finally names itself library"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. However, "we came here to forge beauty from anarchy" and "blooming resistance" appear as direct thematic declarations rather than arising solely through image and choice. The piece resists tidy resolution: the city "will notice, will argue, will threaten," acknowledging ongoing cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>First-person singular POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature ("I am the vagrant penny poet," "whispering meter to calm my ribs"). Diction is lyric and compressed ("a shipwreck of pages and iron," "green cursive up the scars"), and the experimental compression is taught early and sustained. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("translators of ruin," "blooming resistance") that feels more prompt-echo than the narrator's lived idiom under physical labor. Mara's brief dialogue ("catalog number") and the child's question are naturalistic, but voice distinction between narrator and Mara converges in the reflective passages where both characters' interior textures sound similar.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative density is high ("coffee tin with secret false bottom," "vines will scribe green cursive"), but several beats recycle template cadences: "We braid… we tuck… we stack… we read… we open… we buy… we post." This stem repetition across seven sentences in the final third creates a paraphrase loop that dulls propulsion (−0.6). Mixed metaphor appears in "a shipwreck of pages and iron" (shipwrecks don't typically involve iron in that fusion), and "the sky is a listening room" strains coherence (−0.3). The final line "our rebuilt rumor finally names itself library" is strong, but the accumulated pattern artifacts and filter-verb stacks ("We move… Mara carries… I carry") in high-pressure beats lower the grade.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of vagrant poet, prison library friendship, and guerrilla restoration is specific and non-obvious. The coffee tin's false bottom (coins above, archive below) and the tactic of planting seeds between brick and book are fresh, grounded choices. However, the framing—outlaw artists reclaiming a condemned space against developers—echoes widely used templates, and key images ("blooming resistance," "translators of ruin") read as thematic declarations rather than discoveries. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows implications (patrol car, neighbor joining, child entering), but the emotional arc (solidarity → collective opening) proceeds without surprise or friction that would elevate ingenuity into the high 8s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The vagrant penny poet is present throughout, unspoils twine, whispers meter, lifts seeds from the tin, pours screws, and points to the coffee tin when the child asks who built this. These are distinct on-page actions across multiple beats. The poet's choices (not stopping when the patrol passes, opening the tin at dawn) contribute to escalation and closure. However, the decisions feel collaborative rather than individually decisive—Mara pries bars, the neighbor brings tea, others drag plywood—so the poet's agency doesn't create a key solitary turn. The final gesture (pointing to the tin, then to the poem inside) shapes the ending image but reads as a lyric reprise rather than a choice that narrows options with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The coffee tin with secret false bottom appears in four distinct beats: introduced early as "treasury and archive" with coins above and letters/seeds/map below; opened mid-story to lift the forbidden seeds; opened again at dawn when the fortune is passed around and used to buy nails; and recalled at the end when the poet points to it and reveals the first poem inside. Each use is dramatized on the page and the object's dual nature (visible currency / hidden resistance) directly enables the rebuilding tactics. The tin's reappearance in the final beat reweights its earlier function, charging the closure image. It would be difficult to replace this exact object without altering story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The phrase "blooming resistance" is introduced explicitly by line 8 ("we came here to forge beauty from anarchy"), restated near the midpoint ("We tuck them between brick and book, and call the work our blooming resistance"), and echoed in the penultimate line ("this place will grow a blooming resistance until even the bricks sing"). The concept shapes tactics on the page: planting seeds between brick and book, braiding rebar with ivy so "vines will scribe green cursive up the scars." However, the phrase itself functions more as thematic label than a constraint that narrows options—removing the exact words would not break the rebuilding action, though it would reduce the lyric charge at closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The attribute "molts personalities monthly" is introduced early ("My skull molts personalities monthly, and each new skin learns another way to listen") and revisited near the end ("Last month I was a ledger, cold columns and neat sums; tonight I am firelight"). Mara's trust in "whichever version shows up" is noted, but the trait never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. The poet does not face a choice where one personality would succeed and another fail, nor does the molting impose a tradeoff during the rebuilding. The element reads as characterization label rather than a functional constraint on tactics or closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The action "rebuild" drives the entire narrative arc: Mara pries bars, they braid rebar with ivy, hammer a plank, pour screws, stack crates, sew tarps, and the neighbor helps with a ladder while another drags plywood. Every major turn traces to this action—the patrol car tests their resolve to continue rebuilding, the neighbor's joining expands the work, the final sign and child's entrance demonstrate the rebuilt space now functioning. Removing "rebuild" would collapse the plot; no other action could substitute without fundamentally rewriting the story. The rebuilding is both the method and the closure: the library "finally names itself" through the completed work.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The method "a friendship sparked sorting books at a prison library" is introduced at line 7, restated at line 30 ("It was a friendship sparked sorting books at a prison library, and it kept time"), and recalled when Mara remembers her cell while prying bars. The friendship's origin matters: Mara sorted spines by color to outwit rules, the poet read aloud to bunk beds, and both learned "a music with no warden." However, the prison library skills (sorting, reading aloud) do not directly shape the rebuilding tactics on the page—Mara uses bolts, the poet uses twine, but these tools aren't shown as prison-learned techniques. The friendship itself motivates the collaboration, but the exact method of its formation is more backstory anchor than active constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The rusted library under stars is the sole setting and pressures every choice: the collapsed window must be pried, the chewed roof requires tarps, the gnawed floor demands crates-as-steps, the condemned threshold needs a hammered plank. The setting supplies resources (drifted ivy, nails in the yard) and constraints (bars, torn ladder, spatial limits). The moon's arc ("as the moon clears the skyline" at opening, "under the luminous fracture of dawn" at closure) tracks time and charges the final image. The library's physical state determines tactics throughout, and its transformation from condemned space to functioning community hub is the closure itself. Swapping to a different ruin would require rewriting most actions.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "as the moon clears the skyline" is introduced in the opening line, restated in the poem inside the coffee tin ("I will meet you here as the moon clears the skyline, always"), and tracked through "We move by the timetable of the moon, not the sirens, not the trains" and "All night we read the city by touch." The arc concludes "under the luminous fracture of dawn" when they buy nails. This progression from moon-rise to dawn gives the work a nocturnal urgency and shapes the timing (working while the city sleeps, finishing before full daylight exposure). However, the clock never tightens a specific choice—no deadline forces a tradeoff or alters tactics under time pressure. The timeframe is present and thematically resonant but not mechanically decisive.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to forge beauty from anarchy" is stated explicitly by Mara at line 8 and drives the rebuilding: they plant seeds, braid rebar with ivy, post the sign, and open the space to the community. The desire is tested when the patrol car prowls past and they choose not to stop, demonstrating commitment with social risk. However, the motivation is more declared than dramatized through conflicting wants—there's no on-page friction between the poet's wish to forge beauty and a competing desire (safety, recognition, solitude). The cost (trespassing, exposure to developers) is present but the motivation itself never splinters into contradictory impulses that force a hard choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tone "luminous fracture" is introduced at line 5 ("the windows hold a luminous fracture of reflected stars and broken stacks") and sustained through imagery that fuses light and ruin: "moon clears the skyline," "shipwreck of pages," "green cursive up the scars," "luminous fracture of dawn." The tone modulates with pressure—lyric during setup, taut when the patrol passes ("its lights grinning behind us"), collective when others join, and resonant at closure ("our rebuilt rumor finally names itself library"). The fracture motif (broken but light-filled) charges the final image by holding beauty and damage together. However, the tone occasionally slips into abstract declaration ("translators of ruin") that feels more thematic than sensory, preventing a higher score.</comment>
