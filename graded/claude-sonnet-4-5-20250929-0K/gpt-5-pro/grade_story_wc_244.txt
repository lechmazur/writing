<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation ("to find the cure for loneliness without calling it medicine") is concrete and drives choices—trading attention for stories, designing rumor systems. The desperately jocular affect appears in dialogue tags and beat color but remains decorative; it never constrains a choice. Internal contradiction surfaces in "felt seen only by their needs, which was close enough to love that she did not correct the difference," yet this recognition does not force a visible trade-off or forfeiture. Secondary characters (surveyor, mechanic, mother) apply fleeting pressure but serve demonstration over escalation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—rumor density builds, reciprocity chains multiply, the moon rock becomes a collective polite excuse. Orientation anchors who/where by ~80 words ("disused railway station overgrown with ivy"). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration: "crisis has become community without anyone asking permission" reweights the opening isolation with textural deepening, and Mara's placement of the fragment on the platform finalizes the shift from personal cure to shared mechanism. Cost is oblique—she "felt seen only by their needs," implying emotional substitution—but the ledger's bulge and the surveyor's chess partner signal communal transformation on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The station's ivy-overgrown ticket counter, platform, and corrugated surveyor shack anchor spatial moves. The moon rock's placement "where the ivy could test its patience" charges the final image with the setting's slow green breath, meeting the 9+ gate criterion. Sensory selection prioritizes touch ("pressed against her palm"), texture ("striated and stubborn"), and the visual constellation of fingerprints. Spatial choreography (Mara's trip into the hills, return to the counter, walk to the platform) remains legible and the setting constrains the surveyor's isolation and the camp's circulation around the counter.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: moving help to break isolation; signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara places the rock and tells a rumor "that had not yet been true," transforming individual loneliness into collective solace—the queue and market of sorrows. Agency is attention-as-action: she listens, trades, and architects rumor chains. Escalation under Accumulative lens: the fragment catalyzes a visible market (bread for sorrows, mended zippers for memories), and the ledger "bulged with trades." Cost is understated—Mara's loneliness "still prowled, but now it had fewer places to hide"—visible but not visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—reciprocity as the architecture of community—emerges from particulars: flour unloading earns a clinic ride, stories trade for supplies, the rock becomes a polite excuse for mutual recognition. The final sentence "she could rest sometimes" reweights the opening quest without moralizing. The moon rock's transformation from "company" (surveyor) to collective ritual enacts Conceptual Repricing of loneliness as a teamwork problem. Subtext operates in "polite anarchy," where rhythm replaces hierarchy. The only slip: "This is the moment when the story changes" borders on meta-commentary but stays anchored in the ledger as diegetic record.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds Mara's perceptual bias (rumors "like birds," logistics as attention, the rock "adjusting its coat"). Diction is lyric-patterned and idiom-consistent ("anarchy remembering its manners," "wishes fulfilled and wishes pending"). Psychic distance narrows at peak beats (the surveyor meeting, the counter announcement) and widens for camp panoramas purposefully. However, elevated register ("striated," "catalyze," "polite anarchy") occasionally drifts above the folk-logistician frame, and several figurative vehicles ("rumors roosted," "corridors from crates") stack without breathing room in the middle third, slightly reducing clarity under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines layer character, atmosphere, and reciprocity mechanics. Rhythm modulates well (the surveyor exchange slows; the queue sequence accelerates). Minor template cadence appears in "She smiled…She believed…She would show up" (repeated "She [verb]" openings across four lines mid-text) and light synonym churn ("asked for stories," "swapped a promise," "traded batteries") within adjacent beats, triggering a −0.4 deduction for pattern artifacts. The final image ("ribbons to mark wishes fulfilled and wishes pending") propels cleanly. Overwriting check: metaphor density is sustained but mostly coherent; "whisper adjusting its coat" and "fog above the yard" function without mixed vehicles.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of disaster logistics, rumor networks, and moon-rock-as-ritual excuse is specific and non-obvious. "Polite anarchy" and reciprocity hammock offer fresh angles on mutual aid. The surveyor subplot (coffee, listener, wire) personalizes the abstraction without quirk-for-quirk's sake. Risk-taking in lyric compression and accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. One friction: the moon-rock premise echoes fable templates (magical object catalyzes change), but the text transforms it into social mechanism—rumor made it glow—which restores originality through grounded causality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara appears throughout, trades batteries for truth, brokers the surveyor exchange, and places the rock to seed the rumor. Her choices (coffee + listener, the dare-wrapped-in-comfort announcement) create turns. However, middle beats show her orchestrating rather than facing a personal dilemma with cost; the closure "she could rest sometimes" is her interior effect, not a decision that alters her own path.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The fragment appears in three distinct beats: the surveyor's confession (company), Mara's palm walk (striated whisper), and the counter ritual that spawns the queue. Its specificity (gray, striated, fits the palm) matters, and its final placement "where the ivy could test its patience" charges the ending. It shifts from personal comfort to collective excuse, meeting causal pressure and closure linkage. Not quite indispensable—a different catalyst could serve—but deeply integrated.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Reciprocity shapes on-page tactics throughout: flour unloading → clinic ride, stories → supplies, the surveyor promise → coffee and wire. The ledger as shared diary embodies the concept. The closure hinges on reciprocity becoming rhythm ("polite anarchy, where there was no boss, only a rhythm everyone chose"). It drives escalation (queue, market) and reweights the opening isolation. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Desperately jocular" appears three times: the opening arrival smile, the rock announcement grin ("like a joke sent ahead to catch a falling person"), and jokes that "landed gently, like pigeons." It colors voice but never constrains an action with visible cost—Mara's humor succeeds each time without trade-off. Functional accent, replaceable with "wry" or "careful levity" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Catalyze" appears twice: the rumor claims the rock could catalyze water or courage, and later "the queue catalyze a market of solace." The queue formation is the major turn, but it results from Mara's rumor-planting and the rock's placement, not from catalysis as a distinct action the protagonist performs. The verb describes an outcome more than a method, and could be replaced with "spark" or "enable" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rumor chains appear early (moon-rock-for-diesel rumor, catalyzing water/courage variants) and shape Mara's method: she "listen[s] to rumors like birds…notice[s] where they roosted," follows rumor into the hills, and plants a new rumor at the counter. The queue's formation ("the rumor, traveling through improbable rumor chains, returned as a queue") demonstrates the method's mechanics on the page. Drives two beats and contributes to ending; the phrase "improbable" signals specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The station (ivy, ticket counter, platform, tracks, yard, tents) anchors every beat and supplies the stage for trades and the final rock placement. The flooded timetable establishes temporal anarchy; the ivy's patience charges the closing image. Spatial moves (hills, corrugated roof, counter, platform) alter tactics. Not indispensable—a different post-disaster hub could serve—but deeply woven into tone and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"When the story changes" appears as Mara's ledger entry marking the shift from crisis to community. Time pressure is light: "by morning" signals one overnight passage, and "the next day" structures the surveyor promise. The flood is recent enough for questions and jars, but no live clock tightens decisions. The timeframe is more thematic marker than tactical constraint, though the overnight transformation does pace the accumulation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mara's loneliness-cure motivation is stated early and dramatized through every trade, the ledger as diary, and the surveyor's confession that the rock "felt like company." Her choices (attention-as-help, rumor architecture) enact the motivation. Closure shows partial success: loneliness "had fewer places to hide, and she could rest sometimes"—friction between want and cost. Not fully indispensable (a different motivation could animate the same logistics work) but drives multiple beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Polite anarchy" appears four times and coherently defines the camp's orderless-yet-reciprocal rhythm: no boss, only chosen rhythm; anarchy remembering manners; handshakes before names. Tone modulates from Mara's arrival wryness through the surveyor gentleness to the final ribbons and rest. The phrase charges the closure's community reconfiguration. Essential to voice and ending, though "cooperative improvisation" could substitute with moderate structural edits.</comment>
