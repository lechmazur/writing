<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The cloud-shadow poet has a clear motivation (to dissolve boundaries) and the "aesthetically driven" trait appears on the page, but interiority remains thin and poetic rather than embodied. The custodians are present but function as witnessing chorus without individual stake. The poet's transformation from banned speaker to boundary-dissolver is asserted through lyric summary rather than dramatized contradiction or cost-laden micro-choices under pressure. No embodied emotion or therapy-speak, but the lack of visceral struggle keeps this from higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the opening lines and the ban-lift timeframe is clear. The piece accumulates density through the paraphrase action and colonnade response, building to the ice-crossing and pier moment; the final wall inscription offers Conceptual Repricing with the idea that "boundaries consented to dissolve." However, the cost remains conceptual and oblique—no visible foreclosure of a path or felt price on the page. One meaningful deepening (quartz hum dropping, path appearing) but the closure image asserts rather than demonstrates consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cobalt atrium, quartz colonnade, and frozen lake are vivid and specific, filtering through the poet's aesthetic lens ("lantern-moth hush," "cold ink"). The ice surface constrains the crossing choice and the colonnade's changing hum charges the path-opening beat. Spatial choreography (atrium floor to west doors to lake to pier) tracks cleanly. Sensory selection is purposeful and the setting recurs across beats, supporting closure participation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (stride through boundaries without violence) is signaled early and the paraphrase method tightens once (colonnade hum drop, ice reconsidering). The poet's agency drives the path-opening, and custodians follow. However, no live trade-off or visible cost appears—the ice simply "reconsiders" and the path "stays." The resolution feels granted rather than earned through sacrifice or foreclosure. One meaningful pressure point but without felt price to enter higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (boundaries as pauses, not walls; dissolution through listening) emerges from the paraphrase action and colonnade response without overt statement until the final wall inscription, which borders on moralizing ("we changed the world by listening to it"). The lantern-moth hush and tremor-of-certainty motifs recur with shifting weight. Subtext operates in the custodians' respectful distance and the poet's shoulder-glance invitation. The ending offers a resonant image but the wall inscription edges toward explicit thesis, capping the band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single POV, stable focalization through the poet's perception. The prose texture is distinct—lyric, compressed, with purposeful metaphor ("cloud shadows," "lantern-moth hush," "salt releases the color in buried shells"). Diction remains elevated and consistent, voice-motivated. No dialogue on the page. A few lines border on over-figuration ("pathway ghosts forward," "air becomes granular with new permission") but the register holds and the compression pattern is taught early. Psychic distance is controlled and the perceptual signature (aesthetic, patient, scar-smoothed) filters setting and action throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and mostly coherent, though occasional mixed vehicles appear ("pendulums with an elegant calm," "tremor of certainty moving like a thin animal"). Rhythm varies and paragraph structure modulates with scene pressure. A few paraphrase loops ("he does not mock it; he rinses it" then "rephrasing enforcement into invitation, punishment into passage" repeats the same content) and the final wall inscription feels like scaffolding moralizing. Filter verbs are minimal. Information density is strong but the ending's meta-commentary dulls propulsion slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The combination of poet-as-dissolver, paraphrase-as-tool, and physical boundary (ice) meeting conceptual boundary (ban) offers a fresh angle. The "tremor of certainty" motif and the idea of dissolving through listening rather than force provide specificity. However, the core arc—artist crosses threshold after ban lifts—is familiar, and the resolution (ice reconsiders, path stays) lacks the friction or trade-off that would deepen inevitability. The wall inscription's explanatory coda reduces earned resonance. One fresh inflection (paraphrase softening the ice) but the execution stops short of transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cloud-shadow poet present throughout; drives the paraphrase action, the ice-crossing choice, and the final wall inscription. Appears in opening, middle (speaks to colonnade, touches ice), and closure (writes on wall, coaxes custodians). His choice to paraphrase the ban and speak to the colonnade enables the path; his palm-to-ice moment triggers the ice reconsideration. Causal pressure across at least two beats and closure linkage. Specificity moderate (born in village measuring hours by cloud shadows, but the name is more flavor than constraint). Cost tied to him is oblique—years of margin-speaking mentioned but not shown with present price.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Humming quartz colonnade present in opening setup, responds to poet's gait and paraphrase with harmonic drop (middle beat), bends tone to cradle cold at west doors, and steadies into "ladder of tones" cited by the city at closure. Used in three distinct beats; its changing hum enables the path and charges the ending. Causal: the colonnade's response is necessary for the dissolution. Specificity high (quartz, tuned to permissions, harmonic partials). Irreplaceable—remove it and the mechanism of boundary-dissolution collapses.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Tremor of certainty" mentioned twice: poet hears it moving through atrium ribs, and the final wall inscription says "certainty ripple." The phrase recurs but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—it describes an ambient state rather than shaping agency. Lyric early-to-final reprise reweights the stake slightly (certainty associated with alignment and shared resonance) but the cost or pressure tied to this concept remains atmospheric rather than actionable. Present in setup and closure; minimal middle development.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Aesthetically driven" appears once in the arrival paragraph ("aesthetically driven and patient as a migrating glacier") and recurs near the end ("still aesthetically driven... but his taste now includes outcomes, not only beauty"). The shift from beauty-only to outcomes-included is noted but not dramatized with an on-page choice or visible cost. The trait is told rather than shown constraining or enabling action. Label-only mention; no trade-off demonstrated. Late reprise without middle beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase signaled in setup (poet taught himself to paraphrase edicts during ban), dramatized in middle beat (reads aloud a paraphrase of the ban, "rinsing" it, rephrasing enforcement into invitation), and cited at closure (final line "by listening to it, which is how boundaries consented to dissolve" echoes the paraphrase method). The paraphrase action triggers the colonnade hum drop and enables the ice reconsideration—major turns trace to it. Specificity high (not a key or hammer, but salt-like dissolution). Causal pressure across three beats; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Through dissolving boundaries" stated as method in the opening third ("not key nor hammer, but through dissolving boundaries, the way salt releases the color in buried shells"). The mechanics (paraphrase softens enforcement, colonnade hum dissolves ice's need to separate) appear in middle and closure beats. Method shapes the attempts (speaking to colonnade, touching ice) and the outcome (path stays, boundaries become bridge). Signaled early; used across beats; charges closure. Specificity moderate (salt metaphor, but the on-page action is more voice/touch than chemical process). Causal linkage solid.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Cobalt atrium by frozen lake present in opening, middle (west doors yawn, air knifes in), and closure (atrium holds the hush, poet writes on wall). The lake surface constrains the crossing choice (ice must reconsider) and the atrium floor lights respond to the poet's gait. The setting supplies resources (colonnade, path, ice) that affect outcome. More than postcard; environment alters tactics. Present across all three gates; causal pressure moderate (lake is obstacle and medium but could be swapped for another boundary with edits). Specificity solid (cobalt, frozen, angles and pale teeth).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After the ban lifts" signals timeframe in opening and recurs at closure ("after the ban lifts to morning"). The ban's end enables the arrival and attempt but does not tighten tactics on the page—no live clock, no deadline pressure within the scene. The poet moves at glacier pace; time is expansive rather than constrained. Timeframe provides context but does not narrow options or escalate cost. Setup and closure reprise; minimal middle pressure. Lyric bracketing without causal urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To stride through boundaries once thought sacred" stated explicitly in the opening third as the poet's want. The desire drives the paraphrase reading, the ice-crossing, and the final coaxing of custodians. Conflicted slightly by the method constraint (without violence) but the friction between want and cost is told rather than shown—no visible sacrifice or foreclosure. The poet achieves the goal and the text asserts the transformation; dramatized in action (crossing, touching ice) but not in contradictory impulses or trade-offs. Present in setup, middle, and closure; causal but low-friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>"Lantern-moth hush" introduced in opening ("exhales a lantern-moth hush that smells like cold ink"), recurs in middle ("everyone else keeps the lantern-moth hush, wings folded"), and returns at closure ("atrium holds the lantern-moth hush like a chapel of breath"). Tone is coherent—reverent, restrained, patient—and modulates slightly (hush deepens from exhale to held breath). The tone charges the final image by reinforcing the collective witnessing and the dissolution's quiet authority. Specificity high (moth wings, chapel, breath); present across all three gates; reweights closure atmosphere. Does not constrain a choice but resonates strongly.</comment>
