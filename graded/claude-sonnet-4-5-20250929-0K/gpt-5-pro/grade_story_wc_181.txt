<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The curator's interiority is concrete and specific ("brightened disquiet humming in my ribs"), and embodied choices appear throughout—refusing direct inheritance, using the cameo in a non-prescribed way, meeting the young woman on a "third road." However, the protagonist's agency reads more as philosophical attention than decisive action under contradictory pressure. The final choice to capture "the breath of the orchard" rather than a face feels thematically coherent but lacks visible friction or internal contradiction in the moment of decision.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when early (curator, asteroid orchard, contract-bound timeframe). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist's alternative use of the cameo "loosens" the ledger and allows the orchard to bloom without trapping either heir, reweighting the inheritance stakes. Cost is conceptual and felt—choosing a "gentler grammar" forecloses the direct inheritance path—and the final image of seeds "small as commas" charges the resolution. One meaningful deepening (the bathroom realization → altered cameo use) fits the length; the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The orchard's aurora leaves, glowing stones, and roots function as micro-setting that constrains choice: the rule against touching flowers bare-handed, the book nested in roots, the petals that "edit the air." The setting is filtered through the curator's professional and philosophical lens. The pistachio shell cameo and the bathroom mirror also serve as charged micro-spaces. The orchard's breath pressed into the shell directly enables the closure, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment shaping the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether to accept direct inheritance (fruit with the curator's name) or refuse and leave the orchard unmapped. One meaningful tightening occurs when the protagonist realizes in the bathroom that the cameo can capture the orchard's breath instead of a face, narrowing options and shifting tactics. The final choice—offering the young woman a "third road"—reweights the either/or into collaborative coexistence. Cost is legible: the curator forecloses both personal inheritance and abandonment, choosing attention and patience. Agency is clear, though pressure could tighten further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of nonlinear inheritance emerges through concrete particulars: the young woman carving the curator's name into a ledger, the orchard's fruit traveling "forward and sideways," the seeds that "imprint only on breath." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—inheritance as breath and attention rather than claim—without moralizing. The cameo-as-map and the bathroom-mirror seed charge the final image. Minor slip: "the most dangerous catalog is the self" edges toward stated thesis, but it's attributed to a recalled professor and remains embedded in scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single-POV first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: the curator notices through museum-logic ("catalog," "inventory," "ledger") and philosophical whimsy ("simply complicated," "tender mathematics"). Diction is controlled and lyric, purposefully compressed in places ("brightened disquiet," "rain on a summer drought"). The bathroom-breakthrough motif is idiosyncratic and voice-consistent. One minor slip: "which seemed both page and soil" leans slightly expository in a high-density paragraph, but the effect supports the surreal setting without breaking immersion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("leaves of faint aurora," "petals edited the air," "seeds small as commas"), but patterns are taught early and cohere with the lyric-surreal premise. Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift. Two minor loop artifacts: "I decided to return and make no choice except attention" followed shortly by "Back under the aurora leaves, I will inquire of the roots" rephrases intent without advancing pressure, and "brightened disquiet" recurs decoratively. Information density is strong overall, and the closure image remains clear. Apply −0.3 for the paraphrase loop, landing mid-7s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of museum curation, nonlinear inheritance, and astral horticulture feels specific and non-obvious. The bathroom-breakthrough motif and the pistachio-shell cameo are fresh inflections. The choice to press the cameo to the page rather than to a face transforms the inherited premise with philosophical stakes ("debts that pay themselves by seeking other times to be born"). Minor derivativeness: the wise-tree / magical-orchard frame echoes familiar speculative templates, but the story transforms it through occupational lens (curator) and conceptual rigor (inheritance as breath, not bloodline). Risk-taking in structure and tone heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; +0.3 within band for boldness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The bewildered curator is present throughout, framing all decisions. The trait "bewildered" constrains the approach—tentative inquiry, philosophical detours, bathroom breakthroughs—and the curator's occupational lens (cataloging, inventory) shapes perception and tactics. Two key choices trace to this character: the bathroom realization and the decision to capture orchard breath instead of a face. Present in closure when the curator thanks the roots and slips a seed into the mirror frame. Causal linkage is solid; irreplaceability is moderate (a different profession might alter metaphor but not core logic).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The pistachio shell cameo blank is seeded early, wrapped in gauze. It reappears in the first inventory attempt, is rubbed in the bathroom breakthrough, then used to press the orchard's breath—its transformed function enables the closure. Three distinct beats, causal pressure (the choice to use it differently opens the "third road"), and closure linkage (the map of pollination set into the cover unlocks the footpath chapter). High specificity: the shell's material and intended use (to take a face impression) make the reversal meaningful. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Nonlinear inheritance is defined early and structures the stakes: fruit travel forward and sideways, the young woman is "heir from the past," the curator is "ancestor from the future." It constrains choices—whether to take the fruit with the curator's name or refuse—and the final resolution (offering a third road via orchard breath) directly addresses the concept. Present in closure when the ledger pages loosen and choices "no longer canceled each other." Cost is visible: traditional inheritance is foreclosed. Causal and thematic; strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Simply complicated" is introduced early as a descriptor of the orchard's rules and returns when the curator notes "the orchard could keep blooming, simply complicated and honest." It functions more as tonal summary than actionable constraint. The phrase colors perception but does not enable or block a specific on-page move. Lyric reprise between opening and near-ending reweights the stake slightly, but no visible cost or tactic is tied uniquely to this trait. Mid-band for thematic presence without mechanical necessity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Inquire" is seeded as the mandated action ("told to inquire politely"), constrains the first attempt ("I began my inventory by breathing slow"), and structures the key beat: "Back under the aurora leaves, I will inquire of the roots, I told the book." The trees grant "a single direct question," and the curator asks "what it meant to inherit a future." That inquiry triggers the vision of the young woman and opens the path to closure. Present across three beats, causally active, and irreplaceable—other verbs (demand, accept) would break the orchard's courtesy rule. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The bathroom-breakthrough motif is seeded mid-story ("I always end up having philosophical breakthroughs in bathrooms, because the pump noise keeps secrets"), returns when the curator excuses themself to trace possible paths, and delivers the pivotal realization: using the cameo to capture orchard breath instead of a face. That choice unlocks the closure. The method is idiosyncratic and voice-consistent. Two functional beats (mirror scene, pump-hum reflection) and direct closure linkage. Moderate specificity—other introspective sites could substitute with rewrites, but the recurring pump noise and mirror frame add charged detail. Solid integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The astral orchard is anchored immediately and supplies concrete constraints: don't touch flowers bare-handed, the book nested in roots, petals that edit air, aurora leaves. The setting's breath is the object the curator presses into the cameo, directly enabling closure. The orchard's nonlinear inheritance rules shape all tactics. Present in setup, middle inquiry, and closure. High causal pressure and irreplaceability—no other setting could supply "orchard breath" with the same conceptual charge. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "between the first and last page of a book" is mentioned in the contract and the book appears nested in roots, but the constraint is abstract. The curator opens the book, uses it to anchor the cameo, and walks a chapter-footpath, but no ticking clock alters tactics or tightens decisions. The book's opening and closing structure the work, but the temporal pressure is conceptual rather than felt. Setup and closure participation present; middle development weak. Functional but not visceral.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"To pursue forbidden knowledge" is stated in the contract acceptance and colors the curator's approach (tentative, bewildered, seeking rules). The motivation drives the journey to the orchard and the decision to inquire rather than take or flee. Friction appears when the curator realizes the "most dangerous catalog is the self" and must choose between direct inheritance and refusal. The final choice—capturing breath instead of a face—reflects evolved understanding of what knowledge means here. Present across setup, middle, and closure; moderate cost (renouncing direct inheritance). Solid integration but could be sharper.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Brightened disquiet" is introduced in the opening line, recurs when the curator stands "full of brightened disquiet" after the vision, and modulates subtly (wonder, wariness, tentative hope) as pressure shifts. The tone charges the final image: slipping a seed into the mirror frame "for later" maintains the blend of curiosity and unease. Coherent through turns, voice-consistent, and purposefully unresolved. The adjective "brightened" elevates disquiet from mere anxiety to charged attention. Strong tonal integration that supports closure without overstating.</comment>
