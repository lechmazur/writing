<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The albino tracker's interiority is vivid and embodied ("serene anger sits in my chest like a coiled current"), and the grief-driven motive evolves into purposeful agency. The final choice—bracing the beam in the widened moment—is earned by the prior quest and forecloses the past with visible cost ("my bones survive with a song of hairline flares"). Minor slip: the elders remain functional props without pressure-testing the protagonist's stance; relationship dynamics are absent where they could deepen the crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation arrives swiftly (who, where, eclipse timeframe) and the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—density builds through the drone footage, ink patterns, and the recursive sister-memory until the final image reweights the opening grief. Closure lands with cost (bones fractured, rule confirmed), but the causal linkage between "braided noticing" and time dilation remains asserted more than dramatized; the mechanism is told in exposition rather than tested through on-page contradiction or failure. The midpoint ellipsis ("I let myself disappear") compresses the threshold crossing, which fits lyric mode but sacrifices a visible escalation beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Wind, tarps, ink, and the drone function as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the closure: the ink's evaporation maps attention vectors, the drone films seams, and the encampment's "consciously wild" design braids design into disarray. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("salt on my tongue," "heat rising out of the ink"), and spatial choreography remains clear across the threshold crossing. The eclipse aftermath and wind-carved bones anchor the opening and return in the final image, meeting the gate for environment shaping tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering why time slows in crisis—is signaled early and tightens through the drone mapping, ink threshold, and the sister's lantern-moment. One meaningful deepening occurs when the narrator confirms the rule by bracing the beam, forecloses the past, and carries the algebra back. Under the Accumulative lens, the density increase and cadence shift reweight the grief into communal training, satisfying escalation. Minor issue: the elders' instructions and the final training plan feel externalized rather than tested by internal friction or a live tradeoff between personal closure and communal cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: "terror is a choir that holds the note until choice can sing back," and the encampment's wind-carving mirrors the narrator's sculpted anger. The final image—coals ready to warm trembling hands—offers a non-literal answer to the opening question without stating a moral. The ink as metronome/mirror and the drone as witness tie the speculative mechanism to grief-as-attention, and the closing shift from reactive to "consciously wild" reweights the premise. No thematic echo intrudes, and the conceptual repricing (attention braids time) carries undeniable cost on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>First-person voice is distinct and sustained: "stubborn as flint," "the clock coughing sand," "fossiled crisis hanging like a lantern." Psychic distance remains stable, and the high-pressure crossing ("I let myself disappear") compresses diction appropriately while internal texture persists. Purposeful elision at the threshold is taught early and paid off in the return with algebra. Minor slip: a few filter-verb clusters ("I watch," "I tell them") dull immediacy in mid-pressure beats, and one late phrase ("clicking incontrovertible algebra") edges toward elevated register without full voice motivation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high and rhythm varies purposefully, but several beats loop conceptually: "serene anger" recurs three times with near-identical phrasing, and the explanation of time-dilation ("braided noticing," "holding breath together") is paraphrased across two adjacent paragraphs without added pressure. Figurative language is vivid ("the wind is an orchestra of halted crescendos") but occasionally stacks without pattern payoff in the middle third. The opening and closing lines anchor strongly, and no pronoun drift or sequence errors mar clarity, keeping the piece above mid-band despite scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of time-perception science, grief ritual, and wind-carved setting feels specific and non-obvious; the ink-as-metronome and drone-as-witness are fresh inflections that grow from the premise rather than ornament. The transformation test holds: swapping the encampment or the albino tracker would break the voice and the consciously-wild closure logic. Risk-taking in the threshold elision and the recursive sister-moment heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, earning within-band lift. Minor cap: the "time slows in crisis" frame echoes familiar writing-prompt territory; the story transforms it through the communal training and braided-attention mechanism, but the seed remains recognizable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The albino tracker frames expectation early, makes the key choice to brace the beam in the widened moment, and returns with the footage to teach the elders. Present in setup, middle drone-priming beat, and closure; the trait (albino, callused feet) remains ornamental, but the tracker role drives all three gates with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The drone is primed, films the ink seams, threads the threshold, maps attention vectors, and delivers "incontrovertible algebra" at closure. Present across four beats with evolving function; its opal eyes and microsecond-counting wings are specific and irreplaceable. Causal pressure is strong, closure linkage clear, cost tied to the footage that enables communal training.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Disappearing ink shapes stakes and tactics on the page: it evaporates in proportion to collective attention, sketches the scaffold of the longer moment, serves as metronome and mirror, and blooms the gate under the drone's cue. Present in setup (ceramic bowl described), middle (poured onto slate, teased into lattices by wind), and closure (trained to bloom the gate for future storms). Causal pressure high, specificity undeniable, cost connection clear.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Consciously wild" is signaled early in the elders' encampment design ("design braided tightly into seeming disarray") and returns at closure as the training goal ("deliberate in focus"). It enables the attention-braiding mechanism and constrains the encampment's wind-carving. Present in setup and closure with one middle reference; label-only in the final beat lowers the score slightly, but the trait visibly alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Disappearing through the ink patterns is the threshold action that enables the widened-second exploration, the sister-moment revisit, and the beam-bracing choice. Major turn traces directly to this action; removing it would break the story's causal spine. Present in setup (ink described), executed at midpoint, and referenced in the return crossing. Causal pressure and closure linkage both strong.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The method—ephemeral patterns in spilled ink—is signaled early (ceramic bowl, glossy dark ink), demonstrated in the slate-pouring beat, and used to step through the threshold. The vanishing edges pool into whorls, the drone films seams, and the gate mechanism returns at closure when the elders will cue the ink to bloom. Mechanics matter on the page; setup, middle, and closure all clear.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The wind-carved encampment pressures choices: tarps lean like dunes, pathways curve to break the gale and bend it toward listening, and the elders' ring provides the instruments. The setting supplies the drone and ink, enables the attention-braiding mechanism, and will house the future training. Micro-setting (ink slate, tarp ring) alters tactics at multiple beats; spatial choreography clear, closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After the eclipse ends" bookends the opening and recurs once mid-story, anchoring the shadow-trembling air and the hunt for the "leftover." Time does not tighten decisions visibly within the narrative present; the piece instead explores stretched time as subject matter. Setup and thematic echo present, but no live clock that alters moves; the timeframe functions more as atmosphere than pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation to discover why time slows in crisis is stated early, dramatized through the drone-and-ink investigation, tested in the sister-lantern beat, and answered with cost ("my bones survive with a song of hairline flares"). Friction between want (understanding) and cost (reliving the death, accepting the fracture) is visible. Setup, middle pursuit, and closure revelation all present; causal pressure strong.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Serene anger is signaled in the opening ("quiet on the surface, relentless below"), modulates through the quest (drone priming as controlled focus), and returns at closure as "steady fire arranged into coals, ready to warm the hand that trembles." Tone coherence holds across turns, and the final image charges the resolution. The phrase recurs three times with slight paraphrase, which risks loop debt, but the conceptual shift (from coiled current to arranged coals) reweights the stake and fits the RR ending.</comment>
