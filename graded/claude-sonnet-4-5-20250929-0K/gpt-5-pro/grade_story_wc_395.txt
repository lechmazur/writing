<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is concrete and specific ("I wanted, more than rules allowed, to find where deleted files go"), with embodied choices under pressure. The decision to lie and descend into forbidden archives shows clear agency with visible cost. Internal contradiction is present—professional duty versus ethical imperative—though the protagonist's competence could have been tested more sharply. Minor deduction: the final renunciation ("let deletion be a home") feels slightly under-motivated given the intensity of the investigation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly by line 3 (who, where, what). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: recurring numbers build pressure through pattern and density, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid). The protagonist's choice to "leave the numbers to work" forecloses the export path with felt cost—Lia remains un-recovered yet "not entirely missing." Causal linkage is tight: lie → vault access → voice notes → decision to withhold. Cost is legible in "the smallest impossible thing" and the final bus ad callback.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The archive's layered geography (Sargasso, After Echo Vaults, rack eleven slot three) constrains navigation and discovery. The patch—a physical object—is handled twice (estate-sale duplicate, overlay against rack map) and directly enables the final drive discovery. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "dry rain," "blue like tide," "anaerobic layers." The micro-setting (terminal, drawer, racks) charges the final image when the narrator shuts down and the "room keeps whispering." Spatial choreography is coherent throughout descent and return.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find where deleted files go / expose corporate cover-up) is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when the narrator opens the forbidden vault. The lie escalates from "memorial escalation" to each door passage to the final withholding decision. Agency is clear: the protagonist chooses to "let deletion be a home" rather than export, foreclosing the exposure path with visible cost ("company logs every export like a pulse"). One meaningful deepening occurs when Lia's voice notes reveal systemic murder, raising the stakes from curiosity to justice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme (deletion as dispersion vs. deletion as intentional erasure; memory as resistance) emerges through concrete particulars without moralizing. The patch's broken stitches, the recurring 1103, and the final bus ad create a resonant pattern that reweights "disappearance is a system, not a drama." The ending offers a non-literal answer: mercy is not recovery but persistent witness. No thematic echo or sermon; the protagonist's choice to leave the numbers working embodies the theme. Subtext operates in "carefully managed forgetting" and "smallest impossible thing."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "brightly attentive," "sensed absence sitting beside that feed," "the shape a body makes after it rises." Perceptual signature is selective and职业-specific (metadata, rack rows, "candlelight permissions"). POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction stays within the narrator's technical-lyric register throughout. Rhythmic modulation under pressure is evident: clipped urgency during descent ("My badge trembles at each door") versus the hushed final paragraphs. Purposeful compression ("deletion was dispersion, a tidy myth") is taught early and paid off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "seventeen stars, a looping orbit stitched like a noose" carries symbol, image, and foreshadowing). No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during descent and breathing in the final commute. Minor issue: some figurative density in mid-section ("weather" recurs as metaphor four times without pattern payoff). Opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharge motifs cleanly. One template cadence run: "In the first…In the second…In the third" is functional but mechanical.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of corporate archive work, cold case investigation, and digital afterlife is specific and non-obvious. The 1103/seventeen number pattern as spatial topology (rack row/slot) is an ingenious turn earned by prior setup. The patch overlay onto the rack map is a fresh, concrete discovery beat. Risk-taking in the lyric-technical voice heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor limitation: the "cold case threaded into my hands like a snagged wire" premise echoes familiar archivist-detective templates, though the execution transforms it through lived technical detail and moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present throughout; makes key choices (lie to manager, descend, open vault, withhold file). Decisions alter tactics and foreclose paths with visible cost at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Signaled early (week before accident image); handled twice (estate-sale duplicate, rack-map overlay); enables discovery of hidden drives; returns in final thought with reweighted meaning ("dry rain," tide-blue embroidery). Indispensable to closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Frames expectation early (line 6); shapes stakes and tactics (memorial escalation, vault descent); reweighted at closure ("not missing but misfiled"). The case drives all investigation beats and the final withholding choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Signaled in opening line and repeated in Lia's message; enables the protagonist to "follow" the numbers. Trait constrains perception (notices metadata patterns) but does not visibly trade off against another attribute under pressure. Present in closure framing but no sharp cost tied to being "brightly attentive" versus another mode.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>First lie (memorial escalation) opens vault access; repeated lies at each door; final lie-by-omission (not exporting) defines closure. Major turns trace directly to this action. Removing "lie" would collapse the arc; protagonist's ethical calculus hinges on incremental falsehoods.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Signaled early (line 7); mechanics matter (timestamps, file names, audio lengths, rack coordinates); shapes discovery tactics across multiple beats; returns in final bus ad to charge closure image. The method is indispensable; no swappable alternative.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Archive structure (Sargasso, After Echo Vaults, rack topology) pressures choices and supplies resources (vault key, rack map). Micro-setting (terminal, drawer, cold room) alters tactics and charges final image ("room keeps whispering"). Removing the specific geography would break discovery logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Phrase appears in opening but does not function as a tightening clock. Playlists and "forgotten songs" recur thematically and in voice-note framing, but elapsed time is not tracked or used to pressure decisions. More lyric anchor than live constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Desire stated early (line 11); dramatized through vault descent and voice-note discovery; conflicted at closure when the protagonist chooses to "let deletion be a home" rather than recover/export. Friction between want (expose truth) and cost (company surveillance, Lia's request) is visible on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Tone is coherent and modulates with pressure: hushed curiosity → urgency during descent → quiet resolve at closure. The phrase "sensed absence" appears twice and charges the final image ("room keeps whispering, a sensed absence that does not accuse"). Tone reweights the ending's mercy framing and remains stable across beats.</comment>
