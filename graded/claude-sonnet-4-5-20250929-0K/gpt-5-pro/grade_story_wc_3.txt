<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator possesses a distinct perceptual signature—mapping cuneiform to magnetic fields, measuring transitions through "wedges" and "gradients"—with embodied choices (kneeling, humming calibration, rotating rails by a fingerwidth) that reveal methodical craft under pressure. Internal contradiction operates cleanly: haunted ambitions seek mastery yet the protagonist learns to "tune" rather than "reverse," a renunciation earned through contact with the seed and mentor's trace. The final shift from rescue to commons-building forecloses the mastery path with visible cost (accepting the mentor's absence, committing to collective listening). Minor weakness: the mentor remains abstract; her vanishing supplies motive but no on-page friction that tests the narrator's present loyalty or doubt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Cuneiform translator, Magnetic arbor above clouds, night ocean below, after mentor's vanishing) land within the first ~100 words. Pressure accumulates through tactile engagement: seed placed at junction, rails hum, coil grows and roots, fruit forms—each beat deepens understanding and forecloses the rescue fantasy. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the narrator accepts non-ownership of the bridge, promises return with students, and commits to a commons rather than individual mastery. Cost is legible in the relinquishment of "haunted ambitions" and the shift from solo retrieval to patient, collective work. One meaningful tightening occurs when the coil speaks the mentor's final breath, crystallizing that she measured her exit to avoid tearing the world; this insight directly drives the narrator's pivot from mastery to stewardship.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Magnetic arbor is rendered through charged detail: iron boughs, rails that ring like bowls, chirping magnets, buried storms humming in the walkway. Micro-setting elements—the rail junction, the seed's warmth and polarity, ozone and salt in the air—constrain the ritual and charge the final image (coil cradling the fruit beside the seed). Sensory hierarchy reflects professional focus: the narrator attends to field alignment, tonal calibrations, gradients rather than景观 tourism. Spatial choreography is clean throughout (kneel at crossing, fingerwidth rotation, fruit placed back beside seed). The arbor's magnets and storm-charged lattice function as both constraint (the protagonist must align with field lines) and resource (the rails answer, enabling growth), meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping choice and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: understand the physics of transition and reestablish the mentor's orchard. Pressure tightens when the seed shivers and aligns, coil tastes absence, and the narrator hears the mentor's final breath encoded in the fruit—each beat narrows options from retrieval fantasy to acceptance of departure as "rotation, not disappearance." Agency drives escalation: the protagonist chooses to hum calibration, rotate rails, and finally place the fruit back rather than consume it, a renunciation that forecloses immediate closure (biting would "feed" rather than "listen") in favor of sustained commons-building. Cost is visible in the abandonment of "haunted ambitions" and the commitment to return with students, sharing rather than owning the threshold. One meaningful deepening occurs when the hollow of the mentor's last breath reveals she "measured her exit," transforming the loss from rupture to teaching and reweighting the narrator's goal from mastery to stewardship.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—transition as continuity, not rupture; knowledge as commons, not possession—emerges through tactile particulars: wedge-to-magnet-line mappings, the seed's polarity, the coil's tasting absence, the fruit that stores trace rather than nourishment. The mentor's whisper ("endings are rotations") reconfigures the opening image ("After the spirit leaves, the wind remembers its shape") without summary. Subtext operates in the choice not to bite the fruit and in the shift from solo haunting to collective listening. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"a horizon that stands just ahead, and I walk toward it, patient, within touching distance"—that reweights the title phrase and the narrator's initial solitary climb with the promise of shared stewardship. No thematic echo; the cuneiform-as-analogical-thinking conceit integrates organically into the translator's professional lens rather than serving as prompt decoration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Single POV with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator filters sensation through craft idiom (wedges, calibrations, syllables, tablets, vowels), syntactic parallelism ("tasting salt, tasting ozone, tasting the absence"), and measured cadence that modulates under pressure without fragmenting. Purposeful compression and lyric repetition ("After the spirit leaves…" frames beginning and near-end) teach a pattern that the piece pays off at closure. Diction remains within the translator's register—technical terms (cuneiform, magnets, poles, gradients) are precise and voice-motivated; elevated phrasing ("etiquette of its refusal," "amphorae that pour their shape forward") reads as the narrator's idiolect rather than authorial decoration. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. Psychic distance tightens cleanly when the coil speaks and the narrator answers, then eases into the collective future ("we will read the air together") without disorientation. The final line's tonal shift from solitary to communal feels earned by the prior reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do double work (e.g., "It is smooth as an almond and heavy as a magnet, strangely warm with careful memory" conveys weight, texture, and thematic charge). Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer syntactic units during ritual preparation and shorter beats at key intensifications ("I answer that I will"). Figurative language—"the arbor names it with a thousand patient tones," "departures teach arrivals how to wait"—is concentrated but mostly purposeful. However, several lines verge on overwriting: "a gate that opens and remembers both sides," "thresholds as amphorae that pour their shape forward," "bodies as scripts that continue when the scribe lifts the stylus" cluster metaphors that, while coherent, slightly dilute urgency in the middle third. Minor paraphrase loop: "gradients can be read" / "I translate the pulse as I would a tablet" restates the analogical method without advancing it. No template cadence, no severe loops. Sentence openings vary well. A tighter trim of one or two metaphor strings would elevate clarity without sacrificing texture.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of cuneiform scholarship, magnetic field physics, and grief-as-calibration feels specific and non-obvious; the choice to map wedge-strokes to magnet lines and treat transition as "etiquette" rather than rupture transforms familiar mentor-loss arcs. The fruit that stores trace rather than nourishment, and the refusal to consume it, offers a fresh inflection on closure-through-renunciation. Risk-taking in voice (lyric compression, technical idiom, elliptical time frame) heightens coherence without obscuring clarity. The concept of "reestablishing" an orchard as a commons of thresholds integrates organically. However, the mentor-vanishing premise echoes familiar "wise teacher disappears into mystery" templates; the story elevates it through the narrator's professional lens and the specific mechanics of listening-versus-feeding, but does not fully escape the archetype's gravitational pull. No proximity flags to famous lines. Within-band adjustment: +0.3 for sustained voice risk and conceptual integrity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cuneiform translator: present from line 2, frames perception throughout (wedges, syllables, scribe, tablet, translation written on palm), and drives key choices—mapping glyphs to rail junctions, humming calibration, rotating by a fingerwidth, reading the fruit's pulse. The professional lens shapes the ritual method and the final decision to return with students. Causal across beats; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Knowledge fruit seed: introduced early (mentor's gift in basalt pouch), handled in setup (smooth, heavy, warm), placed at junction to initiate growth, returns transformed as fruit with encoded trace, and the narrator's choice not to consume it—only to cradle it for future library—charges the closure. Three distinct beats with escalating stakes; the seed's warmth and polarity constrain ritual mechanics. Cost connection: biting would feed but not teach, a trade-off the protagonist refuses.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Haunted ambitions: named early, shapes the opening solitary climb and the desire for mastery, tested when the fruit reveals the mentor's measured exit, and explicitly renounced in the pivot to "tune… so the living can listen without harm." Drives one major turn (from rescue to stewardship) and participates in closure when ambitions are reframed as "a horizon that stands just ahead." Two beats; causal pressure evident; cost legible. Could score higher with a second mid-scene friction where the haunting complicates a tactical choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Kindly methodical: mentioned twice (colleagues' view, self-pledge to remain so) but not visibly constraining an on-page choice. The methodical approach is shown through careful calibration and fingerwidth adjustments, yet "kindly" remains label-only. No moment where kindness costs speed or where method is tested against urgency. Functional trait that colors execution but does not drive a turn or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Reestablish: signaled early ("I must reestablish the orchard"), structures the ritual (placing seed, rotating rails, reading fruit), and pivots at closure into collective reestablishment ("we will reestablish the orchard as a commons"). The verb frames both the dominant stake and the resolution. Three beats; the shift from solo to shared reestablishment carries the story's conceptual cost. Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Through analogical thinking: introduced by name in the first third, demonstrated when the narrator maps cuneiform strokes to magnet lines and the seed to a syllable, and applied again when translating the fruit's pulse as wedges in clay. The method enables the ritual and discovery of "the harmonic where matter cedes and memory persists." Two beats with causal work; the analogical lens distinguishes this translator's approach. Slightly abstract at first mention but earns its place through repeated use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Magnetic arbor above the clouds: present from the opening, supplies the field that aligns the seed's poles, provides rails that ring and chirp in response to calibration, and remains the site of the final promise to return with students. Setting constrains ritual mechanics (the narrator must work at a rail junction, must tune to magnetic gradients) and charges the ending ("the arbor still carries the warmth of her hands"). Three beats; environment as active participant. Essential.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>After the spirit leaves: frames the opening and closing lines, establishes the temporal context (mentor's absence), and the phrase "what remains is not silence but gradients" pivots understanding at midpoint. The time frame shapes the emotional stakes (listening to what persists after departure) and participates in closure when the narrator walks "toward it, patient, within touching distance." Early setup, lyric reprise, cost-linked. Scores mid-6s because the "after" is stable context rather than live countdown; no escalating clock pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>To understand the physics of transition: stated early as purpose, tested when the seed and coil demonstrate transition as "a bridge that refuses to end," and reconfigured at closure when the narrator shifts from understanding-as-mastery to understanding-as-listening. Desire drives ritual attempt, and the friction between wanting to reverse the mentor's departure and learning to honor her measured exit generates the story's central turn. Two beats; causal; cost visible. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Touching distance: introduced as concept ("work as close as touching distance; every adjustment is a breath"), recurs when the bridge "feels within touching distance," and charges the final line ("I walk toward it, patient, within touching distance"). Tone is intimate, methodical, and elegiac throughout; modulates from solitary haunting to collective promise without rupture. The phrase reweights from physical proximity (breath, fingerwidth adjustments) to relational stance (patient approach, shared threshold). Three appearances with escalating meaning; coherent tonal arc; final image depends on it.</comment>
