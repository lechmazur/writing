<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior life shows genuine contradiction—wanting to "harvest insights from failure" while staging a solitary ritual that might be self-punishment. Embodied emotion appears in the breath-holding quiet and the careful arrangement of markers, though some reflection ("I remember the cost of bravado") tilts toward summary. The final choice to "cross tomorrow, not to claim, but to witness" is earned by the flute-playing scene and the encounter with the twin-valley self, and the cost is visible: the protagonist relinquishes ownership in favor of patient witness. Minor issue: some interiority edges toward lyric abstraction ("hunger to patience") that slightly dilutes specificity under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (driven relic keeper), where (Thunder-echo range), and when (after guardianship) within the first quarter. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the pressure builds through the driftwood arrangement, the flute notes, and the loom imagery, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) when the protagonist decides to carry witness rather than claim. Cost is felt: the markers curve away from the cave toward the pass and listeners who "must judge the seam." The closure reweights the opening failure as a teaching, and the braid image ties the ending to prior motifs with undeniable pressure. One small friction: the twin-valley figure introduces a mild causal wrinkle (is it memory, projection, or literal bifurcation?) that the text does not fully clarify, though it does not break the accumulative build.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "mist stitched," "dried river scribbled runes," "avalanchingly quiet" all anchor the canyon setting through POV filter. The driftwood markers constrain the protagonist's directional thinking, and the flute's gilded threads and reed construction charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean across camp, gorges, and the loom-corridor. Minor limitation: the Thunder-echo range functions more as poetic backdrop than a pressure that alters tactics; the environment enables but does not force a key choice. To reach 9+, the setting would need to narrow options more aggressively at a closure beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transforming failure into insight without hiding it—signals early and remains coherent. The flute-playing scene is the key escalation: each note opens a corridor, introduces the twin-valley self, and forces the protagonist to "teach edges to share" rather than stitch them closed, meaningfully tightening the options. The ending forecloses the path of "carrying banners" in favor of "carrying driftwood," a renunciation with visible cost (the protagonist gives up authority). One meaningful turn is sufficient at this length. To reach 8.8+, the escalation would benefit from a second on-page micro-choice that raises the price or narrows tactics before the final stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—relinquishing ownership and learning to witness rather than command—emerges from the driftwood arrangement, the flute ritual, and the twin-valley encounter without direct statement. The final image of the markers curving toward the pass and the listeners who "do not own" the seam offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in the loom metaphor (weaving, not closing wounds) and the contrast between the protagonist's old vows and new practice. Minor friction: "let others carry banners; I will carry driftwood" edges close to thematic summary, though it lands as a decision rather than a moral. The piece invites reflection and resists tidy resolution, but one moment of near-moralizing keeps it just below 9+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>First-person POV distance is stable and apt; the protagonist's perceptual signature (filtering landscape through failure and ceremony) is consistent. Diction is purposeful and lyric without obscuring clarity: "avalanchingly quiet," "braid of lines marks the old art," "not pardon, it is practice." Psychic distance shifts intentionally at the flute-playing beat when the valley "offers a corridor" and the twin-self appears, creating a productive ambiguity about whether this is literal or interior. No head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean. Minor issue: some figurative clusters in the final third ("hunger to patience," "slow braid tying hunger to patience") repeat the same vehicle, creating slight template cadence, but the effect remains voice-motivated and does not obscure the closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sentence openings are diverse; information density is high. Most lines do double or triple duty (e.g., "The floods had once thrown driftwood here, ghosts of trees polished into bone" gives history, image, and stakes). Clarity is strong throughout. Two distinct frictions lower the score: (1) paraphrase loop at lines 29–30 ("This is not pardon, it is practice" followed by "the craft of not breaking what wants to hold" restates without added pressure), and (2) a template-cadence run in the final block where several lines begin with similar syntactic stems ("I came," "I will cross," "I lay," "I keep"). These artifacts appear in non-closure beats and do not dull the ending image, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies: −0.8 total in Q7 only. No filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—a guardian using a musical instrument to weave between worlds after a professional failure—synthesizes familiar tropes (portal fantasy, redemption arc) into a specific, grounded ritual. The flute as suture rather than gate, and the twin-valley as a teaching rather than a confrontation, offer fresh angles. The decision to "arrange driftwood where the listening begins" and carry witness rather than banners transforms the arc from closure to opening. Emotional specificity (arranging markers from regret, playing to hear what tried to speak) avoids generic templates. Minor limitation: the "fallen guardians and tangled seam" backstory reads as a stock inciting incident, and the settlement of listeners introduced late feels like a convenience rather than an inevitable destination. Risk-taking in the lyric mode and the ambiguous loom-corridor elevates the score within band, but the core arc remains recognizable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The driven relic keeper's choices (arranging markers, playing the flute, deciding to cross toward the listeners) shape the arc. Present by line 4, drives the flute ritual at mid-story, and the final stance (witness, not claim) is causally earned. Two beats plus closure linkage. Cost is felt: relinquishing authority. Minor friction: the character is more observer than decider in some beats (e.g., watching the loom settle), which slightly limits agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Gilded reed flute introduced early (line 15), used actively in the flute-playing scene (three notes that open the loom-corridor), and returns in the penultimate beat where the protagonist oils its threads, tying memory and breath. Two distinct beats plus closure preparation. Causal pressure: the flute enables the twin-valley encounter and the decision to teach edges rather than stitch. Cost connection: the instrument embodies the old art and the new practice. Strong integration; just shy of indispensable because the loom-corridor could theoretically be accessed by another ritual.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Weaving between worlds shapes stakes (the protagonist once "sounded an alarm too late" at a seam) and tactics (playing "not to cross, but to hear"). Signaled by line 17 via the braid on the flute, enacted at the loom-corridor beat, and paid off in the final decision to "teach edges to share." The concept changes options: the protagonist moves from closing wounds to enabling breath. Cost is conceptual: giving up control. Closure linkage is strong. One friction: the concept is more thematic lens than mechanical constraint—removing it would shift tone but not break plot logic—so it trends high-7s rather than 8+.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Avalanchingly quiet appears in the opening (line 7) and returns twice (line 26 "turns avalanchingly quiet again, but kinder," line 42 "where echoes nest, letting canyon hush hold the world steady"). The attribute shapes perception and the tonal arc but does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost. It functions as lyric anchor and mood calibrator rather than mechanical lever. Two-gate presence (setup, closure reprise) with thematic reweighting qualifies it for mid-6s under the lyric-resonance allowance, but lack of middle development keeps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Uncase appears at line 15 (flute) and line 37 (flute again, oiling). The action enables the flute-playing ritual, which is the story's central escalation. Two beats. Causal pressure: uncasing the flute is the gateway to the loom-corridor and the twin-valley encounter. Minor friction: the action itself is procedural; the dramatic weight rests on what follows (playing, listening) rather than the uncasing per se. Swappability test: "lift" or "draw" could replace "uncase" with minor edits, lowering irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Arranging driftwood as directional markers is signaled at line 11 and enacted across lines 11–13. The markers return at line 33 ("Their arrows curve slightly now") to show the protagonist's shift from cave (failure site) to pass (listeners). Two beats. Development: the arrangement externalizes the protagonist's internal map. Payoff: the curved arrows confirm the decision to witness. Friction: the mechanics are more symbolic than constraining—the protagonist could have reached the same decision without physical markers. Lyric reprise with thematic reweighting places it in mid-5s, just shy of shaping a key choice.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Thunder-echo range is named in the opening and provides the gorges, dried river, and shale for the driftwood arrangement. The canyon's quiet charges the flute notes and the loom-corridor effect. Present throughout, but functions more as atmospheric container than tactical pressure. The setting enables the ritual but does not force a choice or narrow options at a key beat. Micro-setting (body, flute, driftwood) does more work than the macro-range. Two-gate presence (setup, ambient development) with tonal support places it in low-6s; lack of closure-beat constraint keeps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>After the guardianship is signaled in the opening lines and frames the protagonist's failure and new vows. The timeframe sets the emotional stake (processing failure) but does not tighten tactics or impose a deadline. Present as backstory anchor and thematic frame, but no middle beat where the time constraint alters a decision. Two gates (setup, thematic closure) without middle development caps it at ~3.4 under strict gating; however, the frame's contribution to the emotional arc and the decision to cross "tomorrow" adds modest lyric lift to mid-5s. Lacks causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>To harvest insights from failure is declared at line 6, dramatized in the driftwood arrangement and flute ritual (lines 11–31), and resolved in the final decision to "witness how the seam breathes" rather than claim it. Three beats. Causal pressure: the motivation drives every major choice. Cost connection: the protagonist must relinquish authority and accept judgment by non-guardians. Friction between wanting insight and fearing irrelevance is embodied in the twin-valley encounter. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff; just shy of indispensable because another motivation (e.g., seeking forgiveness) could fit the same arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Canyon hush is named in the opening and returns at line 42 ("canyon hush hold the world steady"). Tone modulates with pressure: the opening quiet is "crushing and complete," the mid-story quiet "turns avalanchingly quiet again, but kinder," and the ending quiet is stabilizing. The tone charges the final image and supports the thematic shift from self-punishment to witness. Three touches across the arc. Minor friction: the tone is more tonal anchor than mechanical constraint; it enriches but does not alter a choice. Strong coherence and closure linkage place it in low-7s.</comment>
