<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator's internal contradiction—rational method versus involuntary truth, distrust of magic versus desperate need—operates consistently under pressure. Embodied emotion appears in "words poured clear...edges rounded" and "I hated that the eye was a smuggled relic, likely stolen." The choice to bury the eye beneath the truffle bed is earned by prior causality and forecloses the contraband path with visible cost. Minor deduction: the virus constraint is stated more than dramatized in early beats, and the group members (Mara, Jiro, Fen) remain functional but thinly sketched.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors by ~100 words (ravine, orchard, truffle foraging post-virus). Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered particulars (smuggled eye, circle meetings, mycelium as metaphor) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration. Closure: burying the eye and continuing the circle "with fractured grace" is Earned Stasis with visible cost (loss of the relic, acceptance of fragility). One meaningful deepening when the narrator realizes "the circle should not depend on contraband" and acts on it. Cost is legible: the eye is gone, the support structure remains precarious, yet the practice persists.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The hanging orchard, ravine storms, and mycelium threading constrain choices—foraging location shapes the circle's safety metaphor, the eye's burial among roots charges the ending. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "leaves slick with brine," "orchard hummed with runoff and swallows." The glass eye's "stormgreen spiral, flecked with mica" is concrete and purposeful. Spatial choreography (kneeling with trowel, eye on branch, then beneath truffle bed) tracks cleanly. Minor gap: the iron cables and cliff faces are mentioned but do not constrain a choice or return at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: cultivate psychological safety under involuntary truth. One meaningful tightening when the courier demands the relic back, forcing the narrator to choose between contraband aid and self-reliant practice—the choice to bury the eye narrows options and commits to the fragile circle. Cost is visible: the tool is lost, the group must proceed unaided. Escalation fits the Accumulative lens: pressure deepens through the circle's confessions, the eye's ambiguous efficacy, and the narrator's realization. Agency is clear in the final act of burying the relic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme—trust and honesty under compulsion, the limits of magical thinking versus method—emerges from particulars: the virus, the smuggled eye, the circle's faltering confessions, the mycelium studying what we cannot. The final image of the buried eye and the persisting circle offers a resonant, non-literal answer: safety is practice, not object. No overt moralizing. The truffle/mycelium motif recurs meaningfully, threading connection underground. Minor slip: "fractured grace like cables after weather" in the closing line leans slightly abstract, though the image is purposeful.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: the narrator filters everything through rational foraging idiom ("methodical about spores and seasons," "logged outcomes like rainfall"). POV distance is stable; first-person interiority remains controlled. Diction is consistent and voice-motivated: "orchard hung from iron lines stapled into cliff faces," "rumor said the eye could occlude what hurts." Dialogue is minimal but purposeful (Mara, Jiro, Fen speak briefly; their confessions advance the circle's test). Rhythmic control under pressure holds through the climax. No head-hopping or filter stacks that dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies purposefully: longer braided clauses in exposition, shorter beats at the burial decision. Minor loop: "rational" recurs five times across the piece without reweighting each use. A handful of filter verbs ("planned," "studied," "hated") are voice-motivated but cluster in the first half. One scaffold instance: "I am a rational truffle forager, methodical about spores and seasons, suspicious of charms" reads slightly list-like. No major opacity or propulsion stalls; the closure beat is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—post-viral involuntary truth, foraging metaphor for emotional work, smuggled relic as temporary aid, mycelium as collaborative intelligence—feels specific and earned. The choice to bury the eye rather than keep or return it is a non-obvious moral calculus. Voice and world cohere; the ravine orchard and truffle work anchor theme in lived detail. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and the quiet burial ending heightens stakes without gimmickry. Proximity check clean; no close echoes of famous scenes. Minor note: the "empathy virus" frame is lightly sketched and could be deepened for higher originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The forager's rational stance shapes the eye trial, the circle design, and the burial decision. Present early; drives two beats (studying the eye, burying it) and informs closure. The occupation constrains choices (foraging site = circle site; mycelium metaphor). Swappability test: another methodical role could work with edits, but the truffle/root/underground imagery is tightly woven. Cost tied to the role: continuing to forage "rational as rainfall" after the emotional cost is specific.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The glass eye appears in setup (smuggled arrival), middle (trial with the circle), and closure (buried beneath truffle bed). It enables the circle's first attempts and its burial charges the ending with loss and self-reliance. Handled on the page: placed on branch, watched, set in center, then interred. Irreplaceability: the stormgreen spiral and merciful occlusion mechanics are specific. Cost: losing it forecloses the contraband path. Just shy of indispensable—another relic could substitute with moderate rewriting.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Smuggled status shapes stakes: the relic is contraband, the courier's return forces choice, and the narrator's decision to bury rather than return or keep hinges on its illicit nature. Present in setup (arrival), complicates middle (risk of dependence), and drives closure (burial to free the circle). Swappability: "forbidden" or "borrowed" could work with edits, but "smuggled" conveys the precarity and moral debt that charge the choice. Cost tied on-page: giving up the aid and accepting fragile self-reliance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Involuntary truth is the premise-driver: it creates the need for psychological safety and the circle's purpose. Mentioned early and frames all confessions. Constraint appears in "the virus wired me to be involuntarily truthful, so even my caution bared itself" and again in "the virus still compelled our tongues." Cost: the inability to lie is the wound the whole practice addresses. Development beat: the circle's confessions show the trait in action (Mara, Jiro, Fen speak truths they cannot withhold). Cap: mostly told rather than dramatized in a pivotal choice on the page; the narrator's own truth-compulsion does not visibly narrow a key option in the climax.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Occlude" governs the eye's function ("occlude what hurts, filtering speech through a veil of merciful imprecision") and the narrator's interpretive frame ("the earth would occlude its shine"). Present in setup (rumor), middle (the eye's trial softening words), and thematic return at closure (burial as occlusion). The action shapes tactics: using the eye to moderate confession's glare. Swappability: "soften," "veil," "filter" could substitute with minor edits; the verb is apt but not mechanically unique. Cost connection: the decision to let earth occlude the relic is purposeful but slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Discredited textbooks are mentioned once in setup ("I studied it through rumored cures in discredited textbooks") and again in the circle's design ("The textbooks had suggested this practice, in a footnote nobody cites"). The method signals the narrator's rational approach and lends credibility to the displaced-focus technique. Missing: no middle beat where consulting the texts alters a tactic, and the method does not appear in closure. Swappability high: "banned journals" or "forgotten manuals" would serve equally. Cost: not tied to a specific price on the page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ravine and hanging orchard shape every choice: foraging site becomes circle site, storms pressure the meetings ("storms raged above"), mycelium threads the trees and becomes the metaphor for connection, and the truffle bed is where the eye is buried. Present in setup, middle (circle gathers there), and closure (eye goes into roots). The setting's precarity—battered by storms, cables under strain—mirrors the group's fragile trust. Irreplaceability: the vertical, storm-battered, root-threaded space is specific and causal. Cost: working in a dangerous, unstable site is a persistent constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After the empathy virus" anchors time in setup and explains the involuntary truth condition. The timeframe recurs as background: "everyone does now when truth cannot be bargained," "the world had become." The virus aftermath shapes the stakes and world rules. Missing: no middle escalation where time since the virus tightens a choice, and the closure does not depend on how long post-virus the story is set. Swappability: "after the outbreak" or "since the change" could work with edits. Cost connection: implicit (living under virus effects) but not dramatized as a ticking clock or deadline.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Psychological safety is the dominant stake, dramatized on the page: "I kept working here to cultivate psychological safety," designing the circle, setting rules to create "breathing room for the honesty we could not stop." The desire drives the eye trial, the circle meetings, and the burial choice (freeing the group from contraband dependence to practice gentler speech unaided). Friction: the cost of needing a smuggled relic versus the risk of continued fragility. The closing line—"our circle holds with fractured grace"—shows the motive's partial success with visible cost. Slightly told in the opening but strongly enacted across beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Fractured grace is embodied throughout: "involuntarily truthful, so even my caution bared itself," confessions that "softened without breaking," "the circle held...with fractured grace like cables after weather." The tone modulates with pressure—methodical and wary in setup, tentatively hopeful in the circle trial, resigned yet persistent at closure. The final image crystallizes the tone: fragile, enduring, cracked but not collapsed. Coherence is strong; the tone charges the ending. Just shy of indispensable—another tonal phrase could work, but "fractured grace" is specific and purposeful.</comment>
