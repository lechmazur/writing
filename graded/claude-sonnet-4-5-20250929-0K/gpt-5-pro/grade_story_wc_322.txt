<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interior life is distinctly rendered through architecture-as-loneliness metaphors and the specific memory of telling her lover "math was kinder than people." The decision to step into the rigging herself and confront the phantom witness shows agency under pressure. However, the realization that "geometry never protected her" arrives as clean epiphany rather than through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final acceptance lacks a visible trade-off or foreclosed path with felt cost—she simply "asks whether love might also be provable," which reads as insight without consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when clearly within the first paragraph and maintains a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: patterns of connection accumulate through visitor vignettes until Mara herself enters the rigging and confronts her past. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—"something accepts her wish to begin again"—that reweights her loneliness-as-architecture premise. Cost is implied through the confrontation with the phantom lover-witness and her admission of fear, but the final image ("walking beside the stranger, their shoulders equal") feels more like permission than a path foreclosed. The lens holds, and the tightening is meaningful, though the cost could be more viscerally legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The optical illusion gallery is vividly specific—"suspended staircase that appears to descend and ascend simultaneously," "vanishing corners," "taut lines and hovering doors"—and the sinew thread as micro-setting constrains Mara's movements and charges the closure moment when she ties the final knot. The rigging "hums" and composes paths, actively shaping visitor and protagonist choices. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The environment is purpose-driven and integrated into action rather than ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Mara's wish to discover connection and forgive herself—is signaled early and tightens when she steps into the arena and the rigging "reads her" by summoning the phantom witness. The reversal (geometry failed to protect; love might require risk) is meaningful but arrives through realization rather than a decision that narrows options with visible cost. The visitor vignettes (woman at staircase, courier in vanishing corners) accumulate pressure, but the escalation is textural rather than causal. Under the Accumulative lens, one decisive intensification suffices; here it lands, though the price at closure remains oblique.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme—loneliness masked as rational design, connection as risk—emerges organically from Mara's memory of her lover and the gallery's function as a "quietly precise machine for letting attention cross the gap between lives." The final question ("whether love might also be provable if tested with attention and risk") reweights prior material without overt moralizing. The "curve that offers approach without impact" is a resonant image. However, the phrase "rational enchantment" is stated rather than fully dramatized, and the ending leans toward thematic assertion ("something accepts her wish") instead of letting the image alone carry weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The voice is distinct and controlled: "fog that listens," "arithmetic songs to pigeons," "math was kinder than people." POV remains stable in close third, with perceptual signature filtered through architectural metaphors. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tighter during the memory, wider during visitor vignettes. The phrase "realistically imaginary" is used as an in-world term rather than head-hopping. One slip: "erupts" in "whispers erupt" is explained parenthetically ("the word means both burst and emerge"), which breaks voice for meta-commentary. Otherwise, rhythm and diction remain consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—"rooms that argued gently," "harmonics traced the shape of a brother," "frost composing itself"—and while most images are coherent, they cluster heavily in every beat without pattern-teaching or payoff differentiation. "Realistically imaginary, articulate and obedient to their own strangeness" stacks modifiers without clarity gain. The parenthetical gloss on "erupt" is scaffolding. Several sentence stems repeat: "She [verb]…," "The [noun] [verb]…" across adjacent lines. Information density is high, but the opacity in peak beats (the phantom witness exchange) slightly obscures causality. No paraphrase loops, but the figurative saturation in the final third dulls propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—an architect returns to her empathy-machine gallery to confront her own loneliness—is a thoughtful synthesis of metaphor and plot. The sinew thread, visitor vignettes, and rigging-as-oracle are specific and non-generic. However, the "art installation reveals character's hidden wound" template is familiar, and the transformation hinges on a phantom witness device that arrives late and resolves the problem it did not create. The emotional specificity (math vs. people, silence "like a chair") elevates the execution, but the core arc does not surprise in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout, makes the choice to enter the rigging herself, and ties the final knot that awakens the central installation. Her decision to admit "geometry never protected her" and ask "whether love might also be provable" drives the thematic turn. However, much of the middle is observational (watching visitors) rather than decision-driven. She appears early, shapes two key beats (threading the sinew, entering the arena), and participates in closure, satisfying the gate model. The choices alter her stance but do not narrow tactical options with visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sinew thread appears in beat one ("coil of sinew thread, tacky with resin"), is actively used in beat two ("she strung the sinew thread through the first exhibit"), and returns in the climax ("threads the sinew through a final ring," "ties one final knot"). Its material properties (tacky resin, theatrical scraps) are specific, and threading it awakens the installation. The object enables the central action and charges the closure moment. It does not constrain a choice with visible trade-off, but its recurring use and causal role (rigging activation) push it into the mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Rational enchantment" is named twice and glossed as "persuades without lying, revealing logic as a ladder into tenderness." It frames the gallery's method and Mara's stance, shaping her curating philosophy. The concept constrains her approach (no direction, only accompaniment by intention) and appears in the middle beat. However, it is more theme than tactic—it does not alter on-page options or force a trade-off. It primes the final question about love and proof, giving it conceptual weight, but does not drive a key turn with cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Realistically imaginary" is used as an in-world descriptor for the gallery's effects and applied to the phantom witness ("a realistically imaginary witness patterned from the same measurements"). It appears late (final third) and serves as characterization rather than constraint. The attribute does not enable or block an action with visible cost; it is a label for the gallery's aesthetic. Present in closure framing but ornamental, not causal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Erupt" appears once in the climax: "she knots the sinew thread to the central ring and whispers erupt." The word is immediately glossed parenthetically ("knowing the word means both burst and emerge"), which undercuts its dramatization. The action marks the rigging's activation and the arrival of the phantom witness, a meaningful turn. However, it is singular, late, and could be replaced with "release," "ignite," or similar without structural loss. It contributes to one major beat but is not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Weaving patterns" is signaled early ("she would lace it through the exhibits by weaving patterns that adjust sight lines") and demonstrated in two beats: threading the sinew through the first exhibit, then through the final ring. The method shapes the rigging's mechanics and the visitor interactions. However, the weaving itself is described rather than shown constraining Mara's physical choices or forcing trade-offs. It is present, functional, and involved in closure preparation, but the mechanics do not pressure the protagonist directly—it is an enacted method without cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The optical illusion gallery is introduced in line one, supplies all spatial action, and its mechanics (perspective tricks, vanishing corners, suspended staircase, rigging) directly enable the plot. The environment constrains visitor movement and choreographs the central confrontation. The rigging "reads" Mara and composes a path that leads her to the phantom witness, a causal intervention. The setting is indispensable: remove it, and the story's logic collapses. It participates in setup, development, and closure with high specificity and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"As memories alter in the minds of strangers" appears once in the middle as a transitional phrase framing the visitor vignettes. Time is not tracked as a live constraint—no clock, no ticking urgency. The phrase gestures toward thematic resonance (memory and forgiveness) but does not tighten decisions or escalate pressure. It is ornamental rather than tactical, and its absence would not break the arc. Present in development as atmosphere, not as a force that shapes moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The desire "to discover the texture of connection" is stated in line two and dramatized through Mara's curation stance, her memory of the lover, and her final entry into the rigging. The motivation drives her return to the gallery and her willingness to confront the phantom witness. Friction emerges between her defensive use of geometry and her unnamed wish for connection. The motivation is present early, tested in the middle (visitor vignettes as externalized rehearsal), and rewarded/complicated at closure when "something accepts her wish to begin again." Cost is implied but not sharply legible—no visible trade-off forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Unsettling calm" is established in line three ("The evening carried an unsettling calm, like fog that listens") and maintained through diction: "gentle instructions," "smallest bow," "quietly precise machine." The tone modulates slightly when Mara's private ache surfaces and intensifies at the phantom witness exchange, then softens in the final image ("their pace an agreed equation"). It is coherent and purposeful, charging the ending without static repetition. The tone does not constrain a choice, but it reweights the closure image and permeates the narrative voice throughout.</comment>
