<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ilya's interiority is specific and embodied—"breath thin as the mountain air," tracing metal with purpose—but his arc from arrival to reading lacks a visible internal contradiction acting in scene. The final recitation feels like permission granted rather than a choice that forecloses a path with felt cost. Mara's introduction adds pressure, yet her function remains largely expository, and the relationship doesn't evolve under stress. The piece offers atmospheric contemplation over dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The storm, timer, and Mara's folder accumulate pressure toward the final reading, which functions as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the words "find their map, crossing out the crossings-out." Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the second paragraph. The cost is conceptual (defiance of censorship) but remains more asserted than dramatized on the page; the final image resonates thematically without a sharp before/after in Ilya's situation or options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory is vividly rendered with sensory specificity: "tin taste of beginnings," "dome rattled like a throat clearing for confession." The setting pressures choices—Ilya climbs until "trees stopped," and the storm's rhythm becomes a metronome for the reading. The darkroom timer and old instruments anchor micro-setting that charges the closure. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: understanding the cartography of scars (poetic defiance of censorship). The storm and Mara's arrival deepen the vigil, and the final recitation narrows options by making the hidden public. However, the escalation is textural rather than conflict-driven; no live resistance tests Ilya's commitment, and the cost of speaking remains conceptual rather than materially dramatized. One meaningful accumulation under the Accumulative lens, but the final act feels permission-granted rather than a trade-off with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (defiance, the cartography of scars) emerges through storm imagery, the timer, and photographic plates scarred by lightning. The final image—"words found their map, crossing out the crossings-out"—reweights prior material without stating a moral. Subtext operates in gesture and silence. However, lines like "each line a coordinate inscribed over an invisible wound" edge toward overt articulation, and the thematic echo of "cartography of scars" risks labeling what the imagery already conveys.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited on Ilya. Perceptual signature is strong: "rarefy around his ribs," "air seemed to thin." Dialogue (Mara's) feels purposeful and advances plot, though her lexicon ("curator of broken things," "masks slip") occasionally lifts into thematic register. Diction remains mostly controlled, but phrases like "furiously tranquil" and "storm-kissed wonder" read as imposed descriptors rather than Ilya's internal idiom under stress. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high, but figurative language saturates nearly every sentence without taught pattern: "clouds began, and the world seemed to rarefy," "bright with electric threads," "loops and slashes mapping a geography of refusal." Mixed metaphors: "thunder rose and fell as if the mountain were breathing" later becomes "thunder breathed in"—coherent but dense. Template cadence in the Mara dialogue sequence ("She introduced… she said… she added… she laid") and paraphrase loops ("rarefy" used twice in close proximity) reduce propulsion. Apply −0.6 for density + template stems.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The storm-observatory frame and censored-poet premise are familiar, but the darkroom timer as metronome and the photographic plates scarred by lightning offer fresh inflection. Emotional specificity (tracing dents, imagining astronomers as midwives) anchors the voice. However, the "cartography of scars" conceit and storm-as-truth metaphor lean on established symbolic templates without a sharp synthesis. The final reading feels thematically resonant but structurally unsurprising.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Ilya is present throughout and frames the vigil, but his choices are reactive: he climbs, sets the timer, waits, and reads when Mara validates him. The final recitation is a key turn, but it is enabled by Mara's arrival rather than driven by internal conflict. Early signal strong; beat involvement (arrival, vigil, reading) across three moments; closure linkage clear. Causal pressure is moderate—his agency is more interpretive than transformative.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The darkroom timer is handled in multiple beats: Ilya sets it, winds the spring, Mara explains its historical use, and it is set again for the final reading. Its mechanics (ticking, minute, bell) shape the vigil's rhythm and charge the closure. Early signal, development (historical context), and payoff (metronome for the reading) all present. The timer is specific and irreplaceable, though its role is more symbolic than causally constraining.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"A vigil in pause" shapes the middle section: Ilya waits, the storm accumulates, and the timer measures anticipation. The concept is embodied in the waiting and the phrase "a breath held between syllables." It alters tactics (stillness before action) and charges the closure (the pause resolves into speech). However, the vigil itself does not face a test or cost that could have broken it; the concept is more atmospheric than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Furiously tranquil" appears twice: first describing the timer's "mechanical heartbeat," then the wind after thunder. The phrase is vivid but functions as a descriptive label rather than constraining a choice. It does not enable or prevent an action with cost. The contradiction (fury and tranquility) is asserted in diction without being dramatized in a trade-off or decision.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Rarefy" appears early ("the world seemed to rarefy around his ribs") and again ("with each click the air seemed to thin, to rarefy further"). It describes the thinning air and the intensifying focus. The action shapes the vigil's accumulation and charges the final clarity ("thought became a clear bell"). However, it is more a perceptual process than a major turn; swapping it for "clarify" or "distill" would not break the arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The sealed envelope wedged in a bus timetable is the method of summoning. It appears early (Ilya receives it) and Mara reveals she sent it near the end. The method's mechanics matter (quiet conspiracy, diesel and rain smell), and it signals the clandestine nature of the vigil. However, it does not shape middle choices or constrain attempts; it is a setup device that enables the encounter but does not participate in escalation or closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory above clouds is present throughout and pressures every choice: the climb, the isolation, the storm as rhythm, the catwalk exposure. The setting supplies resources (old instruments, darkroom history) and charges the final reading ("he read to the lightning, to the town"). Early signal, development (the vigil inside, the catwalk opening), and payoff (the reading's audience includes the storm and valley). The observatory is indispensable to the story's logic and tone.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"When masks slip" appears in the arrival and Mara's explanation ("tonight is when masks slip, because storms borrow the face of truth"). The timeframe is thematic rather than a live clock—it does not tighten decisions or create urgency. The storm's rhythm (thunder breathing in) provides a trigger for the final act, but the phrase itself is more symbolic than tactical. Present at setup and payoff, but does not constrain middle choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>"To understand the cartography of scars" is Ilya's stated purpose, repeated in narration and reflected in his actions (tracing instruments, thinking of crossed-out lines). It shapes the vigil and frames the final reading. However, it is told and asserted rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or costs. The motivation is consistent but lacks friction—no competing desire or fear tests his commitment. Setup strong, closure linkage clear, but causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Storm-kissed wonder" is coherent throughout: vivid storm imagery, awe at the setting, and the tin taste of beginnings. Tone modulates with pressure (the vigil's stillness, the catwalk's exposure, the reading's release) and charges the final image ("the hush of ink drying on sky"). The tone is consistent and purposeful, though the register occasionally lifts into imposed lyricism ("furiously tranquil," "rarefy") that feels authorial rather than organically character-filtered.</comment>
