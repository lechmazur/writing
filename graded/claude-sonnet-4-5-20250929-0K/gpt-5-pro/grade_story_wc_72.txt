<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The telepathic statue protagonist has a distinct perceptual signature—thoughts traveling through cracks, gentle incisive kindness—but agency remains largely observational. The piece provides embodied perception (tide hears me think like a choir of rust, memory shaped like ocean light on knuckles) and the narrator facilitates communication, yet the final welcoming of nuance lacks a visible cost or forfeiture on the page. Internal contradiction is absent; the narrator flows smoothly from revelation to revelation without genuine friction or a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens inferred as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through cascading revelations and image layering. Orientation is delayed—who/where/when coalesces slowly across the first third—but the underwater garden setting and telepathic statue POV become legible without breaking comprehension (waiving the Orientation Test penalty). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration: the city softens, nuance walks in, the garden welcomes. However, the cost remains abstract; no specific forfeiture or visible price is pointed to in the final image. The lens holds, but closure lacks the sharp felt cost required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The underwater garden is vivid and purposeful: glassy ferns, statues that blink in currents, foxglove ampoule in bronze ivy, cracks as flutes. Setting constrains action—the narrator threads thoughts through structural weaknesses, the quake tips the plaza and releases the ampoule. Spatial choreography is coherent (colonnade, amphora, vault, chamber, plaza ceiling). The micro-setting (cracks, ampoule, bishop's palm) charges the final image when the city hums and the door unlatches, meeting the 9+ gate for environment constraining choice and shaping closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to welcome nuance into certainty, signaled early and threaded throughout. Escalation under Accumulative lens reads as density increase—revelations cascade, the ampoule passes through the city, statues soften—but no single tightening forces a trade-off or narrows options with visible cost. The protagonist facilitates rather than struggles; the bishop releases the ampoule without friction. Agency is present (threading thoughts, asking, praising) but the final reconfiguration arrives as atmospheric shift rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Pressure coheres but does not force a crystallized stance with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—rigidity vs. nuance, misread certainty, structural weakness as conduit—emerges from image and action (city vowed never to doubt, misread as no surrendering doubt; cracks become channels for empathy). The ampoule of foxglove/poison-prayer and the closing image of strength threaded through weakness offer non-literal answers without moralizing. However, the final paragraph's "threading strength through structural weakness until it sang" borders on thematic summary. The piece resists tidy binaries and invites reflection, but the closing lines veer toward assertion rather than earning resonance through a final concrete particular.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single POV (first-person statue) with stable focalization and a highly distinctive voice: "incisively kind," "animate lifeless," "tide hears me think like a choir of rust." Diction is purposefully elevated and lyric, consistent with the narrator's nature. Psychic distance is controlled; the narrator knows only what telepathy and memory reveal. Perceptual signature is strong—noticing through cracks, touching inscriptions, threading thoughts. However, the prose occasionally drifts into abstraction ("nuance walked in, neither timid nor loud, but present") that flattens the lived texture. No head-hopping; voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short declaratives, longer accumulative runs), and figurative language is dense but largely coherent. However, near-paraphrase loops appear: "I threaded my message along the cracks...tugging it through fallen rooms" restates the same action; "We sent that thought outward, threading it along sluices" repeats the threading motif without added pressure. Overwriting is present in high-pressure beats ("revelations cascaded then, not as blows but as rain" followed immediately by "I became a conduit, animate lifeless no longer a contradiction but a method"). Stock constructions like "remember/remembered" recur across a dozen lines, creating template cadence. Apply −0.6 for loops and template cadence; the artifacts do not touch the closure beat directly but accumulate enough to lower momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The premise—telepathic statue in underwater city using structural weakness to thread empathy—offers fresh synthesis. The foxglove ampoule (poison as care) and misread vow (never surrender doubt → never doubting) provide non-obvious angles. However, the emotional arc (rigid certainty → welcoming nuance) follows a familiar template, and the resolution lacks a bold tradeoff or reversal. The piece transforms the setup through specificity (rust choir, kelp arguments, tin fish) but does not take the risk of leaving nuance unwelcome or making the statue's facilitation costly. Mid-band for distinctive voice and world logic, but the thematic payoff plays safe.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Living statue with telepathy: present from line one, drives beats (wakes statues, brushes ampoule, threads thoughts, praises tin fish, touches inscriptions), and appears in closure ("I spoke into the water...the water answered"). However, the narrator facilitates rather than decides under pressure; no choice forecloses a path with cost. Specificity is high (telepathy travels through cracks, tide hears thoughts), but agency is observational and enabling. Two gates met (setup, closure participation); development choices are gentle, not conflicted. Mid 5s for shaping beats without a costly turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Foxglove-stained glass ampoule: discovered in beat one (quake tips plaza), handled by narrator (telepathy brushes it, lends memory), passed to bishop, released to drift upward through ceiling crack, travels city as bead of medicine, softens statues and wakes citizens. Appears in at least four beats and charges closure (everywhere it passed, statues softened). Setup early, development through transfer and touch, payoff in final cascade. Causal pressure present (memory shapes understanding, release triggers city-wide softening). Irreplaceability high (foxglove as poison/prayer, glass as memory vessel). Strong integration; entering 7+ range.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Cascading revelations: core concept present in title phrase and structure. First revelation (digitalis misjudged dose), second (amphora scholar laughs at certainty as raft), third (tin fish confession), fourth (bishop's memory), final cascade (revelations as rain). Shapes stakes (understanding city's fall) and alters options (releasing ampoule). Setup implicit, development through beat sequence, closure participation (revelations cascade, not as blows but as rain). Two-plus beats; causal role in understanding and releasing. However, easily replaced with "accumulating insights" or "layered truths." Mid 6s for shaping beats but limited irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Incisively kind: label appears twice ("thinking gently, incisively kind" in beat one; "I praised it, incisively kind" when addressing tin fish). Trait constrains tone but does not enable or block an action with cost. No visible tradeoff where kindness forecloses a harsher, faster path. Swappable with "gently precise" or "careful compassion." Setup present, no middle constraint, closure participation absent. Late mentions (~40% and ~60% marks) prevent higher score. Ornamental use; functional but replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Thread (verb/action): appears in at least eight beats (threading intent along cracks, threading message through colonnade, threading feelings between anemones and masonry, threading through sluices, threading ampoule through city, threading through chamber, threading strength through weakness). Drives escalation (each threading extends reach), shapes tactics (using cracks as conduits), and charges closure ("threading strength through structural weakness until it sang"). Setup early, development across middle, payoff in final image. Causal pressure high; irreplaceability strong (removes "thread" and the method collapses). Entering 7+ for multiple beats and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Through structural weakness: method signaled in beat one (thoughts travel through structural weakness; fissure is a flute), used repeatedly (threading along cracks, sluices, bone ladders, chamber inscriptions, ceiling crack), and stated at closure ("threading strength through structural weakness until it sang"). Shapes attempts (narrator must find and use cracks) and enables tactics (every broken pediment became a question). Setup early, development constraints visible, closure participation strong. However, the mechanics remain metaphorical rather than dramatized with friction; no moment where a weakness fails or a crack closes. Mid-to-upper 6s for shaping beats and closure without costly constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Forgotten underwater city garden: present from beat one, setting for all action. Supplies resources (glassy ferns, statues, ampoule in bronze ivy, cracks, colonnade, vault, amphora, chamber, plaza, door). Pressures choices (quake tips plaza and releases ampoule, vault collapse opens avenue, door unlatches when city hums). Setup immediate, development through spatial moves, closure participation ("city garden...welcomed us like a room that remembers every voice"). Spatial choreography clear. Micro-setting (cracks, ampoule) alters tactics. Entering 7+ for shaping beats and charging final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>After revealing the secret: timeframe stated in opening line, frames all action. However, time does not tighten decisions or track urgency. The piece unfolds as reflective accumulation rather than live clock pressure. Setup present (opening), no middle tightening (events accrue without deadline), closure does not depend on elapsed time. Swappable with "during the awakening" or "in the aftermath." Functional but replaceable; the "after" anchor orients but does not constrain. Low 3s for setup without development or escalation through time.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>To welcome nuance into a certainty: stated explicitly in beat one ("I ask what nuance wants. It wants to welcome nuance into a certainty") and enacted throughout (releasing misread vow, threading empathy, unbraiding certainties). Shapes stakes (entire narrative arc) and final image ("nuance walked in...and the city garden...welcomed us"). However, the motivation is declared rather than dramatized through a conflicted choice. No moment where welcoming nuance costs the narrator a competing want. Setup early, development through facilitation, closure participation strong. Mid 6s for shaping arc without friction or felt cost tied to the desire itself.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Animate lifeless: tone/oxymoron present in opening beat ("I am the living statue") and developed through paradoxes (thinking statues, statues that blink, tin fish that wakes, bishop with listening shells, "animate lifeless no longer a contradiction but a method"). Modulates with pressure (gentle early, denser at cascade, calm at close). Charges final image ("animate lifeless...a method of breathing in stone"). Coherent through turns, supports theme (rigidity meeting nuance), and reweights the opening contradiction at closure. Setup immediate, development across beats, payoff strong. Irreplaceability high; tone is structural. Entering upper 7s for consistent modulation and closure charge.</comment>
