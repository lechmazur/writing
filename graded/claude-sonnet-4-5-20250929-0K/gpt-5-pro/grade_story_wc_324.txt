<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's perceptual signature is distinct (the hearing aid as sensory filter, curiosity driving attendance) and embodied choices shape the climax—sitting within arm's reach, sliding the photograph, calling witnesses into purpose. Eli's internal state is less developed; his voice-in-pulse receives label treatment ("debt he cannot pay") without contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final renunciation (pocketing the photograph, accepting the borrowed heart's counsel) feels earned by prior causality but lacks visible struggle at the hinge moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land clearly in the opening lines. The piece accumulates density through layered sensory cues (hearing aid pulses, rain-in-heartbeat, glass panel ticking) and tightens via the narrator's micro-choices (tuning the aid, calling witnesses, leading Eli away) that reweight Eli's options. Closure is Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid: Eli pockets the photograph and the borrowed heart "keeps its own steady counsel"—a crystallized moment where options are reconfigured and cost is felt (the debt renounced, the living answer chosen). One meaningful deepening is present; cost is legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium functions as micro-setting that constrains choices: fog obscures Eli, fountain breath and glass-panel tick signal danger, distance to doors and planters choreographs the escape. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (hearing aid pulses sharpen, spatial awareness narrows during exit). The body and the hearing aid operate as setting-equivalents that charge the final image (rain begins "in gentle syllables" mirroring the aid's drum). Spatial choreography remains clean across moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: protect Eli from self-harm and predatory actor. The narrator's agency drives escalation—tuning the aid, speaking assurance, staging witness presence—each narrowing Eli's exit options and the suit's opportunity window. The glass panel's fall delivers visible cost (empty benches, man departs) and alters the atrium's state. One meaningful tightening occurs when the narrator reframes the donor's heart ("she chose to share her heart with you, not her ending"), forecloses the debt narrative, and enables Eli's laugh. Price is legible: attendance paid with attention, incidental heroism without applause.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: listening as labor, borrowed rhythms, incidental heroism as "attendance paid with attention." The hearing aid and photograph constrain choices and return with reweighted meaning (aid hears warning, photo greets Eli's own face). Subtext operates in gesture (arm's length distance, photograph slide, rain drum) and the piece resists moralizing—"the dead are mostly tender, mostly tired of being misunderstood" offers complexity without thesis. The final image (Eli pockets the photograph, rain begins, borrowed heart keeps counsel) answers the thematic question non-literally: survival as continued breath, choice as reclaiming agency from perceived debt. No late symbolism; all motifs seed early and pay off at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinctive and controlled: "contact tracer for hearts," "reeling hush," "kindness of pretending it was their idea first." POV modesty holds (inference reads as inference: "I understand they are steering me"). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven—"she chose to share her heart with you, not her ending" pursues reassurance with subtext about agency. Distance modulates purposefully from lyric compression ("biology becomes memory") to direct address at peak pressure. Perceptual signature remains character-specific (curiosity, listening, tracking borrowed rhythms). Minor register elevation ("reeling hush," "incidental heroism") fits the narrator's idiom without jarring.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings diversify. Information density is high—most lines advance character, stakes, or sensory pressure. Two mild artifacts: "I tell him" / "I say" / "I assure him" stacks filter verbs in adjacent beats (mid-encounter with Eli) and "contact tracer for hearts" recurs as exact phrase twice without functional difference, a minor loop. No paraphrase cycles or template cadence runs. Figurative language ("cathedral of breath," "fear becomes gratitude") coheres and charges closure without overwriting. Propulsion remains strong; no scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis—contact tracer for hearts + hearing aid that hears borrowed rhythms + incidental heroism as witness-gathering—feels specific and non-obvious. The piece transforms the suicide-intervention template through particularized world logic (donor hearts carry pulse-memories, the atrium as liminal space where "the dead call") and avoids both melodrama and tidy rescue. The final image (rain, laughter, pocketed photograph, borrowed heart's counsel) reweights prior material with earned stasis. Risk: lyric compression and non-linear causality heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Fresh inflection: "attendance paid with attention" as heroism redefined.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: opens with role description. Development: narrator's choices (tune aid, slide photograph, call witnesses) constrain Eli's options and the predator's window across multiple beats. Closure: final paragraph restates the role and Eli's question confirms the narrator's method. Causal pressure: narrator's micro-choices drive the exit sequence. Specificity: role shapes perception (listening where biology becomes memory) and tactics (tracking pulses, staging witness presence). Swappability: low—generic counselor would not use the hearing aid or frame the donor's choice as shared heart versus shared ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setup: introduced in paragraph 7. Development: used twice—narrator slides it onto the bench so Eli's own face can greet him (reframes identity), then narrator references it again ("tap the photograph") to anchor the donor's choice versus ending distinction. Closure: Eli pockets it in the final paragraph, a visible choice that signals acceptance. Causal pressure: the photograph's greeting and the narrator's reframe narrow Eli's debt narrative. Irreplaceability: high—the image of Eli waving from a hospital bed with "a smile braver than he knew" particularizes the donor relationship and Eli's prior state. Cost: pocketing it forecloses the exit and accepts the borrowed heart's terms.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: implicit in opening mission. Development: stated explicitly late ("I did not come to prevent a fall, but sometimes incidental heroism is just attendance paid with attention") after the glass panel shatters. Closure: "incidental heroism" is not repeated, but the final image (Eli laughing, rain beginning, borrowed heart keeping counsel) enacts the concept—survival achieved through witness-gathering rather than direct intervention. Causal pressure: moderate—the concept describes the narrator's method (calling witnesses, giving purpose) but does not itself constrain a choice. The on-page action (staging presence) would work without the label. Cost: narrator forgoes badge/authority model for attendance, a tradeoff visible in method but not foregrounded as sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: stated in paragraph 4 ("I am persistently curious, which means trouble finds me"). Development: curiosity drives the narrator to follow the thread ("I follow a thread the old way") and tune the aid until the rhythm grows louder—one beat that enables the search. Closure: not present in the ending. Causal pressure: low—curiosity motivates the search but does not constrain a later choice or create visible cost. Swappability: moderate—"persistent" fits the role but "curious" could swap for "attentive" or "vigilant" without structural change. The trait is told more than dramatized through competing impulses.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 19 ("I assure him that listening and leaving are both forms of courage"). Development: the assurance reframes Eli's perceived debt and primes his willingness to move; it directly enables the later choice to stand and walk. Closure: Eli's laughter and the borrowed heart's counsel enact the assurance—listening (to the dead's call) and leaving (the atrium, the debt narrative) both occur. Causal pressure: high—without the assurance, Eli's hesitation might not break. Specificity: "listening and leaving are both forms of courage" is thematically precise and irreplaceable. Cost: Eli's laugh is "surprised to find laughter still willing to live inside him," a visible emotional shift.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 5–6 (narrator tracks faint pulses in grandmother's hearing aid; it hears "borrowed rhythms of the living"). Development: used in three beats—tuning the aid to find Eli, hearing rain-in-pulse when Eli looks up, raising the aid to hear the "sharp note of warning" before the glass panel ticks. Closure: the rain in the aid becomes a drum and the narrator understands "they are steering me as much as him"—the method shapes the final tactical choice (lead Eli toward doors). Causal pressure: high—the aid's signals enable discovery, diagnosis, and warning. Irreplaceability: very high—the decades-old hearing aid that hears borrowed rhythms is concept-specific and drives three key turns. Cost: dependence on the aid's signals constrains the narrator's options (must tune, must listen, must interpret).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Setup: opening line. Development: mist obscures Eli (narrator must tune aid), fountain takes breath with them (signals alive space), far bench and planters position the predator, far doors provide exit route, glass panel above supplies the warning-then-fall that clears the threat. Closure: the atrium "holds the silence well, a cathedral of breath where fear becomes gratitude"—the space is reweighted as sanctuary rather than liminal danger zone. Causal pressure: high—fog, distance, and panel constrain the search and escape. Irreplaceability: high—"mist-clad atrium at twilight" supports the dead-call timeframe and sensory method (hearing aid over sight). Twilight charges tone and timing.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup: opening line ("when the dead call"). Development: the timeframe recurs—"This is the hour when the dead call, and the living answer by continuing to breathe"—and the hearing aid's pulses (borrowed rhythms, rain-in-heartbeat) are presented as the dead calling throughout. Closure: the dead's call is reframed as "mostly tender, mostly tired of being misunderstood" and the borrowed heart "keeps its own steady counsel." The timeframe is thematic architecture more than a ticking clock. Causal pressure: moderate—the hour enables the narrator's method (tuning aid to hear the dead) but does not itself narrow Eli's decision window. The glass panel fall and predator's departure are circumstantial rather than time-driven. Swappability: low—"when the dead call" is concept-specific and charges tone, but a generic "crisis hour" could carry similar pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 3 ("to protect vulnerable voices, I listen where biology becomes memory"). Development: the motivation drives the narrator's choices across multiple beats—tuning the aid, sitting within arm's reach, assuring Eli, calling witnesses, leading the exit. Closure: restated in the penultimate paragraph ("I am a contact tracer for hearts, and my reason is simple: to protect vulnerable voices") and enacted in the final image—Eli's voice (laughter) is protected, the borrowed heart's voice (counsel) is honored. Friction: the narrator's want (protect) conflicts with the city's limits (no badge, only notebook and aid) and with Eli's initial resistance (hesitation). Cost: narrator forgoes direct intervention for witness-staging, a tactical constraint visible on the page. Irreplaceability: high—the phrasing "protect vulnerable voices" and "contact tracer for hearts" are thematically precise.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setup: opening line ("ours folds into a reeling hush when the dead call"). Development: tone modulates—lyric compression during search ("biology becomes memory"), direct urgency during encounter ("I say, and the name steadies the air"), quiet intensity during exit ("walk as if the floor were a sleeping animal"), relief at closure ("the whole city listens back"). Coherence: held across turns without static uniformity. Closure: "In that reeling hush, Eli pockets the photograph, and the borrowed heart keeps its own steady counsel"—the opening phrase returns, now charged with Eli's survival and the narrator's method, reweighting the hush from dread to sanctuary. The tone does not merely describe; it shapes perception (mist, breath, pulse) and charges the final image. Irreplaceability: very high—"reeling hush" is idiomatic and thematically load-bearing.</comment>
