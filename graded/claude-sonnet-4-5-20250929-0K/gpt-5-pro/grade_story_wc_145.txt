<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's perceptual signature is distinctive—reading condensation as map, trusting window-taught discovery—and the motives (finding the singular convergence) drive sustained curiosity and risk. Embodied sensation appears in kneeling, scraping, tasting, breathing on ice. The choice to mark coordinates and walk back reflects earned endurance rather than decisive change, fitting Earned Stasis; the cost is subtle (waiting in cold, betting the trip on a hunch) but legible. Minor deduction: interiority occasionally approaches stock poeticism ("atlas editor with a stovetop kettle and a suspicion the world has one hidden eye") without micro-choices under immediate pressure in those lines.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accrues through layered images (frost, condensation, falcon return, ice opening) that converge into a final Resonant Reconfiguration when the protagonist validates discovery and returns to the outpost. Orientation anchors who/where/when by ~80 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the ice pupil exhales and the protagonist tastes the water, reweighting the entire expedition's stake. Cost is present—"cold edits our bones," the bargain with stillness, the isolation—but somewhat oblique and atmospheric rather than a stark forfeiture. The two-shard structure (outpost → ice → outpost) holds within one contiguous window with clear transitions, meeting Track B tolerance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setting constrains choice throughout: the falcon's return triggers departure, ice stability dictates movement, condensation on glass teaches the map, frost etching guides the scrape site. The outpost and frozen lake frame the expedition with rust, cold, and tranquility that "worries." Micro-setting details—stovetop kettle steam, wind-carved sastrugi, the radio mast—pressure the protagonist's method and tactics. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (kneeling to scrape, tasting the drop, listening to subglacial thud). The final image of the warm kettle and canteen by the window charges the ending with proof against folklore.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding the singular convergence where rivers begin) is signaled in paragraph five and sustained. One meaningful tightening: waiting for the falcon, crossing ice, scraping to find the throat, tasting confirmation—each narrows options and raises exposure. Agency is attention and endurance; the protagonist bets the trip on a hunch, honors the bargain with stillness, and marks coordinates despite knowing "no one will believe yet." Cost is legible: physical cold, isolation, the risk of the ice not cracking (which is "its own kind of threat"), and the social cost of producing a map "true before it is familiar." Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres and the final return to the outpost crystallizes the discovery with visible constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: sources whisper more than mouths, maps mishear, cartography trusts how water thinks about distance. The glass-born map (condensation as isobaric prayer) and the final image of the canteen by the window offer a resonant answer to the central question without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the falcon as punctuation, the ice's threat-by-silence, the "worrying tranquility" that holds a promise too perfectly. The protagonist's recognition that "no one will forgive the map for being true before it is familiar" reweights the discovery with conceptual and social cost. The dog-ear as "small white sail for a voyage no one else will believe yet" charges the ending without sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature throughout: "dry-witted," reading condensation as prayer, framing the falcon as punctuation, imagining the atlas page from a singular pupil outward. POV distance is stable (close third); diction is controlled, specific, and voice-motivated ("the door complains at being used, then falls quiet, as if embarrassed"). Purposeful compression and patterned syntax ("Sources whisper more than mouths do, and maps mishear them") are taught early and serve lyric accumulation. Rhythm modulates with intensity—short declaratives at the crossing, longer reflection at discovery. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats. The prose reflects the mind of a cartographer under cold and wonder without register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every line advances character, atmosphere, or the central search. Rhythm varies naturally (short declarations, longer lyric runs), and sentence openings shift. Minimal loops; occasional near-paraphrase ("the tranquility of it worries me" / "It is a worrying tranquility") but spaced and voice-motivated. Figurative language is concentrated and consistent with POV ("isobaric prayer," "antlers," "throat where pressures meet"). One minor scaffold moment: "I tell the falcon, who answers by clacking its beak at the world as if taking dictation" feels slightly self-conscious. Proofreading is clean. Propulsion remains steady without sluggishness; the accretion supports the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—atlas editor seeking river origins under ice via condensation-pattern navigation, guided by a falcon's return—feels specific and non-obvious. The inversion (mapping from source rather than mouth) and method (window-taught discovery) transform familiar quest material. Risk-taking in lyric accumulation and quiet ending heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The falcon as editor of air, the ice pupil exhaling "granite, fern memory, and long syntax," and the final image of the kettle waiting all feel earned in hindsight. Proximity to certain poetic nature-quest idioms slightly tempers the freshness, but the cartographic lens and worrying-tranquility tone provide a memorable angle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dry-witted atlas editor is present from the opening and shapes key turns: choosing to wait for the falcon, reading the glass map, scraping the ice, tasting the water, marking coordinates, and deciding to send proofs when the radio thaws. Decisions alter tactics (honoring the bargain with stillness, rotating the compass, breathing on the ice) and the final choice to let the tranquility hold "for a moment before the world wakes and argues" crystallizes stance with visible cost. The trait of being an editor who chases sources rather than estuaries is causally active and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The polyglot's phrasebook dog-ear appears in three beats: carried in pocket with penciled coordinates and joke, marked again after confirming the convergence, and folded "once more, a small white sail" before the return. It evolves from preparation to proof-vessel. The reprise charges the ending ("a voyage no one else will believe yet"), but the object's specific properties (dog-ear from 'spring' chapter, triangle corner) do not constrain tactics beyond being a writing surface. Functional and meaningful but not indispensable; a notebook would serve similarly with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The singular convergence is the story's spine: stated as motive, pursued through the glass-pattern method, discovered as "a throat where pressures from far basins meet," and validated in the final image when condensation "draws routes fanning outward from the throat." It redefines cartographic logic (rivers from a single pupil outward) and shapes every tactic (scraping where frost and compass converge, lowering the canteen, breathing on the ice). The conceptual cost—producing a map true before familiar—is undeniable. Remove this concept and the story collapses.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Subtly confident appears in the protagonist's willingness to "laugh at my own hunch and still bet the trip on it," in the quiet authority of reading condensation as map, and in the understated declaration "This is where the rivers begin." The trait constrains choice (waiting for the falcon, trusting the glass geometry, marking coordinates without external validation) and charges the ending's stance: letting the tranquility hold despite knowing the world will argue. Cost is visible in isolation and professional risk. Present in setup, middle, and closure, but the trait itself is somewhat diffuse; a more overtly cautious or brash character would change tone but not necessarily key actions.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The falcon's return (herald action) triggers departure, punctuates the crossing ("hops ahead like a punctuation mark"), witnesses the discovery ("clacking its beak at the world as if taking dictation"), and bookends the structure by settling at the end. The action is signaled early as a bargain condition, shapes the timeline, and participates in closure (the falcon "satisfied with a paragraph finally correctly punctuated"). Remove the herald and the protagonist's waiting loses its anchor, the departure its catalyst, and the ending its editorial metaphor. Indispensable to the story's pressure and rhythm.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The pattern of condensation on glass is method, oracle, and proof: the protagonist lets steam bloom the window, reads "isobaric prayer," traces veins, rotates compass to match geometry, then breathes on the ice opening to draw new routes. The method is signaled early (kettle, window), constrains middle choices (scraping where glass-map and compass agree), and charges the ending (canteen condensation "approves our discovery"). The mechanics—fogged pane as rumor, each filament a river rehearsing—are irreplaceable. Without this exact method, the discovery loses its ground and the cartographic logic breaks.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rusted outpost by the frozen lake frames the story, supplies the kettle and radio mast, and anchors the protagonist's waiting and return. The lake's frozen expanse permits the crossing; the outpost's door "complains at being used"; the warm kettle at the end "knew to wait." Setting pressures choice (waiting until the falcon lands, leaving into cold, returning before freezing) and charges the final image (canteen by window, condensation approving). The rust and cold are not merely postcard but constrain resources and heighten stakes. Remove this exact setting and the isolation, cold-edits-bones cost, and kettle-as-proof moment weaken.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the falcon returns" is a live condition established early and honored at the midpoint departure: "We leave after the falcon returns, because that was the bargain I made with the stillness." It tightens the protagonist's waiting, structures the expedition into before/during/after the falcon's arrival, and participates in closure (the falcon settling, the kettle still warm, the moment held "before the world wakes"). The clock is not second-by-second urgent but coherent and causal; the bargain with stillness adds conceptual cost. Swapping for a different trigger (e.g., "after the wind shifts") would alter tone but the structural role could transfer with edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The motivation to find where rivers begin is stated in paragraph five, dramatized through every beat (waiting, crossing, reading glass, scraping, tasting, marking), and validated in the ending when the protagonist tells the falcon "This is where the rivers begin." The desire conflicts with editorial preference for "tidy estuaries" and faces the cost of isolation, cold, and professional skepticism ("no one will believe yet"). The friction between the hunch and the risk of being wrong pressures the protagonist's subtly confident stance. Remove this exact motivation and the expedition loses its conceptual spine; the cartographic inversion is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Worrying tranquility is established in the third line ("The wind does not snarl, which worries me more than if it did"), sustained through "the tranquility of it worries me like a lullaby sung by a stranger," "the quiet that worries because it keeps its promise so perfectly," and charged in the final line: "It is a worrying tranquility, yes, but I will let it hold for a moment before the world wakes and argues." Tone modulates with pressure (waiting, crossing, discovery, return) and coheres into the ending's Charged Poise. The paradox (tranquility as threat) is irreplaceable and reweights the discovery's cost. Remove this tone and the story's tension collapses into pastoral or thriller without the singular synthesis.</comment>
