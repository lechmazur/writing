<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interior voice is distinct and sustained—"esoteric realist" philosophy and embodied attention to wind, weight, and signal-building anchor the POV. Emotional texture is present in the moth-wing handling and grandmother seed-sack memory, though these reflections remain more lyric than contradictory. The final choice to leave the knot and descend feels consistent but lacks internal friction; the protagonist's stance never wavers or faces a dilemma that would test competing impulses on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clear by the opening: narrator at grotto, dawn, monarch migration. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through layered images (moth wing, frames, butterfly arrival, knot-tying) and the closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise when the monarch departs and the narrator collapses the frames, reweighting the signal's meaning without a decisive external event. Cost is conceptual and felt: the transience of the structure and the acknowledgment that "signals live only long enough to be believed." One meaningful deepening occurs when the monarch reads the frames and the narrator tilts the triangle to guide him east, crystallizing the purpose of the labor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The grotto above clouds is anchored early with moss, cliff eddies, verdant exhalation, and spatial choreography (lip, apex, cardinal axes). The reeds, twine, and glass vial are handled tactilely across multiple beats, and the environment constrains the narrator's choices: wind direction shapes frame alignment, the broken circle's lip becomes a perch, the tilted triangle spills current eastward. The final knot left on a root charges the setting's role as archive and signal-point, meeting the 9+ gate for micro-setting that alters tactics and the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—honoring overlooked histories through signal-building—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure deepens when the monarch arrives and the narrator must steady the triangle, tilt it to guide, and accept the butterfly's departure without capture or command. One meaningful tightening: the narrator's micro-choice to tilt the triangle forecloses passive observation and enacts accompaniment, narrowing options with a visible relational cost (the risk that guidance could become coercion). The cost is legible but emotional rather than material; no secondary pressure tests the commitment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—honoring the overlooked, the grammar of absence, transient witness—emerges organically from the moth wing, grandmother's seed-sack literacy, and the frames' music of absence. The final image (knot on root, promise to keep building, wind as memory) offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing: signals are not monuments, and accompaniment suffices. Subtext operates consistently in the moth-as-ledger and the broken circle's acknowledgment of wound. The piece resists resolution into a tidy moral and the conceptual repricing is earned by prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is singular and sustained: diction ("blushing stillness," "grammar of winds," "petal burning") is purposeful, poetic, and character-particular. POV is stable first-person; psychic distance remains intimate throughout. Perceptual signature is strong—attention to wind, wing-beats, cardinal axes, and the distinction between capture and accompaniment. Some figurative density in high-pressure beats ("flame ceding itself to distance," "clouds swam below like slow fish") risks ornamentation, but the patterns are taught early and the final lines remain clear. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and sonic modulation. Information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, stake, or motif. Minor paraphrase loops appear: "I did not reach...I only steadied" / "I only wanted him to know" cluster in the monarch sequence, and "transiently rooted" is repeated verbatim twice without added pressure. Figurative language is dense ("sky felt like a library closing," "wingbeat, then the missing answer") but mostly coherent. No major clarity breaks, though the final third could tighten two lines of summary ("signals are not monuments") that restate prior showing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—temporary signal-building as grief practice, moth wing as nocturnal counterpart to monarch, grandmother's seed-sack literacy seeding the narrator's hand-song—feels specific and non-obvious. The framing avoids stock eco-elegy beats by centering micro-action (knot, tilt, collapse) over declaration. Risk is present in the lyric density and the refusal of rescue-arc satisfaction, but the core situation (solitary witness to last-of-species) is a widely used template. Transformation comes through lived detail (reeds lashed by patience, twine thrummed, moth feet like commas) and the commitment to accompaniment over capture.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "esoteric realist" label appears in paragraph three and grounds the narrator's attention to "grammar of winds" and "honesty of weight," shaping the decision to build frames that the air can read. The philosophy enables the signal-building method and the refusal to "make a god of guidance" at the monarch's arrival. Present in setup and middle choice (steadying triangle, tilting for guidance), and implicit in the closure promise to keep building. Causal pressure is moderate; the label itself does not constrain a high-cost choice, but the stance it represents does alter tactics (accompaniment vs. capture).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Moth wing sealed in glass is introduced early (paragraph nine), placed at the apex of the frames (paragraph twenty-two), touched by the monarch "through the glass with feet like commas" (paragraph thirty-nine), and cupped again in the final sequence with the vow to keep building (paragraph forty-three). Handled across four distinct beats and charged with thematic weight—"proof that even the dim can write light," counterpart to butterfly grammar. The object's specificity (speckled, died against window, "ledger") and its return with reweighted meaning (erased letter remembering its name) drive it toward 8+, but it does not directly enable a causal turn or foreclose an option with material cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Interrupted cadence" is introduced early ("listened for the interrupted cadence," "a hush where a wing used to be," "rhythm had a skip stitched into it") and shapes the stakes: the narrator builds frames to sound absence and bridge the missing beat. The concept is embodied in the twine music—"a score of what was missing"—and in the monarch's arrival pattern: "wingbeat, then the missing answer, then a single wingbeat again." It recurs in the grandmother's "interrupted cadence" schooling and structures the closure image of the knot as vow. The concept directly alters the narrator's method (frames with a broken lip to acknowledge the wound) and charges the ending's resonance. Present in setup, middle, and closure; constrains tactics and articulates cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Transiently rooted" is stated twice (paragraphs eight and forty-five) and enacted in the collapse of the frames: "anchored just enough to sing before surrendering to weather" and "ready to be returned to soil and rumor." The trait governs the narrator's method (temporary structures, not monuments) and the closure move to collapse and leave only the knot. It constrains the choice not to build a permanent memorial and enables the final promise to keep building as long as wind can read. Present in setup and closure; modest middle development (the frames are built knowing they will collapse). The label is clear but the on-page cost is conceptual rather than material; swappable with "ephemeral" or "fleeting" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The act of knotting appears in five beats: kneeling to knot the first junction (paragraph seventeen), leaving twine lines that can be plucked (paragraph twenty-one), the twine thrumming when the monarch arrives (paragraph thirty-three), laying the twine "like lines in a palm" after collapse (paragraph forty-one), and leaving "a final knot on a root, small as a vow" (paragraph forty-eight). Knot-tying structures the signal-building method and the closure gesture; the final knot is the story's last physical act and reweights prior labor as ongoing promise. Indispensable to the ending image and present across setup, middle escalation (thrumming under wind), and closure. The knot's particularity (on root, sized as vow) makes it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Building temporary structures as signals" is introduced early (paragraph seven) as "the old craft taught by those who listened," signaled again when the narrator packs reeds and twine (paragraph nine), and executed across the middle third: triangle facing south, circle with broken lip, strung twine, moth wing at apex. The method shapes every middle beat and the monarch's response—he circles and reads the frames, rests on the circle's lip, and rides the tilted current. Present in setup, development (frames enable guidance), and closure (collapse and vow to keep building). The method is specific and causal, but could be described as "signal-crafting" or "guide-making" without major loss; the exact phrase "temporary structures as signals" recurs verbatim, earning lyric-resonance credit.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The "verdant grotto above the clouds" is anchored in the opening line and sustained through spatial detail: lip of the grotto, clouds moving below, moss underfoot, eddies over the cliff, green exhaled into high air. The elevation matters—narrator can tilt the triangle to spill current eastward, and the grotto serves as a lookout for the monarch's arrival. The setting provides resources (wind, cliff edge for guidance) and charges the atmosphere (blushing stillness, brightening like a face). Present in setup, middle (wind plucks twine, cliff eddies guide alignment), and closure (clouds swim below, grotto exhales). Does not foreclose a path with cost, but the verticality and wind access enable the signal's function.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"During the migration of the last monarch butterfly" is stated early (paragraph five) and tightens every choice: the narrator knows this is the final witness moment, which justifies the labor of building frames and the refusal to capture. The timeframe creates urgency ("sky felt like a library closing") and the monarch's arrival—"a petal burning, the last monarch, his orange stained by journeys my maps cannot hold"—delivers on the stated stakes. The temporal constraint shapes the narrator's tactics (leave a signal, not a monument) and charges the closure vow to keep building "as long as wind can read." Present in setup, middle (waiting for the single wingbeat), and closure (departure crystallizes finality). High specificity and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To honor overlooked histories" is stated early (paragraph four: "ones written on the backs of insects and the undersides of leaves") and governs the dominant stake. The motivation is dramatized in the grandmother's seed-sack schooling memory (paragraph thirty-five) and in the choice to build rather than merely observe. It conflicts with the risk of making "a god of guidance" (paragraph thirty-four) and the narrator navigates this friction by offering accompaniment, not command. Present in setup, tested in the middle choice to steady vs. capture, and reaffirmed in the closure promise. Friction is modest; the narrator never doubts the project or faces a competing desire that would foreclose it with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Blushing stillness" is introduced in the opening two lines and sustained as atmospheric signature: "verdant grotto...before dawn, when even silence held a blush," "world hovered in blushing stillness," "blushing stillness returned after his departure, more tender for the passage." The tone modulates slightly—hush deepens when the monarch nears, the grotto brightens "like a face that hears its name"—but remains coherent through all turns. It charges the final image by returning with the modifier "more tender," reweighting the stillness as witness-aftermath rather than empty quiet. Present in setup and closure; middle development is atmospheric rather than causal. Tone is specific and purposeful, but could shift to "hushed dawn" or "reverent quiet" with minor edits.</comment>
