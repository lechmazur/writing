<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The freight guard's motivation is embodied through concrete actions—planting sparks, kneeling in sand, refusing sleep—and his oath ("to cultivate the sparks in the unlit corners") drives tactical choices with visible cost (midnight freezing in his veins, dreamlessness as price). Internal contradiction appears in his wave-function dispersal versus his kneeling solidity, and the choice to remain "dreamless" to protect fragile seeds shows restraint under pressure. However, the interiority leans heavily on abstract perception ("occasionally everywhere," "smear across places") that distances emotional particularity, and the final boarding feels like resumption rather than foreclosure with newly altered stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the guard boards again, carrying forward his oath and the archive's whisper, with the chess clock remaining frozen—a refusal to resolve the temporal standoff that charges the final image with ongoing cost. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece accumulates pressure through density (dune blooms, sparks planted, basement matches catching) and the final cadence shift ("he will return") reweights the opening drift into committed endurance. Orientation is delayed—"who" and "why" emerge gradually through the first third—but the disorientation serves the dreamless, unmoored atmosphere and pays off when the oath crystallizes the stakes, so the penalty is waived. One meaningful deepening occurs when the archive demands proof and he places his palm on the clock, narrowing his options and sealing the cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The glowing dune functions as micro-setting that charges the closure: its algae-fed bloom provides the medium for planting sparks, and its brightening/dimming tracks the ritual's success. The chess clock and lamp are handled across beats (clock set on sand, faces catching bloomlight; lamp lowered, then lifted), grounding spatial choreography. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—"pollen colored like drowned stars," "algae dim to make room for letters sprouting stems"—and filtered through the guard's professional focus on sparks and sidings. However, the tracks, train cars, and "buried yard of impossible switches" remain abstract anchors; the physical layout of the divergent archive and the railman's circle lack the tactile constraint that would push this into the high 8s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—cultivating sparks to light unlit corners—is signaled early and tightens when the archive demands proof, forcing the guard to pay with his sleep and frozen veins. One meaningful deepening occurs: the wave-function dispersal allows him to see fifteen sidings and plant sparks in multiple locations, reweighting the scale from single-point charity to distributed seeding. The cost is legible on the page: he remains dreamless, his midnight "freezes further inside his veins," and the clock "waits, a small moon he can neither spend nor forgive." Coincidence does not resolve; the guard's method and sacrifice enable the sparks to tumble out. However, the agency reads more as enactment of a ritual than a choice that forecloses a live alternative path, keeping this below 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the fractured lullaby, frozen clock, and planted sparks embody endurance and distributed care without stating a thesis. The final image—"occasionally everywhere, humming that broken song until the corners answer with light"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how to tend a post-catastrophe world, reweighting the opening drift into purposeful dispersal. Subtext operates in the chess clock (two arrested lungs, a standoff of time), the algae blooming on ash, and the guard's refusal to dream (clarity over comfort). The piece resists tidy morals: the sparks are "tiny as syllables," the future uncertain, and the guard's victories small and ongoing. One strand remains abstract: "divergent archive" and "wave functions" lean toward concept-speak without grounding the thematic cost in embodied consequence as fully as the planted sparks do.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV distance is stable and controlled: third-person limited holds to the guard's perceptual signature (tracks "knot," dunes "drape," bloomlight brushes boots), and diction stays within his railman's idiom (sleepers, sidings, switching yard). Compression and patterned elision are purposeful—"he is occasionally everywhere" recurs as a taught motif, and the wave-function dispersal is signaled early and paid off at closure. However, register drifts into elevated abstraction in key beats: "interference chisels a door from certainty," "names without bodies, gestures without hands" read as authorial gloss rather than the guard's interior texture. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. The perceptual signature is distinct but occasionally sacrifices embodied immediacy for lyric distance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and sensory detail is dense and specific ("pollen colored like drowned stars," "letters sprouting stems and leaves"). However, template cadence pervades: "He [verb]" openers run across most beats ("He hums," "He intends," "He lowers," "He sets," "He knees," "He speaks," "He is," "He sees," "He charms," "He cups," "He could," "He lifts"), creating a drumbeat that flattens propulsion in high-pressure moments. Synonym churn appears in adjacent lines: "hisses to a halt" / "steps down," "whispers" / "shivers," "employs" / "arranges." Mixed metaphors strain clarity: "interference chisels a door from certainty" conflates wave and stonework, and "drowned stars" as pollen color contradicts luminosity. These artifacts touch multiple beats but do not obscure the closure image, so the deduction is capped at −1.4 per the Text-Artifact Screen.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-catastrophe setting, quantum-adjacent dispersal, and railman's ritual feels specific and non-obvious; the frozen chess clock as both key and burden, the algae blooming on ash, and sparks planted "in the throats of sleeping towns" transform familiar recovery tropes through tactile detail. The "occasionally everywhere" trait and wave-function method offer a fresh angle on distributed agency. However, the core premise—solitary keeper tending embers after collapse—echoes widely used templates, and the divergent archive remains more concept than grounded constraint. Risk-taking in voice (lyric compression, patterned elision) heightens atmosphere without obscuring clarity, earning a +0.3 within-band adjustment. Transformation is present but incomplete: removing the quantum language and substituting a more conventional journey would leave the emotional arc largely intact.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The freight guard makes key choices: kneeling to draw the railman's circle, placing his palm on the clock to freeze midnight in his veins, and choosing dreamlessness to protect the seeds. These choices drive the middle ritual and closure boarding, and his dispersal ("occasionally everywhere") enables the spark-planting across sidings. Setup is early, development shapes the archive-opening beat, and payoff appears in the final boarding and ongoing return. However, his agency reads more as enactment of a known ritual than a decision that forecloses a live alternative, and his character traits (dreamless, unslept, fractured lullaby) are more atmosphere than tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The chess clock is handled in three beats: carried at his belt, set on sand facing both horizons, and its faces catching bloomlight to signal "his moment has finally arrived"; he places his palm on it to offer proof, freezing midnight further in his veins; and it reappears in the final paragraph as "a small moon he can neither spend nor forgive." It functions as both key and burden, and its frozen state constrains his choices (he cannot resolve time, only defer). Setup is early, development occurs when he uses it as proof, and payoff charges the closure with unresolved cost. The clock's dual faces and midnight freeze are specific and irreplaceable, tied to visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The divergent archive shapes stakes: it "remembers every path the freight could have taken" and gates access to "unspent futures," motivating the guard's ritual. He charms it open by arranging his absences in wave superposition, and it answers by releasing sparks. Setup is early (signaled by the second paragraph), development occurs in the middle ritual when he speaks his oath and offers proof, and payoff appears when sparks tumble out and are planted. However, the archive's mechanics remain abstract—"switching yard of whispers, tracks laid in parallel and canceling"—and its physical form ("somewhere beneath the dunes") is never encountered on the page. The concept constrains the guard's method but does not pressure his choices with a visible tradeoff or tactical shift.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The "occasionally everywhere" trait is signaled early ("counted in windows, reflected in steel") and explained as a wave-function dispersal trick. It enables the guard to see fifteen sidings simultaneously and plant sparks in multiple locations during the ritual, a specific tactical advantage. The trait reappears at closure ("he will return… occasionally everywhere"). However, the cost is generic (solitude, "how a person can… still be alone") rather than a visible tradeoff that alters later moves, and the trait is told more than dramatized—no beat shows him losing focus or splitting attention under the strain of dispersal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The charm action drives the central ritual: the guard "intends to charm it open tonight," he "charms the gates of the divergent archive… by arranging his absences so that a path appears," and the method is "plain to him and impossible to others." This action is causally necessary to access the archive and release the sparks, shaping the middle beat and enabling closure. Setup is early (paragraph 12), development is the ritual itself, and payoff is the sparks tumbling out and being planted. However, "charm" is used as a verb without showing the specific gestures, words, or costs beyond the wave-function humming already described; swapping "charm" for "open" or "unlock" would require only minor edits, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The wave-function method is signaled early ("learned from silence, how a person can smear across places through wave functions") and applied in the ritual: "tuning the air through wave functions, humming until interference chisels a door." It enables his superposition walk and simultaneous planting across sidings. Setup is early, development shapes the middle ritual, and payoff appears when he guards "fifteen sidings down the line" and plants sparks. However, the mechanics are told rather than shown—no beat dramatizes the cost or friction of maintaining superposition, and "wave functions" reads as lyric gloss rather than a constraint that narrows his options or alters tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The glowing dune is present early (paragraph 4), supplies the medium for the ritual (sand for the railman's circle, bloomlight that catches the clock faces), and its blooming/dimming tracks the success of planting sparks. The dune's glow "brushes his boots with pollen," and it "brightens as if remembering noon" and "sinks back to breathing" at closure. Setup, development, and payoff are all present. However, the dune does not pressure the guard's choices—it provides atmosphere and a platform but does not constrain his actions or supply a resource he must navigate. It functions more as vivid backdrop than as micro-setting that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the last forest burns" is established in the opening line and frames the post-catastrophe stakes. The guard's oath to cultivate sparks and the algae blooming "on the last ash" tie his mission to this aftermath. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—no clock runs down, no urgency within this ritual, and the guard's choice to act "tonight" is asserted rather than dramatized as a deadline. The chess clock frozen at midnight suggests temporal stasis, not pressure. Setup is early, but development and payoff are weak: the timeframe flavors the world without constraining the guard's moves or altering his tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to cultivate the sparks in the unlit corners" is signaled early, dramatized in his oath to the archive, and executed through planting sparks "beneath sleepers, under stairs, in sockets of dead lights." The guard pays with his sleep and frozen veins, showing friction between desire and cost. Setup is early, development occurs when he speaks his oath and offers proof, and payoff appears in the distributed planting and the closure boarding with sparks "to feed tomorrow." The motivation drives all key choices and forecloses the path of rest or retreat. However, the friction is abstract (dreamlessness, veins freezing) rather than a visible internal conflict between competing wants.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The "fractured lullaby" tone is established early ("hums a fractured lullaby to keep the cars from remembering") and coheres through the piece: syntax is compressed and elliptical, images are dreamlike yet precise (drowned stars, letters sprouting stems), and the rhythm modulates between drift and ritual solemnity. The guard's humming recurs ("tuning the air… humming until interference chisels a door," "humming that broken song until the corners answer with light"), and the tone charges the closure with ongoing, incomplete care. The fracture—missing notes, limping rhythm—matches the guard's refusal to dream and the partial, seed-like victories. Tone is coherent, purposeful, and integral to the final image.</comment>
