<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's grief and transformation arc is embodied through concrete craft choices—trembling hands, the failed plant, designing breathing chambers—but the interiority leans abstract in key beats ("listening to intervals," "host their last instructions"). The micro-choice of pulling the cord and laying the stencil shows agency, yet the mourners remain undifferentiated and passive, reducing relational pressure. The final renunciation—keeping the observatory open—feels earned by prior causality with visible cost (staying present to grief rather than unmaking the craft entirely), though the path reads more as steady deepening than contradictory impulse.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Charged Poise)—the narrator commits to ongoing tending with visible cost ("keep leaving origami figures," "ready to illuminate again"). Orientation anchors who/where/when by line 2 (mourning jewelry maker, timeless observatory, after rock bottom). One meaningful deepening occurs when the stencil reframes ash as growth instruction, tightening the dominant stake (transform grief into light). Cost is legible: the narrator remains open to grief's weight rather than escaping it. The accumulative pattern—repeated images of breath, light, seeds—coheres and the ending reweights prior material without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The observatory's "brass bones," curtains of intention, and genuinely artificial stars are vivid and voice-filtered. The vellum stencil, lockets with micromesh, and origami cranes function as micro-setting elements that constrain choices (alignment of pathways, measured illumination). Spatial choreography remains clear (central table, railing, floor corridor). The final image—curtains "slumber behind us, ready to illuminate again"—charges closure. Minor abstraction ("timeless observatory") and the lack of exterior city pressure keep specificity from reaching higher bands.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: transform grief into generative attention (teach withering to bloom). One meaningful tightening when the narrator confesses near-unmaking of craft, then chooses to "thread light through ash" via the stencil's alignment—a renunciation that forecloses escape with visible cost (staying exposed to grief's weight). Agency is clear in pulling the cord, designing lockets, leaving cranes. No antagonist required under Accumulative lens; pressure accumulates through the ritual's exacting demands and the seeds' response. Cost legible: ongoing exposure, no closure of mourning.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: ash + seed in breathing chambers, stencil as map of pulse and stars, "tending is the bravest spark." The genuinely artificial stars reframe care as valid even when not "real." No thematic echo or sermon; the final image ("some part of each of us does not wither") answers the central question (can grief feed light?) non-literally. Minor drag from abstraction ("intervals," "gentle thresholds") but the ending reweights prior material—cranes as trust rehearsal, lockets as growth instructions—with resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV stable first-person with distinct perceptual signature (jeweler's eye: "micromesh," "breathing chambers," "braided from patience"). Voice is lyric-accumulative with purposeful compression and elevated diction consistent throughout. However, register drifts into abstract philosophical phrasing ("listener to intervals," "gentle thresholds between withering and blossom") that feels writerly rather than character-bound under pressure. No dialogue on page to judge. Psychic distance and focalization remain controlled; no head-hopping. Elision is taught early (the ritual's mechanics unfold gradually) and pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; no template cadence. Information density is high (most lines advance setting, grief, or ritual logic). Clarity remains solid through spatial and causal sequences. However, figurative density is unrelenting—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated image ("lung paused at top of breath," "grief kept walking," "silvered corridor of focus")—without pattern-teaching or rest, trending toward overwriting in a high-pressure beat. Mixed metaphor: "night learned our pace" anthropomorphizes time inconsistently with "stars held their breath." Minor filter-verb stack in middle third ("I had designed," "I had come"). Paraphrase loop: "I told them... I had come here after hitting rock bottom" repeats the opening without added pressure. Apply −0.6 for density + mixed vehicle + loop.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: grief ritual via precision optics and jewelry craft, with "genuinely artificial" stars reframing care's validity. The curtains of intention, tattoo stencil as lens, and origami invitation are specific and non-obvious. Emotional truth (grief as exacting attention rather than catharsis) avoids generic templates. The final turn—keeping the observatory open as ongoing practice—grows from prior particulars and resists tidy resolution. Minor derivative echo: the "teach withering to bloom" construction leans toward prompt language. Transformation test passes: plot would not work unchanged with different names/places. Slight abstraction ("timeless") and lyric density reduce immediate surprise, but conceptual integrity is strong.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Jewelry maker is signaled early (line 2, "clutching a toolbox of ash, hair") and shapes key turns: designing lockets with breathing chambers, using craft grammar to thread light through ash, pulling the cord. Decisions alter tactics (alignment of stencil with curtains, keeping observatory open). Active in closure ("I keep the observatory open now, and I keep leaving origami figures"). Cost visible: ongoing exposure to grief. Meets all three gates; causal pressure moderate; specificity strong (jeweler's eye for micromesh, vellum).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Stencil introduced early (central table, designed by wife), used in two distinct beats: laid against curtains to align pathways (middle), and as proof of threading light through ash without burning (late confession). Returns with reweighted meaning at closure: "her touch still pressed into the vellum, had shown me a way." Shapes the illumination tactic and charges the emotional turn. High irreplaceability (wife's design, map of arteries and constellations). Strong closure linkage and causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Curtains signaled early (line 4, "shimmering panels that obeyed a steady mind"), shape tactics across beats: pulling one strand tilts constellations, laying stencil aligns pathways, narrowing the beam to illuminate lockets. Directly enable the ritual's success and constrain method (require focus, alignment). Present in closure frame ("slumber behind us... ready to illuminate again"). High specificity (bending starlight like wire) and causal pressure (without them, ritual cannot proceed). Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Genuinely artificial" appears twice: stars above (line 6) and final paragraph ("No star here is real, yet the care is"). Functions thematically to reframe care's validity, charging closure with conceptual cost. However, it does not constrain an on-page action; its role is lyric reweighting rather than tactical pressure. Specificity moderate; swappable with "synthetic" or "man-made" without major structural loss. Meets setup and closure gates but not development; lyric reprise lifts score into mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Illuminate signaled early (curtains "bending starlight"), drives two beats: narrowing the beam to lockets (middle), and the corridor of focus unfurling. Shapes the ritual's success (seeds swell under measured light). Present in closure logic ("ready to illuminate again"). High causal pressure; without illumination, the ritual's mechanism fails. Specificity strong (braided from patience, measured attention). Could conceptually be replaced with "warm" or "focus light," but the text's logic hinges on precision illumination, so swappability is low.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Method signaled early (line 10, "gathered other mourners by leaving origami figures with coordinates"), frames the invitation structure and shapes the mourners' arrival. Returns at closure ("I keep leaving origami figures... as invitations to patience"). Constrains the recruitment tactic and charges the final image (ongoing practice, trust rehearsal). However, the mechanics are told rather than shown in action; we do not see the narrator folding or placing a crane on the page. Two-gate presence (setup, closure) with strong thematic weight but limited mid-scene causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Observatory anchored early (line 1, "timeless observatory held stillness"), pressures choices throughout: "did not permit spectacle, only the long work of noticing," the brass dome and railing as grounding elements, the central table for stencil work. Supplies the curtains and artificial stars as tactical resources. Shapes closure tone ("the room's old instruments ticking in relief," "slumber behind us"). Strong irreplaceability (no other setting offers these tools). Meets all three gates with high causal and atmospheric pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Timeframe anchored early (line 2, "after hitting rock bottom") and reprised at confession beat ("I told them... I had come here after hitting rock bottom, ready to unmake my craft entirely"). Shapes motive and stakes (transformation vs. unmaking). However, the time pressure is retrospective frame rather than live ticking clock; no sense of urgency or deadline that alters tactics within the ritual. Functions more as setup context than active constraint. Meets setup and thematic reprise but lacks development gate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation signaled early (line 9, "teach withering to bloom again by learning how grief might feed light"), drives the ritual design (lockets with seeds, measured illumination), and shapes the confession turn ("If we could not revive the bodies we loved, we could at least host their last instructions: grow"). Present in closure ("tending is the bravest spark"). Friction visible: desire to unmake craft vs. staying present to grief's weight. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Minor swappability with similar grief-to-growth phrasings, but the specificity (teaching, feeding light) fits tightly.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Tone anchored early (line 13, "subdued ardor that felt like hands cupped around a flame in wind") and sustained throughout: quiet restraint ("No one sobbed"), purposeful patience ("measured attention," "the long work of noticing"), charged restraint at closure ("some part of each of us does not wither"). Modulates appropriately with pressure (seeds swell, group exhales). Coherent through turns and charges the final image. Strong consistency and thematic fit; the tone is the ritual's texture.</comment>
