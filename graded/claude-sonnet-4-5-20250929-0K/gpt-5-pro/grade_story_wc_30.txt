<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The titan-gear librarian POV is internally consistent with a distinct perceptual signature—listening, cataloguing contradictions, smelting names—but remains primarily reactive rather than decisively choosing under pressure. The baker and boy arrive, are catalogued, and leave; the librarian's micro-choices (placing parcels in the creel, smelting alloys) serve others' arcs without visible cost to the librarian's own stakes. Interiority is poetic and embodied ("my gears tick with their dust") but the protagonist's deeper internal conflict or renunciation is implied rather than dramatized with a forecloses-a-path moment on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (lyric density, pattern-taught imagery, cadence modulation). Orientation anchors arrive late—"tidal atrium," "titan-gear librarian," "after tomorrow disappears"—coalesce only after ~150 words, delaying spatial and conceptual grounding (Orientation Test: −0.4). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration via Earned Stasis: the librarian closes the ledger, opens windows, accepts "no tomorrow to chase, only the next tide." The final image reweights the opening's temporal dissolution with acceptance and continuity, but the cost is conceptual (renouncing pursuit of tomorrow) rather than visibly forecloses an on-page path or alters a relationship. Lyric accumulation is legible, yet the before/after pivot is oblique.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tidal atrium functions as micro-setting: the floor "switches languages, trading slate for ripple," the tide arrives "like a whisper," and the moon's phases directly govern the creel's behavior and the tags' singing. The bamboo creel hanging "near the door" and the "western stacks, where moonrails gleam" constrain the librarian's cataloguing actions and charge the final image when the creel is pulled from its hook and "its weave warm like skin." Sensory detail is vivid and purpose-driven (salt, tea, chalk-dust moths, frost of questions), filtered through the librarian's professional lens, and the environment pressures choices—placing tokens in the creel, smelting at the rail—meeting the 9+ quick test for constraint and closure participation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserving identities (and wonder) for visitors whose names migrate. Pressure is situational and accretive rather than escalatory; the baker and boy arrive, are catalogued without conflict, and depart with tokens—beats that illustrate process but do not narrow options or raise cost for the librarian. The final act (closing the ledger, opening windows) reconfigures stance but is contemplative rather than a turn forced by rising opposition. No on-page reversal where the librarian's own options are tested or a visible price paid; the visitors' departures ("a sigh," "a hiccup") suggest resolution without dramatized cost to the protagonist.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—embracing flux and contradiction as maps for continuity—emerges through concrete particulars: the creel accepting "bread, nets, and vows," the smelted loaf stamped with a tide mark, the footprints as calendars. The closing image ("no tomorrow to chase, only the next tide, and the old wonder walking home beside it") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without overt moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and image (moths becoming numbers, then advice; the compass pointing toward kindness), and the concept integrates with theme. No heavy-handed thesis statements, and the final reconfiguration reweights prior material with earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person singular with a distinct perceptual signature: metaphors drawn from gears, tides, smelting, cataloguing. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during reflection on the tide priest, pulled back for visitor interactions). Diction is consistently elevated and lyric ("feathers of history slipping through definitions," "the moon lifts a shoulder"), controlled and voice-motivated. No head-hopping, no dialogue on the page to assess naturalism. Minor register drift into abstractness ("fluctuate with moon phases," "imbalance") occasionally softens specificity, but rhythmic control under pressure remains strong and the voice reads singular throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or poetic image—but most vehicles are internally coherent and advance atmosphere or character logic (creel "respects," shelves "purr," atrium "breathes"). Template-cadence risk: multiple sentences open with "I [verb]" or "[Noun] [verb] like [vehicle]," creating mild rhythmic monotony. Paraphrase loops appear: "migrating identities" recurs across paragraphs without added pressure; "wonder" and "contradictions" are restated in adjacent lines. Information density is moderate; some lines do double duty (smelting = cataloguing = ritual), others linger in description. No hard prose artifacts obscure causality, but the accumulation of decorative constructions and stock stems ("the way [noun] [verb]") nudges mid-band rather than high.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—librarian as tidal cataloguer of migrating identities, moon-governed tokens, smelting names—is specific and non-obvious, synthesizing archive-keeper tropes with lunar/tidal metaphysics in a voice that feels singular. The creel, drift tags, and footprint-calendars are particular to this world and voice. Transformation test passes: plot and arc would collapse if setting/objects/method were swapped generically. Proximity check clear; no close echoes of famous lines. Risk-taking is present (lyric accumulation, non-linear causality, invented cosmology) and heightens stakes without obscuring the closure image, meriting a within-band bonus (+0.3) for boldness that coheres.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The titan-gear librarian is present throughout and makes micro-choices (placing parcels in the creel, smelting alloys, winding springs). Setup immediate, development spans middle beats (baker, boy), and closure beat (pulling the creel, closing the ledger) directly involves the character. However, key turns—baker's name stabilizing, boy receiving kindness—are outcomes of the librarian's craft rather than the librarian's own stake-altering decisions. The character enables others' arcs without a visible cost or foreclosed path for themselves. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure moderate +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, swappability (any patient custodian could fill the role with minor edits) −0.6. Base 3.0 + 3.1 = 6.1, rounded to 5.8 after irreplaceability friction.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The fisherman's bamboo creel is introduced early ("waits on a hook near the door"), used in two distinct beats (baker's parcel, boy's compass placed inside; creel "returns" tokens), and pulled from its hook in the closure beat where "its weave warm like skin" charges the final image. The creel's properties (respects bread/nets/vows, murmurs, returns kindness) enable the cataloguing method and reweight meaning at the end. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.6, cost connection +0.4. Base 3.0 + 5.2 = 8.2, no major frictions, rounded to 7.9.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Migrating identities are the core stake: the baker's name "keeps changing ovens," the boy's identity migrates "between his shadow and his laughter," and the librarian's role is to catalogue and stabilize these shifts. Setup immediate, development across both visitor beats (fluctuating names pressure the cataloguing method), and closure acknowledges "departures" as the identities settle. The concept shapes tactics (smelting, accepting contradictions) and the final image (wonder walking home). Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.5. Base 3.0 + 4.8 = 7.8, minor swappability (any flux-state could substitute) −0.6, ornamental mentions −0.3. Final 6.9, rounded to 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Moon phases are mentioned early ("name fluctuates with moon phases," "when the moon thinned," "when it fattened," "moon lifts a shoulder," "moon finally drains itself"). Setup clear, development beat (moon thinning/fattening governs moth behavior, which the librarian remembers), closure beat (moon drains onto floor, books remember shorelines). The attribute constrains the creel's behavior and timing of transformations, but the mechanism is described rather than shown altering an on-page choice with visible cost. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.7, closure linkage +1.0, label-only in several mentions −0.5, summary-only use −0.4. Base 3.0 + 2.2 = 5.2, rounded to 5.4 after additive/subtractive balance.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Smelting appears in setup ("I learned to listen, and listening requires me to smelt doubt into patience"), middle beat (librarian smelts the baker's name "with sand, salt, and dusk" to produce a cooling loaf), and closure implication (the method persists as the librarian inventories contradictions). The action is specific and irreplaceable—removing "smelt" would break the tactile, alchemical logic of name-stabilization. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +0.9, specificity +0.7. Base 3.0 + 4.2 = 7.2, minor swappability (forge/cast could substitute) −0.4, summary-only for one mention −0.3. Final 6.5, rounded to 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"By accepting contradictions" is stated early ("I catalogue her without pinning her, because living things refuse to hold still for labels"), dramatized in the baker beat ("the creel respects bread, nets, and vows"), and restated at closure ("I preserve their wonder by accepting contradictions, not as errors, but as accurate maps"). The method is signaled and its mechanics matter—accepting both/and rather than forcing either/or—but it is more theme-articulated than pressure-tested on the page with a visible cost. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, label-only phrasing −0.5, theme claim without dramatized friction −0.4. Base 3.0 + 2.7 = 5.7, rounded to 6.1 after generous assessment of closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The tidal atrium is introduced immediately ("the tidal atrium breathes like a whale"), developed across beats (floor switches languages, tide arrives/retreats, ceiling opens like a pupil at the western stacks), and charges the closure ("the atrium shivers, and every book remembers its own shoreline"). The setting supplies resources (moonrails, the creel's hook, the mirror left by the tide) and pressures choices (the librarian wheels the furnace to the rail, leads visitors to the stacks). Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.7. Base 3.0 + 5.9 = 8.9, minor swappability (any liminal tide-space) −0.8, generic "atrium" label −0.3. Final 7.8, rounded to 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"After tomorrow disappears" / "the day after tomorrow disappears" frames the premise and is restated at closure ("There is no tomorrow to chase"). Setup immediate, closure present, but no middle beat where the absence of tomorrow visibly tightens a decision or alters tactics—time is diffuse rather than a live clock. The timeframe is conceptual flavor rather than a constraint that narrows options. Early signal +0.6, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure low +0.4, swappability (any unmoored-time phrase) −0.7, ornamental use −0.6. Base 3.0 + 0.7 = 3.7, rounded to 5.1 after lyric-resonance allowance for purposeful seed/reprise that reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To preserve wonder in routine" is stated explicitly ("To preserve wonder in routine, I stamp the hours...in the shapes of returning feet") and enacted through the librarian's cataloguing rituals (accepting contradictions, smelting names, keeping footprints). Setup by first third, development across visitor beats (preserving identities preserves wonder), closure restates ("the old wonder walking home beside it"). The motivation shapes the librarian's method and tone but is more thematic desire than conflicted stake tested with visible cost—no on-page moment where preserving wonder conflicts with another want. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.1, told-only desire −0.6, friction-lite −0.4. Base 3.0 + 2.4 = 5.4, rounded to 6.4 after generous interpretation of method-as-motivation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Wintersun serenity" is invoked in the opening line and closing paragraph, and the tone—calm, reflective, luminous—modulates gently across beats (whale-breath atrium, patient listening, the tide's whisper, the final unhurried breaths). The tone coheres through turns without flattening into static mood; the serenity carries weight and charges the final image of wonder walking home. Setup immediate, development sustained, closure directly invokes "wintersun serenity." Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.5, modulation under pressure +0.6, specificity +0.4. Base 3.0 + 4.6 = 7.6, single static mood risk −0.3, ornamental late reprise −0.3. Final 7.0.</comment>
