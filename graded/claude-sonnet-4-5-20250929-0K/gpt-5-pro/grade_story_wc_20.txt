<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The alchemist's interiority is consistently embodied through work-specific perception ("broken ore," "wet nail") and contradictory impulses act simultaneously: the desire for precision wars with guilt over naming Mira's wildness as disobedience. The final choice to "go because balance is movement" forecloses simple redemption with visible cost. Minor deduction: some interiority edges toward abstract philosophizing ("balance is a jealous arithmetic") rather than staying strictly grounded in sensory present, though the closure choice remains earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of metallurgical metaphor braided with memory, escalates through the kintsugi repair sequence, and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) in the final stanza: the alchemist commits to carrying forward despite knowing the father will hate them, with the cost made undeniable ("accept the hatred as another name with weight"). Orientation anchors clearly by line 2 (foundry, alchemist, fire). One meaningful deepening occurs when the coin is hammered into the disc and the pattern becomes "a map of all the times we failed her," reweighting the premise from magical redemption to testimonial repair. Closure participation is strong and cost is legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The foundry constrains choices throughout: fire's role in annealing, the anvil as workspace, rain as witness and metaphor. The zodiac coin is handled across multiple beats (pressed into palm, annealed, hammered, inlaid, carried outside) with material properties shaping tactics. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("slag-light," "commas of light"), and the final image of the disc cooling on the anvil while rain drinks from seams charges closure. The rain-washed foundry is indispensable to the alchemist's method and the story's central metaphor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: redeem Mira through alchemical repair. One meaningful tightening occurs when the narrator realizes "What if I misnamed her wildness as disobedience," deepening the stake from external task to moral reckoning. Agency is renunciation ("I will accept the hatred") combined with testimonial action (creating the disc as witness). The price is legible: the father's hatred, the abandonment of miracle-thinking, and the acceptance that redemption means "to choose a joining that makes memory and metal agree." Escalation is driven by protagonist reflection under the Accumulative lens, and cost appears on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—the weight of names and the limits of redemption—emerges from concrete metallurgical work rather than assertion. The kintsugi repair becomes a non-literal answer to the central question: redemption is testimonial joining, not undoing. The final image (disc cooling, rain carrying the oath forward) offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing. Subtext operates in the seams metaphor and the refusal of miracles. One brief dip into philosophizing ("balance is movement, because love is method") edges toward abstraction but remains tethered to the disc's material testimony.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is consistently metalworker-particular with embodied diction ("silted ash," "slag-light," "filings") and a lyric cadence that modulates with emotional intensity. POV distance is stable; interiority stays within the alchemist's sensory and professional lexicon. Purposeful compression ("factually mystical as the tide tables we consult") teaches a pattern of oxymoron that pays off at closure. Minor penalty: a few lines ("luminous regret that burns without consuming me") edge toward elevated register that slightly exceeds the established voice under peak pressure, though recovery is swift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (image, metaphor, character stance). Rhythm varies purposefully with short declaratives anchoring longer lyric sweeps. Figurative density is heavy but mostly coherent ("names fall heavy when they are all that remains, heavier than steel if guilt is the flux"). Deductions: minor paraphrase loop between "I work to understand the weight of names" and "Names fall heavy when they are all that remains"; elevated diction in a few peak beats ("luminous regret," "jealous arithmetic") reads slightly ornamental. No loops or scaffold touch the closure beat, which remains propulsive and clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The kintsugi-as-testimonial-repair premise is a fresh synthesis; the metallurgical specificity (annealing, tempering, inlay) transforms the trope through professional method. The alchemist's renunciation of miracle-thinking and acceptance of hatred as cost feels non-obvious and earned. Risk: the piece commits fully to lyric density and metalwork as moral calculus without retreat. Minor penalty: the "factually mystical" frame and zodiac coin edge toward familiar fantasy-adjacent motifs, though the treatment through work and loss is particular enough to avoid pure derivation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The balanced alchemist's choices drive key turns: the decision to begin repair ("I begin where naming hurts"), the realization of misnaming wildness, and the final choice to go and speak to the father. The character appears in setup, middle work, and closure. Causal pressure is strong; the alchemist's professional method and moral reckoning shape every beat.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The zodiac coin is handled across four distinct beats: pressed into palm, annealed, hammered into the disc, and carried outside. It evolves from relic to testimonial object. Specificity (greened with time, twelve worn beasts) matters; its transformation is the story's central action. Strong closure linkage when the disc is set on the anvil to cool with rain drinking from seams.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Kintsugi intentions shape stakes and tactics: the alchemist repairs by exposing failure ("a map of all the times we failed her") rather than hiding it, inlaying cracks with brass. The concept is signaled early ("kintsugi intentions"), demonstrated in the middle repair sequence, and paid off at closure when seams speak truth. Not merely thematic echo; the method alters the disc's meaning and the narrator's stance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Factually mystical" is signaled early and used to frame the alchemist's approach (tide tables, naming metals by childhood). It enables one visible tactic: listening for Mira in the metal during annealing. The trait appears in setup and middle but does not constrain a choice with visible cost; it functions more as tonal register than active limit. Closure participation is indirect (the oath carried "like smoke").</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Redeem" is the explicit task given by the father and drives the entire arc. The alchemist redefines redemption from miracle to testimonial repair, a major conceptual turn. The action shapes setup (father's command), middle (the repair work), and closure (accepting hatred as the price). Not easily swappable; the moral stakes hinge on what redemption means in the absence of miracles.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"By exploring limits" is signaled in the ledger passage ("by exploring limits I learn where a name holds and where it breaks") and demonstrated when the alchemist tests the coin's and their own capacity through annealing, tempering, and acceptance of hatred. The method shapes middle tactics and the final stance. Not merely end-stage mention; the mechanics of finding breakpoints and holding points matter throughout.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The rain-washed foundry supplies tools (anvil, fire, brass), constrains method (heat, hammering, filing), and charges every image. Rain punctuates the ending and "takes its first small drink from the seams." The setting is indispensable; remove the foundry and the metallurgical metaphor collapses. Micro-setting (anvil, gutters, slag-light) alters tactics at every beat.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After the search party disbands" anchors the opening and establishes consequence: Mira is confirmed lost, shifting the task from rescue to reckoning. The timeframe tightens the alchemist's emotional stakes (guilt, aftermath) but does not impose a live clock that alters tactics beat-to-beat. Present throughout but pressure is situational rather than urgent temporal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"To understand the weight of names" is stated early and dramatized through the misnaming realization ("What if I misnamed her wildness as disobedience") and the final vow to "speak each letter as if holding a newborn." The motivation is in friction with the father's demand for redemption and the alchemist's own limits. It drives setup, middle reflection, and closure stance with visible cost (accepting hatred).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Luminous regret" is coherent from the opening phrase through the entire repair sequence and modulates with pressure: sorrow deepens at the misnaming realization, firms into resolve at the final vow. The tone charges the ending image (disc cooling, rain as witness). Diction and rhythm maintain the elegiac register without flattening under stress. The tone is indispensable to the story's testimonial stance.</comment>
