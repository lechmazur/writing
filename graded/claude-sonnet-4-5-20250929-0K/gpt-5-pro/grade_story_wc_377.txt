<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's seasonally mute trait and her purpose to preserve wonder are present, but her interior contradictions and hierarchy of values remain generic. The villagers' emotional releases ("woman clutched her chest," "man slumped and stood") rely on bodily clichés rather than specific embodiment. The ending earns a renunciation (her voice dims, yet she is "fully heard") with some cost, but the interiority never achieves character-particular texture—phrases like "felt themselves honest, not perfect, but brave enough to begin" sound like therapeutic abstraction rather than lived perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens early (post-words world, kinetic sculpture assembling meaning through sensory density) and holds it to closure. Orientation anchors who (Mara), where (whispering bluff), and conceptual when (after words) by the second paragraph. The iceberg fragment's arrival and its melting provide one meaningful tightening: water falling into reed channels deepens the sculpture's effect, and the aurora thickens again. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "the bells kept vigil... They would hold the color of wonder for as long as hearts needed," with conceptual cost (the fragment will melt, its memory will ring inside the metal). However, the cost remains somewhat abstracted—no specific character path is foreclosed on the page, only a general replenishment of wonder.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The bluff setting actively constrains and enables: "the place the bluff called its listening throat" positions the iceberg fragment to catch sunlight, and the wind tunnels through the kinetic frames. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—"clouds stitched past at eye level," "iceberg fragment... a clear tooth blinking like starglass," "rivers of mist teased from stone." The sculpture's mechanics (wind, bells, water channels) are integrated into action. The setting charges the final image: the bells' ongoing vigil on the bluff above the clouds becomes the story's resonant close.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve the color of wonder before it thins—is signaled early and coherent. Pressure tightens when the iceberg fragment begins to melt ("fear pricked the crowd as precious water fell"); Mara's on-page response (motioning for basins, guiding apprentices to repurpose the water into percussion) narrows options and deepens the sculpture's effect. The aurora thickens again, delivering one meaningful escalation under the Accumulative lens. However, the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt: no specific personal path is foreclosed for Mara beyond her seasonal muteness, which was already established. The villagers' emotional releases are told more than dramatized in peak moments.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—truth and wonder preserved through listening, not words—emerges from concrete particulars: the kinetic sculpture, the iceberg fragment's memory ringing in metal, and the villagers' refusal to lie coupled with their polite hiding. The ending image ("when the fragment finally melted, its memory would ring inside the metal, clear as morning ice") reweights the premise without stating a moral. The piece resists easy binaries and avoids thematic echo in the final paragraph. However, phrases like "felt themselves honest, not perfect, but brave enough to begin" and "to preserve the color of wonder before it thinned" verge on abstract thesis language rather than emerging purely from scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored in Mara's perceptual filter: "Mara felt the season change inside her; her throat cooled." Diction is elevated and lyric-consistent ("wonder had a hue here, a pale aurora"), though it occasionally drifts into prompt-like abstraction ("symphonies of truth," "color of wonder") that reads more thematic than voice-particular. No dialogue appears on the page. Purposeful compression and patterned repetition (the aurora, the bells, the fragment) are taught early and pay off at closure. Minor register slips: "seasonally mute when the winds turned and stories curdled" mixes natural metaphor with abstract concept in a way that slightly blurs the grounding.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several phrases loop or paraphrase: "whispering bluff above the clouds" appears three times; "color of wonder" recurs without added pressure. Template cadence is mild but present in the middle third: "A woman clutched... A man slumped... Children leaned..." The figurative density is high throughout ("rivers of mist," "aurora bowed its head," "clouds... bottoms bruised purple") without creating coherence issues, but in peak beats (fragment melting, crowd's emotional releases) the imagery occasionally competes with clarity rather than sharpening it. No major loops or scaffold, yet the prose does not achieve the tightness required for the 8-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—a post-verbal world where truth is conveyed through kinetic sculpture and ice-fragment resonance—offers a fresh synthesis. The iceberg fragment as a memory-bearer and the seasonal muteness trait are specific, non-obvious choices. However, the emotional arc (villagers release hidden grief, children find their names as tastes) echoes familiar catharsis-through-art templates. The ending image (fragment melting, memory ringing in metal) is resonant and earned, but the conceptual framing ("symphonies of truth," "color of wonder") risks prompt-echo territory. Risk-taking is moderate: the lyric density and post-verbal conceit heighten stakes without obscuring clarity, warranting a small within-band lift.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara is introduced early, tunes the bells across multiple beats (setting the fragment, tuning by touch, motioning for basins, striking the smallest bell at closure), and her seasonal muteness constrains her method (signing to apprentices). Her choices—positioning the fragment, repurposing meltwater—alter tactics and enable the sculpture's final effect. The closure image includes her ("Mara lifted the smallest bell and struck it"), charging the ending. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; irreplaceability is moderate (another tuner could plausibly serve, though the seasonal muteness trait adds specificity).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The iceberg fragment is introduced early (fog-wrapped crate), handled in multiple beats (set in the listening throat, glistens at dawn, sweats water, Mara presses her palm against it at night, melts by the ending), and its changing state (melting) creates the mid-story tightening (fear, repurposing water into percussion). It appears in the final image ("when the fragment finally melted, its memory would ring inside the metal"), reweighting prior material. Causal pressure, beat involvement, and closure linkage are all present. The object's unique property (ice remembers stories, outlives words) is irreplaceable and tied to visible cost (the fragment will be lost, yet its memory persists).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Symphonies of truth" is introduced mid-story ("the bells wrote symphonies of truth that threaded through the crowd") and appears again near the end ("they accepted the symphonies of truth"). It shapes the villagers' emotional releases (woman's unnamed child, man's grief-as-posture) and frames the sculpture's effect. However, the concept is more thematic label than on-page constraint: the mechanics are the kinetic sculpture and iceberg fragment; "symphonies of truth" names the result rather than altering tactics. It does not appear in the closure image itself. Setup is late, middle development is present via the crowd's reactions, and closure participation is indirect (the sculpture continues its vigil, but "symphonies" is not explicitly reprised).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Seasonally mute" is introduced early ("Mara wore silence like a shawl, seasonally mute when the winds turned") and constrains her on-page action mid-story: "It was the month she was seasonally mute, when notes refused to climb her lips. She signed to her apprentices, palms drawing arcs." This tradeoff (she cannot speak but signs, and her silence is mirrored in the fragment) is visible. The trait reappears at closure ("seasonally mute but fully heard"), reweighting her relationship to communication. Setup, development (signing), and closure participation are all present, with moderate causal pressure and a felt cost (she cannot use her voice, yet achieves her purpose).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Glisten" appears when the iceberg fragment catches sunlight ("the iceberg fragment began to glisten. Its light moved across the bells"), triggering the bells' response and the sculpture's activation. It recurs in the closing image ("the bells kept vigil, glisten and hush"). The action is not a protagonist choice but an environmental trigger; however, it enables the sculpture's effect and is reprised with reweighted meaning at closure. Setup is mid-story (~40% mark), development is the sculpture's activation, and closure participation is strong. Causal role is moderate (the glistening is a catalyst, not a decision), but specificity and closure linkage elevate the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Kinetic sculpture" is introduced early ("She worked through kinetic sculpture, setting frames of wood and copper that accepted the wind") and its mechanics shape the entire middle: setting the fragment, tuning by touch, wind moving the bells, water repurposed into percussion. The method constrains Mara's attempts (she must tune the frames to the wind, adjust when the fragment melts) and is essential to the ending ("Through kinetic sculpture, she let truth move in more than one direction"). Setup, development across multiple beats, and closure participation are all strong. The method is irreplaceable—removing "kinetic sculpture" collapses the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "whispering bluff above the clouds" is introduced in the opening line and repeatedly grounds action: "the place the bluff called its listening throat" positions the fragment, "clouds stitched past at eye level" provides sensory specificity, and "towers of cypress and brass leaned to listen" integrates the setting into the sculpture's design. The bluff's wind tunnels through the frames, and the final image ("On the whispering bluff above the clouds, the bells kept vigil") charges closure. The setting is irreplaceable—the bluff's height, wind, and acoustic properties enable the sculpture's function. Setup, development, and closure participation are all strong.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After words become unnecessary" is introduced in the opening line and frames the conceptual setting: "People understood; it is the time after words become unnecessary, and meaning travels otherwise." It justifies the kinetic sculpture method and Mara's seasonal muteness. However, it does not create a live ticking clock or tighten decisions—time flows in seasons and narrative progression (dawn, night) rather than urgency. The timeframe is conceptual backdrop rather than tactical pressure. Setup is strong, but middle development and closure participation are weak (the ending does not reference "after words" or use time pressure to force a choice). The concept is present but ornamental to the escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To preserve the color of wonder before it thinned" is introduced early ("Her purpose pressed softly but persistently") and dramatized through her actions: tuning the bells, positioning the fragment, repurposing meltwater. The stake is tested when the fragment begins to melt (fear, quick adaptation). The ending delivers on the motivation: "The aurora along the rail thickened again... They would hold the color of wonder for as long as hearts needed." However, the motivation is more told ("Her purpose pressed") than shown through internal conflict or competing wants. Setup, development, and closure participation are present, with moderate causal pressure and a conceptual cost (the fragment will be lost, yet wonder is replenished).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Muted vigor" is coherent from the opening ("After words became unnecessary") through the closing ("the bells kept vigil, glisten and hush, question and grace"). Diction is restrained yet charged: "silence like a shawl," "breath we saw," "aurora bowed its head." The tone modulates appropriately—calm observation (setting the sculpture), urgency (fragment melting), quiet resolution (final vigil)—without flattening. It charges the final image through phrasing like "slow, circling breaths" and "clear as morning ice." The tone is consistent, purposeful, and integral to the piece's effect, though it occasionally drifts into abstraction ("color of wonder," "symphonies of truth") that slightly weakens grounding.</comment>
