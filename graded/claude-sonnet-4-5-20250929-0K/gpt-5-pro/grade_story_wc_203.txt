<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motives are consistent—ghosts send them, they follow—and the character demonstrates skillful observation in reading dust patterns. However, interiority remains thin; the narrator observes more than struggles. The watchmaker ghost delivers exposition rather than pressure, and the final choice to "unwind" the mechanism feels more symbolic than internally conflicted. Embodied emotion is sparse; most beats are filtered through metaphor rather than visceral reaction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural with closure via Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid). The protagonist discovers the hidden manipulation apparatus, lowers it, and leaves the hatch open—a renunciation of secrecy with felt cost ("agreements make ghosts hungrier than finales"). Orientation anchors early (abandoned circus, ticket office, storm). The accumulation of dust-reading, hatch-opening, and mirror-lowering tightens understanding and reweights the "cracks in the façade" motif at closure. Cost is legible: the ghosts depart "like pardons," the barrel is returned, and the narrator walks away "lighter, carrying nothing but the habit of looking up."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ticket office is vivid and purposeful: paint curling, sequins "barely remembering light," slatted wood drooping. The setting directly constrains choice—the hatch mechanism requires the mainspring barrel found in the drawer, and the ceiling's architecture (mirrors, cables) is the story's central discovery. Micro-setting as constraint: the barrel's cradle, the hidden pin, the dust patterns all guide action. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the narrator's professional lens. The final image charges the setting: "Cracks in the facade let truth escape like steam."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: discover what ceilings hide. Pressure tightens through the dust-reading, barrel placement, hatch opening, and mirror-lowering sequence. The protagonist's agency drives each beat (knocking, prying, engaging the mechanism, turning it backward). Cost is visible: the ghosts are freed, the grift apparatus is dismantled, and the narrator accepts the burden of witnessing. One meaningful tightening occurs when the second hatch unlatches, revealing the full scope of the manipulation. Minor slip: the watchmaker's exposition ("My barrels drove the clock and the grift") tells rather than dramatizes the ethical stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—hidden systems of manipulation, the ethics dried and peeled—emerges organically from the ticket-office grift and its ceiling apparatus. The "cracks in the façade" motif recurs with reweighted meaning at closure: "Cracks in the facade let truth escape like steam." Subtext operates in image and gesture (ghosts as lingering agreements, dust as honesty, mirrors as dazzle). The protagonist's final insight ("ceilings hide what cannot stand eye level") is earned by on-page discovery, not assertion. No overt moralizing; the open hatch and departing ghosts offer a resonant answer to the central question without stating a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "Dust is honest; it rests where air forgets to argue." POV remains stable (single first-person). Diction is consistent, mixing occupational precision ("shafts and cables," "tooth of the barrel") with lyric compression ("a smile that practiced too long"). Perceptual signature is clear: the narrator notices structure, load, silence. Minor slips: some metaphors stretch ("the room became a held breath I could walk through"), and a few lines edge toward over-writing ("invoices forgiven"). Dialogue from the ghosts is minimal and serves function, though the watchmaker's exposition is slightly mechanical.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high in the discovery beats. Clarity is generally strong, but several lines tip into figurative excess: "cotton candy without a stick," "agreements make ghosts hungrier than finales," "a nick in brass." The dust-reading sequence is crisp and propulsive. Minor loops: "light as" appears twice in close succession ("light as invoices forgiven," "shoulders light, burden light"). The final paragraph stacks metaphors ("steam," "invoices," "habit") without all landing cleanly. No major scaffold or template cadence, but the figurative density in non-peak beats slightly dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—ghost-seeing elevator technician reads dust to expose a circus grift—feels specific and non-obvious. The dust-analysis method and the mainspring-barrel mechanism are fresh inflections on the haunted-place premise. The ending avoids tidy resolution; the open hatch and departing ghosts earn the transformation. Risk: the lyric register and occupational specificity elevate the material. Minor deduction: the "cracks in the façade" metaphor, while reweighted, trends toward thematic convenience; the connection between elevator repair and ticket-office ceilings is asserted more than it constrains choice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Present early (paragraph 3). The character's ghost-seeing ability frames the ticket office visit and enables communication with the girl and watchmaker. Observation shapes the dust-reading and hatch-discovery beats. However, the "elevator repair technician" half is largely ornamental; the protagonist's elevator expertise does not constrain or enable a key choice. The ghost-seeing is essential; the occupation is not. Two gates (setup, middle), weak closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Present early (paragraph 22), used twice: the girl points to it, and the protagonist engages it with the hatch mechanism (paragraph 27), then returns it to the drawer at closure (paragraph 43). The barrel's engraved lions and circus-time function add specificity. It enables the hatch to open, and its return signals the engine "finished with turning." Strong causal role, closure participation, and irreplaceability. All three gates.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Introduced early (paragraph 5: "all cracks in the facade"). Recurs in paragraph 33 ("The cracks in the facade were not just paint, but ethics dried and peeled") and at closure (paragraph 49: "Cracks in the facade let truth escape like steam"). The concept shapes thematic stakes—hidden manipulation—but does not constrain a tactical choice. Lyric reprise reweights the dominant stake at closure. Two gates (setup, payoff); middle involvement is thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Signaled early (paragraph 12: "I am skillfully observant"). Enables the dust-reading method (paragraphs 16–18) and the discovery of the clean square (paragraph 18). The trait constrains action: observation drives the hatch location and mechanism engagement. Visible on-page use with causal pressure. However, the label "skillfully observant" is slightly generic; the execution (dust reading) is more specific than the attribute itself. Two beats, closure linkage indirect.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Present across multiple beats: engaging the barrel tooth (paragraph 27), turning it (paragraph 28), and turning it backward to unlatch the second hatch (paragraph 39). The action enables the attic reveal and the mirror-lowering sequence. Major turns trace to "engage": the hatch opens, the apparatus is exposed, and the protagonist physically dismantles it. Strong causal role, closure participation. All three gates, high irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Signaled early (paragraph 16: "analyzing dust accumulation patterns"). The method shapes the hatch-discovery beat (paragraphs 16–18): thicker drifts lead to the clean square. The mechanics matter—dust rests where air forgets—and the protagonist uses this principle on the page. However, the method appears in one sustained beat and does not recur or constrain later choices. Two gates (setup, middle); closure participation is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present from the opening line and sustained throughout. The ticket office pressures choices: the counter provides access to the ceiling (paragraph 14), the desk drawer supplies the barrel (paragraph 22), and the architecture (hatch, attic, mirrors) is the story's central discovery. The setting is not merely backdrop; it is the puzzle the protagonist solves. The final image charges the setting: open hatch, trace of the window frame, rain on the midway. All three gates, high causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Introduced in paragraph 7 ("When the overhead fluorescent buzz dies off, the ghosts talk plain") and dramatized in paragraph 8 ("It sputtered, grew quiet"). The moment enables ghost communication (paragraphs 9–10, later 36–37). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions; the fluorescent's behavior marks a threshold but does not constrain tactics or pace. The element returns briefly (paragraph 42: "the fluorescents stayed shy") but does not shape closure. Two gates (setup, middle), weak causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stated early by the ghost (paragraph 10: "We need you to discover what ceilings hide") and affirmed by the protagonist (paragraph 26: "Show me"). The desire drives the entire discovery sequence: knocking, prying, engaging the barrel, lowering the mirrors. Friction is present—"I wanted to do more than witness"—but the internal conflict is brief. Cost is legible: the protagonist accepts the burden of the revealed truth and leaves "lighter, carrying nothing but the habit of looking up." All three gates, strong causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Established early (paragraph 2: "weightless burden of anticipations not chosen, like cotton candy without a stick"). The tone recurs in images of suspension and paradox: sequins "barely remembering light," dust as "slow snowfall," ghosts "light as invoices forgiven." The tone modulates with discovery—wonder shifts to ethical reckoning—and charges the final image: "walked away lighter." Coherent through turns, with cadence that supports the lyric-accumulative lens. Strong reprise at closure, but the "weightless burden" phrase itself does not return. Two gates (setup, payoff).</comment>
