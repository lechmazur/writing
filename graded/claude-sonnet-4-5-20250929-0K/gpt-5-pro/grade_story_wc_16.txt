<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator's motives (repair collaboration, restore trust) are clear and embodied through concrete actions—writing vows, confessing vanishing—that create authentic internal friction. The reconciliation arc shows genuine cost: "Silence had once been my shield... and it had cut her like glass." However, interiority occasionally tips into therapeutic self-diagnosis ("my vanishing," "map the boundary between focus and forgetting") that softens pressure at key beats. Mara remains functional but underdrawn; her "cautious exuberance" and strategic forgiveness support the arc without independent texture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece opens with clear who/where/when (arcane linguist, archive, present-tense return) and accumulates pressure through layered vows that unseal the door—a legible Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost ("the language of we is a grammar I will not lose again"). The vow-by-vow structure functions as escalation under an accumulative lens, each promise reweighting trust and access. Minor causality softness: the door's mechanics ("symphonies of truth aligned within spoken promises") are asserted more than demonstrated, and the final codex appears as reward rather than complication, slightly diluting the cost at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The archive is vividly established—dust, high shelves "like staves," sealed room, scrolls "like sleeping infants"—and the glass ink well functions as charged micro-setting, handled across beats and tied to grandmother's peace charters. Spatial choreography (catalog desk, sealed door, chamber, floor translation) remains coherent. The archive constrains choice (door requires vows to open) and the ink well charges the reconciliation moment ("small thing gathered all the weight"). Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered, though some metaphors (shelves as staves, scrolls as infants) lean decorative rather than tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore collaboration and unseal the archive—is signaled early and tightens through the vow sequence. The narrator's agency is clear: confessing vanishing, co-writing promises, accepting mutual accountability. One meaningful deepening occurs when they move from mechanical promises to emotionally charged ones ("I confessed my vanishing... drawing it where she could see"), and the door's opening reconfigures their relationship with felt cost. The escalation is accumulative rather than reversals, fitting the lens. However, the final codex arrival feels like a granted reward rather than a complication that tests the earned reconciliation, slightly softening the stakes' final edge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—trust as constructed through interlocking promises, understanding as collaborative act—emerges organically from the vow-writing and archive mechanics without overt moralizing. The grandmother's "peace charters in disappearing ink" seed the motif early, and the final translation scene ("text opened like a window with two hands") crystallizes the theme through image rather than statement. Subtext operates in silence, gesture (Mara sliding the ink well), and the archive's "breath" as externalized approval. The piece resists tidy resolution: "fragile and brave, a path we would keep walking" acknowledges ongoing work. One slip: "symphonies of truth hold" briefly edges into articulated thesis, though it's anchored in the grandmother's voice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and lyric—figurative diction ("choir of hush," "scholarship of retreat") anchored in the narrator's academic idiom. POV remains stable first-person with clean temporal control. Dialogue is sparse but functional ("You forgot this," "You came back"), carrying subtext and goal pursuit without over-articulation. However, figurative density is high throughout, with metaphors in nearly every sentence ("metronome on our impatience," "corridor ahead looked less like a fork and more like a chorus"), occasionally slowing momentum and creating mild register drift. Filter verbs ("I remembered," "I imagined") appear but fit the reflective mode. Free indirect for Mara is minimal; her interiority remains opaque, reinforcing single-POV integrity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled and information-dense, with sentences often doing double work (e.g., "She lifted the glass ink well between us, as fragile and clear as a drop of intent" conveys object, gesture, and thematic charge). However, figurative language saturates high-pressure beats without relief: "lullabies of nations," "sweetened by our vows," "warm bread" cluster in the climax, blurring specificity. Template cadence appears in the vow sequence: "We wrote... We spoke... We continued... We sat..." (−0.4). Minor paraphrase loop: "to argue without abandoning" and "disagreements stitched so a seam offered strength" restate the same idea. No significant scaffold or pronoun drift; grammar is clean. Propulsion is steady but occasionally yields to ornament.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—extinct-language scholarship as reconciliation metaphor, promises as literal keys—feels purposeful and non-obvious, avoiding template plot mechanics. The ink well's lineage (grandmother's peace charters) and the archive's vow-based lock integrate world logic with emotional stakes. Specificity (river people's codex, glass ink well, counterpoint metaphor) anchors universals. Risk: the piece commits fully to lyric accumulation over causal reversals, and the ending resists tidy closure ("fragile and brave, a path we would keep walking"). Transformation test passes: the arc depends on these exact details. Minor derivative echo: reconciliation-through-collaborative-ritual reads familiar in structure, though execution particularizes it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The arcane linguist's professional knowledge shapes setup (deciphering the treatise, understanding the archive's mechanics) and drives the vow-writing sequence. The role enables the collaboration and final translation ("the code of hospitality unfolding"), constraining choices to those within the established expertise. Introduced immediately, recurs in middle beats (writing vows, unsnarling scrolls), and anchors closure (translating the codex together). However, the role could be replaced with "researcher" or "scholar" with minor edits; the linguist-specific knowledge doesn't create a unique constraint or cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The glass ink well appears in three distinct beats: Mara's opening gesture ("You forgot this"), the vow-writing ("We dipped quills"), and the packing at the end ("capped the glass ink well, leaving its clear heart unbroken"). It carries grandmother's legacy (peace charters in disappearing ink), charges the reconciliation stakes, and functions as a shared tool. Setup is immediate, development uses it concretely (writing vows), and closure references it with reweighted care. However, it doesn't decisively shape the outcome; the vow-writing could occur with another writing tool.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Symphonies of truth" frames the archive's mechanics early ("door did not open to keys... but to symphonies of truth aligned within spoken promises") and structures the middle action—writing vows as aligned declarations. The concept shapes tactics (how they open the door) and recurs thematically ("treaties songs... symphonies of truth hold"). Present in setup, drives middle beats (vow construction), and resonates at closure ("chorus"). However, the mechanics remain somewhat metaphorical; the reader doesn't see the door "listening" in a way that could fail or succeed based on misalignment, slightly reducing causal specificity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Carefully reckless" is stated twice: the narrator bringing the ink well ("carefully reckless enough to bring it here") and later co-writing vows ("carefully reckless in phrasing yet exact"). The trait colors the reconciliation attempt—willingness to risk fragility for connection—and enables the grandmother parallel. However, it functions more as descriptor than constraint; no on-page choice hinges on this exact blend of caution and risk in a way that another temperament wouldn't also permit. Present early, echoed at closure, but swappable with "deliberate vulnerability" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Unsnarl" drives a pivotal beat: "We unsnarled the knot together, teasing the threads with fingers sweetened by our vows, and laughter surprised us both." This action crystallizes the collaboration after the door opens, transforms tension into repair, and enables discovery of the codex. The verb recurs from an earlier dread ("the old knot I had dreaded"), charging the moment with earned relief. Setup (knot mentioned as obstacle), development (physical unsnarling becomes emotional repair), and closure linkage (laughter and codex access follow). The action could be replaced with "opened" or "unlocked" at narrative cost, but not structural collapse.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Interconnected promises" is seeded early ("Meaning could bloom only via interconnected promises, each thread answering another, until a door believed you") and structures the entire middle sequence—writing, speaking, and aligning vows. The method is demonstrated on the page: each promise references and builds on prior ones, creating the "woven staff of music." Setup is clear, development is the core mechanic (door opens only when promises interlock), and closure reflects it ("the language of we"). However, the interlocking mechanics are asserted more than tested; the reader doesn't see a failed promise or misalignment that the method must overcome.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The extinct language archive provides resources (scrolls, codex, the sealed room) and constraints (door requires vows to open, dust and silence create atmosphere). Setup is immediate ("first time I returned"), development uses the sealed room as a locked goal that shapes all tactics, and closure occurs inside the archive with the codex discovery. Spatial choreography (catalog desk, sealed door, chamber, floor) remains coherent. The archive's rules (door mechanics) actively pressure choices, elevating it beyond postcard description. However, the archive could be replaced with another knowledge repository requiring collaborative ritual without fundamental story collapse.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Before paths diverge" bookends the story: the narrator says "Before paths diverge again, I said, let us speak..." and the final line references "before paths diverge into other days." The timeframe creates urgency—this reconciliation must happen now—but the clock isn't tight or tracked on the page. No visible deadline pressures their choices (e.g., Mara's imminent departure, archive closing). Setup in title/opening, thematic recurrence at closure, but the middle beats don't tighten under temporal constraint. Functions more as metaphor (fleeting opportunity) than as a live pressure that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To restore trust after silence" drives every choice: the narrator's return, confessing vanishing ("I confessed my vanishing and promised to map the boundary"), co-writing vows, and accepting mutual accountability. The motivation is embodied in actions and charged by prior cost ("Silence had once been my shield... and it had cut her like glass"). Setup is immediate ("contrite friend, to restore trust after silence"), development shows friction (Mara's cautious exuberance, the narrator's guilt), and closure validates the repair ("You came back... the language of we is a grammar I will not lose again"). The motivation shapes the entire arc with visible relational cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Cautious exuberance" is embodied in Mara's opening ("her eyes bright with cautious exuberance that matched my own") and modulates through the arc: caution in testing the narrator's commitment, exuberance building as the door opens and laughter arrives. The tone charges the final image ("fragile and brave") and matches the narrative stance—hopeful but guarded. Setup is early, tone coherent through turns, and closure reflects it. However, the tone is more consistent than dynamic; it doesn't sharply shift under pressure or create ironic tension. Functions as atmosphere rather than a constraint that alters choices.</comment>
