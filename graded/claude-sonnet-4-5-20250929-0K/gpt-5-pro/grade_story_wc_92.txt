<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The lock sentinel shows clear interiority and embodied choice when wedging the bronze quill holder to bridge the wheel's corroded teeth. Internal texture remains consistent—"keys clinked like cool birds nesting," "my mind kept its winking hush"—with purposeful compression. However, motivational depth lacks visible internal conflict; the sentinel moves through the intrigue with calm inventiveness but no contradictory impulses testing commitment. The collective "we" dilutes individual stakes; companions arrive and depart without friction, flattening the crucible that would elevate characterization into high bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the sentinel becomes "a hinge" on which "the city turned quietly," and the revolution "stayed silent long enough to seed song." Cost is conceptual and felt—the quill holder sacrificed, vigilance softened—legible in the final image of the half-painted sundial wearing "honest" shadows. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through lyric compression, pattern-taught metaphors (locks, hinges, light), and a cadence shift at closure reweighting the dominant stake (permission over toppling). Orientation anchors by ~120 words (fort, twilight, blackout, lock sentinel role). One micro turn when the wheel wakes shifts tactics from stealth to shared light. However, causality occasionally compresses past clarity: how the sundial's "coded angles" direct guards and why the blackout occurs remain asserted rather than dramatized, costing full confidence in escalation mechanics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bronze quill holder functions as micro-setting, constraining the climactic choice: its "balance" and conductivity bridge the wheel's corroded teeth, and its absence afterward marks cost. The fort's architecture—archive door, iron eyelids, floor seam—guides movement and discovery. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "keys clinked like cool birds," "the room exhaled the kind of breath that starts a confession," light "tasted the room first, polite at the lips." The half-painted sundial recurs with evolving pressure, its "pause" a tactical wedge and its new shadows the closure image. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the archive descent and courtyard return, with "luminous fort at twilight" framing and charging the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—sparking a silent revolution of permission rather than toppling thrones—is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens. One meaningful tightening occurs when the wheel needs "one bridge across two corroded teeth" and the manuals fail, forcing the protagonist's improvisation with the quill holder. That choice forecloses the tool's original function and alters the city's state, with cost legible in the post-act line "it lived now as a tooth in the wheel." However, escalation remains more textural than causal: the blackout and the companions' arrival feel coincidental rather than pressure-driven, and no visible loss (time, discovery risk, stamina) tightens tactics mid-scene. The ending reweights options—doors "knew how to open," people "discovering their own hands had always been lanterns"—but the path from invention to city-wide light lacks on-page resistance that would drive high-band scores.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and action: permission over force, doors as boundaries versus blessings, light that won't bow. The final image—"the city turned quietly on that hinge, and the revolution stayed silent long enough to seed song"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Recurring motifs (locks, hinges, vigilance, light, the half-painted sundial) constrain choice and charge closure rather than merely decorating. The "cradle of sparks" metaphor braids hope-as-infant with the literal wheel, and the bronze quill holder's transformation from "pompous desk totem" to conductive bridge enacts rather than states the thematic turn. Subtext operates in gesture and implication: "honesty meant the guards patrolled where mathematic shadows told them to, not where meaning actually slept." No prompt-echo or didactic summary flattens the ending; the piece trusts image and particular to carry complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent: lyric compression ("winking hush," "tried out a costume," "metal stuttered") and purposeful syntactic inversion sustain a narrative stance that modulates pressure without breaking idiom. Psychic distance remains stable in first person; no head-hopping. Figurative density is high but patterned early—"keys clinked like cool birds," "fear tries to giggle"—teaching the reader the texture before relying on it at closure. However, some constructions approach ornamental register drift: "a republic of little suns," "hope can be an infant with fists" feel elevated past the sentinel's embodied lexicon, especially under peak stress. No dialogue appears; the collective "we" briefly dilutes focalization when "companions arrived in ones and twos," though internal texture quickly returns. Free indirect style is clean, and the perceptual signature—metal as honest, doors as blessings—remains character-particular throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and sentence openings show range. Information density is high: most lines advance atmosphere, character stance, or world logic. Clarity holds across the archive descent and wheel activation. However, figurative language clusters densely in nearly every sentence of high-pressure beats without clear escalation pattern: "the dark blink me past," "breath that starts a confession," "wheel shuddered, then remembered the verb for turning." This density approaches overwriting in the climax, risking decorative weight. Minor template cadence: "I knelt, pressed… room exhaled… cradle waited… companions arrived" stacks similar participial stems. A paraphrase loop appears: "The intrigue was never to topple thrones with shouts, but to reveal that doors knew how to open. We moved during an unexplained blackout, and what we opened was permission"—the second sentence restates the first without added pressure. Proofreading is clean, and the opening and closing lines anchor and recharge motifs effectively, but mid-scene loops and ornamental metaphor prevent higher bands.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—using coded sundial angles and a bronze quill holder to spark a generator during a blackout—offers a specific, non-obvious synthesis. The "silent revolution" concept is transformed through grounded detail: the quill holder's conductivity, the sundial's half-painted rim, the archive's hidden seam. Emotional truth in "we wanted to spark a silent revolution that would light bread ovens and minds without burning the city" avoids both cynicism and naïve utopianism. The piece commits fully to its lyric premise and follows its implications without retreat. However, the revolution-via-light trope has wide currency in speculative and metaphorical fiction; while the sundial mechanic and the sentinel's "hinge" self-conception add freshness, the core arc—secret collective restores power to the people—does not fundamentally transform the template. Risk-taking in voice and structure (lyric compression, accumulative escalation) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, meriting modest upward adjustment within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The vigilant lock sentinel makes the key choice to wedge the bronze quill holder as a conductive bridge, directly enabling the wheel to wake. This choice appears in the climax and forecloses the holder's original function with visible cost ("gone from my belt, but it lived now as a tooth in the wheel"). The sentinel's observation throughout—listening to metal, checking the sundial, pressing the floor seam—frames and enables the final action. However, the sentinel's interior arc lacks friction; calm inventiveness dominates without contradictory impulses testing resolve. The collective "we" dilutes individual agency in the middle beats. Setup is early (first line), development occurs in the archive descent and wheel repair, and payoff anchors the ending image ("I was also a hinge"). Two-gate minimum met, causal pressure present, closure linkage strong, but lack of internal conflict and shared agency cap higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The bronze quill holder is handled in at least three beats: introduced on the belt as "official enough to pass any inspection, heavy enough to matter later" (setup with foreshadowing), lifted and felt for balance before wedging (tactile agency at climax), and noted as absent afterward with its new function acknowledged ("it lived now as a tooth in the wheel"). Its specific properties—balance, conductivity, official appearance—enable the climactic improvisation and cannot be swapped for a generic tool without breaking the repair logic. The ending reconfigures its meaning from pompous totem to essential bridge, charging the closure image. Setup early, development at the wheel, payoff in reflection and thematic resonance. High causal pressure, closure linkage, irreplaceability, and visible cost elevate the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "cradle of sparks" is introduced as the hidden chamber's name and metaphor ("hope can be an infant with fists"), then dramatized when the wheel wakes "like a newborn" and light emerges. It shapes the middle beat by providing the goal and stakes (activate the dormant wheel), and the ending references it implicitly when light "slipped into alleys and stitched bakeries to barracks." However, the concept functions more as atmospheric setting and thematic vehicle than as a constraint on tactics; the mechanics of activation (corroded teeth, quill holder bridge) drive the choice, not the cradle metaphor itself. Setup is clear, development and payoff present, but causal pressure and cost are tied to the wheel and holder rather than the cradle label. Purposeful lyric reprise reweights meaning but does not constrain choice enough for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "calmly inventive" trait is demonstrated on the page when the sentinel "checked the courtyard sundial" under stress, wedged the quill holder after feeling its balance, and "fed the wheel slowly, because inventions are like children." These actions show the trait enabling tactics. However, the trait is also label-stated ("I am calmly inventive when fear tries to giggle"), reducing embodied specificity. No visible tradeoff or cost directly tied to being inventive versus, say, reckless or cautious; the calm approach succeeds without friction. The trait appears in setup (early self-description), development (repair improvisation), and implicitly in the ending stance ("softer vigilance"), meeting two gates. Functional involvement but lacks the constrained choice or price that would elevate it above mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The intrigue structures the entire plot: planting the half-painted sundial as a tactical wedge, moving via coded angles to evade guards, hiding the chamber, and coordinating the blackout action. The intrigue is signaled early ("Our intrigue had planted that pause") and shapes multiple beats: checking the sundial, slipping through the archive, the collective "we" enacting the plan, and the post-activation reflection ("The intrigue was never to topple thrones"). However, the mechanics remain partly asserted—how the sundial angles actually redirect guards is told rather than shown in a dramatized beat. The intrigue enables the revolution but does not itself create a pivot where the protagonist must choose between competing intrigue paths or pay a visible cost tied specifically to conspiracy (as opposed to the tool sacrifice). Setup early, development across beats, payoff at closure. Strong involvement but swappable with "plan" or "secret coordination" without fundamental breakage, capping the score below high bands.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The "coded angles in a half-painted sundial" is introduced early as the intrigue's method and recurs at closure when "the half-painted sundial wore new shadows, honest ones drawn by a future finally awake." The sundial signals setup and provides thematic resonance. However, the mechanics—how paint placement encodes angles that redirect guards—are asserted rather than demonstrated. The sundial does not constrain a middle choice or shape the wheel-repair tactic; it functions as context and symbol more than causal lever. The element is present in two beats (courtyard check, ending image) but neither beat shows the method enabling a choice under pressure. Lyric reprise reweights meaning but does not tie to on-page cost or tactical constraint. Setup and payoff present; middle development weak. Swappable with another misdirection device without structural impact, capping the score in mid-bands.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The "luminous fort at twilight" frames the opening and closing lines, charging the ending when the fort "belonged to everyone again." The fort's architecture—archive door, iron eyelids, floor seam, ramparts—guides movement and discovery. The blackout transforms the fort's usual luminosity, creating pressure by removing the magistrates' control over light. However, the fort functions more as atmospheric container than as constraint that alters protagonist tactics; the choice to repair the wheel would remain identical in a basement elsewhere. The twilight timing and luminous reputation enrich tone but do not tighten decisions. Spatial choreography is coherent. Setup early, development through architectural navigation, payoff in the thematic return. Micro-setting elements (archive floor seam) constrain more than the fort-as-whole. Strong presence across beats but limited causal pressure on choice, placing it in mid-to-good integration band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The "unexplained blackout" creates the window for intrigue action and is tracked across the piece: lights fold away, twilight becomes memory, darkness deepens, then lanterns relit when the wheel wakes. The blackout enables the protagonist's stealth ("pretended to inventory locks") and signals urgency. However, time pressure is not dramatically tightened—no approaching dawn, no patrol schedule counting down—so the blackout functions more as enabling condition than as live clock altering tactics. The element appears in setup (early), middle (enables archive entry), and closure (reversed when light returns), meeting gate requirements. The blackout's reversal is a result of protagonist action, not a coincidence. Causal involvement is present but the timeframe itself does not constrain a choice beat or impose visible cost; the intrigue could proceed at similar pace in dim light. Functional integration without high constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to spark a silent revolution" is stated early ("We wanted to spark a silent revolution that would light bread ovens and minds without burning the city") and drives the protagonist's choices: checking the sundial, descending to the chamber, improvising the quill holder bridge, feeding the wheel carefully. The ending crystallizes the motivation's fruition when "the revolution stayed silent long enough to seed song" and "doors knew how to open." Friction appears between the goal (light without burning) and the risk (discovery, failure), though that tension is more implicit than dramatized through an on-page moment where the protagonist weighs competing costs. The motivation shapes three beats (preparation, repair, reflection) and is indispensable to the closure image. However, the desire is more collectively held ("we") than individually conflicted in the sentinel's interiority, and no scene tests whether the protagonist would sacrifice the revolution for personal safety or vice versa. Strong presence and causal role, visible payoff, but lacks the friction of want-versus-fear under pressure that would push into high bands.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The "winking hush" tone is established early ("my mind kept its winking hush," "fear tries to giggle") and sustained through lyric compression, playful metaphor ("keys clinked like cool birds nesting," "doors wore their darkness as if trying out a costume"), and the conspiracy's quiet confidence. The tone modulates with pressure: calm invention during setup, tactile focus at the wheel repair, and softer reflection at closure ("I kept watch with a softer vigilance"). The ending image—"the revolution stayed silent long enough to seed song"—directly charges the winking-hush premise, reweighting silence as strategic strength rather than mere stealth. Tone is coherent across structural beats and integral to the piece's identity; removing the winking-hush texture would flatten voice and thematic resonance. However, the tone occasionally risks ornamental lyricism ("light did not shout; it tasted the room first, polite at the lips") that decorates rather than pressures. Strong integration with closure and consistent modulation earn high mid-band placement.</comment>
