<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Anya's interiority is concrete and specific—"methodically hopeful, shelving glass jars of seed and rinsed brushes like votive lamps"—but her choices operate more as ritual than as pressure-tested decisions. The visitors arrive, recognize fragments, and leave gifts in a frictionless exchange; no competing impulse or internal contradiction drives a costly choice. The ledger-keeping and final palm-glyph show persistence, but the stakes never tighten to force a renunciation or meaningful trade-off. Minor penalty: the grandmother's brush trait is told rather than discovered through Anya's embodied struggle with it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern—strangers arrive, recognize lost-language inscriptions, reciprocate with gifts—that coheres across multiple beats and deepens through density increase. Orientation is clean by the first paragraph (who, where, when). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final palm-glyph "keep" crystallizes Anya's stance and the ledger of kindnesses charges the ending image with felt cost (nightly labor, patience, faith in strangers). One persistent constraint shapes tactics: the moon-tipped brush works only via moonlight, limiting when she can write. The accumulative design holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse is rendered with vivid, purposeful detail—saffron quiet, neon smeared on glass panes, ferny breath drifting down stairwells—that reflects Anya's priorities and constrains choices (moon angle, smog thinning, ventilation). Sensory selection is economical and urgent: "city thudding like a muffled drum," "antiseptic" on the nurse's coat. The moon-tipped brush and watering can function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent across all visitor arrivals and the ledger-keeping.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: prove strangers remember kindness through tending. One meaningful deepening occurs as Anya records each kindness in the ledger, converting hope into practice. The cost is visible—nightly labor, waiting, methodical faith—but pressure remains static; no live option is foreclosed, no tactic altered by a reversal. The strangers' arrivals feel serendipitous rather than driven by Anya's agency. The final palm-glyph ("keep") crystallizes her stance without a choice that narrows options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: lost languages as vessels for kindness, methodical hope as practice, strangers recognizing fragments of their pasts. The saffron quiet, the ledger, the moon-tipped brush, and the returning gifts build a coherent answer to "how is memory kept alive?" without a stated moral. The final glyph ("keep") offers a resonant, non-literal close. Minor slip: the grandmother's unexplained trait and "translation" metaphor approach overt thematic statement but remain grounded in action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, anchored in Anya's perceptual signature: "vowels traded for bread," "tea cloth," "votive lamps." Distance modulates purposefully between close-third interiority and observational stance during visitor arrivals. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; the courier's "surprised his mouth remembered" carries embodied recognition. Diction remains consistent—lyric, specific, slightly elevated—but some figurative density clusters ("moon-tipped brush drank light instead of ink," "moonlight pooled cleanly along its bristles like milk") approach overwriting in the opening third without pattern-teaching payoff.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies naturally, with shorter beats during visitor exchanges and longer accumulative sentences for Anya's reflection. Two frictions lower the score: (1) paraphrase loop in the opening ("She was methodically hopeful" followed immediately by the ledger sentence that restates the same trait without added pressure); (2) figurative density in the first third—multiple moon/light metaphors cluster without beat involvement. The final third tightens cleanly. No coherence breaks, but the metaphoric stack in the opening triggers −0.5 under the Overwriting Check.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—lost languages as sensory memory, moonlight-activated calligraphy, strangers trading kindness for recognition—feels specific and non-obvious. The rooftop greenhouse as sanctuary in a smog-choked city and the ledger as proof of methodical hope avoid template plotting. The daydream mechanic (brush works via moonlight) is lightly sketched but functional. Risk is present in the accumulative structure and the quiet, open ending. Minor dock: the "moon-tipped brush that drank light" leans toward quirky ornament, and the grandmother's unexplained trait reads slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Anya is present across all beats and her choices—opening vents, writing inscriptions, offering tea, recording kindnesses, marking the palm-glyph—shape the accumulative arc. However, her decisions do not narrow options or force a costly trade-off; she observes and tends without friction. She is causally active but not under pressure that tests commitment.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The moon-tipped brush appears in the opening (setup), is used to write inscriptions across multiple beats (development), and returns in the final paragraph ("the brush cooled") to charge the closure image (payoff). Its mechanics—works via daydreams sparked by moonlight—constrain when Anya can write. High specificity: horsehair that "drank light instead of ink" makes it irreplaceable. Cost is implied: Anya depends on moon angle and clear skies.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lost languages shape every beat: the harbor cant, the caravan tongue, the market vowels, the word for "share" glowing in a daydream. Each inscription alters tactics—strangers recognize fragments, reciprocate, leave gifts—and the ledger records the translations. The concept drives the dominant stake and charges the closure: "each translation kept the lost languages breathing." Causal pressure is strong; removal would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Methodically hopeful" is introduced early and embodied in specific actions: shelving jars "like votive lamps," keeping a ledger, writing nightly, marking intervals. The trait constrains tactics—Anya does not proselytize or demand but tends and waits—and the final glyph ("keep") crystallizes it. Cost is visible: nightly labor, patience, faith without guarantee. However, the trait is also stated directly ("Method allowed hope to be more than a wish") which lowers integration slightly.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Rouse" appears in multiple beats: Anya rouses old alphabets, daydreams rouse new inscriptions, and memory is roused in strangers. The action drives the causal chain—without rousing, no recognition occurs—and shapes the closure (the final glyph is a "vow" that keeps "rousing memory with gentle work"). It is not easily swappable. However, the mechanics (how rousing works) remain lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The method—daydreams sparked by moonlight—is signaled early ("The brush worked via daydreams sparked by moonlight") and constrains tactics: Anya must wait for moon angle and tip the brush into the silver path to receive new daydreams. It appears in at least two beats (the first inscriptions, the caravan daydream, the tide chart). The method shapes attempts but is not tested under pressure or paid off with visible cost at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse is established in the opening line and pressures every beat: smog narrows when the moon can be seen, vents allow "ferny breath" to invite strangers, plants are watered with the inscribed can, terracotta warms Anya's palm. The setting supplies resources (moonlight, glass panes for writing, stairwells for marking) and charges the closure image ("the greenhouse kept breathing in saffron quiet"). Removal would break the story's spatial and atmospheric logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The waxing moon is present in the opening, its angle is tracked ("At intervals the smog thinned, and the moon threw a silver path"), and it governs when Anya can write. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions; the moon is a recurring condition, not a live clock. The phrase "under a waxing moon's glow" recurs in the final paragraph but does not reweight stakes or create urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Anya's motivation—to prove strangers remember kindness—is dramatized across all beats: she writes inscriptions, opens vents, offers tea, records gifts in the ledger. It faces friction (the city is smog-choked, strangers arrive by chance, no guarantee of recognition) and drives the accumulative arc. The final glyph ("keep faith, keep doors open") crystallizes the motivation. Cost is visible: nightly labor, solitude, patience. The ledger serves as on-page proof of this friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Saffron quiet" is introduced in the opening and recurs in the final line ("the greenhouse kept breathing in saffron quiet"), creating a purposeful frame. The tone modulates with pressure—visitor exchanges are calm, daydreams deepen mood, the city "thudded like a muffled drum"—and charges the closure image with warmth and stillness. The color and sensory quality are consistent and voice-specific. Minor dock: the tone is more static mood than dynamic charge; it supports rather than transforms the final image.</comment>
