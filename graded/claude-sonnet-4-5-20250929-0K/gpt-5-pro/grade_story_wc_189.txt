<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is richly particular—"I listened sideways, to light skimming barnacles"—and contradictory impulses emerge through the tension between cataloging (observational safety) and relational risk. Embodied emotion lands in gestures like "my hand kept the hinge warm" and the cicada pressing cool against skin. The final choice to "cross this mouth of water with you until the footing names itself" earns Earned Stasis through sustained causality, though the reflective density occasionally abstracts immediate pressure. Minor penalty for elevated diction at peak beats ("crossings between states were holy work") that tilts toward thematic label-speak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The grotto anchors who/where/when by line 1; the dominant stake (stay or leave the coast) is signaled at line 4 and accumulates pressure through sensory deepening and the cicada's evolving charge. Closure achieves Earned Stasis when the narrator refuses immediate decision but commits to shared crossing, forecloses the demand for resolution, and reweights the premise ("the will waits on a question spoken without the demand to end it"). Cost is felt in the refusal itself and the acceptance of sustained uncertainty. One meaningful tightening occurs when the cicada's symbolic weight shifts from "fossil of change" to active permission ("leaving is a form of arrival"), then pays off in the final image of the cicada sleeping, "content to wait."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The grotto's drip/hush, tidal pools, and barnacle-lit surfaces constrain observation and choice throughout; the narrator reads "braille in water" and learns to answer "sideways," making the cave's acoustics and tidal clock active participants. Sensory hierarchy reflects the chronicler's professional filter—pools, molting crab, snail bridging slick—and the physical act of pressing palm to stone in the penultimate beat grounds the closing vow. The jade cicada functions as micro-setting, its cool weight and green glaze anchoring reflection and the final turn. Spatial choreography (knees in low tide, walking out as tide turns) tracks cleanly and the tidal clock charges the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (leave or stay) is clear by line 4 and pressure coheres through the partner's trembling voice and the narrator's evasion. The tightening occurs when the narrator shifts from cataloging avoidance to naming the method: "I do not know if I will stay, but I know how the mussels hold and release." This forecloses false certainty and opens a costlier path—sustained ambiguity as shared work. The grotto's "older yes" and the partner's laugh dissolve the demand for resolution, not by victory but by "courtesy to change," making the cost relational and temporal. Agency is decision to defer decision with visible price: prolonged uncertainty and mutual vulnerability.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The theme of transition and threshold emerges concretely through molt, tide-shift, and the cicada as burial token for "a second song." The final image—cicada asleep, tide vowing at ankles, pause ending with "salt on our tongues, a map we would follow slowly together"—offers a non-literal answer: patience as allowing arrival rather than forcing it. No moralizing; the grotto's "older yes" and the will's two-clock structure ground the abstract in particulars (mussels' hold/release, snail bridging slick). Subtext operates through silence and the partner's soundless laugh. Minor penalty for one thematic echo in the narrator's articulation of "crossings between states were holy work," which borders on prompt language, though it's attributed to the partner as teaching rather than present epiphany.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a richly idiosyncratic perceptual signature: "warmly observant sorter of gleams, slow grazers, and respiring sand." Diction is elevated but consistent with a literate chronicler's lens, and purposeful compression ("the pause ended, its salt on our tongues") serves the lyric design. The partner's voice appears in indirect summary ("You said that patience was not waiting but allowing a shore to arrive"), maintaining focalization. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close embodiment (hand on cicada) to wider reflection (notebooks, first learning), always anchored to present stimuli. Minor penalty for one filter-verb stack in mid-section ("I felt," "I thought," "I remembered") that slightly dulls immediacy, though voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully—short declaratives at the peak choice ("I said, I do not know if I will stay") contrast with longer lyric arcs earlier. Information density is high; nearly every line advances image, stakes, or interiority. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor deductions: elevated metaphoric density in the opening third (drip/hush, braille in water, throat of rock, slick of a star) occasionally slows momentum without pattern-teaching, and one near-synonym pair ("letting our words fade" / "the silence spilled") in adjacent beats. The closure beat is clean and propulsive. Within-band penalty totals −0.4 for density and one redundancy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of tidal-pool chronicler observing transition through a jade burial cicada offers a fresh angle on relationship-ambiguity material. The tangential-approach method (watching snail rather than answering directly) is specific and earned through prior craft. The trope of "difficult conversation" is transformed by embedding it in occupational expertise (tide-flat teacher, chronicler's ledger) and by using the cicada's cultural function (tongue-waking token) non-decoratively. The final image—pause ending with "salt on our tongues, a map"—feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in structure (heavy reflection interleaved with micro-choices) succeeds without obscuring clarity. No proximity echoes detected; voice and stakes cohere.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: present from line 3. Development: the chronicler's observational habit shapes the evasive catalog (line 17–18) and the decision to answer via the snail (line 24), constraining direct response. Payoff: the final choice ("I do not choose tonight, but I agree to cross this mouth of water with you until the footing names itself") is enabled by the chronicler's trained patience and sideways approach. Cost: the profession's ledger-keeping is revealed as "a fear of being caught by waves without a ledger to hold me steady," and letting go of that safety is the price. Causal across three beats; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setup: introduced line 6, handled physically. Development: turned in palm (line 8), its coolness and hum felt against skin (line 13), its glaze read by pools; functions as pocket shrine and then permission ("leaving is a form of arrival," line 28). Payoff: tucked back into cloth (line 38), sleeps in final image (line 43), "content to wait"—its evolving state mirrors and enables the narrator's choice to defer choice. Three distinct beats; charged reprise; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: signaled via cicada ("fossil of change," line 7), molt/threshold language (line 15). Development: "crossings between states" explicitly named (line 15) and the two-clock idea (water/will, line 36) shapes the narrator's refusal to force resolution. Payoff: "courtesy to change" (line 38) and the closing map/vow embody transition as method. The concept constrains the narrator's answer and charges the Earned Stasis. Causal across beats; strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: self-described line 3 ("warmly observant sorter"). Development: the trait enables the catalog-as-answer tactic (line 18) and listening sideways (line 11), but "warmly" does not constrain a choice with visible cost—observational patience does that work. Payoff: the warmth colors the closing shared vow but is not causally indispensable. One clear beat; modest cost linkage; partially swappable with "patient" or "attentive."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: stated method line 11 ("I had learned to foresee only through tangential approach"). Development: the narrator's sideways watching (snail, crab) enacts it (line 12, 18) and enables the catalog-answer that shifts the conversation (line 24). Payoff: "I could suddenly foresee a way to answer that would honor both shorelines" (line 33) directly invokes the method at the turn. Two beats; causal; strong closure linkage. Small swappability penalty: "observe" or "understand" could replace "foresee" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup: named line 11. Development: dramatized in the snail-watching beat (line 12) and the catalog offer (line 17–18) that deflects direct demand. Payoff: the method produces the turn ("I could suddenly foresee a way to answer," line 33) and the indirect final answer (two-clock teaching, mussels' hold/release). Two beats; mechanics shown and matter. Modest swappability: "indirect" or "oblique" could substitute with minor tonal shift.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setup: anchored line 1 (grotto under stars). Development: the cave's drip/hush, pooled water, and acoustics enable the narrator's sideways reading (line 8, 11) and the grotto's "older yes" (line 19) resolves the pressure without persuasion. Payoff: pressing palm to the wall (line 42) and the tide's vow at ankles (line 43) supply the closing physical anchor. Three beats; irreplaceable constraint; charges closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: framed line 2 ("across the pause in a difficult conversation"). Development: the pause's duration is felt in the silence spilling (line 5) and the partner's hitching breath (line 16), creating urgency for the narrator's answer. Payoff: "The pause ended" (line 44) marks closure and the tidal turn co-times it. Two gates; moderate pressure. Deduction: exact elapsed time is vague; the pause functions more as metaphor than clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Setup: stated line 9 ("we had come to discover the texture of time"). Development: the narrator's reflection on tidal versus willed clocks (line 36) and the memory of learning patience (line 22) dramatize the desire in conflict with the partner's demand for decision. Payoff: the closing image—"texture of time rough and smooth at once, like a scallop's edge" (line 40)—fulfills the desire and the final shared map (line 44) embodies it. Two beats; cost is prolonged uncertainty; strong closure linkage.</comment>
