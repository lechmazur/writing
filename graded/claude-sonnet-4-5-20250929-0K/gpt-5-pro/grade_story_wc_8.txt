<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara is defined primarily by her professional role and method ("emotionally rational," "drawing parallels") rather than embodied contradictions or visceral stakes. Her interiority reads as task-oriented exposition—"she feels her throat heat, then cools it with numbers, pages, dates"—which summarizes emotion rather than enacting it under pressure. Tomas offers a credible counterweight with worry and resistance, but his pivot to collaboration arrives without dramatized internal friction or visible cost. The closure choice (publishing as calendar, not vengeance) is stated rather than shown forecloses a live option with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive promptly (platform, Mara, satchel, purpose), and the piece sustains a situational lens through accumulation of archival detail. However, the closure unit—agreeing to publish the ledgers—lacks on-page decisive change or visible cost; the shift from "rescue" to "build" is announced by Tomas rather than dramatized through a choice that narrows options or imposes sacrifice. The causal chain (illuminated letter → cipher → parallels → brick → ledgers → neighbors → publication agreement) is legible but largely procedural, and the final promise ("rescue truth from any pit of lies") reads as thematic recap rather than a reweighted stake or charged image. Cost is conceptual but not felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The disused station, ivy, western stair, and shaft are vividly rendered and materially constrain the retrieval (ladder, descent, lamps, brick seam). Ivy functions both as atmosphere and as a charged parallel to the illuminated letter's vines, embedding the method in the setting. Spatial choreography (platform → booth → stair → shaft → bench) remains coherent, and the pit's physicality pressures the choice to descend. The final image—ivy "nails itself to what stands"—recharges the setting metaphorically, though the metaphor announces itself rather than emerging through action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rescuing buried names and truths—is signaled early and guides every beat. Pressure accumulates through the cipher work, descent, and ledger discovery, with Tomas's resistance providing situational friction. However, escalation plateaus after the ledgers are hauled up; the neighbors' arrival and the decision to publish unfold without a tightening choice or visible trade-off. The line "mercy or memory" gestures toward moral calculus, but Mara's stance is already fixed, and no on-page cost (risk, sacrifice, forfeiture) is dramatized to earn the resolution. One meaningful deepening—exposing the council's detour rather than fire—shapes tactics but does not force a pivot with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (noble lies vs. rooted truth; erasure vs. memory) emerges organically from the ledger discovery and the ivy/illuminated-letter parallel. The metaphor "truth, like ivy, nails itself to what stands" is purposeful but borders on explicit statement. Subtext operates in Tomas's reluctance and Mara's controlled emotion, though the final passage—"Fictional Historian Statement," method tagged in the margin—tilts toward meta-commentary rather than earned resonance. The piece resists simplistic moralizing by positioning the ledgers as "calendar of what happened, not a call to vengeance," yet the ending asserts this stance rather than dramatizing the choice's ambiguity or cost. The central question (what does unmasking cost?) is posed but not answered with particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Mara with clean focalization; no head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric, archival texture—"breath chalking the air," "a name flares at him"—that fits the historian frame and modulates under pressure (descent tightens syntax). Dialogue is sparse but functional: Tomas's "You will blister the town" and Mara's "A mask that protects by erasing a worker's death is a mask that steals breath forever" pursue goals and carry subtext. However, Mara's speech occasionally drifts into thesis statement ("by drawing parallels, so the town can see itself from two angles and walk a middle rail"), and the final self-narration ("Fictional Historian Statement… Method, by drawing parallels") breaks immersion to tag the prompt elements.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose is ambitious and image-rich ("ivy breathes a green hush," "her throat heat, then cools it with numbers"), with varied syntax and purposeful rhythm. However, the piece suffers from figurative density that occasionally muddles clarity: "the pit of lies sighs like a mouth finally uncorked" mixes metaphors (sighs/uncorked), and "fictional historian" is both role and concept without embodied grounding. Repetitive phrasing appears in adjacent lines—"they call it the pit of lies, and only the ivy knows the names it keeps" echoes "the pit of lies" from two sentences prior without adding pressure. The final third stacks exposition ("She explains that a fictional historian crafts truths that breathe, and then tags her method in the margin") that reads as scaffolding for the prompt rather than scene pressure. Filter verbs ("watches with worry," "feels her throat heat") cluster in mid-pressure beats, dulling immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "fictional historian" frame and method of "drawing parallels" (illuminated letter vines → ivy → cipher) offer a fresh procedural hook, and the specificity of the detour/strike-night ledger avoids generic conspiracy. However, the core premise—uncovering a civic lie buried in archives—is familiar, and the piece does not transform it through moral ambiguity or an earned cost that complicates the reveal. Mara's stance is fixed from the opening, and the resolution (publish as calendar, not vengeance) is announced rather than tested. The ivy/illuminated-letter parallel is clever but feels engineered to serve the method requirement; removing it would not fundamentally alter the discovery or its stakes. Risk is present in the descent and exposure, but the piece retreats from dramatizing the social or personal price, opting instead for a tidy collaborative closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Mara (fictional historian) drives the investigation, decodes the cipher, and initiates the descent and publication. Her decisions create key turns (finding the brick, calling neighbors), but her choices are largely procedural rather than constrained by internal conflict or trade-offs. Setup and payoff are present; middle development shows her method in action. Swappability is low (the role matters), but causal pressure is moderate—she executes a plan without pivoting under cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The illuminated letter appears in the opening (setup), is handled twice (traced against ivy, checked in the shaft), and returns in the final scene ("golden strokes catching the moon"). Its vines parallel the ivy and guide the cipher, giving it causal and thematic weight. However, its role is largely symbolic after the brick is found; removing it would require only minor rewrites to the method. Closure linkage is present but ornamental rather than decisive.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Noble lies (council's phantom fire vs. real detour) frame the stakes and are dramatized through the ledger discovery and Tomas's worry. The concept shapes Mara's purpose and the neighbors' choice. However, the moral calculus is declared rather than tested on the page—no scene pressures Mara to weigh mercy vs. memory with visible sacrifice. Setup, development, and payoff are present; causal pressure is moderate; closure is thematic rather than decisively shaped by the concept's friction.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Emotionally rational" is labeled in the opening and invoked once mid-story ("she is emotionally rational, and so are her reasons"), but it does not constrain or enable a specific choice with cost. The trait is told rather than shown through contradictory impulses or a trade-off that tests it. No middle development or closure participation; swappability is high—the trait could be omitted without altering her actions.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Recapture" drives the entire arc: Mara recaptures the ledgers, names, and timetable, and the final agreement commits to recapturing the town's history. The action is signaled early, enacted physically (descent, hauling bundles), and shapes the closure (publication as recapture). Setup, development, and payoff are strong; causal pressure is high; irreplaceability is solid. One minor friction: the final "recapture truth from any pit of lies" line feels like a tag rather than a charged image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Drawing parallels" is signaled early and executed on the page: Mara aligns letter vines to ivy, serifs to chisel marks, and later uses the method to show the town "itself from two angles." The method enables the cipher solution and the final rhetorical frame. Setup and payoff are present; middle development is visible in the brick-finding beat. However, the method's mechanics are more asserted than dramatized—"by drawing parallels" appears as a label rather than a constrained process. Cost connection is weak; the method succeeds without friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The disused railway station overgrown with ivy is introduced immediately, materially constrains the action (western stair, shaft, descent), and charges the final image (ivy "nails itself to what stands"). The ivy parallels the illuminated letter and embodies the theme. Setup, development, and payoff are strong; causal pressure is high (the pit and shaft force the descent); closure linkage is direct. Irreplaceability is solid—swapping to another setting would require substantial rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the final petal drops" is mentioned in the opening but never returns or constrains a choice. Time is vague throughout (no clock pressure, no urgency tied to the petal/rosebush image). The phrase reads as atmospheric setup without middle development or closure participation. Swappability is high; removing it would not alter the narrative arc or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"To rescue truth from a pit of lies" is Mara's stated purpose, drives her investigation and descent, and is restated in the closing promise. The motivation is present across beats and shapes the closure. However, it is declared rather than conflicted—Mara never wavers or pays a visible personal price for the rescue. Setup and payoff are strong; middle development shows the motivation in action; cost connection is conceptual but not felt. Causal pressure is solid; irreplaceability is high.</comment>
