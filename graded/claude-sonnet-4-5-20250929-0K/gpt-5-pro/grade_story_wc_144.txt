<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's blindness generates purposeful constraints (water-bowl navigation, drone interpretation), and her repair choices are goal-driven. However, interiority remains thin; we see competence without internal contradiction or competing wants. Jaro and the yardhands are functional props rather than sources of relational pressure. The final stance—calm stewardship—feels asserted rather than earned through visible cost or renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors clearly by line 4 (Mara, depot, blindness). The closure crystallizes her role as listening steward when the anchor rises, reweighting prior sensory particulars with calm authority. Cost is conceptual (sustained attention under time pressure) but legible. One meaningful deepening occurs when the drone returns damaged and she decodes its feedback under the ship's deadline, narrowing the window and raising stakes modestly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The depot's mist, rails, bowls, and acoustic texture are vivid and filtering through Mara's non-visual perception. The water bowls constrain her navigation method and charge the ending when they "brighten" as the anchor lifts. Spatial choreography (bench, door, pier, flood grate) tracks cleanly. The rail-and-harbor setting pressures the time window and supplies the closure image (anchor, foam, hulls).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: locate the crate before the ship departs. One tightening occurs when the drone returns damaged, forcing repair under time pressure. The yardhands' coordinated retrieval is enabled by Mara's tone-direction, but the resolution feels smooth—no visible trade-off or foreclosed path. Coincidence (gulls, flood grate discovery) complicates without Mara's agency driving the turn. Cost is implied (sustained focus) but not felt as a sacrifice on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme—listening translates chaos into motion—emerges through water-bowl mechanics and the "listening until the world answered" final line. The closing image of rising anchor and "city relearning balance" reweights the artisan's quiet work without moralizing. However, the conceptual cost remains oblique; no prior material registers a tension between listening and acting. The piece gestures toward resonance but does not press a question hard enough to make the answer non-obvious.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mara; psychic distance is consistent. Perceptual signature is strong: sound, texture, echo, oil scent filter all observation. Jaro's brief narration ("bollards, ropes, men") is clearly mediated by Mara's request and does not leak interiority. Diction is elevated and patterned ("iron prayers," "magnetic calm," "syllables promising") in a way that reads purposeful but occasionally slips into poetic stock ("mist-coated," "breathed like a sleeping animal") without fresh specificity. Dialogue is minimal and functional.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in the repair and navigation beats. However, patterned stock metaphors cluster: "breathed like a sleeping animal," "iron prayers," "magnetic calm," "day opened across engines and waves." The final paragraph loops thematic summary ("one artisan listened until the world answered in kind") that restates rather than sharpens. Figurative language in most lines of the opening and closing beats without clear payoff applies −0.5. Clarity and propulsion remain solid in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Blind artisan using refracted light through water as sonar/nav is a fresh synthesis of assistive tech and sensory translation. The hummingbird drone and rail-depot setting combine purposefully. However, the plot structure—find lost object under time pressure—is template-standard, and the ending's calm triumph lacks a non-obvious turn. The water-bowl method is specific but introduced more as aesthetic detail than a constraint that shapes a difficult choice. Moderate risk in sensory POV but safe narrative arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout, repairs the drone, interprets feedback, and sends the tone-direction. She shapes two beats (repair, decode-and-direct) and the ending image centers her listening. However, her choices feel procedural rather than conflicted; removing "heartfelt" as a trait would not alter any action. Causal pressure is modest; cost is not visible.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The drone appears damaged (beat 1), is patched (beat 2), searches and tags the crate (beat 3), and returns "sturdy now" at closure. It drives three beats and its repaired wing becomes a micro-metaphor for restored function. Specificity (carbon lattice, magnetic beak, wingbeat counting) matters. Strong integration; slightly short of indispensable because a generic tracker could substitute with moderate edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The repair shop frames Mara's competence and houses the tools/bowls. Repair (patching the drone) enables the search and is causal. The shop itself does not constrain later choices—the search happens outside—but the opening and closing beats anchor here, and the resonance of "repair" (drone, logistics, balance) charges the ending. Setup and payoff present; middle beat (the patch) is shop-located. Functional but could be a navigation hub with similar effect.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Oversees while blind" is signaled early, constrains her method (bowls, echo, Jaro's narration), and enables the sensory-translation tactics across all beats. The attribute shapes two distinct problem-solving moments (repair by touch, decode by tone). Cost is implicit (sustained attention, reliance on Jaro) but not dramatized as a tradeoff. The ending reaffirms "she oversees while blind, stewarding passage with listening." Strong causal role; visible cost would push higher.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Patch" is the first major action, enables the drone's return flight, and directly unlocks the search. It appears early (first third), is handled on the page with tactile detail (resin, mesh, carbon lattice), and its success determines all subsequent beats. The closure references the patch drying into strength. Causal and closure-linked. Swappability test: "repair" is broader; "patch" is specific to torn wing, so modest irreplaceability. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Water-bowl refraction is introduced early, used to interpret the drone's tones into a spatial map ("Track Three sang hollow"), and reappears at closure when "bowls brightened" as the anchor lifts. The method shapes two beats (initial decode, final confirmation) and charges the ending image. However, the mechanics remain atmospheric—Mara "tunes" rather than troubleshoots—so it reads more as sensory flavor than a constraint that alters her tactics under friction. Setup and payoff present; causal pressure is light.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The depot is anchored early with mist, rails, harbor, bowls, and acoustic texture. It supplies the drone's launch/return points, the time pressure (ship departure), and the closure image (anchor, foam, hulls). The setting pressures Mara's method (sound, echo) and provides the yardhands' coordination space. The mist thickens per Jaro's report, subtly affecting visibility. Micro-setting (bowls, bench) and macro (harbor, tracks) both constrain. Strong setting integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The timeframe is signaled early ("as an anchor lifts for a ship's maiden voyage") and repeated at the closure beat. It creates urgency for the crate retrieval and tightens Mara's decode window. However, elapsed time is not tracked beat-by-beat; the clock remains atmospheric rather than a live countdown that alters tactics on the page. The ending pays off the frame when "the anchor rose clear of foam." Setup and closure present; middle pressure is implied but not sharp.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Mara's motivation—"to decode feedback into direction before others mistook noise for truth"—is stated mid-story and dramatized when she interprets the drone's pings and sends the tone to the yardhands. It shapes one key beat (decode-and-direct) and aligns with the ending's "listening until the world answered." However, no friction or cost complicates the want; she succeeds smoothly. The motivation is told more than tested. Functional but not conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>"Magnetic calm" is named twice and matches the story's measured, competent tone. The prose rhythm (long sentences, patterned diction) reinforces stillness. Tone modulates slightly when the drone returns damaged ("exhausted shiver") and when the crowd's hush "quickened," but pressure remains muted throughout. The final image—"magnetic calm... depot breathed... timing forgave everyone"—charges the ending with the tone's thematic weight. Coherent and closure-linked but static across turns; no tonal friction under rising stakes.</comment>
