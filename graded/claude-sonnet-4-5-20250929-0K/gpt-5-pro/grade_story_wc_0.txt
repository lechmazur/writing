<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The neutron star researcher's voice is highly specific and consistent, filtering the greenhouse through scientific habits ("preprocesses reality into gradients," "timing a pulsar"). Motivation to "strip needless drama" is embodied in concrete choices: marking salvageable panes, prioritizing green-hearted orchids, drafting a report over sermonizing. The botanist remains lightly sketched but functional. Internal contradiction is present but subtle—the researcher claims to avoid drama yet finds poetic resonance everywhere—and could press harder at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: pressure builds through density increase and pattern layering (dust maps, orchid triage, report drafting, children at the panes). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): the greenhouse becomes "a star made humble," reweighting the opening salt-and-metal arrival with a visible cost—half light, half hours, gradual repair over heroic vow. Orientation is immediate (post-flood greenhouse, researcher POV). One micro turn (botanist's arrival with tea) deepens without fragmenting the accumulative design. Cost is felt in the renunciation of full restoration and the quiet acceptance of what remains.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The storm-damaged greenhouse is vividly particular: silt-white benches, brine-drinking orchids, bronze butterfly dust along fractures. Spatial choreography is clean (panes, vents, potting table, puddles). The dust functions as micro-setting, constraining interpretation (reading which vents failed) and charging the final image (children steering by windows). Sensory hierarchy reflects the researcher's professional lens. One minor slip: "drowned notebooks" are introduced late and feel more thematic than spatially grounded in the moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is recovery method—gradual vs. dramatic repair—signaled early ("strip needless drama") and tested throughout (chalking seams, saving least-dramatic orchids, drafting a slope-shaped schedule). Agency is decision and renunciation with visible cost: replanting at half capacity, hand fans before motors, composting the dead. Escalation reads as accumulative deepening: triage narrows to partnership with the botanist, then expands to teaching children, each beat reweighting the opening forensic stance. The "slope" metaphor coheres pressure across all moves. No antagonist required; the flood's aftermath supplies persistent constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—dignified decay as generative process—emerges from dust maps, orchid arithmetic, pulsar patience, and the final "star made humble" without overt statement. The neutron-star/greenhouse synthesis is non-obvious and earns resonance through recurring images: spin-down, gradual change, closed arithmetic. The ending reweights the opening's "salt and metal" forensics into communal pedagogy (children learning to steer by windows), answering the implicit question of how to honor what remains. Subtext operates in the researcher's refusal of sermon, the botanist's river-lined boots, the radio beacons—no line declares meaning. One phrase—"kindled humility"—borders on thematic echo but functions more as report diction than moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single POV with a distinct perceptual signature: the researcher notices vents, gradients, coherence, beats. Vocabulary is precise and voice-consistent ("lepidopteran air," "closed wild arithmetic"). Psychic distance is stable; free indirect style is clean. One dialogue exchange with the botanist is brief, functional, and voice-appropriate. Figurative language intensifies under pressure without obscuring clarity: "riverbeds left in the air," "butterflies taught to write." Minor note: the repeated "decay" and "slope" terms approach saturation in the final third but remain legible and purpose-driven rather than looped.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines layer image, action, and thematic weight ("The wings were once gentle, but the flood taught them to write"). Rhythm varies purposefully, balancing long reflective sentences with clipped declaratives in the triage passages. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative coherence is strong except for one mixed vehicle: "drumline of plastic and branches and patience" conflates percussion with endurance in a way that strains sense. Opening and closing lines charge the frame effectively. Minor deduction for density of metaphor in the final third—most sentences carry figurative weight, approaching but not crossing into overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The neutron-star-researcher-as-greenhouse-restorer synthesis is non-obvious and sustained through lived detail (forensic meteorology, pulsar timing, spin-down vocabulary). The dust-as-map conceit is specific and irreplaceable. Emotional truth—accepting half-light rather than vowing heroic recovery—resists the template redemption arc. Conceptual integrity: the "gradual change" premise is followed rigorously into tactics, structure, and tone. Risk: the accumulative/lyric design without a decisive confrontation could feel static, but here it heightens stakes by making patience itself the crucible. Transformation test passes: swap the greenhouse for another setting and the emotional arc collapses.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The neutron star researcher identity shapes perception (preprocesses reality, reads dust like pulsars), drives key choices (marking panes, prioritizing green-hearted orchids, drafting a gradual-repair report vs. sermon), and charges the closure ("star made humble"). Present throughout, causally active in triage and pedagogy beats, and indispensable to the thematic synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Butterfly-wing dust is introduced early ("bronze that refuses to be scrubbed"), used functionally in the middle (mapping vent failure and wind pressure), and returns with reweighted meaning at closure (children learn to steer by dust charts, not only suns). Drives at least two beats (forensic reading, pedagogical moment) and charges the final image. Removing it would collapse the "scribes" conceit and the window-navigation closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Gradual change is the spine: motivates every tactic (hand fans before motors, half hours, slope-testing), shapes the report structure (rising softly), and defines the final stance (working the slope vs. vowing cliffs). Present in the opening paragraph, tested across triage and planning beats, and crystallized in the closure image. The story would fail without this exact organizing principle; swapping it for "resilience" or "recovery" would gut the accumulative pressure and the pulsar metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Preprocesses reality into gradients" enables the dust-map reading, the triage taxonomy (least dramatic orchids), and the slope-over-cliff report framing. Visible in at least two distinct beats and tied to cost (renouncing drama means accepting half-restoration). Could score higher if a moment dramatized a tradeoff where this preprocessing caused a missed emotional cue or friction with the botanist.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Decay is the action lens throughout: reading decay patterns in dust and orchids, deciding what to compost vs. clean, turning decay into pedagogy ("closed wild arithmetic"). Drives the triage choice, the report's framing, and the closure's "decay as giving back." Not easily swappable; replacing it with "damage" or "loss" would flatten the story's temporal and generative dimension. Introduced early, active in multiple beats, and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Reading through accumulated dust patterns is introduced early (dust along fractures), used as the forensic method (tracing vent failures, wind pressure), and returns at closure (children learn to steer by dust charts). Shapes at least two beats (initial assessment, teaching moment) and provides the conceptual bridge between neutron-star observation and greenhouse restoration. Mechanics matter: the dust must accumulate and persist to be readable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Storm-damaged greenhouse is the spatial frame for all action, supplies the immediate constraint (what can be salvaged), and its state drives every choice (replace eastern panes, reopen at half capacity). The cracked roof, taped seams, and river-visible setting pressure the triage and closure. Removing this exact setting—substituting a lab or garden—would eliminate the dust, the orchids, and the spatial metaphor that charges "star made humble." Present throughout, causally essential, and indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"After the flood" anchors the inciting condition, drives urgency (community wants a report, debris still moving), and shapes the botanist's arrival (boots dark with river lines). The timeframe tightens the triage window and the children's visit marks forward motion. Not a live ticking clock, but the aftermath pressure is consistent and alters tactics (gradual repair rather than waiting for full restoration funding).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Strip needless drama" is dramatized in concrete choices: marking only essential panes, saving least-dramatic orchids, drafting a report over a sermon, choosing slope over cliff. Present in the opening beat, tested in the triage sequence, and crystallized in the final report framing and pedagogy. Friction between the desire to avoid drama and the poetic noticing everywhere (butterflies as scribes, stars as teachers) is present but understated; stronger conflict between this drive and an emotional impulse would lift the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Kindled humility is coherent throughout: the researcher honors what remains without sermonizing, accepts half-light as sufficient, teaches children without grandiosity. Tone modulates appropriately—forensic at the start, warmer with the botanist, pedagogical at the end—without breaking the underlying stance. The closing image ("greenhouse begins to feel like a star made humble") charges the tone with conceptual cost. Minor note: "kindled humility" appears once as a phrase in the report paragraph, bordering on self-annotation, but functions as diction rather than theme-label.</comment>
