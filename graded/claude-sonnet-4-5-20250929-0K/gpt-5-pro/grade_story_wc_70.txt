<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The toll keeper's involuntary truthfulness is embodied through concrete choices (asking for "reason" as toll, revealing the riddle when asked) and the lightning-kiss origin provides visceral grounding. Mara's worry and engineering mindset come through in action and diagnosis ("algorithm had overtrained the drones"). Internal contradiction appears when the keeper balances his compulsion with the craft of preservation, and the final choice to open the lacquer box again is earned. Minor slip: Mara's laugh "without relief" while "still standing near the cliff's edge" leans slightly toward label-only emotion rather than full embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (toll keeper), where (tower), and when (after blackout, nectar dusk) by the opening lines. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered images (dry fountain → harp → coil → sky writing cursive) and the closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the tower remembers its vocation, the keeper commits to the craft of wonder-preservation with visible cost ("words tasted like something sweet a hive might save"). One meaningful deepening occurs when the brass coil catalyzes the harp's song, reweighting all prior particulars. Cost is legible: the keeper's compulsion isolates him ("nuisance at markets") and his treasury is "strange," yet he persists.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tower, harp, lacquer box, matchbox, and coil function as micro-setting that constrains choices: the phosphorus glow reveals the seam, the harp's silence blocks the tower's function, the coil restarts the cycle. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("nectar dusk," "honeyed and smoky," "ghost line that glowed thinly"). The final image—tower holding "the largest flame, steady and speaking"—charges closure. Spatial choreography is clear (queue, stair, bench, panel, brush ring). The recurring objects (lacquer box, matchbox) reappear with reweighted meaning at the end.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: restore the drones to preserve wonder and power the tower. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mara diagnoses the algorithmic failure and the keeper must reveal the riddle, then the coil introduction narrows options decisively. The protagonist's agency (choosing to reveal, mounting the coil) drives the resolution with visible cost: his compulsion to truth and his isolation are the price. The escalation is textural (harp silent → coil wound → drones remember → tower speaks) and coheres under the Accumulative lens. Minor: the firmware-patch coda slightly diffuses the earned causality, though the keeper's closing stance reclaims it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—preserving wonder against routine—emerges through concrete particulars: the drones "forgetting the dance," the harp needing "wild, uneven music," the keeper collecting stories as toll. The riddle ("Strike none, but strike one; find the song that climbs") operates as earned subtext, not sermon. The final image ("let the sky teach us, once more, how to be astonished") reweights prior material without stating a moral; it answers the central question through image and the keeper's renewed commitment. The lacquer box and brass coil accrue symbolic weight through use, not assertion. No thematic echo or prompt-language intrusion mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "speech exited me involuntarily truthful," "words tasted like something sweet a hive might save." Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("candid toll keeper," "nectar dusk"). Mara's dialogue carries subtext ("frowns the way an engineer frowns") and her single line of direct speech advances plot. Internal texture remains consistent under pressure; the keeper's reflections anchor in present stimuli (box, matchbox, sky). Minor: "They were excellent at routine but had lost the shimmer that made currents notice them" risks slight register drift into abstract summary, though it recovers quickly with the coil action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create texture. Information density is high: most lines advance character, plot, or atmosphere. The phosphorus-glow sequence is concise and propulsive. Minor issues: "I asked for toll not in coins but in reason, because reason was scarce and I was hired to gather it" and "Also, I collect wonder as toll, and lies never pay enough" are near-paraphrases of the same thematic claim; a template-cadence check flags "I cannot, I told her" / "I reached beneath my bench" / "I slid a match" / "I watched the sky" clustering in mid-passage. These accumulate to −0.6 in Q7. No loops touch the closure beat, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The premise—lightning-induced truthfulness meets drone-beehive failure—synthesizes speculative elements into a coherent logic. The matchbox riddle, phosphorus glow, and brass-coil recording offer specific, non-obvious mechanics that feel inevitable in hindsight. The keeper's craft of preserving wonder through stories and curiosities transforms the toll-keeper archetype. Emotional specificity (Mara's cliff-edge laugh, the keeper's sweet-hive taste) avoids generic templates. Risk-taking (lyric compression, the cryptic riddle, the quiet ending) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, warranting a +0.3 within-band adjustment.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The toll keeper's choices create key turns: asking for reason as toll (first beat), revealing the riddle when asked (second beat), sliding the match to find the seam (third beat), and mounting the coil (closure participation). Early signal (first paragraph), three distinct beats, causal pressure (the reveal and coil-mounting narrow options), and closure linkage (final commitment to open the lacquer again) are all present. Specificity is high: the lightning-induced truthfulness and the craft of wonder-preservation are irreplaceable traits. Visible cost: isolation and compulsion.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The lacquer box appears in three beats: retrieved from beneath the bench (first touch), holding the matchbox and later the brass coil (second touch), and referenced in the final paragraph as the container for future wonder-preservation (closure reprise). Early signal (setup by midpoint), causal pressure (the box holds the tools that enable the solution), and closure linkage (the keeper will "open the lacquer" again) are present. The "red sheen that remembered fingerprints" and the wrap in waxed cloth add specificity. Swappability is low: the box's role as treasury is integral to the keeper's craft.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drone beehive failure shapes stakes (tower won't attract storms, gardens starve) and tactics (diagnose the algorithm failure, restart the harp with the coil). Early signal (Mara climbs with the problem in paragraph six), two beats (diagnosis, coil solution), causal pressure (the drones' loss of "shimmer" blocks the tower's function), and closure linkage (drones circle, tower speaks, keeper commits to preserving wonder). Specificity is high: the harp-and-draft mechanic and the "queen of motion" metaphor are irreplaceable. Cost is legible: the city's wonder and power supply depend on this fix.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Involuntary truthfulness constrains the keeper's choices: he reveals the riddle when asked ("I am sworn… to reveal what I know") and explains his compulsion to Mara ("the lightning put a wire in my throat"). It appears in setup (paragraph three) and closure (the keeper's commitment to tell "what I can, and sometimes more than I should"). Two beats, moderate causal pressure (the trait forces the reveal but doesn't directly solve the problem), and closure linkage are present. However, the trait's cost is asserted more than dramatized: "nuisance at markets but a blessing at the gate" tells rather than shows a visible tradeoff in this scene.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Reveal" drives two major beats: the keeper reveals the riddle to Mara (middle turn) and commits to revealing "what I can, and sometimes more than I should" (closure stance). Early signal (the keeper's sworn nature is established by paragraph fifteen), causal pressure (the reveal unlocks the riddle's use), and closure linkage (the final paragraph restates the craft of revelation). Specificity is moderate: the action could be generalized to "share knowledge," but the lightning-induced compulsion and the riddle's mechanics make it less swappable. Cost is present but light: the keeper's isolation is a price, though not sharply felt in this scene.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The matchbox containing the riddle appears in three beats: retrieved from the lacquer box (setup), the riddle read and interpreted (middle turn), and the match slid to reveal the seam (mechanics used). Early signal (midpoint), causal pressure (the riddle and match-glow unlock the harp), and closure linkage (the keeper will keep the matchbox near "because sometimes thunder needs a riddle"). Specificity is high: "Strike none, but strike one; find the song that climbs" and the phosphorus-glow mechanic are irreplaceable. The method shapes attempts rather than appearing only at the end.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The lightning collection tower pressures choices (drones must dance to prime the static brushes, the harp must sing to call storms) and supplies resources (the hidden panel, the brush ring, the flame at the end). Early signal (first paragraph: "dry fountain over the rooftops"), multiple beats (the tower's failure, the panel discovery, the tower "remembering its vocation"), and closure linkage (the tower holds "the largest flame, steady and speaking"). Micro-setting elements (harp, panel, brush ring) constrain tactics. Specificity is high: the tower's function as a storm-attractor and wonder-preserver is integral to the keeper's craft.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the city-wide blackout" establishes stakes (the tower and drones failed, the city needs power and wonder restored) and is signaled early (first paragraph). It appears in setup and is referenced at closure ("city lights coughed awake"). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions in real-time; no live clock alters tactics. The "that evening" frame is static mood-setting rather than a pressure device. Causal role is moderate: the blackout explains the problem but doesn't drive escalation beats. Cost is conceptual (the city's loss of wonder) but not urgent within the scene's minutes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to preserve wonder in routine" is dramatized through the keeper's choices: asking for stories as toll, revealing the riddle, mounting the coil, and committing to future wonder-collection. Early signal (implicit in the opening, explicit by "I collect wonder as toll"), two beats (the coil solution, the final commitment), and closure linkage (the keeper will "practice our craft… listening for the current that wants to leap"). Friction between wants and costs appears: the keeper's compulsion isolates him, and his treasury is "strange." However, the motivation is asserted more often than tested against a competing desire; the keeper never faces a choice that would abandon wonder for convenience.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Nectar dusk" as tone is signaled early ("That evening wore the tone of nectar dusk, the sky honeyed and smoky") and modulates with pressure: the sweetness persists through problem-solving and recurs at closure ("Nectar dusk comes again and again"). The tone charges the final image: the keeper's words "tasted like something sweet a hive might save," linking sensory texture to theme. Coherence is strong; the tone doesn't flatten under stress but sustains the lyric register. However, the tone is more atmospheric envelope than active constraint; it colors but doesn't pressure choices. Closure linkage is clear, but the tone's function is illustrative rather than causal.</comment>
