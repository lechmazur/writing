<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The reaper's interiority is dense and specific—grief embodied through the prism work, naming acts, and the snowfield memory—all showing contradictory impulses (duty versus mending distance). Motivation evolves from failure to cautious repair through micro-choices (writing "Not Leaving," then "Named"). The final naming of "Enough" earns its cost by prior causality. Minor: the voice occasionally edges toward abstract philosophizing ("fog makes cliffs feel taller") but recovers through concrete action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration: the reaper names their own fear ("Enough"), folding the atlas and leaving the lexicon burning—a visible stance shift with felt cost (accepting limitation after trying to repair all distance). Accumulative/textural lens holds: recordings layer into named monsters, tightening the dominant stake (giving names to nameless fears). Orientation anchors quickly (observatory, dusk, cassettes). One meaningful deepening occurs when the reaper's own voice returns and crystallizes into "Enough."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The observatory's cold stone, echoing dome, cracked prism, and projector constrain the naming ritual and charge the final image (lexicon burning). Body and tool (prism tilted, tape unspooled) enable crystallization through scattered light. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: mica dust, frost on eyelids, burnt glass. The atlas page functions as micro-setting, grounding each naming act.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—giving names to nameless fears—is signaled early and tightens through each recording/naming pair. Agency manifests in renunciation: the reaper names "Enough" and folds the atlas, foreclosing further mending with visible cost (leaving the snowfield memory unresolved). The echo of sacrifice applies pressure as "companion whose cloak stays near," holding the reaper responsible. One meaningful deepening when the reaper's own fear crystallizes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: naming as acceptance rather than control, mending distance through careful handles. The final image—naming one's own fear "Enough" and folding the atlas—offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the reaper's hesitations ("then hesitated, then wrote again") and the dome's faint stutter "that felt like pity." The snowfield memory anchors thematic weight (distance that broke, mending since). No prompt echo or thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: the reaper's metaphors are death-work specific (scythes, ledger of souls, cloak of alleyways). Diction remains stable and voice-particular ("heartbroken reaper," "ribs vibrate when grief leans in"). Psychic distance controlled; no head-hopping. Purposeful compression ("Small Payments," "Not Leaving") taught early and paid off at closure. Rhythm modulates under pressure—short fragments at the final naming, longer sentences for the snowfield memory.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>High information density; most lines layer image, action, and character (prism work, naming, atlas annotations). Rhythm varies purposefully. Minor loop: "echoes forgotten phrases" appears twice in similar phrasing without reweighting. Some figurative density in mid-beats ("grief leans in," "paper jaw and patient eyes") but coherent and earned. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks. The final paragraph propels cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Premise—reaper naming fears by crystallizing recordings through light—is specific and non-obvious. The observatory, prism mechanics, and atlas annotations cohere as singular vision. Risk: accumulative structure with lyric compression could obscure, but taught pattern holds. Transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on this exact synthesis of death-work, archival sound, and cartographic naming. The snowfield memory and "Enough" feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present throughout. Drives two key beats: the snowfield memory (motivation for mending distance) and the final naming/folding choice. Decisions alter tactics (writing "Named," then "Enough"). Causal pressure evident; closure depends on this character's renunciation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Atlas page handled in three beats: scrawled question marks beside monsters, writing "Not Leaving" and "Named" during recordings, and folding it at closure. Evolving use: static map → active naming surface → folded lexicon. Charges the final image. Irreplaceable; the sea-monster cartography anchors the naming conceit.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Echo of sacrifice personified ("companion whose cloak stays near") shapes the reaper's felt accountability and constrains the final choice. Recurs in approval ("as if approving the cost") and as pressure. Visible cost tied to it: the reaper cannot escape responsibility. Mid-band: more thematic presence than causal driver, but does tighten stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Observatory "echoes forgotten phrases" in its ribs; this enables the naming ritual (phrases crystallize through prism/sound). Constraint: the dome's acoustic properties matter—recordings must be played here. Payoff: dome returns the reaper's voice "as a stranger might return a glove." Two beats, causal role, closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Crystallization (via prism and scattered light) is the core action across five beats: syllables gather, promises make shapes, serpent arches, fears take form, reaper's own fear crystallizes. Drives every naming turn. Final image depends on crystallization having occurred. Not swappable; mechanics are specific and weight the closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Scattered light (via cracked prism and projector) is signaled early ("would only crystallize through scattered light") and mechanics matter: tilting the prism swarms vowels, enabling each naming. Shapes all attempts. Closure depends on this method having worked. Cost: the reaper must use broken tools (cracked prism).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Observatory supplies cold stone, echoing dome, mirrors, projector—all essential to the naming ritual. Dusk timing charges the orange light that catches the tape ribbon. Setting constrains choice (ritual must happen here) and supplies the lexicon-burning final image. Micro-setting (prism, atlas beside cassettes) alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Timeframe ("after finding") establishes causality: recordings prompt the naming attempt. Recurs as anchor (snowfield memory, earlier lighter voice). No live clock tightening decisions, but the after-frame motivates the entire journey. Lyric reprise: past recordings → present naming → lexicon kept burning.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Motivation stated early, dramatized in conflicted action: "I needed to give names...because unnamed things thicken into fog." Friction between wanting to control versus accepting ("not to control it, but to give it somewhere to stand"). Final choice (naming "Enough") enacts the motivation with visible cost: accepting limit. Two beats, closure-active.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distant intimacy coherent throughout: formal diction ("heartbroken reaper," "Keep the door") paired with embodied grief (ribs vibrate, warm atlas page). Modulates under pressure—shortest fragments at closure, longer rhythms for reflection. Charges final image: "kept our lexicon burning" fuses distance (lexicon, observatory) with intimacy (our). Tone inseparable from voice and stakes.</comment>
