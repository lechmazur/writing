<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior life is concrete and purposeful: "Because my hands always build for others, I said, but no one knows my name where I sleep" demonstrates embodied longing. The shift from isolation to tentative belonging is earned through micro-choices (accepting Neri's terms, weaving the bench, dedicating it publicly). Emotions remain layered and contradictory—"luminescent ache" as both hunger and hope—without therapy-speak. Minor slips: some secondary characters (the neighbors) appear late without distinct pressure, though the ending choice to "dedicate this seat" forecloses solitary work and opens to community with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens inferred as Accumulative/Textural with a decisive final act; the search for the sigil accumulates sensory and social pressure until the protagonist dedicates the bench, crystallizing the belonging-stake with cost. The sigil's discovery and the bench's placement form a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist's vow is translated into labor and community acceptance. Orientation is anchored early (crystalline orchard, crater, marsh-reed sculptor). One meaningful deepening suffices at this length: the search intensifies kinship webs, and the dedication forecloses the protagonist's prior anonymity. Cost is legible: "I felt held like light is held by water until someone drinks" reweights solitude into interdependence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard is vivid and purposeful: trunks refract silhouettes into "braided halos," quiet stones regulate temperature, and the obsidian arbor's gloss stitches faces together. Micro-setting qualifies when the arbor constrains the dedication ritual and charges the final image (the sigil blooms on its underside, the bench sits in "the arbor's cool mouth"). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (marsh reeds "salt still cataloged," fruit "tasted like the sound of rain on linen"). Minor gap: the crater's rim villages are mentioned but never pressure a choice, remaining ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early (to graft onto community) and sustained through the search and dedication. One meaningful tightening occurs when the sigil appears as reeds interlacing, directly answering the protagonist's craft before they ask—this narrows options from anonymous artisan to committed member. The dedication itself is a high-stakes renunciation of solitary work with visible cost: "I did not feel accepted like a document stamped; I felt held like light is held by water until someone drinks." Agency is protagonist-driven (weaving the bench, speaking the vow). The ending's Charged Poise crystallizes belonging as a "muscle of reaching," a constraint that will shape future work.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the search, the arbor, and the woven bench: belonging as labor, vulnerability, and co-creation rather than mere acceptance. The sigil's geometry—reeds parting and joining—offers a non-literal answer to the central question of grafting oneself into community. Subtext operates in Neri's "boldly sympathetic" gaze, the condensation mark that "held, silvering the air," and the neighbors pressing stories into the bench until "the weave remembered more than my wrists." The final image avoids moralizing: "Community was a muscle of reaching, a luminescent ache learning to hold and be held" synthesizes the particulars (bench, arbor, webs of kinship) into a resonant, earned insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person, intimate and lyric. Perceptual signature is consistent: the protagonist notices through craft metaphors (salt "cataloged," vows "breathe inside," bench as "lattice of anecdotes"). Diction is elevated but voice-motivated ("porous than solitude," "grammar of staying"). Dialogue is sparse but goal-driven: "Because my hands always build for others… I want to be woven in" advances plot and character. Minor slips: some figurative density in high-pressure beats ("braided halos," "luminescent ache," "silvering the air") borders on overwriting but remains legible and pattern-taught. No head-hopping; distance stays controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift between subject, prepositional, and participial. Information density is high: "They pressed their stories into the bench, a lattice of anecdotes, splinters smoothed by laughter, until the weave remembered more than my wrists" layers action, image, and thematic resonance. Minor artifice: some figurative phrasing accumulates without clear escalation ("glimmering," "shimmering," "luminescent" appear frequently), and a few lines near the climax risk purple prose ("webs of kinship trembled awake"). No loops or scaffolding detected. Propulsion is strong, with strategic telling compressing transit ("We walked between trunks") to preserve momentum for the dedication beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of street-artist tagging, marsh-reed craft, and arbor-as-threshold is specific and non-obvious. The sigil's answer (reeds interlacing) is earned in hindsight by the protagonist's cart and Neri's weighing of "patient memory." The ending transforms the familiar belonging-quest through tactile particulars: condensation sigil, bench woven under an obsidian arch, neighbors as co-authors of the artifact. Voice is singular and committed. Minor cap: the elusive-artist trope is familiar; transformation is solid but not radical. Risk-taking in lyric density and accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marsh-reed sculptor drives key turns: brings the cart (setup), tells marsh stories to earn trust (middle), weaves the bench (climax), and speaks the dedication (closure). The craft constrains and enables—reeds as patient memory, the sigil echoing reed geometry, the bench as offering. Three distinct beats; causal pressure high; closure linkage direct. Cost: the dedication forecloses anonymity and commits future labor to the community.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Glimmering obsidian arbor appears early (setup), hosts the search with lanterns (middle), reveals the sigil on its underside, and receives the bench in "the arbor's cool mouth" (closure). Handled across four beats; its reflective surface stitches faces together, its geometry houses vows, and it becomes the site of transformation. Specific properties (ash-glass, condensation-holding) matter. High causal pressure and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Webs of kinship shape the search method (looking together becomes belonging) and frame the ending ("webs of kinship trembled awake"). Present in setup and closure; the concept motivates the shared search and reweights the protagonist's solitary past. Middle development is implicit (neighbors gather, press stories) but not a distinct beat with cost. Two gates met; lyric reprise elevates but does not reach indispensable status.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Boldly sympathetic (Neri's trait) enables the initial acceptance and listening without judgment. Appears early and again when Neri whispers "stay" (heard as "braid") near closure. Two beats; causal role is moderate—Neri's sympathy opens the gate but does not constrain later choices. Label is embodied ("eyes molded by every sorrow they refused to turn away from") but cost is generic scene-level rather than tied uniquely to this trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dedicate is the climactic action: "I dedicate this seat to all who search and keep searching." The vow transforms the protagonist from outsider to member, the sigil thickens in response, and the neighbors touch the bench to test "the grammar we had learned." Setup (promise to dedicate if the tag is found), middle (weaving toward dedication), and closure all hinge on this act. Irreplaceable; swapping for "offer" or "present" would dilute the ritual weight. Cost: public commitment forecloses retreat.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Shared search for the street artist's tag is signaled early ("those who look together become the finding"), structures the middle (circling the arbor with lanterns, finding the sigil in condensation), and pays off when the sigil answers the protagonist's craft. Three beats; the method shapes attempts and the sigil's discovery is the hinge for dedication. Mechanics matter: the tag arrives "where dew would never cling," and the group effort enables the find. Strong integration but one step below indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Crystalline orchard at crater's edge anchors all action: protagonist arrives there, walks between refractive trunks, searches the arbor, dedicates the bench. The orchard's chime and reflective surfaces create webs of kinship physically (braided halos) and socially. Three beats; spatial choreography is clear. The crater's origin story (cooling tears, sweetness from scar) primes the belonging-theme. Setting constrains the dedication ritual and charges the final image. Not quite indispensable (the story could occur in another communal threshold) but deeply integrated.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Beyond the murmur of lost languages" appears once mid-story as atmospheric backdrop for the rim villages. Does not tighten decisions, track elapsed time, or shape tactics. Ornamental; no causal pressure or closure link. Swappable with any poetic time phrase. Setup and middle gates missing; no payoff.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>To graft oneself onto community is the protagonist's explicit want ("I want to be woven in"), dramatized through the cart's arrival, the search participation, the bench-weaving, and the public dedication. Four beats; internal friction is present (fear vs. dare, hunger vs. risk of rejection). Cost is visible: "I felt held like light is held by water until someone drinks" reweights the solitary past. The motivation drives all key turns and the closure image. Essential but not fully indispensable (a similar belonging-want could substitute with moderate edits).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Luminescent ache appears multiple times: the promise as "luminescent ache in my chest," the ending as "luminescent ache learning to hold and be held." Tone is coherent—poignant, hopeful, vulnerable—and modulates under pressure (quiet arrival, tentative search, charged dedication). The ache charges the final image, linking hunger to fulfillment with cost. Three beats; purposeful recurrence reweights the stake. Strong integration; one notch below indispensable because the exact phrase could be varied without breaking closure logic.</comment>
