<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's guilt over the backward journal is embodied through concrete action (touching the driftwood map, writing the note), and her interiority carries a distinct filter ("harbor that feared ships"). However, the transformation feels too smooth—she moves from self-blame to self-acceptance without sufficient dramatized internal contradiction. The epiphany "I harmed nothing by meaning well, yet I still must mend what happened" arrives as articulated insight rather than through embodied struggle under pressure. The final choice to visit the patron's door has visible cost (she must admit error), but the emotional arc reads more as therapeutic release than earned struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mara accepts the error-as-gift paradox and commits to mending with the note, foreclosing her reclusive refusal with visible cost. The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens through layered imagery (harbor, driftwood, backward spine) and a cadence shift at the ending that reweights her stance. Orientation is clean by the laundromat turn. One meaningful deepening occurs when the woman explains "staying while leaving," which narrows Mara's options and charges the final walk. The inferred lens holds, and the cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The laundromat-as-threshold and the driftwood table function as micro-settings that constrain Mara's journey and charge the closure: the humming dryers teach the world's hidden rules, and the table's "river scars" anchor her realization about harbors. Sensory selection is purposeful (paper/wool/patience, "air tasted") and filtered through Mara's craft-oriented POV. Spatial choreography remains clear across the threshold crossing and library interior. The midnight frame and "linted moons" in her pockets at the end tie setting detail to the final image, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Mara's mistake caused harm or held hidden value—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the woman's explanation ("the forward becomes kind only when it meets the backward halfway") reframes the problem, narrowing Mara's options from self-blame to integrated mending. Agency is clear: Mara chooses to write the note and visit the patron, foreclosing her reclusive stance with on-page cost. However, no direct opposition tests her commitment; the library woman guides rather than resists, so escalation reads as accumulative deepening rather than contested pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme—nestled paradoxes, staying while leaving—emerges organically from the backward journal, the driftwood map, and the final instruction to "admit the error and name the gift it gave." The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "harbor steady, error cherished" reweights the recluse premise without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the woman's half-smile and the brass plate's hiss. The "compassionate recluse" contradiction is finally integrated through action rather than label. No thematic echo in the final paragraph; the image does the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinctive, with a lyric compression ("the city exhaled a slow hush," "linted moons") and a perceptual signature tied to Mara's craft ("backward spine," "book...sewn"). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; the woman's lines carry subtext and advance plot without exposition. POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. However, elevated diction occasionally drifts above Mara's plausible lexicon ("enlarged tranquility," "braided tether"), creating minor register friction in peak beats. The woman's speech converges slightly with the narrative voice, but remains legible as a separate character.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines layer action, perception, and thematic imagery. Sentence openings vary, and rhythm modulates with scene pressure. However, repetitive syntactic stems appear in the middle section ("She saw...," "She realized...," "She felt...") and a paraphrase loop occurs when "staying while leaving" is restated three times without added pressure. Stock metaphors like "soft moons" and "quiet mirrors" accumulate without pattern payoff. No major scaffold, but the cumulative texture debt and template cadence in the reflection block (-0.6) prevent entry into the 7.5+ range.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—bookmender seeks wisdom in a secret library to understand an error that helped a grieving patron—synthesizes familiar elements (hidden library, mistake-as-gift) through specific craft detail (backward binding, detergent-shelf threshold). The "staying while leaving" paradox is purposeful but not fully transformed; it reads as thematic overlay rather than an organic discovery from prior particulars. The driftwood map and brass plate are fresh touches, but the emotional arc (recluse learns self-acceptance) follows a recognizable template. Transformation test: the plot would work with a different craft and setting with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout and her compassion drives her to seek the library, but "recluse" remains more label than enacted trait until the harbor insight near the end. Her key choice—to write the note and visit the patron—alters tactics and closes the arc. Setup is clear, middle involvement is strong (she practices "staying while leaving"), and closure participation is direct. However, the reclusive aspect is told more than dramatized in scene pressure, lowering irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The invitation appears in beat one (warmth in her palm), returns at the anteroom (pressed flat against the brass plate), and dissolves into membership at closure. Three distinct beats, early signal, and closure linkage are present. However, its causal pressure is modest—it grants access but does not constrain her choices within the library. The transformation (crumpled → dissolved → membership) reweights meaning but does not drive a key turn. Swappability is moderate; any token could serve the same function.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Nestled paradoxes" is announced as the library's practice in beat one, demonstrated through "staying while leaving" in the middle, and directly shapes Mara's realization that the backward journal created a bridge. It constrains her understanding and enables the final choice to "admit the error and name the gift." Setup, development, and closure participation are all present with causal pressure. The concept is irreplaceable—removing it would collapse the logic of the library's teaching and Mara's transformation. Cost is visible: Mara must hold contradiction without resolution.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Keenly empathetic" is labeled in the opening but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. Mara's empathy presumably drives her initial guilt, but the trait is not tested or traded off in scene. It remains an attributed quality rather than a dramatized force that shapes a choice. Setup is present, but development and closure participation are absent. Swappable with "sensitive" or "conscientious" with no structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Hide" appears explicitly in the woman's explanation ("how to hide what is sharp without dulling it") and implicitly in the library's concealment and Mara's practice of hiding from connection. It shapes the thematic instruction and the final binding technique. However, the action is more conceptual than physical—Mara does not enact a hiding choice that drives a key turn. Setup and thematic closure participation are present, but middle causal pressure is weak. Swappability is moderate; "shelter" or "hold" could replace it with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Staying while leaving" is introduced explicitly by the woman, demonstrated through Mara's meditation at the table, and embodied in the final walk ("harbor steady"). It appears in at least three beats and constrains Mara's practice: she must remain with the ache while letting fear wait outside. The method shapes the middle turn and charges the closure image. However, its mechanics remain abstract—Mara closes her eyes and "practices," but the reader does not see the specific steps. Causal pressure is present but the method's irreplaceability is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The library is signaled early (invitation), accessed through the laundromat threshold (dryers stop, detergent shelf swings), and supplies the driftwood table and brass plate that enable Mara's realization. It pressures her choices by offering tools (the note-binding technique) and constraints (the woman's instruction). Setup, development, and closure participation are all present. The hidden-in-plain-sight mechanism (laundromat portal) is specific and irreplaceable. The setting shapes tactics and charges the final image ("linted moons" carry the library forward). Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Midnight frames the opening and closing ("within arm's reach of midnight"), creating a lyric bracket, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or constrain action. No live clock shapes Mara's choices within the library; the meditation and instruction could unfold over any duration. Setup and closure reprise are present, but middle development is absent. The timeframe is decorative rather than causal. Swappable with "late evening" or "twilight" with no structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's desire to "unearth wisdom in a mistake" is established in beat one (she fears her hands "rearranged a farewell into a labyrinth"), drives her library visit, shapes the woman's instruction, and is resolved when she writes the note admitting error and naming the gift. Setup, development, and closure participation are all present with strong causal pressure. The motivation is conflicted—she wants to mend but also fears she caused harm—and this friction drives the key turn. The final choice forecloses her guilt-driven reclusion with visible cost. Irreplaceable and tightly integrated.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Enlarged tranquility" is announced explicitly when Mara enters the library ("the world steadied into enlarged tranquility") and modulates subtly as the woman explains the practice. The tone is coherent through the piece and charges the final image ("harbor steady, error cherished"). However, the tone remains relatively static—there is no sharp contrast or pressure-driven modulation that tests it. The phrasing "enlarged tranquility" itself is elevated and slightly detached from Mara's POV. Setup, thematic presence, and closure linkage are solid, but the tone does not meaningfully constrain a choice. Lyric reprise qualifies for mid-6s.</comment>
