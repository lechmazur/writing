<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior life is rendered through vivid, embodied imagery ("dress in ache," "fingers are thin maps"), and the grief-driven motive shapes choices across the narrative. The shadow's departure and Lio's loss provide clear psychological stakes. However, the piece leans heavily on poetic assertion rather than dramatized micro-choices under pressure; the lantern-making and crane-folding feel more like extended metaphor than moment-by-moment decision points with visible tradeoffs. The final reunion with the shadow arrives without the protagonist having to surrender a competing want on the page, softening the cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a lyric-mosaic pattern early (fragmented vignettes unified by the lantern-maker's voice and the grief motif) and sustains it through to closure. The ending delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (the shadow's return reframes the grief as a quest for balance rather than loss) with felt cost: the torment shifts but remains "luminous," and the protagonist commits to perpetual transformation rather than resolution. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (floating island, tea garden, glass basilica). One meaningful deepening occurs when the cranes are released and the shadow returns, reweighting the protagonist's understanding of what was sought. Minor penalty: the middle third loops several descriptions of gem-polishing and dream-recording without a clear escalation beat between the decision to fold cranes and their completion, creating a sense of stasis before the payoff.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating island, glass basilica, tea garden, and the physical work of polishing gems and folding cranes are vivid and specific. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "steam from the shrubs," "rain on iron," "wind slices the bells into ribbons." The spiral path that "descends while ascending" functions as a charged micro-setting that externalizes the protagonist's internal state. The cranes tethered to the waist and the opal-threaded lanterns constrain the final action, meeting the 9+ gate. However, the basilica's interior mechanics (dream-recording, color-organ birds) remain somewhat abstract, and spatial choreography inside the basilica is less concrete than earlier garden scenes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clearly signaled: to fold grief into form and recover the shadow/balance. The narrative tightens once when the protagonist completes the thousand cranes and ascends to the basilica, a choice that forecloses passivity and commits to the ritual. The shadow's return reconfigures the protagonist's understanding (it sought balance, not Lio), a deepening under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible: the torment persists ("still luminous"), and the protagonist accepts perpetual labor ("I will keep making lanterns") rather than closure. Weakness: the middle stretch (gem-polishing, patron interactions, crane-folding) feels iterative without a clear reversal or complication that narrows options before the final ascent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—grief as transformation, the necessity of carrying brightness without breaking it—emerges organically from the lantern-making, the cranes, and the shadow's return. The final image ("holding the knot where light and loss agree to stay") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates in the shadow's departure ("deciding I was not worth trailing") and its return bearing weight, reframing the quest as one for balance rather than recovery of the lost beloved. The piece resists tidy resolution; the protagonist's torment shifts but does not vanish. Minor note: the phrase "a living is the art of folding brightness without breaking it" in the penultimate paragraph edges close to thematic summary, though it remains imagistic enough to avoid heavy penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: compressed, lyric syntax, metaphor-dense diction that reflects the protagonist's craft and grief. Free indirect style is clean; internal thought is consistent. Under peak stress (the crane release, the shadow's return) the prose compresses further without losing coherence or voice. No head-hopping. Weakness: a few lines veer toward elevated abstraction ("a theorem here, a bargain of buoyancy between dream recording and release") that feels slightly detached from the embodied voice established earlier. The basilica keeper's dialogue ("Not for permission, but for lift") is spare and functional but does not carry distinct idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled and purposeful; sentence openings vary. Information density is high, with most lines advancing character, atmosphere, or the grief motif. The prose is vivid and compressed ("I rake steam from the shrubs," "my fingers are thin maps"). However, the middle third contains paraphrase loops and template cadence: multiple paragraphs begin with "I [verb]" or "The lanterns/cranes [verb]," and several beats restate the gem-polishing and dream-recording process without added pressure. The phrase "Ever since Lio fell through the sky seam, my shadow went after him" is striking, but the surrounding lines ("I wake without silhouette and dress in ache") recycle near-synonyms for grief across adjacent sentences. These artifacts accumulate to −0.6 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of grief-work, artisan craft, and fantastical floating-world imagery feels specific and non-obvious. The shadow as a figure of balance rather than loss is a fresh inflection on the grief narrative. The piece commits fully to its lyric, metaphor-heavy mode and follows its logic through to the ending. Weakness: the core premise (artisan on a floating island processing grief through a mystical craft) leans on familiar fantasy-of-consolation templates, and while the execution is vivid, the emotional arc (loss → labor → partial reconciliation) does not surprise. The story's boldest risk—its dense, elided style—succeeds in maintaining coherence and pressure, earning a modest within-band bonus.</comment>
