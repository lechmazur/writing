<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is consistently filtered through metaphor-heavy perception ("ears were maps of old thunder"), creating a distinct voice. The motivation to find the brother drives concrete choices—assembling the phonograph, using the leaf as lens, following the map to turn the spindle—with visible forfeiture (copying letters, walking under constellations, bringing neighbors into the discovery). Internal contradiction is present but muted: grief drives the search, yet the narrator pauses to let Gable drink and gathers the community rather than hoarding the water. Embodied emotion appears in gestures like Gable's tail thumping and the narrator pressing an ear to rust, though some beats rely on metaphor over visceral reaction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the narrator gains water for the settlement and receives the brother's invitation ("Bring the leaf when you come"), crystallizing a path forward with the cost of delayed reunion now reweighted as shared survival. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure accrues through layered riddles, the phonograph message, the amber-revealed map, the spindle turn, and the water discovery, culminating in a cadence shift where solitary grief becomes communal sustenance. Orientation anchors who (narrator + Gable), where (scrapyard settlement), and when (post-war nights) by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the leaf decodes the cylinder's hidden text, narrowing options from aimless mourning to a concrete quest with stakes (finding water, eventual reunion).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The scrapyard's material palette—rust, wax, cracked wasteland, salvage towers, bolted spindle—constrains choices at every turn: the narrator must oil the phonograph's turn, find the western heap's pipe, and thread hose "seam to seam." The autumn leaf in wax charges the final image by bending light to reveal the map and later promising to "meet the water and name it." Sensory detail is consistently filtered through the narrator's poetic bias (wild hush, constellations made of cranes, moon as stitched eye), maintaining coherence without catalog excess. The settlement's spatial layout—aisles of wrecks, western heap—tracks cleanly through the night walk, and the underground river's discovery alters the environment causally (pipes sigh, buckets brighten).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—translating distance into closeness by finding the brother—is signaled in paragraph six and tightened when the phonograph riddles narrow the search to a concrete map and the spindle location. Protagonist agency drives escalation: choosing to buy the phonograph, placing the leaf over the horn, copying the shadowed letters, and turning the spindle counter-wind all foreclose easier paths (ignoring the riddle, keeping the discovery private). The water discovery forces a trade-off: the narrator could hoard the resource or follow the brother's final instruction to share it, and chooses communal distribution ("threaded hose from seam to seam") with the cost of delaying personal reunion. One reversal occurs when the second voice introduces the need for "tinted revelations," transforming a simple message into a puzzle requiring the leaf.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—grief and scarcity transformed into shared sustenance through patient attention—emerges from the concrete sequence: solitary walks, deciphering riddles, the leaf as key, and water flowing to neighbors. The brother's riddles function as non-literal thematic probes ("What holds when broken, fills when emptied") answered by "Listening," which the settlement then enacts by gathering with cups. The amber leaf shifts meaning from private keepsake to communal lens ("its light can meet the water and name it"), and "tinted revelations" evolves from trick to "angles of kindness made visible." The final image—leaf slipped back into wax, night keeping the thought for dawn—offers a resonant answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates in the brother's layered messages and Gable's warm presence as counterweight to isolation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrator's perceptual signature is highly metaphoric and consistent ("distance translated us," "desert kept no music," "settlement clanking like a sleeping animal learning to trust"), creating a distinct lyric voice. POV distance remains stable in close third, with psychic access limited to the narrator's sensory and emotional experience. Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence carries metaphor—but the pattern is taught early and remains legible, so purposeful compression applies. However, under peak pressure (copying letters, turning the spindle, hearing water), the elevated register does not modulate toward sharper immediacy, flattening some urgency. The brother's embedded voice in the cylinder riddles reads distinct in cadence and question structure, avoiding full convergence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Figurative density is pervasive: most sentences in high-pressure beats layer metaphor without pattern-teaching or lyric payoff that directly charges closure ("grooves of a phonograph cylinder" is literal, but surrounding lines like "hush inside the hush" and "wild hush again" loop conceptually). Template cadence appears in repeated stems: "He said... He spoke... He drew..." and "I set... I copied... I pressed..." across adjacent paragraphs. Paraphrase loops surface in "translate distance into closeness" (paragraph 6) and "translated distance into closeness" (paragraph 38), restating the same content. Mixed metaphor: "wasteland, a longer throat for our voices" pairs organic and spatial vehicles without clear coherence. Information density is high in the phonograph and water-discovery beats, but scaffold phrasing ("a riddle laid softly," "a hinge for the door of doubt") adds texture without advancing causality. No catastrophic opacity, but cumulative artifacts dull momentum in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic scarcity, phonograph puzzle-solving, and wax-leaf optics is non-obvious and feels earned in hindsight through the brother's layered communication method. The riddle structure and amber-revealed map offer a fresh angle on the "searching for a lost relative" frame. Emotional specificity—Gable's retired vocation, the leaf pressed at departure, the settlement as "wind-rattled cathedral of rust"—grounds the premise in particulars rather than generic post-war tropes. The transformation test holds: swapping names or setting would lose the scrapyard's material constraints and the phonograph's analog mystery. Risk-taking in the heightened lyric register and riddle mechanics elevates stakes without obscuring the causal spine, though the density occasionally trends toward ornament. The premise does not echo well-known templates closely enough to trigger derivative adjustment.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Gable appears in the opening walk, sniffs the cylinders and whines (prompting attention), noses the coat pocket to reveal the leaf (middle beat enabling the map discovery), drinks after the water flows, and lays his head on the narrator's shoe at closure. He is present across setup, middle, and ending, but his choices are reactive observation (sniffing, whining, nosing) rather than decisions that narrow options. The trait "retired from finding bodies" reappears thematically ("he still found the living when they hid inside themselves") but does not constrain tactics. Two-gate presence (setup, closure) with middle involvement elevates above ornamental, but lack of autonomous decision-making limits score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The leaf is pressed into the narrator's palm at departure (setup), used as lens over the phonograph horn to reveal the hidden map (middle beat driving escalation), and returns in the brother's final instruction to "bring the leaf when you come, so its light can meet the water and name it" (closure). Its wax casing and amber glow are causally necessary: without it, the shadowed letters remain invisible and the map unreadable. The leaf's meaning reweights from private keepsake to communal and future-facing symbol. Visible cost: the narrator must carry and preserve it, and the brother's demand ties reunion to the leaf's presence. Three gates, two distinct beats, closure linkage, high irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The concept is signaled when the second voice says "tinted revelations" are needed to see the rest (setup before midpoint), then demonstrated when the amber leaf acts as filter to decode the cylinder's hidden text (middle beat altering tactics from passive listening to active optical decoding). At closure, the narrator interprets "tinted revelations had never been tricks, only angles of kindness made visible," reweighting the concept thematically. The mechanics—light bent through a keepsake—shape the middle discovery directly, and the final reflection charges the concept with cost (the effort to decode grief into shared resource). Three gates, causal pressure in one major beat, closure linkage via reflection.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The attribute appears once when the phonograph's shadowed letters are described as "intuitively descriptive, drawing feelings first, meanings second, as if my brother wrote with weather." This occurs in the middle sequence and characterizes the brother's communication style, adding texture to the decoding beat. However, the trait does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost—the narrator copies the letters regardless of their intuitive style, and the attribute could be omitted without altering tactics or closure. Present in middle development but lacks causal pressure or closure participation. Late signal, ornamental use, high swappability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Riddles appear three times: the brother's first message poses the phonograph riddle (setup), the amber-revealed text includes a map "drawn in metaphors" (middle beat enabling the water search), and the final riddle "What holds when broken, fills when emptied" is answered "Listening" at closure, prompting communal gathering. Each riddle narrows options—without solving the phonograph riddle the narrator cannot proceed, without the map the spindle is not found, and the final riddle articulates the thematic cost of shared attention. The action is irreplaceable: no near-synonym (puzzle, question) carries the same folkloric weight or brother's voice. Three gates, three beats, closure linkage, high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The method is embedded in the brother's first riddle ("answer me by reading secret texts in the grooves of a phonograph cylinder"), signaling it by the story's first third. The mechanics matter: the narrator must assemble the phonograph, lower a broken nail as needle, and later overlay the amber leaf to reveal hidden letters in the spinning wax. The method drives two beats—initial message delivery and map decoding—and shapes the middle escalation by requiring the leaf as key. Closure does not depend on the phonograph directly (the water flows from the spindle), but the method enables the entire quest chain. Three gates, two beats, high specificity, moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The scrapyard is established in the opening line ("sprawled across the cracked wasteland like a wind-rattled cathedral of rust") and recurs throughout: aisles of wrecks walked with Gable, roofs built from doors, the western heap where the spindle is found, and the settlement's transformation into "a chorus" when water flows. The setting supplies materials (phonograph parts, salvage towers as landmarks) and the underground river as resource, pressuring choices by limiting what can be scavenged and requiring communal infrastructure ("threaded hose from seam to seam"). Spatial choreography is clear. However, the setting could be replaced with another post-war ruin without breaking the plot's logic; the scrapyard's specificity charges atmosphere more than it alters tactics. Three gates, moderate causal pressure, moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The timeframe is signaled in the second paragraph ("After the last resource war, we built roofs from doors") and contextualizes scarcity and salvage culture throughout. The brother's crossing and silence occur in this post-war window, motivating the search. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page—no countdown, no worsening scarcity within the story's night, no rival claim on the water. The past war explains the world's state but does not create present pressure. Setup present, thematic relevance moderate, no middle or closure participation in escalation. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The motivation is stated explicitly in paragraph six ("to translate distance into closeness before distance translated us") and recurs at closure ("translated distance into closeness by the music of shared water"). It drives all major choices: buying the phonograph, decoding the riddles, following the map, turning the spindle. Internal friction appears between the narrator's desire for personal reunion and the brother's instruction to share the discovery, resolved when the narrator threads hose to neighbors and delays departure. The motivation's cost is visible: solitary grief becomes communal stewardship, and the leaf must now serve a larger purpose. Three gates, causal pressure across beats, closure reweighting, visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The tone is anchored in the opening ("Nights fell in a wild hush that could make a welding torch sound shy") and modulates under pressure: the phonograph message arrives "roughened by sand and longing," the settlement "clanking like a sleeping animal learning to trust," and at closure the hush sounds "like two hearts agreeing." The tone remains coherent—quiet, metaphoric, patient—through discovery and communal gathering, avoiding false urgency. It charges the final image by framing the night as keeper of thought. However, the tone does not shift sharply at peak beats (decoding the map, hearing water); it sustains one register rather than tightening or breaking. Three gates, coherent modulation, strong closure charge, moderate pressure variance.</comment>
