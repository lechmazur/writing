<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is vivid and specific ("I follow a trail of oxidized hooks"), but motivation remains abstract—the desire to "honor overlooked histories" never faces a live on-page cost or contradiction that would force a hierarchy of values. The elder and Risa exist as evoked presences rather than dramatic pressure points; no relationship crystallizes under strain. The final "translation" beat feels declarative rather than earned through embodied struggle, and the protagonist's stance does not measurably shift or foreclose a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accrues density through repeated images (lens fragment, hidden details, anchors of intuition) and the final moment—hanging the painting as map and teaching the market to read its threads—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Orientation anchors arrive by ~150 words (market, narrator with satchel and lens). However, the closure cost is conceptual and oblique; no visible forfeiture or tactical shift occurs on the page, only a declared intention to "keep the paths suspended." The causal chain is present but diffuse, relying on metaphor more than dramatized choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The alchemist's market is vivid and purposeful: "swinging aisles," "rope frayed into wings," "wind bells speak on wires." The lighthouse lens fragment recurs across beats and charges the closure by enabling the translation. Spatial choreography is clear (narrator moves from stall entrance to canvas over lantern to painted door), and the setting supplies the canvas that becomes the map. The lens itself functions as micro-setting, constraining and enabling the protagonist's method throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—honoring overlooked histories—is signaled early and sustained. The narrator's discovery of Risa and the journal offers one meaningful deepening, but the escalation is textural (accumulation of names and images) rather than a tightening that narrows options or imposes a visible trade-off. The elder asks "why I would risk remembering," yet no on-page consequence or friction materializes; the market "shifts, ropes easing" without resistance. Agency is present in the translation act, but the cost remains diffuse and conceptual.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: translation as witness, overlooked labor, and the weight of memory. The final image—hanging the painting as map rather than merchandise—reweights the premise without overt moralizing. Subtext operates in the elder's tear and the phrase "translation is a bridge, but mine is also a bell rung home." The lens fragment as motif constrains choice and charges closure. Minor deduction: the phrase "to honor overlooked histories" recurs as a thematic echo that edges toward prompt-label speech, particularly in the midpoint declaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "oxidized hooks," "bruised whites begin to breathe," "silvery marginal weather." POV distance is stable, filter verbs are voice-motivated ("I think of my own childhood's roofline"), and no head-hopping occurs. However, diction slips into elevated register at peak beats ("elusively tangible," "petitioners to dawn," "cartographers of smell") that feel more ornamental than character-specific under pressure. The elder's brief speech carries subtext, but the narrator's internal voice converges with the prose texture throughout, reducing contrast.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and mostly coherent ("sky-bound river," "anchors of intuition sharp as hooks"), but several metaphors strain clarity: "bruised whites begin to breathe," "soot-sweet laughter," "silvery marginal weather." Template cadence appears in repeated "I [verb]" stems across the opening third. Paraphrase loops are minimal, but the phrase "elusively tangible" recurs four times without accumulating pressure. Information density is strong in the translation beats; momentum sags in the reflective asides ("between childhood and now" appears three times). Figurative language in nearly every sentence of the canvas-examination beat (midpoint) risks overwriting without pattern-teaching payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The combination—translator reading hidden labor through a lens fragment in a suspended market—is specific and non-obvious. The lighthouse-lens-as-reading-tool and the painted door that opens to memory offer fresh inflections. However, the emotional arc (witness discovering and honoring the overlooked) follows a familiar template, and the resolution—hanging the painting as map—feels more symbolic than tactically or morally complex. No bold structural risk elevates the design; the piece executes its lyric accumulation competently without surprising in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Introduced in the opening paragraph; the narrator translates at multiple beats (angling the fragment over canvas, unfastening the painted door, reading the journal); the act of translation shapes the closure when the painting is hung as map. However, the protagonist's choices do not create reversals or visible trade-offs—observation and declaration dominate. The translator role enables method but does not constrain or force a hierarchy of costs.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present in paragraph four; handled in at least four beats (angling over canvas, revealing harbors, tilting to the painted door, warming under coat at the end); its mechanics matter (refracts hidden details) and it charges the closure image ("its weight reminds me to listen"). Removing it would collapse the translation method and the final resonance. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, though the fragment does not impose a visible cost or constraint that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Phrase appears in the opening and recurs three times. Functions as thematic language and occasional metaphor ("anchors of intuition sharp as hooks"), but does not shape on-page stakes or alter tactics. The concept is ornamental—descriptive rather than a constraint or enabler. Swappable with "instinct" or "insight" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Phrase appears four times as label-only description (the lens fragment, memory). No on-page action is constrained or enabled by this quality; it describes a sensory ambiguity but does not force a trade-off or visible cost. Ornamental texture.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Introduced early (grandfather's gift established unfastened the shard from its lantern home); enacted twice on the page (unfastening the rusted catch, unfastening the tacks on the painted door's hinge). The second unfastening reveals the journal and drives the closure preparation. Strong causal linkage, though the action itself is not irreplaceable—opening or revealing would serve the same function with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Signaled in paragraph seven ("truths travel through hidden details in paintings, stitched into pigments"); mechanics dramatized across three beats (hairline constellations in canvas, letters pressed by nailhead, journal stitched from sailcloth). The method shapes the protagonist's attempts and enables the closure discovery. Removing it would require a wholesale replacement of the translation mechanism. Strong beat involvement and causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Present from the opening; provides spatial anchors (swinging aisles, stalls, ropes) and supplies the elder's stall with the lighthouse canvas. The market's "shift" at the closure ("ropes easing, ladders lowering") suggests atmospheric participation, but the setting does not constrain choices or alter tactics in a visible way. Functions more as vivid backdrop than as active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Phrase recurs three times as thematic frame. No on-page clock tightens decisions; the timeframe is reflective and diffuse rather than a live constraint. The narrator's movement from childhood memory to present stance is summarized, not dramatized with temporal pressure. Ornamental rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Stated explicitly at the midpoint and acted upon across translation beats (speaking names aloud, unfastening the painted door, hanging the painting as map). The motive drives the protagonist's goals and is present in the closure. However, no on-page friction tests the desire—no competing cost, no moment where honoring histories requires forfeiting another good. Desire is clean and declarative rather than conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Phrase appears in the opening and recurs at closure ("an eternal instant that does not pass, only circles"). Tone is lyric and reflective throughout, modulating minimally with pressure. The final image ("a tide within a tide, speaking as I go") attempts to charge the instant, but the tone remains static rather than deepening under escalation. Coherent but not dynamic.</comment>
