<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior life is richly embodied through poetic perception ("sea sigh turning inside my ribs"), and the search for courage shapes micro-choices throughout. The dog's return is earned by the shift from chase to patience, with visible cost in the vulnerability required. However, the guides remain largely observational facilitators rather than characters with their own contradictory impulses, and the protagonist's fear is more declared than dramatized through resisted impulses in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with clear RR (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid): the protagonist learns to wait rather than chase, and the dog's approach confirms the tactical shift with felt cost in the required gentleness. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (broken leash, ridgeway, ferry guides by ~100 words). The escalation unfolds through a meaningful deepening—panic to vigil to reunion—that narrows options under the inferred lens. One mild causality slip: the fox's shadow "pointing" feels convenient rather than earned, though it does not break the closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The veiled ridgeway, fog-laden water, and carved cliff stairs create a cohesive coastal dreamscape that directly enables the vigil and the protagonist's shift in approach. The ticket punch with star stamp becomes a tactile anchor that lights fence posts and guides movement, constraining the search method. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("conch-hum whispers," "fern drips," "moonbread air"), though some coined terms ("moonbread") edge toward ornamental. The environment charges the final image: the stars cooling like shells as they descend.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recovering the lost dog—is signaled immediately and tightens through a clear tactical shift: from panic to patience, chase to vigil. The fox sighting and pawprints provide one meaningful reversal that narrows options and forces the protagonist to hum rather than call. The guides' persistent instruction that "panic tramples tracks" imposes a credible constraint with visible cost (restraint, vulnerability). The reunion earns its moment through the protagonist's kneeling and invitation rather than pursuit, though the escalation could sustain slightly more pressure in the middle third.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: unused courage is found not in bold action but in patience and gentleness after the leash breaks. The shoreline lullaby, indirect routes, and star-stamp constellation accrue meaning without thematic echo or moralizing. The dog "sniffs the card of stars" and the protagonist's acknowledgment that "we are learning how to walk after the leash breaks" offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The final image—stars cooling like shells—reweights the journey with quiet, earned grace.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The POV is stable and lyric throughout, with a consistent perceptual signature that notices metaphorically ("sea sigh," "bruise warming into lavender," "moonbread air"). Distance control is clean; no head-hopping. The guides' dialogue ("the tide already paid them in returned names") feels purposefully stylized and matches the dreamlike register. Some figurative density approaches overwriting in cumulative effect, and a few coinages ("moonbread") test the boundary of voice-motivated invention, but the texture remains coherent and the prose reflects the focalizer's transformation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high; nearly every line advances atmosphere, character choice, or symbolic charge. However, figurative language appears in most sentences without respite ("sea sigh," "conch-hum whispers," "bruise warming," "shed snake skin," "moonbread air"), creating cumulative density that slows momentum in the middle third. Two minor loops: "gently persistent" recurs as both descriptor and guide attribution without added nuance, and "traverse" / "indirect routes" pair repeatedly in similar syntactic slots. No grammar or clarity breaks; the overwriting stays legible but pushes against the policy ceiling.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of lost-dog search and mystical vigil offers a fresh angle, and the story commits fully to its lyric-fable premise without retreat. The guides, star-stamp ticket, and indirect-route method feel specific to this vision. However, the underlying arc—panic to patience, reunion through gentleness—follows a familiar emotional template, and the transformative work relies heavily on atmospheric layering rather than a non-obvious turn. The piece avoids generic settings and stock resolutions, landing in solid territory without breakthrough surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The wise ferry guides are present early, frame the journey, and instruct the protagonist at key beats ("panic tramples tracks," "arrivals prefer to find you waiting"). They stamp stars to light the path and refuse payment at closure, signaling thematic completion. However, their role is primarily facilitative; they do not make decisions that create reversals. They enable rather than drive turns, placing them in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ticket punch with star stamp appears early, is used three times on the page (first turn, fence posts, final star for the dog), and becomes a tactile constellation guiding the search. Its warmth and cooling ("cool like shells") charge the final image. The stars constrain the method—indirect routes marked by light—and the dog "sniffs the card" at reunion, integrating the object into closure. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>A vigil in twilight is the story's structural and thematic spine: the protagonist is told "a vigil in twilight" is required after the leash breaks, settles into watch with the guides, and the vigil "bends into night" with no fear at closure. The concept dictates the tactical shift from chase to waiting, directly shaping the reunion. It appears in the title-like refrain and reweights the entire arc. Indispensable to stakes and closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Gently persistent" is attributed to the guides early ("gently persistent as rain") and enacted when they hush the protagonist and insist on patience. The trait constrains the search method—no chasing—and the protagonist internalizes it ("I breathe smaller," kneeling without advancing). It enables the dog's approach with visible cost in restraint. Present across beats and tied to closure, though slightly more implicit than demonstrative in mid-sequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Traverse" appears early as the ferry crossing, recurs when they "traverse the ridge" in arcs, and the return descent is framed as traversing "through indirect routes." The action structures the journey and the tactical choice of looping paths over straight pursuit. Removing it would require significant rewrites. However, it functions more as connective tissue than a decision point that creates a major turn, limiting top-band reach.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Through indirect routes" is signaled early ("traverse the current seams through indirect routes the maps never draw"), taught as doctrine by the guides ("your fear uncurls, because straight lines are where it holds its breath longest"), and enacted in the ridge arcs that revisit cairns. The method is causally tied to success: straight pursuit fails, patience via winding paths succeeds. It shapes middle tactics and is referenced at closure. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The veiled ridgeway is named early, serves as the vigil location, and its "fold where briars soften" becomes the site of reunion. Cloud veils snag on fences that the guides light with star stamps, and the heath-and-wind braid creates the dreamscape pressure. The setting enables the search method (winding paths, cairns, folds) and charges the final descent. Environment actively shapes tactics and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"After the leash breaks" is the inciting event and temporal anchor, repeated as a thematic refrain ("after the leash breaks, the world must learn your new name," "how to walk after the leash breaks"). The timeframe tightens decisions—the protagonist must act now, the dog is loose and vulnerable—and the break itself (leash as "shed snake skin") becomes a charged image at closure. The before/after is legible and drives urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to find where unused courage waits, because mine keeps hiding whenever footsteps echo" is stated early and dramatized through the shift from panic to vigil. The protagonist's humming, kneeling, and invitation ("he may set the pace") enact the discovery of courage-as-patience. The fox and pawprints test the commitment to gentleness. Desire is made concrete in choices with visible cost (restraint, vulnerability), though one line borders on articulation rather than pure dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Shoreline lullaby" is introduced early as the guides' song that "keeps the surf from biting," modulates when the protagonist hums it to call the dog, and returns at closure as the guides sing again. The tone—gentle, liminal, soothing—remains coherent through the vigil and charges the final image of stars cooling. It shapes the emotional register and the method (lullaby versus shouting), supporting both pressure and resolution. Strong tonal integration.</comment>
