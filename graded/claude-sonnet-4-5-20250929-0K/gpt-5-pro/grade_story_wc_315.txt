<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority is specific and embodied: "my stomach becomes the canopy" anchors visceral fear without label-speak. Micro-choices under pressure—pacing words to breath, revising signals when Lio refuses—demonstrate contradictory impulses (command vs. care) that shape the crisis. The mentor's blindfold training and the watcher's erasure of self establish a consistent character arc that earns the final stance. Minor: the relationship with Lio is told more than tested on the page until the crisis, and the "defiance of relief" hug feels slightly performed rather than contradictory.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the arbor breathes, Lio sleeps, the buckle endures—a crystallized moment that reweights the watcher's burden with visible cost (the voice is mine to hold and to hush). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered images (lanterns, cables, webbing maps), then the cadence shift in the final lines reweights the dominant stake (trust as small kept promises under pressure). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph; the single-POV, two-shard structure (crisis + resolution cradle) holds coherent pressure. Cost is legible: the narrator chooses to stay, foreclosing departure, with the soundless echo asking her to remain.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The arbor's wooden arteries, ropewalk, and upper court ground spatial choreography cleanly; the parachute buckle and webbing constrain the rescue attempt and charge the final image ("a small bright vow"). Sensory selection reflects urgency: during the crisis, the narrator counts gusts and hears the off-key percussion of the failing strap; afterward, wind smooths its ruffled sheet. The nocturnal arbor functions as micro-setting, pressuring every choice through verticality and exposure. Idiom ("the hungry clasp that must be fed") is consistent and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve trust under pressure—is signaled early and tightens when Lio's harness slips: the narrator must guide him through muscle memory without looking, a choice that narrows options and raises cost. The refusal/retry beat ("he refuses, then tries") deepens the autonomy/care tension. Escalation is driven by protagonist agency: revising the signal, pacing words to breath, directing the longer landing run. The resolution is earned by the narrator's alteration (voiding self until patterns remain) with visible cost (pride locked against teeth, choice to stay). One meaningful tightening forecloses the path of leaving the arbor.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Theme—trust as a system of small kept promises under pressure—emerges from concrete actions: the buckle threading, the breath-paced instructions, the defiance-of-relief hug that the trees accept. The final image offers a non-literal answer: the buckle endures as "a small bright vow that no one hears," reweighting the opening premise (the watcher's burden) without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the soundless echo, the revision of signals, and the protagonist's choice to stay rather than steal the arbor's voice. The motif of remembering through muscle memory constrains choices and charges closure without token repetition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a distinct perceptual signature: "the change in rhythm you ignore until the rhythm ignores you back" and "pride is the cheap spice that ruins concentration" carry voice-specific idiom. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—pulling close during the buckle crisis, widening to arbor-scale at closure. Dialogue ("One strap claps" / "Do not look") feels natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext (Lio's autonomy vs. the narrator's care). Minor slip: Lio's voice could be more distinct from the narrator's internal cadence; brief convergence at relief is acceptable, but earlier differentiation would sharpen. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot without padding. Rhythm varies naturally—short bursts during the buckle crisis ("Do not look"), longer breath in the final paragraph. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Minor issues: "the soundless echo" recurs four times, functioning as motif but verging on over-reliance; "After the radio static clears" bookends the piece purposefully but the third instance ("for the final time") feels slightly mechanical. Figurative density is controlled and voice-motivated ("my stomach becomes the canopy"), though "lightning tastes the underside" in the crisis beat is vivid but edges toward ornamental given the buckle's immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—aerial watcher + muscle-memory teaching + arbor-as-living-shelter—feels specific and non-obvious. The transformation of mentor-student trust into a spatial/systemic metaphor (trust as small kept promises, arbor breathing, buckle as vow) avoids template rescue plots. The piece commits fully to its premise: the watcher erases self until guidance feels like home, a stance that shapes every beat. Risk-taking in the lyric density and the choice to foreground atmosphere over linear action heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor: the core situation (guide talks novice through equipment failure) is familiar; the arbor setting and the muscle-memory method provide the fresh angle, but the emotional arc is not radically transformed.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present by paragraph one (setup). Drives at least three beats: revising the signal when Lio refuses, guiding him through the buckle repair via breath-paced instruction, directing the longer landing run (development). The final choice to stay and hold the voice (closure participation) is causally rooted in the pattern-seeker role. Causal pressure is strong: the narrator's decisions narrow Lio's options and enable the safe landing. Cost is visible: pride locked against teeth, self voided until patterns remain, choice to stay foreclosing departure. High irreplaceability: the role's specifics (blind mapping, reading rhythms, signaling turns) cannot be swapped. Two minor frictions: the "attentively inventive" attribute is named but the on-page invention (breath pacing, revised signal) is modest rather than dramatically creative; the role could theoretically be fulfilled by another trained watcher, though this narrator's arc makes it feel personal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Present by mid-story (second shard) when Lio reports the strap clap (setup). Handled in the crisis beat: the narrator talks him through the ladder of stitches and hungry clasp, and Lio finds/tests it (development). Returns in the final paragraph as "a small bright vow that no one hears," reweighting trust and the watcher's burden (closure participation). Causal pressure: the buckle's failure creates the central jeopardy; its repair enables the safe landing. Cost connection: the narrator's instruction must overcome Lio's impulse to look, and the buckle's hold becomes the proof of trust kept. Specificity: the off-key percussion, the webbing path, the clean metallic syllable of safety are irreplaceable details. One friction: the buckle is introduced slightly past the midpoint, limiting its early framing power.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Present by paragraph three as "the watcher's burden" (setup). Shapes tactics throughout: the narrator voids self to preserve patterns, revises signals to balance command and care, locks teeth against pride to maintain concentration (development). The final choice—"the voice is mine to hold and to hush"—directly crystallizes the burden with cost: staying rather than leaving (closure participation). Causal pressure: the concept constrains every decision under crisis. Cost is visible: self-erasure, patience under pressure, foreclosed departure. Specificity: "to void the self until only patterns remain" and "guidance feels like home" are irreplaceable phrasings tied to this exact concept. One friction: the concept is more thematic than mechanical; it does not supply a unique resource or tool, but it does reweight every choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Present by paragraph seven as a label tied to the watcher role (setup). Enables two on-page actions: revising the signal when Lio refuses (showing adaptive response to autonomy tension) and pacing words to breath during the buckle repair (showing inventive pedagogy under pressure) (development). The final paragraph ties attentive watching to prayer, a charged reprise that reweights the trait (closure participation). Cost connection: the invention is bounded by the need to preserve trust without commanding; the attentiveness must avoid pride. One friction: "attentively inventive" is more label than fully dramatized trait—specific inventive acts (the breath pacing, the revised signal) are present but modest rather than dramatically creative, and the trait could be described as "adaptive" or "responsive" with similar effect. Moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Present early: "my hands revise patterns faster than my mouth can narrate" (setup). Drives at least three beats: the narrator revises the signal after Lio's refusal, revises the landing plan for a longer run, and later revises charts while the wind smooths (development). The act of revision is tied to the core concept (watcher adapting to preserve trust) and reappears in the final third as part of the work cycle (closure participation). Causal pressure: each revision narrows options or enables the safe outcome. Cost connection: revision under pressure requires voiding pride and self. Specificity: the repeated verb "revise" becomes a structural spine; no near-synonym (adjust, alter, change) would carry the same iterative, corrective weight. Very high irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Signaled early: "Years ago my mentor taught me remembering through muscle memory, guiding my fingers blindfolded across webbing until touch drew maps" (setup). Drives the crisis beat: "use remembering through muscle memory and trace the webbing" becomes the instruction that saves Lio, and the narrator's hands air-dance with him (development). Returns in the resolution: "I will keep remembering through muscle memory until thought is the last thing to arrive and the first thing to go" (closure participation). Causal pressure: the method is the tactical solution to the buckle failure; without it, Lio cannot repair the harness blind. Cost connection: the method requires years of training and ongoing nightly practice. Specificity: the mechanics (blindfolded webbing, touch-drawn maps, thought as last arrival) are irreplaceable. Very high irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Present from the opening line: "nocturnal arbor above the clouds breathes like a lung suspended over the world" (setup). Pressures every choice: the ropewalk, the cradle, the verticality and exposure shape the rescue attempt; the upper court provides the landing zone; the wooden arteries insulate from lightning (development). The final image—"The arbor breathes, Lio sleeps"—charges closure by making the setting a witness and co-participant in the trust system (closure participation). Causal pressure: the arbor's structure (ropewalk, cradle, vertical court) constrains tactics and supplies the physical architecture for the watcher's work. Cost connection: choosing to stay is choosing to remain bound to this specific place. Specificity: "nocturnal arbor above the clouds" with wooden arteries, ropewalk, and breathing rhythm is irreplaceable; no generic tower or platform would carry the organic, symbiotic charge. Very high irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Present from the title and opening line (setup). Frames the narrative window: the story begins after static clears, proceeds through the crisis, and closes after static clears "for the final time" (development and closure participation). The timeframe creates a bounded pressure unit and the repeated phrase reweights the opening at closure. One friction: the timeframe is more lyric frame than live clock—it does not tighten decisions with countdown urgency or measurably alter tactics during the crisis. The phrase "after the radio static clears" recurs three times, functioning as structural punctuation, but the time between clearings is elastic and does not constrain moves. Moderate causal pressure; strong thematic charge. Swappability: a different temporal marker (after dawn, after the storm passes) could frame the window with similar effect, though the radio static ties to the pilot communication and adds slight specificity.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Present by paragraph six: "my motivation clears with it: to preserve trust under pressure, whatever arrives" (setup). Drives every choice under crisis: revising the signal to balance command and care, pacing words to Lio's breath, locking teeth against pride, choosing to stay at closure (development and closure participation). Causal pressure: the motivation forecloses easier paths (commanding without care, leaving the arbor) and shapes the final stance. Cost is visible: self-erasure, patience, foreclosed departure. Friction between want (to guide Lio safely) and cost (voiding self, suppressing pride) is dramatized in the crisis beats. Specificity: "to preserve trust under pressure" is tied to the watcher role and irreplaceable. Very high irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Present early: "a soundless echo resting inside the bones of the trees" (setup). Modulates with pressure: during the crisis it becomes "a grace note, the forest relearning its pulse while our two pulses relearn each other"; at closure it "asks me to stay" (development and closure participation). The tone charges the final image by making silence, breath, and echo the emotional texture of trust preserved. Coherence: the tone remains quiet, meditative, and attentive throughout, without jarring shifts. One friction: "soundless echo" recurs four times, a purposeful motif but verging on over-reliance; the phrase is more atmospheric than mechanically constraining. Moderate causal pressure (the tone does not change tactics, but it reweights the stakes at closure). Strong thematic charge. Moderate irreplaceability: a similar paradoxical phrase (silent hum, breathless voice) could substitute with minor tonal drift.</comment>
