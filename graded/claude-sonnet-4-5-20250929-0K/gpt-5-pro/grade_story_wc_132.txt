<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The nursery owner's interior world is specific and contradictory: "my certainty itched where the glove of routine had always fit" captures embodied discomfort with lost mastery. The shift from wanting control to accepting humility emerges through concrete micro-choices (opening channels, widening swales, letting moss claim posts). Theo functions as a useful foil whose question about the leaf "choosing routes toward survival or toward me" sharpens the protagonist's stake. Minor slip: the father's teaching arrives late and feels grafted rather than woven into earlier pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by line 3 (nursery owner, storm season, mossy trellis). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through recurring leaf observations, small reconstructions, and weather events that reweight the protagonist's stance from mastery to stewardship. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): "I will say the linden leaf changed me, and the storms, and the willingness to let change be" crystallizes the shift with conceptual cost (forfeiture of certainty, ledger set aside). The gale scene provides a micro-turn that validates the new approach, and the final image of "vines choosing threads like careful readers" charges prior material without moralizing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The mossy trellis after rain recurs with functional pressure: it survives the gale because "the moss had stitched seams the screws missed," constraining the protagonist's reconstruction choices. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "wet limestone and linden," "drip line moved it," "veins glistened as if mapping routes under the skin." Spatial choreography remains clear across the nursery, gate, trellis, bench, and street. The linden leaf functions as micro-setting, driving observation and tactical shifts, charging the final image when it settles on the boot with fern spores—a moment that reweights "life drifts by invitations instead of orders."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: the protagonist wants mastery over plant behaviors but faces storm season's disruption. Escalation under the Accumulative lens deepens through repeated failures of prediction, the apprentice's probing question, the gale that tests the new approach, and the ledger's abandonment. The nursery's survival through moss-stitched seams provides a meaningful tightening that validates the shift from control to stewardship. Cost is legible: certainty is forfeit, routines abandoned, advice now cautious admissions of ignorance. No reversal required; the accumulation model supports the closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: the linden leaf's drift, the moss's unplanned repair, the storms' patient lessons. "Sustaining transformation without demanding a finish line" crystallizes without moralizing. The final image—vines choosing threads, the protagonist listening for "the next translation"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the opening stake of mastery versus humility. Subtext operates in gesture and image: the leaf with fern spores as passengers embodies the invitation model. No thematic echo or prompt-language intrusion mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: "the wind had other syllables for me, and I was a poor translator" and "my honesty is awkward and circuitous" establish voice-particular diction. POV remains stable first-person; no head-hopping. Theo's dialogue feels natural and goal-driven: "whether the leaf was choosing routes toward survival or toward me" advances thematic pressure without exposition. Diction stays within the nursery owner's lexicon throughout, with rhythmic control modulating from controlled ("my ledger lined up like seed flats") to releasing ("I will keep listening"). One brief slip: "circuitously sincere" is used identically for both narrator and Theo, blurring voice distinction momentarily.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully: "I kept notes that read like apologies, and they did not fool me" shifts cadence cleanly. Information density is high; nearly every line advances character stance or atmospheric pressure. Two artifacts lower the score: (1) runs of parallel "I [verb]" stems in the final third create template cadence ("I would reconstruct… I would keep returning… I still wince… I let the leaf decide"), and (2) minor paraphrase loop between "releasing control to the weather" (line 23) and "by releasing control to water" (line 13). Figurative language is coherent and voice-motivated throughout; no mixed metaphors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—nursery owner learns humility from weather—is familiar but transformed through specific, verifiable detail: moss stitching trellis seams, fern spores on the leaf's back, drip lines altering placement. The linden leaf as teacher avoids symbolic convenience by recurring across multiple beats with evolving function. The shift from ledger to prayer-like plan and the apprentice's role as translator offer fresh inflections. Risk-taking in the elliptical, reflection-heavy structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on these exact particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The nursery owner's choices create key turns: marking where the leaf lands (early), opening channels and widening swales (middle), holding the trellis posts during the gale and picking up the leaf with fern spores (late), setting aside the ledger to write a prayer-like plan (closure). Each decision narrows options and alters tactics, forfeiting mastery for stewardship. Present across all three gates with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The linden leaf is handled or observed in at least five beats: morning discovery, marking its landing, watching it travel the drip line, customers touching it on the bench, settling on the boot with fern spores. Its meaning reweights from puzzle to teacher to invitation. The leaf's final appearance with passengers ("life drifts by invitations instead of orders") charges the closure image. Indispensable; removing it breaks the story's causal spine and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Reluctant metamorphosis" shapes the protagonist's arc from wanting mastery to accepting stewardship "slow, damp, undeniable." The concept constrains the middle tactics (trying to reconstruct beds, opening channels) and charges the closure stance ("willingness to let change be"). It appears early as "change came as a reluctant metamorphosis" and threads through the ledger's abandonment and the prayer-like plan. Present in setup and payoff with some middle development; causal role is solid but the exact phrasing feels slightly ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Circuitously sincere" is applied to Theo ("circuitously sincere about it, pretending indifference") and the narrator ("my honesty is awkward and circuitous, yet it is circuitously sincere enough to keep us growing"). The trait constrains the narrator's advice-giving ("I spoke cautiously, admitting what I did not know") and charges the ending stance. However, the identical phrasing for two characters and its summary-like application in the final third reduce specificity. Present in middle and closure with some cost, but swappable and not causally sharp.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Reconstruct" drives multiple beats: the protagonist tries to reconstruct beds by releasing control to water, opens channels and widens swales, plans to "reconstruct what I could, berms and drains and stakes" while letting the heart be guided by weather. The action redefines options from control to stewardship and appears in the closure paragraph. Early signal, middle development, and payoff present with causal pressure. Removing it would require major rewrites; score docked slightly for partial summary in late paragraphs.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Releasing control" is signaled early ("releasing control to water"), demonstrated in middle beats (opening channels, letting moss claim posts, stopping the stripping of carpets), tested in the gale (the trellis survives because moss stitched seams), and articulated at closure ("the heart of the place would be guided by releasing control to the weather"). The method shapes tactics across the arc with visible cost (certainty forfeit, routines abandoned). All three gates with strong causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The mossy trellis after rain anchors the title action ("kept returning to the mossy trellis after rain"), supplies the constraint that saves it during the gale ("the moss had stitched seams the screws missed"), and charges the final image ("the trellis will hold new weight, vines choosing threads"). It appears in at least four beats and alters tactics (letting moss claim posts instead of stripping it). Indispensable to both escalation and closure; micro-setting use is exemplary.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"During storm season" is signaled in the opening ("It was during storm season, when every plan blew sideways") and tightens decisions: the gale that tests the new approach, the overflowing gutters, the street flashing like a creek. The timeframe shapes the protagonist's shift from schedules to clouds and pressures the middle reconstruction attempts. Present in setup and middle with some closure linkage ("when the rains slacken"), but the clock is not live enough to drive beat-by-beat tactics; trends toward atmospheric constraint rather than urgent deadline.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To study plant behaviors" is the protagonist's opening motive ("My motive then was stout and simple, to study plant behaviors so I could predict how each stem would take its place") and evolves under friction: prediction fails, the leaf offers a patient lesson, the protagonist keeps returning "to study plant behaviors as they revealed themselves slowly." The desire is dramatized in choices (marking the leaf's landing, opening channels) and conflicts with the need to accept unpredictability. Present across setup, middle, and closure with visible cost (mastery forfeit).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Sustaining transformation" coheres across the arc: tone modulates from controlled early description to releasing middle tactics to the prayer-like closure plan. The phrase appears explicitly late ("sustaining transformation without demanding a finish line") but the tonal posture is consistent—patient, observant, accumulative—and charges the final image of vines choosing threads and the protagonist listening. The tone supports the Accumulative lens and reweights the opening stake. Present in mood throughout with closure articulation; not swappable.</comment>
