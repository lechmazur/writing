<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The narrator's interiority remains abstract and metaphor-heavy rather than embodied; "steadily curious" and "confusion itself felt like a map my grandmother left" are asserted but not shown through micro-choices under pressure. The cartomancer is vivid in gesture (skull ring tap, card shuffle) but her decisions never narrow options or foreclose a path with visible cost—she facilitates rather than drives. The arrival of people at the end feels unmotivated by prior protagonist agency; we lack the concrete stakes or internal contradiction that would make the final gathering feel earned rather than ambient.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly in the opening paragraph; no penalty. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pulses, routes, patterns layer toward a final image of collective presence. However, the closure unit lacks a decisive on-page cost—people arrive "without texts" and the room "kept humming," but no choice is forecloses, no visible price paid, no felt tension resolved. The Cost Proof Test fails: I cannot point to a sentence where cost is legible at the ending beat, only ambiance and metaphor.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft anchors atmosphere early and returns in the ending ("the loft windows…hummed"), charging the final image with spatial memory. The measuring tape, cork map, red string, and chalk function as tools that shape the work itself, constraining the method of pattern-making. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through the narrator's POV ("grit-bright hush," "steam, song, and rumor"). The environment charges the closure image, narrowly qualifying for the 9+ gate, but the spatial choreography during the gathering scene is vague (who stands where, how the room fills) and the setting's constraint on choice remains implicit rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—mapping cultural patterns to bridge a divided neighborhood—is signaled early and coheres across beats. The multiplying-paths method and pin-to-pin traversal constitute on-page work, and the gap "like a mouth" introduces a tightening. But the resolution is ambient rather than driven by protagonist agency: people arrive drawn by "steam, song, and rumor," not by a choice the narrator makes that forecloses an alternative path. The arrival feels like coincidence solving the stated problem, and no visible cost or trade-off is dramatized; the kettles cool and the room hums without friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: reverse engineering memory from ash, inherited mystery made practical, private panic becoming public rhythm. The final image of the room "borrowing our breath" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how to rebuild connection. However, the piece edges toward thematic echo in lines like "inherited mystery had finally found a mouth" and "reverse engineering of faith conducted with measuring tape, steam, cards, and patience," which label rather than dramatize. The cartomancer's aphorisms ("we are not hunting profit…slow and patient and real") risk sounding like thesis statements.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV distance is stable; first-person singular with consistent perceptual bias toward metaphor and inherited memory. The voice has a distinct lyric texture ("grit-bright hush," "siren sighed past") but diction occasionally drifts into abstract elevation ("lattice of constellations waiting to fall into meaning") that feels more decorative than character-particular. No dialogue is present; the cartomancer's and narrator's speech is reported indirectly, which is acceptable but misses an opportunity for voice distinction. Purposeful compression and patterned repetition ("multiplying paths," "confide") are taught early and held, but the final paragraph's "borrowed our breath" risks softening into poetic vagueness rather than concrete closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density pervades nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff at closure: "charts lost their gospel," "braid silt into islands," "kettles, stoops, and cracked posts with tiny arrows no algorithm could counterfeit." This creates texture but slows propulsion and obscures causality. Multiple paraphrase loops appear: "multiplying paths" recurs across six distinct sentences without meaningfully advancing pressure; "inherited mystery" toggles between "gift" and "practical" in adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence: "We multiplied pulses into routes, then multiplied routes into patterns…" echoes "We read graffiti as footnotes, mutual aid spreadsheets as epics…" The final beat ("borrowed our breath") is metaphorically opaque rather than concrete. Apply −1.2 for density + loops touching closure; disallow 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of cartomancy, measuring tape, and mutual-aid mapping is specific and non-obvious; the image of chalk arrows and multiplied paths offers a fresh angle on post-crash rebuilding. The grandmother's weather-for-songs backstory and the neighborhood gap feel particular rather than stock. However, the core emotional arc—lonely individuals drawn together by ambient signals—is familiar, and the resolution (people arrive without agency-driven invitation) does not transform the template through on-page cost or moral calculus. The prose leans heavily on lyric ornamentation, which can read as writerly flourish rather than inevitable voice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The onyx-ink cartomancer is present in setup (opens the scene, taps skull ring, spreads deck) and development (instructs the narrator to confide, to step pin-to-pin, asks arrivals to share routes), and shapes the closure (asks people to confide, places words on cork). However, her choices are facilitative rather than decisive; she does not face a dilemma or foreclose a path. She observes and guides but does not drive a key turn. Mid-band: present across all three gates but replaceable with any mentor figure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The measuring tape appears in setup (workbench alongside string and map), development (narrator stretches it pin-to-pin, "clicked in my fingers as I measured"), and closure (listed in the final summary "measuring tape, steam, cards, and patience"). It is handled in at least two distinct beats and its use—measuring distances—directly enables the method. However, its meaning does not evolve or recharge; it remains a tool rather than acquiring thematic weight. Strong causal role, but not indispensable—string or any linear measure could substitute.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Reverse engineering is signaled early ("her method was not divination but reverse engineering"), shapes middle tactics (tracing transactions backward to meals, meals to recipes, recipes to hands), and is named again at closure ("reverse engineering of faith"). The concept constrains the method: working backward from residue rather than forward prediction. It drives at least two beats and contributes conceptual charge to the ending. The mechanics matter: the backward trace from burned coins to shared kitchens alters what actions are possible. High integration; removal would break the logic of the cartomancer's work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Steadily curious" appears once in the opening paragraph as a label for why the narrator came. It does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost; the narrator's choices (stretching tape, stepping pin-to-pin) are prompted by the cartomancer rather than driven by curiosity that trades off against caution or comfort. Label-only mention; no development or closure participation. Cap at 3.8 for swappability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Confide" is signaled in setup ("Confide in the cards…with data, anecdotes, rumors"), drives development (narrator steps and cards fall, cartomancer asks arrivals to "confide one true route each"), and shapes closure (people's words are placed on cork, private panic becomes public rhythm). The action of confiding—sharing hidden knowledge—enables the bridge across the neighborhood gap. Two distinct beats and closure linkage. The mechanics matter: without confiding, the lattice cannot gather. High causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"By multiplying paths" is named early ("we multiplied pulses into routes, then multiplied routes into patterns"), recurs across middle beats (layering hypothetical errands, market days, funerals across the gap), and is invoked at closure ("By multiplying paths, the lattice sang"). The method shapes the work: accumulation of possible routes rather than single prediction. However, the mechanics remain abstract—how does one "multiply" a path on cork and string?—and the method could be replaced by "layering" or "accumulating" with minimal rewrite. Strong thematic presence but mid-band specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft anchors setup (opening line, "after the cryptocurrency crashes"), development (workbench with tools, floorboards register weight), and closure (windows spread open, room hums across wet rooftops). The loft supplies the workspace and the acoustic/spatial container for the gathering; its height and skylight create the rain-beaded atmosphere that charges the final image. The setting constrains choice (people must come to this space) and its sensory signature (rain, steam, hum) becomes the closure's charge. High integration; removal would flatten the ending's resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"After the cryptocurrency crashes" appears in setup (paragraph two: "when charts lost their gospel") and is echoed at closure in the reference to "burned coins and shuttered screens." The timeframe motivates the need to map new patterns after market collapse and provides the residue (ash, glass, emptied coworking temples) the cartomancer reads. However, time does not tighten decisions—there is no live clock, no urgency tied to elapsed duration. The crashes are backdrop rather than active pressure. Mid-band: present and motivating but not constraining tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to map cultural patterns" is named early ("we are here to map cultural patterns the way rivers braid silt"), drives the method (multiplying paths, reading graffiti and mutual aid as data), and is fulfilled at closure (the lattice sings, public rhythm emerges). The desire is dramatized through on-page work: stretching tape, stepping pin-to-pin, marking with chalk. However, friction between want and cost is minimal; the work succeeds without sacrifice or trade-off. Two gates and causal role, but no visible cost tied to this motivation lowers the score slightly.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The tone of "inherited mystery" is established in setup ("confusion itself felt like a map my grandmother left without coordinates"), modulates through development (chalk, sewing kit becoming compasses and constellations), and charges the closure ("inherited mystery had finally found a mouth"). The tone is coherent and purposeful, blending wonder with practical work. However, the final-line articulation ("inherited mystery had finally found a mouth") edges toward thematic echo, and the tone does not intensify under pressure—it remains a consistent lyric register rather than tightening at the peak. Solid integration but not indispensable; another tonal frame could carry the same arc.</comment>
