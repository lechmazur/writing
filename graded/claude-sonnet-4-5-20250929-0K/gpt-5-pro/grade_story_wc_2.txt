<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tinkerer's progression from "predictably repaired by habit" to befriending uncertainty is earned through fire, discovery, and the underground machine work. Internal contradictions appear in embodied form: "hands wet and shaking" while improvising, "fear thinned" as breathing matches waterfall rhythm. The final shop with out-of-phase clocks and customers waiting "for the right moment" demonstrates a credible stance shift with visible cost—the protagonist now lives by rhythms instead of schedules. Minor weakness: the admiral's backstory is told rather than discovered through objects or documents that would charge the present choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the tinkerer reopens the shop with charred beams as "ribs of memory" and practices willingness to adjust rather than certainty. Cost is visible in the doorbell that "refused to ring until the rain began" and clocks "wrong just long enough to be right"—operational friction that forecloses predictable repair work. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: fire → sigil → greenhouse → cavern → machine repair → reopened shop, each beat adding density and cadence shift until the final image reweights "broken-clock tinkerer" from failure to method. One tightening occurs when the compass seats and "numbers I could not read warmed the walls," narrowing the protagonist's interpretive frame and forcing improvisation as permanent stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The compass rose constrains the greenhouse entry ("tugged me through the swirling leaves"), the waterfall supplies the machine's heartbeat and measures time "by weight and fall," and the wire spool becomes tendon linking eras. Micro-setting detail charges closure: charred beams mounted as "ribs of memory" transform the rebuilt shop into a skeleton that mirrors the cavern machine. The botanical garden's "wet paper and the color green grown tired of itself" filters through the tinkerer's lens—decay as adjacent to restoration. Spatial choreography in the cavern is exact: ledge, pedestal, machine ribs climbed with "hands wet and shaking," socket placement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learning to befriend uncertainty in planning—is signaled at the fire and tightens when the compass "wheeled toward unlikely alignments" and again when seating the wire "began to improvise a bridge between eras." The machine repair forces a micro-choice cascade: screws as couplers, wire as tendon, thin blades for shims. Agency is decision and improvisation with visible cost: the tinkerer leaves the rose "plugged into the heart it knew before me," forfeiting the navigational tool to activate the system. The waterfall's "grammar of perhaps" becomes operational constraint in the reopened shop where timing depends on rain or pigeons. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens; escalation reads as density increase and cadence shift rather than reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the compass that points not north but "toward unlikely alignments," the water-clock "skeleton" with missing heart, and the final shop where clocks tick "out of phase" yet right. The ending line—"my clocks are wrong just long enough to be right"—reweights precision as a failure mode and error as cadence, answering the thematic question without moralizing. The charred beams as "ribs of memory" and the machine as cartwheel gears create a coherent metaphor system linking body, time, and willingness. No thematic echo or prompt-label intrusion. The admiral's need for "an instrument uncertainly certain" and abandonment of oceans integrates the human stakes of letting go predictability when horizons become untrustworthy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable first-person past with controlled psychic distance. Perceptual signature is watchmaker-specific: "screws and springs," "tested each step with a watchmaker's patience," "thin blades for shims." Diction modulates under pressure—short phrases when climbing the ribs, longer syntactic breath when fear thins. The idiom "Fire unmade that certainty" and "I let the wheel turn me until my breathing matched the waterfall" carry voice-specific metaphor rooted in mechanical and temporal lexicons. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("I realized," "I understood") are strategic and voice-motivated. Minor slip: "uncertainly certain poise" in the compass description borders on thesis statement rather than embedded observation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density with most lines doing multiple jobs: "moss silvered the walls, and a river stole light from a crack above" anchors setting and light source while advancing spatial descent. Rhythm varies purposefully—short clauses during machine assembly, longer breaths in retrospective opening. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor figurative density in the cavern section: "breathing cool like a hidden lung," "folded time like cloth," "spoke in drips and thuds, a grammar of perhaps" cluster within four paragraphs without clear pattern-teaching, approaching but not crossing overwriting threshold. Propulsion is strong; scaffolding is minimal. One stock phrase: "the color green grown tired of itself" risks cleverness over clarity but remains legible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of broken-clock repair, admiral's compass rose, subterranean waterfall machine, and uncertainly-certain time feels inevitable in hindsight yet non-obvious at start. The fire as catalyst for befriending uncertainty avoids the self-help template by rooting transformation in wire, gears, and algae rather than epiphany. The compass not pointing north but toward "unlikely alignments of errands and weather" and the machine measuring "hush by weight and fall" are specific, verifiable inversions of their referent objects. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure and the quiet ending—clocks "wrong just long enough to be right"—heightens stakes without obscuring causality. The tinkerer's occupational detail (screws as couplers, blades as shims) personalizes every turn. No close echoes of famous images; "rhythm, a metronome of accidents" and "practiced willingness to adjust" are fresh inflections on planning and time.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Broken-clock tinkerer present at opening ("screws and springs, predictably repaired by habit"), drives middle choices (traces vault, enters garden, climbs machine ribs, improvises repair), and shapes closure (reopens shop with out-of-phase clocks, waits for "the right moment"). Occupation constrains tactics: uses watchmaker tools as couplers and shims, tests steps "with a watchmaker's patience." The identity reweights at closure from failure ("broken-clock") to method ("wrong just long enough to be right"). Cost visible in operational friction of new shop. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Admiral's lost compass rose discovered beneath ashes (setup), guides through greenhouse ("tugged me through the swirling leaves"), brightens and pulses in cavern, hums when wire is unspooled, clicks when seated, and is left "plugged into the heart it knew before me" at closure. Its property—pointing toward unlikely alignments rather than north—constrains all navigation choices. The "uncertainly certain poise" and "needle quivered" tie directly to protagonist's trait. Returns in final image via the flickering corridor map. Causal across three beats, charges closure with visible cost (forfeit). Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Beneath the ashes" frames discovery (sigil found under shop fire), recurs at cavern ("Fire had touched this place too, and beneath the ashes the urn held a spool of wire"), and charges closure via charred beams mounted as memory. Shapes stakes: what survives fire becomes instrument. The concept appears in setup, middle discovery, and final image. Specific cost: loss of predictable shop, gain of uncertainty-based practice. Not fully indispensable—story could function with "after the fire"—but strong integration across beats.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Uncertainly certain" appears in compass description ("needle quivered with an uncertainly certain poise"), constrains machine operation ("an instrument uncertainly certain, one that aligned not with north but with unfolding"), and defines closure practice ("practiced willingness to adjust" and clocks "wrong just long enough to be right"). Trait shapes protagonist's choices: tests steps yet doubts, improvises with shaking hands yet faithful engagement. Visible cost in customers learning to wait for alignment rather than schedule. The attribute is the story's operational principle; indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>"Improvise" drives the cavern repair sequence: "began to improvise a bridge between eras," turning screws into couplers and wire into tendon. The action redefines options—rather than decode the machine's original design, the tinkerer synthesizes from pocket contents. Shapes closure: shop practice becomes "trimming sails to rumors instead of wind," and timing as improvisation rather than schedule. The tinkerer's shift from "predictably repaired by habit" to improvisational stance makes this action the hinge of transformation. Cost visible in forfeit of certainty. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Through the swirling leaves in a neglected greenhouse" is the method of entry to the cistern. The compass "tugged me through" establishes means; the grate discovery follows. Mechanics matter: padlocked garden, overgrown interior, grate hidden beneath swirl. Signaled early (garden location traced on map) and executed in middle beat. Does not shape closure directly but enables the core discovery. Strong causal role in one major beat; the specific method (leaves as concealment/compass navigation through disorder) fits the uncertainly-certain theme but could be replaced with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>Subterranean waterfall supplies the machine's heartbeat ("constant hush that folded time like cloth"), measures time "by weight and fall," and enables the gear engagement ("water teeth engaged the wheel with patient bite"). The waterfall's rhythm becomes the protagonist's breath ("my breathing matched the waterfall") and the operational constraint for the reopened shop's timing. Present in setup (heard descending stairs), drives middle repair choice, and charges closure via the city's "breathing" map and cadence-based practice. Indispensable; the story's time-measurement premise depends on this exact setting element.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"When coincidence becomes pattern" signals the timeframe trigger: letter arrives early, train delay, leaves spinning counterclockwise mark the threshold. The phrase drives the decision to follow compass rather than hide. Recurs implicitly in closure when customers "learned to wait for the right moment" and the doorbell aligns with rain or pigeon. Time as pattern-recognition rather than linear clock constrains all post-fire choices. Strong thematic integration; the timeframe is felt rather than tracked by a ticking clock, fitting accumulative lens. Not fully indispensable—story could use "after I noticed the pattern"—but essential to the uncertainty-befriending arc.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"To befriend uncertainty in planning" is promised after fire, tested by compass navigation and machine repair improvisation, and fulfilled in closure practice ("not schedules, but cadences"). Desire is dramatized in the cavern climb with "shaking" hands yet "faithful" engagement, and in the choice to leave the compass behind. Friction between wanting certainty (watchmaker habit) and accepting uncertainty (following the rose) drives all middle beats. Cost visible in operational shop constraints and customer waiting. The motivation is indispensable; removing it collapses the arc.</comment>
