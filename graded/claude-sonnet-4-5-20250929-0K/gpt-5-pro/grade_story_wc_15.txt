<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The narrator demonstrates clear interior texture through imagery ("hands still remember how to sew grief into nets") and embodied perception filtered through the wharf-weaver lens. The hauntingly optimistic trait is asserted but not tested under competing impulses; the journey proceeds without visible internal conflict or cost that forecloses a path. Motivation remains stable throughout—no contradictory wants act simultaneously in scene to deepen characterization under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early (lyric/mosaic exposition interleaved with action beats) and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure: the rough book and tactile lighthouse reweight the labyrinth's purpose from archival rigidity to participatory reverence, with the conceptual cost legible in "the only rule was listening" and the broken precedents becoming instruments. Orientation anchors (wharf, canyon labyrinth, protagonist role) arrive clearly within the first ~150 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the plate "fits the niche like a fossil returning to its bone," opening the seam and transforming the task from delivery to co-creation, which then charges the final image of the town touching blind pages.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The labyrinth's stone texture, chalk marks, and grooves constrain and guide multiple choices: the seam sewn open, the table's missing pages prompting the sail-scrap book, and the lighthouse's inward bloom that opens corridors. The tide-pool timeframe brackets the journey with sensory anchors (salt, ochre, glistening stones, refilling pools). Spatial choreography remains clear across the wharf → canyon entrance → fork → chamber → emergence sequence, with each location supplying resources (waxed thread, sail scraps) that alter tactics and charge the closure image of the town gathered with buckets and ropes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: coax a passage and carve a path from ruin to reverence, signaled early via the council's charge. Escalation unfolds through accumulative pressure: the labyrinth demands attention as payment, the plate reveals a seam, sewing opens the chamber, and the rough book's embossed pages finally illuminate the lighthouse inward. The protagonist's agency (threading, sewing, pressing sail scraps) drives each tightening, and the council's astonished question about rules at the end crystallizes the cost—precedent has been abandoned for listening, foreclosing the old Archivist method with the visible price of collective uncertainty now met by shared touch.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the interplay of broken precedents, participatory repair, and embodied knowledge: "the light must be carried in by whoever seeks to read" and "our new song needs every quiet shard" arise organically from the plate's transformation and the town's tactile reading. The lighthouse without a lamp functions as a central motif that shifts meaning—first a salvaged failure, then a promise requiring human engagement. The ending offers a resonant answer to the central question (how to move from ruin to reverence) through the image of palms learning light from blind pages, reweighting prior material without stating a moral. No thematic echo or label-speak flattens the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: the narrator notices through the wharf-weaver's idiom (sew, thread, stitch, nets) and reads the labyrinth as "not a puzzle but a choir." Diction stays consistently lyric and image-dense ("cool palm on my brow as if blessing a fever," "orchid solace unfolding across stone") without unmotivated register shifts. No dialogue appears. Under peak pressure (sewing the seam open, pressing the plate), the syntax compresses slightly but the interior texture holds, and the final council exchange ("what rules I followed") remains in the narrator's voice without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high across most beats. However, figurative density approaches saturation in several passages (tide pools exhale, canyon as hush, walls "swallow," stone parts "with shy gratitude," corridors "open like lungs"), risking overwriting without clear pattern-teaching or payoff tied to escalation. A mild paraphrase loop appears in the repeated "broken precedents" framing (lines 5, 6, final paragraph) without added pressure each time. No severe scaffold or template cadence, and the final image remains clear, so artifacts do not touch closure directly but accumulate to −0.4 within Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of labyrinth-as-archive, tactile/blind literacy, and communal sleepwalking paths offers a specific angle on ruin-and-repair that avoids generic templates. The lighthouse without a lamp transformed into an interior, participatory light feels earned in hindsight and constitutes a fresh inflection. However, the broader arc (community loss → journey into sacred space → retrieval of symbolic object → renewed hope) follows a recognizable pattern; the story transforms it through the sail-scrap book and embodied reading but does not fully escape the template's shadow, capping the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The poetic wharf weaver frames expectation early (setup), constrains middle choices (sewing the seam open, stitching sail scraps into a book—two distinct beats tied to the weaver skill), and is causally active at closure (the rough book held up for the town to touch). The weaving/sewing idiom pervades perception and action, making the character-trait essential across the arc. Strong beat involvement (+0.9), causal pressure (+0.8), closure linkage (+1.0), specificity (+0.5) elevate from the 3.0 default to ~6.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The storybook illustration plate appears early (setup: council gives it, "lighthouse missing the light"), drives two major beats (held against the wall to reveal the seam, then pressed repeatedly onto sail scraps to emboss pages), and participates decisively at closure (the embossed pages enable tactile reading, fulfilling the lighthouse's promise). Its unique property—etched lighthouse needing human-carried light—constrains the protagonist's final action and charges the ending image. Early signal (+0.5), three beats (+1.4), causal pressure (+1.0), closure linkage (+1.4), specificity (+0.6) elevate solidly into the 7–8 band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Broken precedents frame the story early (setup: "rules cracked like clay"), constrain the middle journey (the protagonist goes "not by compass or chant" but via sleepwalking paths, abandoning Archivist rules), and are reweighted at closure ("Even broken precedents can be instruments, once tuned"). The concept shapes stakes (how to navigate without old rules) and tactics (listening rather than following protocol), with a conceptual cost legible in the council's astonishment and the town's "shy hope." Early signal (+0.5), two beats (+0.9), causal pressure (+0.9), closure linkage (+1.2), conceptual cost (+0.4) yield ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Hauntingly optimistic is named early but functions primarily as a label: "not because I ignore fracture, but because I hear how openings sing when edges split." The trait does not constrain a choice with visible cost; the protagonist proceeds without a competing impulse (fear, doubt) that would dramatize optimism under pressure. Mentioned once in exposition without on-page tradeoff or action enabled/foreclosed by the trait. Setup present (+0.3), label-only (−0.5), no cost connection (−0.3), ornamental use (−0.7) cap the score near 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sewing/stitching appears in setup ("hands still remember how to sew grief into nets"), drives three major beats (stitching sleepwalking paths into a map, threading and sewing the seam open, sewing sail scraps into the rough book), and is causally indispensable at closure (the embossed book enables the town's tactile reading). Removing sewing would break the story's central mechanic and the wharf-weaver identity. Early signal (+0.6), three beats (+1.4), causal pressure (+1.2), closure linkage (+1.5), specificity (+0.7) place the score solidly in the 7–8 band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Overlapping sleepwalking paths are introduced early (setup: "chalk their footfalls… stitch their lines into a map of murmurs"), enable a middle choice ("I walk where the chalked map directs, where ninety two sleeping strides of Maris overlap"), and are implicitly paid off at closure when the protagonist describes "palimpsest of older sleepwalkers" and the final listening rule. The method shapes the journey's route and charges the concept of collective, unconscious navigation. Early signal (+0.5), two beats (+0.9), causal pressure (+0.7), closure linkage (+0.8), specificity (+0.4) yield ~5.8. The method is present and functional but does not uniquely constrain the protagonist's peak choice inside the chamber; the sail-book creation proceeds independently.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The centuries-old labyrinth carved into red canyon walls is introduced early (setup), constrains multiple choices (stone demands attention as payment, wall swallows the plate and reveals a seam, grooves around the table prompt the sail-book, corridors open "like lungs" after embossing), and charges the closure (the protagonist emerges as tide pools refill, spatial completion mirroring narrative closure). The labyrinth's physical properties (niche, seam, table grooves) supply resources and friction that shape tactics across the arc. Early signal (+0.6), three beats (+1.4), causal pressure (+1.3), closure linkage (+1.0), specificity (+0.6) elevate into the 7–8 band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>After the tide pools empty brackets the story twice (opening line and penultimate paragraph: "tide pools are beginning to refill"), creating a lyric frame that reweights the journey as a natural cycle. The timeframe does not tighten decisions within the labyrinth—no live clock pressures the protagonist's moves—but the reprise at closure charges the final image of the town gathering as water returns, signaling renewal. Setup present (+0.5), lyric reprise with closure reweighting (+1.2), no middle constraint (−0.5), no urgency shaping tactics (−0.4) yield ~5.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>To carve a path from ruin to reverence is introduced early (setup: "coax a passage… carve a path"), drives the journey's goal (seeking the chamber, creating the book), and is fulfilled at closure when the rough book enables the town to "feel the light" and "the harbor begins to sound less empty." The motivation is dramatized through on-page actions (sewing, pressing, embossing) rather than told-only, though no competing want (e.g., safety, return) creates friction. Early signal (+0.5), two beats (+0.9), causal pressure (+0.9), closure linkage (+1.3), conceptual cost at ending (+0.4), but no visible internal friction (−0.5) yield ~6.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Orchid solace appears once explicitly ("an orchid solace unfolding across stone") near closure, describing the lighthouse's inward bloom. The tone throughout is lyric, patient, and gently reverent, modulating minimally under pressure—no sharp contrast or cadence shift as stakes rise. The final image (town touching blind pages, harbor sounding less empty) sustains the solace tone and charges the ending without overt transformation. Late first appearance (−0.4), single mention (−0.5), but strong closure linkage (+1.4) and tonal coherence that supports theme (+0.8) yield ~6.1. The tone is present and purposeful but not causally varied across beats.</comment>
