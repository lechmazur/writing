<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interiority is concrete and specific ("I tremble" followed immediately by its conversion to tighter grip), with embodied tension throughout. The mentor relationship and its posthumous influence motivate present choices with clear emotional cost. However, the protagonist remains largely unopposed by other characters; the council's resistance dissolves quickly without meaningful internal conflict for the narrator, and the resolution feels earned more by discovery than by a hierarchy of competing values tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds pressure through layered discovery (envelope → resin pattern → surveyor's chain → opening schedule), culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the gates function and the valley "learns how to listen." Closure lands on the page with conceptual cost (the lesson of encrypted care must be remembered, the method archived). Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the resin sequence translates into the schedule, reweighting the quarrel from abstract dispute to embodied rhythm.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The amphitheater's breath functions as more than backdrop: it times the gate operation, hums in response to the chain, and constrains the maintenance calendar. The volcano's "stone lung," basalt ribs, and galleries bored by vanished fire are specific and purposeful. The antique surveyor's chain becomes a tactile object handled across beats (quivering against the wrist, laid across steps, polished bright, run under a farmer's thumb). Micro-setting qualifies; the chain and the breathing rhythm directly charge the final resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>One dominant stake is clear: harmonize conflicting water claims before disaster. The piece delivers one meaningful tightening when the resin pattern unlocks the schedule, narrowing options from abstract debate to a testable design. The testing beat shows the gates working ("bats poured out unharmed," downstream intake spins), and the farmer's nod signals acceptance with visible cost (the ledger "soften[s] and still balance[s]"). Agency is decision and demonstration. No second reversal is required at this length; the escalation is present but modest, relying more on revelation than on protagonist struggle against obstacles.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the mentor's encrypted message and the protagonist's enactment: "engineering is encrypted compassion, numbers arranged to cradle a world without bragging." The final image—"machinery and mercy kept time together, a slyly heartfelt metronome"—reweights prior material without moralizing. The piece resists false equivalence (the conflict is not balanced artificially; it is resolved by translating care into legible form). Subtext operates in the resin spacing, the chain's lengths, and the amphitheater's exhalation. One risk: the closing lines edge toward direct thematic statement, but they remain anchored in image and rhythm.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>First-person voice is distinct, filtering setting through the engineer's attentive, metaphor-rich perception ("dark ribs of basalt," "stone lung," "dappled resolve"). Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. The narrator's perceptual signature—observing breath, trembling, translating pattern into compassion—remains consistent under pressure. Dialogue (council and farmer exchanges) is brief but goal-driven and purposeful, advancing the test and resolution. Free indirect style is clean. The prose modulates appropriately: lyric during discovery, more grounded during the demonstration. Minor caution: some elevated diction ("fossilized waves," "cathedral") approaches overwriting but stays voice-motivated and legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence. Information density is high (most sentences advance character, discovery, or atmosphere). Figurative language is pervasive ("stone lung," "encrypted compassion," "slyly heartfelt metronome"), and while generally purposeful, it accumulates in high-pressure beats without always clarifying causality—e.g., "math and mercy arguing" is evocative but abstract at a pivot moment. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. One scaffold phrase: "When I laid the chain across the steps, the amphitheater hummed, and the pattern translated" uses passive discovery where active problem-solving might sharpen agency. Overall clean, with momentum intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The combination of floodgate engineering, posthumous mentor message encoded in adhesive, and a breathing amphitheater is specific and non-obvious. The piece transforms a template "solve the village dispute" plot through tactile, verifiable engineering detail (surveyor's chain, resin spacing, counterweights) and a distinct emotional angle (grief sublimated into design). Risk-taking is moderate: the lyric voice and metaphor density elevate the material without obscuring clarity. The closure grows organically from prior particulars. Transformation test passes; swapping names and places would lose the amphitheater's breath and the chain's material specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The machinist protagonist is present throughout, making key decisions: to bring the envelope, to analyze the adhesive, to lay the chain across steps, to present the schedule, to test the gates, and to archive the tools. These choices create the central turn (discovery of the schedule) and drive the resolution. Observation is paired with action. The character could be more oppositionally tested by other agents, but agency is clear and causal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The antique surveyor's chain appears in setup (given by the council), is used in the middle beat (laid across amphitheater steps to translate resin spacing into the schedule), is embodied in the demonstration (counterweighting the gates, "polished bright"), is handled again (farmer's thumb runs along it), and is archived at closure. The chain's lengths are irreplaceable; they decode the mentor's resin pattern. Removing it would break the story's logic. High integration across beats and closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Encrypted compassion is introduced early via the mentor's teaching, enacted on the page when the protagonist decodes the resin-adhesive pattern into a gate schedule, and tested when the council asks how choices were calibrated. The concept shapes tactics (analyzing adhesive, spacing as lengths, timed openings) and charges the final image ("machinery and mercy kept time together"). It is not merely thematic backdrop; it alters the protagonist's method and the council's acceptance. Strong causal role and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Slyly heartfelt" is signaled early ("dappled resolve," the mentor's letters "slyly heartfelt, doodled with springs and confessions"). The trait constrains the protagonist's method: blending technical rigor with emotional inheritance. It surfaces in the presentation to the council ("I told them a story about letters and glue, slyly heartfelt and rigorously measured") and charges the ending ("a slyly heartfelt metronome"). The cost is oblique—vulnerability in technical presentation—but the trait recurs purposefully and shapes voice. Integration is solid but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Tremble" appears twice: once when the narrator feels the amphitheater's breath and hears "math and mercy arguing," then again in the standalone beat "I tremble. / But trembling does not loosen my grip; it tightens the fit..." This second instance reframes physical reaction as precision under pressure, linking to the mentor's lesson. The action is specific and voice-driven, but it does not create a major turn; it colors interiority without altering tactics. Purposeful but not load-bearing for plot.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The method (analyzing envelope adhesive) is signaled in setup, executed on-page in the middle ("I scraped a film from the flap and mixed it with distilled rain"), and pays off when the resin pattern decodes into the chain-based schedule. The mechanics matter: resin spacing matches surveyor's chain lengths, enabling the solution. Removing this method would break causality. It appears across beats, shapes the central discovery, and is essential to closure. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The amphitheater setting is present throughout and directly pressures choices. Its breath times the gate operation ("we work as the building breathes"), the steps serve as the substrate for laying the chain, the warm draft triggers the narrator's epiphany, the hum confirms the pattern, and the final maintenance schedule is keyed to the amphitheater's rhythm. The setting is irreplaceable; its volcanic breath is the story's temporal and causal spine. Removing it would collapse the plot and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "as the building breathes" is introduced early, recurs in the council's instruction, governs the gate testing ("timed our opening as the building breathes"), and shapes the maintenance calendar mapped at closure. It constrains tactics (when to open gates) and charges the final image (machinery keeping time with breath). The breath is not a countdown clock but a rhythmic constraint that alters decision-making. Integration is strong; swapping for generic time would lose thematic and mechanical coherence.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation to harmonize conflicting values is stated early, dramatized through the council's quarrel (orchards vs. habitat), tested in the adhesive-analysis and gate-design beats, and resolved when "Farmers and guardians stood side by side" and the schedule balances flows without cheating the ledger. The friction between wants (fairness, survival, habitat) and the cost of compromise (ongoing retune agreement, memory of hidden care) is visible on the page. The motivation drives all major choices and is inseparable from closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Dappled resolve" is signaled in the opening and modulates throughout: the narrator arrives uncertain but committed, trembles but tightens grip, listens and translates, presents with vulnerability ("slyly heartfelt"), and departs with "a steadier heartbeat." The tone coheres through discovery and demonstration beats, and charges the final image (resolve embodied in the metronome). It does not shift dramatically under pressure but maintains a consistent texture of tentative confidence. Solid integration; tone supports rather than dominates.</comment>
