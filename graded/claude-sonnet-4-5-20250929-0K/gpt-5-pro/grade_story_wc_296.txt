<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Issa's interiority is concrete and character-particular throughout: "She tastes bile and iron, and then she steadies herself as if setting spear to shield." Her micro-choices under pressure are clear—kneeling, pricking her palm, loosening the rings—each action rooted in warlike discipline and earned by the teacher's betrayal. The backstory about Master Ren integrates well, anchoring her present stance without flattening momentum. Minor slip: the phrase "room inside her armor" in the penultimate beat reads slightly abstract for peak emotional clarity, but does not undercut the earned renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Orientation is swift: Issa, druid, lake, orchard vortex established by ~100 words. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure accretes through expanding ritual circles, blood offering, seed unfurling, and word-by-word revelation until the orchard "stands down" in the final image. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Issa releases the binding she herself wove, reads the confession aloud to the lake, and walks away—renunciation with visible cost ("ache in a clean way"). The lens holds without contradiction, and the cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The orchard vortex constrains every choice: circling trees, orbiting apples, ice disk at center supply spatial pressure and resources (ice to read, rings to unbind). Micro-setting details—flat stone for the seed, shore for kneeling—anchor action. The lake's transformation from forced mirror to "winter sky and a steady woman" charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is controlled: "apples bump the shore like helmets stacked after drill" filters perception through Issa's martial lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: discover the truth that refuses reflection. One meaningful tightening: the seed eats spells, letters coalesce, confession reveals Master Ren drowned the orchard using her hands. Issa's agency drives escalation—she unbends the rings she herself wove, reads aloud to the lake, feeds the seed the final binding—each choice forecloses reconciliation with her teacher. The cost is felt: "ache in a clean way" and the orchard "handed a final order to stand down." No forced reversals; pressure coheres under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars without statement: mirrors hide/truth revealed, guilt disguised as spectacle, warlike clarity versus deceptive surfaces. The seed, ice, and orchard recur with shifted weight—truth eats secrecy, frozen words become readable, spinning stalls into stillness. Final image delivers a resonant non-literal answer: "the room inside her armor…not empty, but ready" reweights the journey without a moral. The phrase "what mirrors don't show" returns as earned insight, not prompt echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; psychic distance tight. Perceptual signature is martial throughout: "spear to shield," "helmets stacked after drill," "handed a final order." Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure: short syntax during the seed's feeding, longer cadence during the walk out. Minor slip: "the guarded druid" in the opening reads slightly expository for a character we track intimately, but voice recovers immediately. Diction stays within Issa's warrior-druid lexicon; no register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines advance ritual, revelation, or interiority. Figurative language is purposeful ("hush like armor," "apples orbiting…in a solemn storm") and pattern-consistent. Two small frictions lower the score: "Because she finds lost things and returns them" reads scaffoldy in paragraph two, and the opening's "After the magic trick fails, the lake stops pretending" double-states the framing. Sentence openings vary; no template runs. Clarity and propulsion remain strong throughout the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—druid as truth-finder, flesh-eating seed as spell-eater, frozen confession in cursed orchard—is specific and non-obvious. The twist that Issa herself wove the binding rings elevates stakes beyond retrieval-mission template. Warlike serenity as tonal through-line is fresh. Risk: expanding-circles ritual and blood-feeding seed could have felt ornamental, but both constrain tactics and charge closure. The final image ("room inside her armor") is particular enough to avoid generic resolution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Issa (guarded druid) drives every key turn: kneels and breathes through expanding circles, pricks palm to feed the seed, unbends the rings she wove, reads the confession aloud, places the seed to eat the final binding. Setup by paragraph two, present in middle ritual beats, decisive at closure. Her choices alter tactics (loosening current, feeding seed) and foreclose reconciliation with Master Ren. Visible cost: "ache in a clean way."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Flesh-eating plant seed appears in three distinct beats: emptied from pouch onto flat stone (setup), fed blood and eats spell-film to reveal letters (middle), placed where rings were knotted to eat the final binding (closure). Its specificity matters: "color of bruised milk," "thirsts for skin and secrecy," "mouth of tiny sieves." Removing it would break the mechanism of unveiling. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Frozen confession is the core stake: "disk of trapped ice with words blurred inside," later "skeletal as winter fish…readable and cold." It drives tactics (seed must gnaw ice without shattering), reveals Master Ren's crime (orchard drowned by command), and Issa reads it aloud to the lake in the climax. Present in opening third, constrains middle ritual, and shapes the ending's release. Indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Finds lost things and returns them" is invoked in paragraph two and frames the quest (truth that refuses reflection). It constrains the choice to return here rather than stay silent, and the closing walk-out literalizes "returning" the confession to the lake. One middle callback: "never expecting the finder to return." Present across beats but cost connection is more implicit than visceral; swapping for "seeker" would weaken but not break the story.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Unbend" is the action-command spoken twice: first to the knotting current and to herself, second to the pattern that holds the orchard obedient. It drives the major turn—Issa loosens the rings she wove, the orchard's spin softens, the ice thins. Causal and irreplaceable: without unbending, the confession stays trapped. Early signal (~midpoint), peak use at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Through expanding circles of thought" appears in two ritual beats: kneeling to sense the orchard's rotation and roots, then "expanding circles of release" to loosen the rings. The method is signaled, shapes tactics (meditative rather than combative approach), and is specific to druid magic. Removing it would flatten the ritual's mechanics. Minor friction: it could be more causally urgent (why circles vs. another method?).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Swirling orchard vortex at cursed lake's heart is setup in paragraph two, supplies all spatial pressure: circling drowned trees, orbiting apples, trapped ice at center. It constrains every choice—Issa must calm the spin to reach the ice, unbend the rings that keep it circling. The vortex's stall at closure ("divides into paths that lead back to shore") is the visible proof of success. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"After the magic trick fails" frames the timeframe in the opening line and recurs as backstory anchor: "after the last audience gasped and the magic trick failed, she remembered the lake." It motivates Issa's return and sets the premise (spectacle failed, truth must be retrieved). Present in setup and backstory, but does not tighten on-page decisions during the ritual. Lyric reprise would lift it higher.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"To discover what mirrors don't show" is stated in paragraph three and dramatized throughout: the lake forced to spin and forget, confession hidden, Issa's realization at the end ("in that blankness she sees precisely what mirrors don't show, the room inside her armor"). The desire drives every ritual choice. Friction between motive and cost is clear: uncovering truth costs her the image of her teacher. Strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Warlike serenity" is established early ("the calm around her feels honed, an old warlike serenity") and sustained through every beat: "steadies herself as if setting spear to shield," "clarity that follows a battle prayer," "apples bump the shore like helmets stacked after drill," orchard "handed a final order to stand down." Tone modulates with pressure—tightens during the seed's feeding, breathes during the walk out—and charges the final image. Indispensable to voice and closure.</comment>
