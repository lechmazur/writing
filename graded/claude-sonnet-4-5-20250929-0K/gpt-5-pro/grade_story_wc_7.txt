<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The chef's ability to taste memories is established and drives several micro-choices (trading grandmother's memory, tasting childhood in sweat), but interiority leans heavily on poetic assertion rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Kye's arc from erasure to arrangement shows clearer transformation with visible cost in their tears and declaration. The therapeutic framing ("synaptic plasticity," "pathways") flirts with diagnostic label-speak but stays dramatized enough through the soup's sensory effects to avoid full penalty. Motivation remains consistent, though the final choice feels more like inevitable fulfillment than a decision that forecloses a live alternative.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (greenhouse at dusk, celestial alignment at midnight, rusted setting) arrive early and remain stable. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered sensory detail, ritual preparation, and the seed's awakening, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where community-as-trellis and ritual care crystallize the rebellion's future form. Cost is legible in the traded memory, Kye's tears as irrigation, and the forfeiture of safety for beauty. One meaningful deepening occurs when the seed sprouts and its first leaf delivers the taste of rebuilt libraries, reweighting the stakes from personal to communal. The pattern holds without contradiction, though causality between planetary alignment and sprouting rests on stipulated magic rather than earned mechanics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse supplies vivid, purposeful detail—crying hinges, shattered panes threading planetary light, iron ribs vibrating—that constrains the ritual and charges the closure image. Sensory hierarchy reflects the chef's professional filter: taste anchors memory (rain on grandmother's porch, pickled plums, coins in fountain water), while sight and smell support atmosphere (books in rain, burnt sugar of courage). The camping stove and bent workbench ground the poverty of resources, and the spatial choreography (basket on bench, seed in composted diaries, bowls in a circle) remains coherent. The greenhouse as cathedral of patient geometry directly shapes the final image of ordinary care, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—creating beauty to awaken suppressed memory and community against the Quiet Diet—is signaled early and tightens through the ritual's steps. One meaningful turn occurs when the seed sprouts and Kye moves from fear ("Is this dangerous") to agency ("arranging is how I will refuse him"), crystallizing stance with visible emotional cost (tears as irrigation). The celestial alignment functions as a time constraint, though its mechanics remain decorative rather than tactical. The resolution relies on the seed's stipulated awakening rather than protagonist decision; the chef executes a faithful recipe without a trade-off that narrows live options. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but lacks a second reversal or tactical pivot that would elevate escalation into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: gentle rebellion as patient tending versus erasure, memory as nourishment versus sanctioned blandness, community as trellis versus isolation. The final image—laying bowls in a circle, "beauty begins where someone cleans a place"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing, reweighting the seed's awakening as ordinary ritual rather than miracle. Subtext operates cleanly in Kye's declaration ("arranging is how I will refuse him") and the chef's patient listening "like a pot simmers." The synaptic plasticity reference risks essay intrusion but stays integrated through sensory proof (tears irrigate, routes form). No thematic echo in the final paragraph; the bowls-and-cleaning closure avoids stating the thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single-POV third-person limited holds stable distance and filters all perception through the chef's culinary vocabulary (silence as seasoning, grief without punctuation, editing paragraphs). Figurative density is high but mostly voice-consistent: "planets braid their long spines," "moonwind," "synapses asked to dance." Kye's dialogue feels goal-driven and carries subtext, though their voice ("arranging is how I will refuse him") briefly elevates into thematic articulation that risks convergence with the narrator's register. Filter verbs ("I tasted," "I knew") appear frequently but read as purposeful POV anchoring rather than dullness. Diction remains controlled; no unmotivated register shifts. The perceptual signature—everything filtered through taste and culinary metaphor—is distinct and charges pressure without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is very high, with metaphor in nearly every sentence: "hinges cried like old gulls," "sky made room for prophecy," "roots tasted the air," "arranging is how I will refuse." Most images are fresh and voice-coherent, but the accumulation slows momentum in non-peak beats (the pruning sequence runs long with "inviting moonwind" and "grief that had run on for years"). Two paraphrase loops: the "gentle rebellion" concept is restated across three beats without added pressure, and the synaptic plasticity explanation appears twice (once mid-story, once near the end). Template cadence is avoided, and sentence openings vary. No grammar errors. The closure beat ("laid the bowls in a circle, a ritual of ordinary care") is clean and propulsive, so non-closure density caps accumulation penalty at −0.8, preventing entry to 8+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—chef who tastes memories uses celestial alignment to plant a knowledge-fruit seed as gentle rebellion—synthesizes multiple prompt elements but reads as a constructed response rather than an organic vision. The transformation test is marginal: swap "chef" for "gardener" and "memories" for "emotions" and the arc holds unchanged. The rusted greenhouse and composted-diaries detail provide specificity, and "arranging versus erasing" offers a fresh inflection on resistance. The synaptic plasticity method and planetary mechanics remain decorative rather than causally weight-bearing. Risk-taking is modest; the piece commits to its lyric register but avoids bold structural or moral choices that would test the premise's implications. No close echoes of famous lines, and emotional truth (Kye's tears, traded memory) avoids generic templates.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The chef's memory-tasting ability is introduced early, drives the bartered-memory setup, and reappears in two distinct beats (tasting childhood in sweat, tasting libraries in the seed's leaf). The trait enables the knowledge-fruit ritual and shapes the final closure participation (tasting the seed's first leaf reweights the rebellion's potential). Causal pressure is present but modest—the chef's choices feel like faithful execution of a known recipe rather than decisions that narrow live options. Cost is legible in the traded memory but that price is paid off-page before the story begins. The trait constrains perception (everything filtered through taste) but not tactics. Mid-band score reflects solid beat involvement and closure linkage without high irreplaceability or on-page tactical cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The knowledge-fruit seed appears in setup (unwrapped from cloth, glinting like a dark tear), development (laid in composted diaries, watered from the fountain), and payoff (sprouts, first leaf tastes of rebuilt libraries). It drives three distinct beats and supplies the closure image's causal spine: the seed's awakening validates the rebellion and delivers the story's conceptual repricing (libraries rebuilt, playgrounds full). Specificity is high—smuggled, confiscated, only wakes under planetary alignment—and swapping it for a generic "magic seed" would gut thematic resonance. Visible cost ties to it (bartered memory to obtain it, tears to irrigate it). Closure linkage is strong but one step removed from the final image (bowls laid in a circle), preventing full 8.5+ indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Gentle rebellion is signaled early ("I chose gentle rebellion to create something beautiful") and shapes the protagonist's tactics throughout: no slogans or shouting, but flavors and ritual care. It drives the choice to plant the seed, constrains the method (patient preparation, inviting rather than forcing), and charges the closure declaration ("not with a war…but with a table and enough bowls"). The concept reweights the ending image (cleaning as rebellion) and ties to visible cost (risking danger for beauty). Causal pressure is present but the concept mostly functions as thematic frame rather than a force that narrows tactical options in a high-stakes beat. Mid-to-upper band reflects strong setup, development, and payoff without the irreplaceability or on-page friction that would push it higher.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Informally wise" is introduced with a simile ("I listen like a pot simmers") but remains largely label-only. The trait colors the chef's patient tone and decision to use "silence as seasoning," but no on-page action tests it under pressure or pays a visible cost for that wisdom. The chef's choices feel inevitable rather than constrained by this specific attribute; swap "wise" for "patient" or "careful" and the arc holds. Setup and closure participation are weak (the trait is mentioned once mid-story and does not reappear in the final image). Functional but replaceable, with minimal beat involvement and no escalation or cost tied directly to the attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Pruning is introduced early and drives a distinct beat: cutting grape skeletons to "invite moonwind," editing "a paragraph in a grief that had run on for years," and Kye joining with shears. The action ties to theme (removal as preparation, care as rebellion) and enables the seed's later awakening by clearing space for planetary light. It reappears metaphorically in the closure promise ("keep pruning away fear, letting light through"). Causal pressure is present—pruning changes the greenhouse's state—but the action feels more like necessary setup than a decision that forecloses live options. Specificity is moderate; "clearing" or "cleaning" could substitute with minor edits. Mid-to-upper band reflects solid beat involvement, thematic resonance, and closure linkage without high irreplaceability or on-page tactical cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Synaptic plasticity is named once mid-story ("My craft is not magic; it is biology…strengthening pathways through synaptic plasticity") and once near the end ("how tears could irrigate the brain, how new routes could form"). The method is signaled but its mechanics remain decorative—no on-page beat shows the chef adjusting tactics based on synaptic principles, and the seed's awakening follows stipulated magic (planetary alignment) rather than biological process. The concept supplies thematic vocabulary (routes forming, pathways opening) but does not constrain choices or supply resources that alter outcome. Functional mention without development or causal work; closure participation is thematic echo only. Cap at setup + theme participation without middle beat or tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse is introduced in the opening line and supplies persistent constraints and resources across the entire arc: shattered panes thread planetary light (enabling the ritual), iron ribs vibrate with memory, bent workbench holds the basket, cracked beds receive the seed. The setting drives at least three beats (unlocking/pruning/planting) and charges the final image as "cathedral of patient geometry" where ordinary care becomes rebellion. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout. The greenhouse's specific properties (rust, broken glass, iron structure) are irreplaceable—swap for a generic garden and the thematic resonance (beauty from ruins) collapses. High causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity meet the 8.5+ threshold, with only minor swappability (another ruined structure could serve) preventing full indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The celestial alignment is introduced in the opening lines ("once-in-a-lifetime," "peak at midnight," "seven reluctant planets") and supplies the story's timeframe and urgency. It drives the decision to plant tonight and enables the seed's awakening (stipulated to wake "when the planets lined their long spines"). The alignment reappears at the climax ("At the stroke of alignment") and charges the closure image as the moment planetary light threads the greenhouse. Causal pressure is moderate—time tightens the window but does not force tactical trade-offs on the page—and the mechanics remain decorative (the planets' influence is asserted, not demonstrated). Setup, development, and payoff are present, but the element feels more like atmospheric framing than a force that narrows options under stress. Mid-band reflects solid integration without high irreplaceability or visible cost tied to the timeframe's constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The motivation to create beauty from ruins is introduced early ("I planned to cook with starlight and soil," "create something beautiful from the ruins") and drives the protagonist's every choice: bartering a treasured memory for the seed, pruning the greenhouse, brewing the awakening broth, and laying bowls in ritual care. It faces friction in Kye's question ("Is this dangerous") and the city's erasure culture, and it pays visible cost in the traded memory and tears. The motivation reweights the closure image (beauty begins where someone cleans a place) and ties directly to the dominant stake. Causal pressure is strong—decisions trace to this desire—but the arc feels more like faithful fulfillment than a choice that forecloses a competing want. Upper band reflects beat involvement, closure linkage, and cost without the high internal conflict or irreplaceability that would push to 8.5+.</comment>
