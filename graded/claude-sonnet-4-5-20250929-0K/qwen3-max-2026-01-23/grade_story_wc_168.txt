<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias is anchored by visible scars and a clear goal (carrying the box, translating pain), but the interiority is heavily abstract—"alchemy," "universal language," "hard softness"—without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final "enlightenment" arrives through sustained reflection rather than a micro-choice under pressure that forecloses a path with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present in tactile handling of the box, but the epiphany feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle. The protagonist remains competent and resolute throughout, with no genuine mistake or blind spot that compounds before resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where early (firefighter, ridge path, moonlit night); the dominant stake—fulfilling the bargain by understanding innocence—is signaled and pursued. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the piece deepens through layered reflection and the porcelain box's symbolic weight, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (enlightenment and acceptance that innocence transforms rather than remains pristine). However, the cost is felt primarily as conceptual repricing rather than a visible forfeiture or altered tactic on the page; the final walk down with the box "secure against his chest" reweights meaning but lacks a sharp before/after with tangible sacrifice. The closure is legible but soft, relying on thematic assertion ("bargain fulfilled") more than dramatized consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The moonlit ridge path, weathered stone, and porcelain box provide concrete anchors; sensory details (cool air tightening scars, scent of damp earth, breeze in pines) are filtered through Elias's professional and emotional lens. The box's cracks constrain his understanding and charge the final image as a map of survival, meeting the 9+ gate's requirement that an object or environment shape choice or closure. Spatial choreography remains clear (settling on stone, rising, descending), though the setting functions more as backdrop and symbolic frame than as a source of immediate tactical pressure during the reflective sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding and fulfilling the bargain of salvaged innocence—is clear and braided with Elias's need to translate pain into connection. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure accumulates through deepening reflection rather than causal reversals; the final realization that innocence evolves into wisdom reweights the premise. However, no live option is foreclosed with visible cost on the page; the walk down with the box "secure" and "no longer an anchor" feels like acceptance without sacrifice or tactical trade-off. The piece lacks a moment where agency (decision, renunciation, endurance) narrows concrete choices or forces a price legible in action rather than perception.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the scars, the cracked box, and the child's drawing: survival, transformation, and shared resilience as a "universal language." The final image—scars as words, fractures gleaming like starlight—offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing, and the motif of cracks/scars recurs purposefully to reweight innocence as evolution rather than loss. However, late-paragraph abstractions ("translation," "alchemy," "hard softness") risk thematic echo, and the piece hovers near explicit thesis statement in lines like "This was the translation" and "This was the core." The wisdom feels asserted more than discovered through specific, resistant particulars, though the porcelain box and scars anchor the theme concretely enough to avoid pure abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited; Elias's perceptual signature (firefighter's touch, attention to fractures and scars) is consistent, and the elevated diction ("alchemy," "celestial dance," "syntax of scars") reads as purposeful lyric register. However, the prose uniformly maintains a high literary pitch without modulation under pressure, and several lines ("hard softness," "gently skilled," "slow dance of celestial bodies") echo prompt language directly, suggesting external framing rather than organic voice. No dialogue appears. The narrative distance is appropriate for reflection-led mode, but the vocabulary and cadence feel templated—many lines open with "He" + verb or noun phrase, creating rhythmic monotony that flattens voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Severe template-cadence debt: numerous lines open with "He [verb]" or "The [noun]," and synonym loops recur ("reflecting deeply" appears twice, "gently skilled" twice, "hard softness" twice, "celestial" three times, "innocence" nine times). Paraphrase loops are frequent—paragraphs restate the same insight (innocence transforms, cracks are maps of survival) without added pressure. Abstract diction ("alchemy," "syntax of scars," "universal language") stacks in peak beats, muddling concreteness. Cumulative deductions: template runs −0.6, paraphrase loops −0.4, elevated register drift −0.3, stock metaphor reliance −0.4. The artifacts touch the closure sequence ("scars were not wounds, but words"), triggering the −1.7 artifact-at-closure penalty and disallowing 9+ globally. Information density is low; many sentences restate theme rather than advance situation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The scarred firefighter, cracked porcelain box, and theme of transformed innocence are familiar tropes; the piece does not transform them through non-obvious synthesis or sharp particulars. The child's drawing and Cedar Ridge backstory are mentioned but not developed into unique moral calculus. Emotional terrain (survivor guilt, quest for meaning) follows a predictable arc without risky choices or fresh inflection. The "universal language" framing and scars-as-words metaphor read as generic rather than specific to Elias's lived detail. The lyric mode and elevated register are competently executed but feel derivative—echoing literary convention rather than offering a memorable, singular vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Character present throughout; "scarred forest firefighter" anchors backstory and skill. However, Elias observes and reflects without making a key on-page decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. The walk down the ridge at the end is acceptance, not a causal turn driven by his choice. Cap at 3.8 for swappability (another reflective professional could fill the role) and lack of middle development pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The porcelain box is handled in the opening, traced mid-story ("hairline fractures"), and returns in the final image ("gleaming like starlight"). It charges the closure by symbolizing survival and transformation. Present in setup, middle, and ending; constrains understanding and reweights innocence. Eligible for ≥6.1 under the three-gate model. Specific cracks matter, but the box could be replaced by another fragile keepsake with minor edits, limiting irreplaceability lift.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Bargained innocence" is signaled early (Cedar Ridge, "vow to salvage one pure thing") and revisited throughout; the realization that innocence transforms rather than remains pristine is the conceptual core. However, the concept is explored thematically rather than dramatized through on-page choice or tactical pressure. It shapes reflection but does not narrow options or force a visible trade-off. Present in setup and ending with thematic payoff, meeting two gates; lyric reprise reweights the stake, eligible for ~5.5–6.3 band, but swappable phrasing and summary-only treatment lower the score within that range.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Gently skilled" is mentioned twice (tracing fractures, honoring the box) but functions as label rather than constraint. No on-page moment where gentleness enables or costs; the trait could be omitted without altering causality. Present in middle beat, missing clear setup anchor and closure pressure. Late signal (after 40% mark) and ornamental use cap at 4.6; decorative mention −0.3, label-only −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Enlighten" (enlightenment blooms, sought to enlighten himself) appears mid-story and at closure, framing the realization that innocence evolves. It shapes the ending's conceptual repricing but is presented through reflection rather than a dramatized turn. Present in middle and ending; causal role in the final insight. Two gates met, eligible up to ~6.0; reflective delivery and swappable phrasing (could be "understand," "realize") prevent higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>"Reflecting deeply" is named twice and enacted throughout the descent into memory and the final realization. The method shapes attempts (inviting the past, tracing fractures, questioning the bargain) and delivers closure. Present in setup (signaled by contemplation), middle (active reflection on scars and box), and ending (enlightenment achieved). Three gates met, eligible for ≥6.1; however, the mechanics are largely introspective summary rather than dramatized choice, and the phrasing is label-only in places, limiting causal specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The moonlit ridge path anchors location and atmosphere early and recurs (settling on stone, descending toward valley). It provides scenic frame and symbolic charge (celestial backdrop, descent as purpose) but does not constrain Elias's choices or supply tactical resources. Setup and ending present; missing middle development pressure. Postcard description with thematic resonance; cap for missing middle gate at ~3.4 baseline, lifted slightly by closure participation to 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Slow dance of celestial bodies" (moon's arc, stars tracing paths, moon dips low) provides atmospheric timeframe but does not tighten decisions or track a live clock. Time passes without urgency or tactical consequence. Present in setup and ending as lyric reprise; missing middle pressure. Vague tracking and ornamental use trend low; lyric return reweights mood slightly but does not constrain action. Two gates (weak setup, weak ending), decorative mention −0.3, summary-only −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"To translate pain into a universal language" is named early and drives Elias's quest for meaning; the realization that scars and the box speak this language shapes the ending. Present in setup, middle (motivation stated and pursued), and ending (crystallized and enacted). Three gates met. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choice or visible friction between want and cost. Causal role in closure but swappable phrasing and summary delivery limit score within the 5.0–6.9 band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Hard softness" is named three times (night's "hard softness," Elias's "scarred grace," resolve "forged in fire, tempered by starlight") and frames the juxtaposition of trauma and tenderness. Tone is coherent through reflection and modulates subtly at the ending (acceptance, purpose). Present in setup, middle, and ending; contributes to closure mood. However, the phrasing is repetitive label rather than enacted tonal shift under pressure, and the concept feels abstract rather than charged by action. Three gates met but ornamental execution and swappability cap eligibility; decorative mention −0.3, label-only −0.3.</comment>
