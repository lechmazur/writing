<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her "sacred duty" reads as a declared trait rather than a lived struggle; no moment forces her to choose between competing goods or pay a visible personal cost. The tears at vindication and the final pedestal placement feel performed rather than embodied. Kaelen exists only in reflective summary, never pressuring Elara's present choices with friction or doubt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The closure—revealing the Aethel ritual via projection—lands on the page, but the cost is abstract (vindication "too late for its prophet") rather than a choice that forecloses Elara's options. The drive lens appears causal but the key reversal (shard glowing, truth revealed) occurs through passive observation during the storm rather than protagonist agency. Valerius's immediate capitulation dissolves decades of dispute without friction, undercutting the stakes declared in the setup. The Orientation Test passes (who/where/when by line 2), but the resolution feels gifted rather than earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid and Hall of Echoing Time are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (gilded cherubs, amber chroniton rivers, velvet texture). The mirrors-as-projection-screens device constrains Elara's method and charges the final demonstration. However, much description remains postcard-level (weeping angels, cosmic dust) without altering tactics, and the storm's mechanics are asserted rather than experienced through bodily pressure or spatial consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (vindicating Kaelen's interpretation) is signaled early, but escalation is minimal: Elara enacts Kaelen's mirror-covering method without complication, the shard glows on cue, and Valerius concedes immediately. No on-page reversal narrows her options or forces a trade-off; the temporal storm serves as atmospheric setup rather than a tactical obstacle. The resolution is delivered to her rather than earned through agency under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme (memory, interpretation, redemption) emerges through imagery (shattered vase, covered mirrors, time rivers) and the Aethel ritual reveal. However, the final paragraph explicitly moralizes ("a revolution not of force, but of remembrance") and the shard-on-pedestal tableau feels staged for symbolic effect rather than resonant ambiguity. The "poets of impermanence" framing is asserted in closure rather than discovered through friction, and Valerius's tears arrive without earned complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, but diction fluctuates between character-grounded perception ("cold truth," "burnished sorrow") and elevated thematic commentary ("polished ache of vindication," "sacred duty"). Elara's interior voice lacks distinct idiom; her perceptual signature defaults to ornate descriptors rather than selective bias. Valerius's brief dialogue ("Kaelen saw the soul we were too afraid to acknowledge") reads as thematic summary rather than subtext-driven speech. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the projection beat but loosens into expository reflection at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "baroque asteroid," "labyrinth of gilded cherubs," "slow-drifting amber rivers," "polished ache of vindication," "burnished into reverence" stack figurative language without respite. Paraphrase loops appear ("tears traced warm paths"/"tears glistening"; "time's reflection becomes a liar"/"time-filaments resolved"). Template cadence: "Elara had fulfilled…she reimagined…she placed…" in the final third. Register drifts into abstract philosophizing ("defunct revolutionary," "profound poetic inclination," "cognate streams") that clashes with immediate action. Artifacts touch the closure sequence, triggering the cap and disallowing 9+ globally per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The core premise (archaeological dispute resolved via time-visible chronitons and mirror projection) offers a fresh synthesis, and the Aethel ritual reveal (ceremonial shattering, not violence) subverts the expected "warlike" trope. However, the execution leans on familiar beats: lone disciple vindicates fallen mentor, skeptic weeps and concedes, symbolic object on pedestal. The mirror-covering method and velvet-projection device show ingenuity, but emotional arc and resolution follow a template path without bold risk or transformation that deepens the premise's implications.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Kaelen (defunct revolutionary) appears only in reflective summary and quoted memory. No on-page choice or beat involvement; the character functions as thematic framing rather than active pressure on Elara's present decisions.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The crystal vase shard is handled in setup (Elara holds it), middle (glows during storm), and closure (placed on pedestal). It enables the projection and carries thematic weight (Aethel ritual fragments). However, its mechanics are asserted rather than constrained by cost, and the final pedestal placement feels ornamental rather than causally transformative.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The archaeological dispute frames the dominant stake and is resolved on-page via the projection demonstration. It shapes Elara's motivation and Valerius's opposition. However, the dispute dissolves without friction or tactical cost; no middle beat forces Elara to navigate objections or adapt her argument under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Poetically inclined" is stated twice (Kaelen's "poetic manifestos," "profound poetic inclination") but never constrains an on-page choice or creates visible tradeoff. The attribute exists as label rather than dramatized trait affecting tactics or cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Devise" appears twice: Elara devises her counter-argument (covering mirrors as projection screens) and Kaelen devised the mirror-covering method. The projection device drives the closure demonstration, but the method itself is inherited rather than invented under pressure, and its execution faces no complication that would raise the score into the essential band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Covering mirrors during storms is signaled early (Kaelen's memory/warning), enacted in the middle (Elara covers every mirror), and enables the projection at closure. The method's mechanics matter (velvet texture for display), but no cost or friction accompanies its use; the storm provides atmospheric pressure without tactical obstacle.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid and Hall of Echoing Time anchor the single scene and supply the mirrors and chroniton environment essential to the projection. However, much description remains atmospheric (cherubs, angels, volutes) without constraining Elara's choices. The setting enables rather than pressures; removing "baroque" specifics would not break the plot.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"After time becomes visible" establishes the chroniton-filled setting and the shard's truth-revealing glow. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create a live clock; time's visibility functions as premise rather than escalating constraint. The temporal storm arrives and subsides on schedule without forcing tactical adaptation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To reimagine an entire civilization" is stated as Elara's motivation and drives her projection demonstration. The desire is declared multiple times but rarely conflicted on the page; no moment forces her to weigh this goal against a competing cost or fear. The vindication arrives without visible personal sacrifice or foreclosed option.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>"Burnished sorrow" appears explicitly and the tone (reverent melancholy, "polished ache," "quiet," "sacred light") remains coherent through the demonstration and Valerius's concession. However, the tone is asserted via elevated diction rather than modulated through rhythm or image shifts under pressure, and the final paragraph's string of sorrowful tableaux feels static rather than charged by the closure beat.</comment>
