<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and rooted in a consistent trait (seeking thresholds beyond explanation), and the final renunciation (leaving the compass, refusing a sample) is earned by the psychometry vision. However, the awakening arrives via received wisdom from Thorne rather than her own contradictory struggle; she accepts his epiphany wholesale without visible internal friction. Embodied emotion is present ("tears tracing clean paths") but the interiority leans toward abstract philosophizing ("wonder begins precisely where explanation ends") rather than character-particular sensation. The choice to surrender feels thematically mandated rather than wrested from competing impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors early (who, where, when by paragraph two). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara renounces extraction, aligns the compass as tribute, and internalizes the lagoon's "quiet wisdom," foreclosing her prior mode of collection with felt cost. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered description, the psychometry block reweights the compass, and the final gestures (returning the compass, refusing the sample) constitute a cadence shift that honors the threshold. One persistent constraint—the lagoon's resistance to measurement—shapes the final image. Causality is clean within this lens; no major breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The subterranean lagoon is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail: "obsidian water so perfectly still it seemed to swallow light," "walls curved in gentle, impossible arcs." The setting constrains Elara's final choice—she cannot take a sample because "some truths were too immense for glass vials." The compass's behavior (needle pointing to lagoon's center) and the flowstone walls anchor spatial choreography. Micro-setting (silt, shore, dripping ceiling) charges the psychometry beat and the final tribute gesture. The lagoon functions as both environment and thematic pressure, elevating the score.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the threshold where explanations fail—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs via the psychometry reading: Elara receives Thorne's epiphany, which reweights her quest from seeking a location to accepting internal revelation. The cost is legible: she forgoes her usual practice (scent collection) and leaves empty-handed, foreclosing her role as cataloger. However, escalation is driven more by inherited wisdom than by protagonist agency under pressure; Thorne's vision does the causal work, and Elara's acceptance feels passive. The price (renunciation) is visible but arrives without a prior difficult choice or trade-off that she herself navigates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: wonder begins where measurement ends, and the petrichor collector's life prepares her to honor the ineffable. The compass's "failure" as revelation and the lagoon's refusal of reflection serve as concrete particulars rather than abstractions. The final image—"a compass calibrated not to north, but to grace"—resonates without overt moralizing, and the ending reweights prior material (her scent-collection practice, Thorne's journal) with quiet authority. Minor slip: "wonder begins precisely where explanation ends" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward a theme summary, though it remains tied to the compass image and avoids heavy-handed declaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "the ghost of water meeting ancient stone," "obsidian water," "resonant hush." Distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Diction stays consistent and elevated throughout, matching Elara's contemplative sensibility. Free indirect style is clean in the psychometry passage, where Thorne's panic and realization flood her senses without confusion. Rhythmic variation supports emotional beats (short declaratives at closure: "The delving was complete; the awakening was hers to carry"). No dialogue to evaluate. Minor note: a few filter verbs ("she believed," "she understood") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme. The opening and closing images are strong anchors. However, several paraphrase loops and synonym clusters appear: "resonant hush" recurs four times across the text; "wonder," "awe," and "ineffable" cluster in the final third; "truth" / "truthful" / "truths" appears in tight succession. Template cadence in adjacent lines ("She had studied… She had delved… She would not take… She carried no artifact…") creates a drumbeat in the closing paragraphs. These artifacts do not obscure causality but do reduce propulsion and trigger the patterned-artifact penalty pack (−0.6 to −0.8 in Q7). Clarity remains high; no grammar errors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The petrichor-collector premise and the compass-pointing-inward conceit offer a fresh synthesis, and the subterranean lagoon as unmeasurable sanctuary is vividly particular. The psychometry method and Thorne's journal fragment add texture. However, the emotional arc—seeker finds wisdom through renunciation—follows a familiar template (quest → epiphany → surrender), and the resolution (leaving the compass, refusing the sample) feels anticipated rather than inevitable in hindsight. The "hinged awakening" arrives as received wisdom rather than through a non-obvious character choice or world-logic surprise. Specific details (flowstone, silt, frozen needle) elevate the execution, but the core trajectory does not transform its tropes sufficiently to reach the high band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara (petrichor collector) is present throughout and makes the key closure choices: employing psychometry, leaving the compass, refusing a sample. Setup by paragraph one; middle development via the psychometry reading that changes her understanding; payoff in the final renunciation gestures. Her occupation constrains the ending (she cannot bottle this truth) and drives her motivation. Two distinct beats (psychometry, renunciation) and closure linkage are clear. Specificity is high (scent-collection satchel, petrichor vs. mineral cousin). Cost is visible (empty-handed return). Strong integration; close to essential but the psychometry vision does much of the causal work, slightly reducing her irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The compass appears in beat one (discovery in silt), beat two (psychometry trigger), and beat three (returned as tribute). Setup early; middle development via psychometry that reweights its meaning (not broken, truthful); payoff when Elara aligns it exactly as found, a gesture that charges the closure. The needle's direction (lagoon's center, not north) is a specific, irreplaceable property. Visible cost: she honors it rather than taking it. Causal pressure: the compass's behavior shapes Elara's realization and final renunciation. High integration; nearly indispensable but the psychometry vision mediates its revelatory power, preventing a perfect score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Hinged awakenings frame the story: Thorne's "hinged awakening" is named and dramatized in the psychometry passage, and Elara's own awakening ("the awakening was hers to carry") bookends the closure. Setup via the journal fragment; middle development through the psychometry vision; payoff in Elara's parallel realization. The concept constrains the ending (she must accept, not measure) and provides thematic coherence. However, it functions more as a thematic claim than a concrete stake or tactic; the hinge itself is received wisdom rather than an on-page reversal that Elara navigates. Purposeful early-to-final reprise reweights the stake, reaching mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Sensibly eccentric" is mentioned in paragraph one and echoed in the final third ("Her sensibly eccentric life… had been preparation"). The trait shapes her choice to undertake the delve and frames her scent-collection practice, but no specific on-page action with visible cost is directly enabled or constrained by this attribute during the lagoon scene. It reads as characterization texture rather than a causal lever. Setup present; no middle beat where the trait alters tactics; closure mention is ornamental. Functional but replaceable; ornamental use lowers the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Delve" is signaled in paragraph two, sustained through the descent and exploration, and resolved at closure ("The delving was complete"). Setup early; middle development as Elara moves through the cavern, discovers the compass, and employs psychometry; payoff in the final return to surface. The action frames the narrative arc and provides spatial-temporal coherence. However, "delve" could be replaced with "descend" or "explore" with minor edits; the specificity of "delve" as a term does not uniquely enable a turn or constrain the ending. Two beats (descent, return) and closure linkage earn mid-band, but swappability prevents higher.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Psychometry reading is named in paragraph nine and executed in the following passage (Thorne's panic, his realization flood Elara's senses). Setup at the story's midpoint; middle development as the method delivers the key revelation; payoff when Elara internalizes the epiphany and acts on it (renunciation). The method is irreplaceable: without it, Elara cannot access Thorne's vision. However, it is introduced late (past 40% mark) and serves primarily as a delivery mechanism for inherited wisdom rather than a repeated tactic that Elara navigates under pressure. Late introduction (−0.3) and single-use function limit the score despite strong causal linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The subterranean lagoon is discovered early (paragraph six), anchors the psychometry beat (Elara kneels at the water's edge), and charges the closure (she returns the compass to the silt, refuses to sample the space). Setup by first third; middle development as the lagoon's properties (obsidian stillness, no reflection, impossible arcs) constrain measurement and pressure Elara's choice; payoff when the lagoon's "quiet wisdom" dissolves her need for answers. The setting is irreplaceable: its specific traits (swallowing light, curving impossibly) drive the thematic and causal work. Causal pressure, closure linkage, three beats, and high specificity. Essential.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the factory shuts down" is mentioned in paragraph one and echoed in the final paragraph ("the factory's absence above felt like a gift"). Setup present; the silence enabled by the shutdown allows the fissure's discovery and frames the "resonant hush" motif. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency; no clock or deadline pressures Elara's choices. The factory's absence is atmospheric context rather than a causal constraint. Functional setup and closure reprise earn low-mid band, but lack of tactical pressure prevents higher.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—"to find the place where explanations fail"—is stated in paragraph three, dramatized through her delve and psychometry, and resolved at closure when she internalizes the threshold. Setup early; middle development as she discovers the compass, reads Thorne's quest, and confronts the lagoon's resistance; payoff when she renounces extraction and accepts the ineffable. The motivation drives her journey and shapes the ending choice (leaving the compass, refusing the sample). Cost is visible (empty-handed return). Strong integration; causal pressure and closure linkage are clear. Minor friction: the motivation is articulated more than it is shown in conflicted micro-choices during the lagoon scene.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Resonant hush" is introduced in paragraph two ("the mountain's true voice… a resonant hush"), sustained through the cavern exploration ("profound silence," "silence was not emptiness"), and charges the final image ("the profound hush now nestled within her"). Setup early; middle development as the tone modulates with pressure (Thorne's panic breaks the hush, then his calm restores it); payoff when the hush becomes internalized and contrasted with the factory's absence. The tone is coherent, purposeful, and integral to the thematic work. Recurrence across three beats and closure linkage with specificity. Strong integration; nearly indispensable.</comment>
