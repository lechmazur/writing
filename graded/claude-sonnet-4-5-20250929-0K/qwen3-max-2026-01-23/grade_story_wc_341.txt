<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Aris is established with clear motivation (memorialize Elara) and a consistent method (cloud categorization). Internal contradiction appears ("quietly explosive" claimed but not demonstrated through simultaneous opposing impulses in scene), and the interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("anxiety," "melancholy," "acceptance") rather than embodied perception. The final sob and closure feel earned by prior causality, but the journey is more catalogue than genuine struggle with visible tradeoffs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates cloud observations in a stable pattern, then lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (the fallstreak hole as visible absence) that reweights the dominant stake with felt cost (the cathartic sob, the completed journal). Closure is on the page with emotional cost. Minor deduction: the drift itself is passive situation rather than protagonist-driven causality, and the single-location catalogue structure offers minimal escalation beyond density increase.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sky gondola functions as micro-setting; the brass telescope constrains observation choices and charges the final moment. Cloud types are specific and filter through Aris's professional lens. Spatial choreography is clean (gondola, telescope, journal, sky). The fallstreak hole—a real meteorological phenomenon—provides the geometric absence that validates the method and closes the piece, qualifying for the 9+ gate requirement that setting/object constrain choice or charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove empty spaces remember) is signaled early and pursued through each cloud entry. The accumulative lens allows pressure to build via density and pattern rather than reversals. One meaningful deepening occurs when the fallstreak hole shifts the catalogue from classification to proof, forecloses doubt, and triggers the emotional release. Cost is felt (two years of grief breaking), though the gondola drift itself imposes no material constraint or tactical trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (love persists in absence's architecture) emerges from the cloud catalogue and crystallizes in the fallstreak hole image. The final journal entry offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Weakness: "quietly explosive" and "spooled wholeness" are asserted as concepts rather than enacted through scene pressure, and the piece risks thematic echo when Aris writes the thesis almost verbatim ("The space where you were is shaped exactly like you").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single POV, stable distance, distinct perceptual filter (meteorologist's gaze). The prose carries a consistent lyric texture and professional vocabulary. Minor slips: "dusty starlight" repeated four times without pattern-teaching; "quietly explosive" appears three times as label without embodied demonstration; the final paragraph drifts toward summary ("had proven that love persists") rather than sustaining image. Elara's dialogue feels natural and purposeful in the brief flashback.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "empty spaces remember" / "empty spaces did not forget"; "quietly explosive" appears identically three times; "dusty starlight" recurs four times without reweighting. Template cadence in the catalogue middle ("A fractured altocumulus... A high cirrus... A lenticular cloud...") flattens rhythm. Stock metaphors ("contained lightning," "dark tear"). These artifacts spread across the piece but do not obscure the closure image itself. Deductions: −0.6 for loops, −0.4 for template cadence, −0.3 for stock strings = baseline ~6.4 after accumulation cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The combination (meteorologist + grief memoir + cloud taxonomy by emotion + fallstreak hole as proof) is specific and non-obvious. The fallstreak hole—a real phenomenon—provides earned transformation of the catalogue into closure. Risk: the lyric accumulative structure and the unconventional emotional meteorology heighten stakes. Weakness: the premise echoes familiar "scientist seeks transcendence through their craft" templates, and "dusty starlight" as a tonal anchor feels ornamental rather than integral.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Aviation meteorologist: Setup (paragraph 1), Development (professional lens filters each cloud observation), Payoff (the fallstreak hole is recognized via meteorological knowledge). The occupation enables the categorization method and provides the vocabulary for the final proof. Two gates met (setup, payoff); middle development is functional but the profession could be swapped for another observer role with minor edits. Causal pressure moderate; closure linkage present. Score: 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Brass telescope: Setup (paragraph 3), Development (used to observe lenticular, cirrostratus, anvil clouds), Payoff (set aside after fallstreak observation, "purpose fulfilled"). Appears in multiple beats but does not constrain a choice or impose cost; it is a tool for observation that could be replaced by naked-eye viewing or binoculars. Closure participation is passive (mentioned as set aside). Score: 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Spooled wholeness: Setup (paragraph 8 "This spooled wholeness was Aris's life work"), Development (paragraph 22 "the spooled wholeness almost complete"), Payoff (paragraph 33 "cradled the spooled wholeness"). Label-only; the concept is asserted but does not shape a choice or tactic. The actual work is cloud categorization; "spooled wholeness" is a metaphor for the journal/memorial without mechanical function. Swappable with "tapestry," "archive," or "record." Score: 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Quietly explosive: Setup (paragraph 10 "embodied the quietly explosive"), Development (paragraph 28 "A sob escaped, quietly explosive"), Payoff (paragraph 39 "the quietly explosive peace settling"). Label-only trait; no on-page action demonstrates simultaneous calm and explosion as a tradeoff or constraint. The sob is a conventional emotional release, not a visible paradox. Mentioned three times identically without causal work. Score: 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Memorialize: Setup (paragraph 5 "to memorialize Elara"), Development (each cloud entry is an act of memorializing; paragraph 17 "a deliberate act of memorializing"), Payoff (final journal entry and the entire catalogue structure serve this action). The action is the dominant stake and drives every beat; removing it collapses the story. Major turns trace to this action. Score: 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Categorizing clouds by emotion: Setup (paragraph 6 "categorizing clouds by emotion"), Development (applied in every observation beat from paragraph 7 onward: "anxiety," "melancholy," "acceptance," "grief," "comfort," "hope," "fury tempered by time," "peace"), Payoff (the fallstreak hole completes the method by proving absence holds form). The method is signaled early, mechanics shape every attempt, and the final category ("The space where you were") validates the approach. Score: 7.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Sky gondola: Setup (paragraph 2 "The sky gondola, a wicker cradle suspended in velvet dark, drifted free"), Development (paragraph 21 "This drift was that promise made manifest, the sky gondola a vessel for sacred observation"; paragraph 22 "Turbulence rocked the basket"), Payoff (paragraph 37 "The untethered gondola was not lost but liberated"). Present in setup and payoff; minor pressure (turbulence) but does not alter tactics. Micro-setting that enables observation but could be replaced by balloon, airship, or mountain summit. Score: 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>After the string breaks: Setup (paragraph 1 "felt the tether snap"). The initial break establishes the drift situation. Development and Payoff: the untethered state persists but does not tighten decisions or create a clock. Rescue light appears (paragraph 35 "held no urgency"), explicitly removing time pressure. The timeframe is functional but vague and does not shape tactics. Score: 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>To prove that empty spaces remember: Setup (paragraph 4 "to prove that empty spaces remember"), Development (paragraph 13 "The core concept demanded proof"; each cloud entry is an attempt), Payoff (paragraph 29 "Empty spaces did not forget" and final journal entry provide proof). Desire is dramatized through the catalogue and conflicted by grief; the fallstreak hole delivers the proof with emotional cost (the sob). Friction between intellectual goal and emotional release is visible. Score: 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dusty starlight: Setup (paragraph 26 "framed by dusty starlight"), Development (paragraph 36 "wrapped in the dusty starlight"), Payoff (paragraph 34 "The tone of the night was not desolation, but dusty starlight"; paragraph 38 "under the watchful gaze of dusty starlight"). Tone is named and repeated but does not modulate with pressure; the phrase appears identically across calm and climactic beats. Coherent but static; the final image includes it but does not reweight it. Score: 5.9.</comment>
