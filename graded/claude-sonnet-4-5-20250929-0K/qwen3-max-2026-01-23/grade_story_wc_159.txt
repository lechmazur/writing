<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared early but her interior remains generic and label-driven ("foxglove regret," "profound connection"). The piece tells us she feels devotion and gratitude rather than showing contradictory impulses acting in scene. A single tear and murmured dialogue do not constitute embodied emotion under pressure; the protagonist performs reverence without cost or genuine struggle. The final stance feels stated, not earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who, where, and when anchor by the second paragraph; no penalty. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—dawn triggers the chime, orchids capture names—but no meaningful tightening occurs; the ritual completes exactly as planned with no reversal, complication, or visible cost. Closure lacks a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration; the protagonist simply continues her routine tomorrow. The ending offers theme assertion ("remembrance...is the highest form of love") rather than an on-page cost or reweighted image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The opal library and cracked bamboo tube supply vivid, purposeful detail that charges multiple beats and the final image. Spatial choreography is clear—atrium, oculus, concentric spirals—and the crack constrains method. Minor deduction: the "museum of extinct feelings" frame remains decorative; it does not limit access or alter a choice on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve forgotten names) is signaled early, but no opposition or complication tests it. The ritual proceeds without friction: light falls, song emerges, orchids capture echoes, cataloging awaits. The crack is framed as "destiny," not a problem to solve, so its presence adds texture but no escalation. No on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; coincidence (dawn's arrival) enables rather than complicates, violating the lens rule.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from images (crack, foxglove regret, light) rather than direct statement until the penultimate paragraph, which slides into thesis ("remembrance...is the highest form of love"). The cracked tube as resilience-symbol is coherent, but the final lines moralize instead of letting the image resonate. No earned insight arises from specific struggle; Elara already understands everything at the outset.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout—"spire of solidified mist," "pearlescent walls veined with shifting colors"—creating a consistent textural voice. Deduction: register drift into thesis language in the final two paragraphs ("enduring truth," "sacred duty") clashes with the established sensory idiom and reads as authorial summary rather than character perception. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Template cadence pervades: "Moving with...," "Closing her eyes...," "She would spend...," "Tomorrow, the light would..."; identical stems stack across beats. Paraphrase loops appear ("deserted marvel" recurs three times as noun phrase without evolving meaning; "gently systematic" echoes twice). Heavy figurative density in non-peak beats ("bittersweet ache where beauty and sorrow are inseparable") without pattern-teaching. Line artifacts and scaffold trigger −1.2 total in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per artifact cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The glass-orchid sound-capture premise offers a fresh synthesis of synesthesia and ritual. Deduction: "museum of extinct feelings" and "foxglove regret" read as invented prompt labels rather than lived-in world details, and the piece does not transform them beyond their surface. The crack-as-destiny frame avoids risk; no bold structural or perspectival choice heightens stakes. Median originality within a lyric register.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara appears in setup and ending; her choices (adjust lens, hum lullaby, guide echoes) enact the ritual but do not create turns or alter tactics. She observes and facilitates; no decision changes options or forecloses a path with cost. Mid-low functional presence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cracked bamboo tube: present in setup ("decades ago"), middle (light falls upon it, splits vibration), and ending (fingertip trace, gratitude). The crack's mechanics matter—filters the song to capture authentic regret—and it charges the final gesture. Swappability: another damaged instrument could serve similarly. Strong integration but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Deserted marvels" appear in the opening paragraph, recur as a theme claim in the final third, and name the Hall of Faded Joys flashback. The concept does not constrain choices or alter tactics on the page; it functions as atmospheric labeling. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Gently systematic" is declared twice (opening, near end) and shown in Elara's checking orchids and arranging spirals. It describes her manner but does not create a visible tradeoff or limit a choice under pressure. Functional but replaceable descriptor.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Light: setup (awaits dawn), middle (adjusts lens, beam falls on tube, awakens song), ending (sun climbs, song fades). Light is the trigger and timer; removing it breaks the ritual's logic. Two distinct beats plus closure participation. Strong causal role, though the action itself is passive reception rather than protagonist-driven agency.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Echo of a long-forgotten song" frames the method in setup, is enacted mid-scene (Elara hums the lullaby, echoes coalesce), and appears in the final third as "echo shaped by a crack." The method is signaled and its mechanics matter (crack splits vibration). Lyric reprise reweights meaning. Solid integration, one beat short of essential.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Opal library: vivid in setup, houses the atrium/oculus/orchids, and glows in the ending. It provides the stage and tools (lens, chime) but does not pressure choices or supply a resource that alters outcome. Micro-setting (body, tool) is stronger than the floating library itself. Mid-band setting work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Across the museum of extinct feelings" appears in the opening and a brief Hall of Faded Joys flashback. Time is vague ("decades ago," "today," "tomorrow") and does not tighten decisions. The timeframe labels a thematic space rather than creating urgency. Present as decoration, minimal causal role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Preserve the sound of forgotten names" is stated in setup, enacted across the ritual (orchids capture names), and recurs in the ending's purpose claim. The motivation is told and illustrated but not dramatized through friction or competing wants. Lyric reprise reweights the stake at closure. Solid thematic integration, lacks visible cost in choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>"Foxglove regret" is named in setup, tied to the crack's function mid-scene, and echoed in the final paragraph ("honoring its foxglove truth"). Tone remains static—solemn reverence throughout—without modulation under pressure. The invented compound feels ornamental; removing it would not alter mood or stakes. Functional label, mid-band.</comment>
