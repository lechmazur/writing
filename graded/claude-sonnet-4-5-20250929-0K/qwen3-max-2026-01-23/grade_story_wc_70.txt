<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's involuntary truthfulness is asserted but never tested on the page—no moment shows him compelled to speak truth at personal cost. His "crusade to preserve wonder" motivates the riddle method, but the choice to share versus withhold never creates visible friction. Dr. Aris functions as receiver, not pressuring force. The closure—Kael's satisfaction—rests on declaration rather than dramatized contradiction or embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (riddle-reveal structure builds through nectar-dusk imagery and the lacquer-box nested objects). Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the blackout reweights from "software fault" to "beauty-blinded sensors," framed through the riddle's answer. However, cost is asserted ("renewed purpose," "changed heart") rather than shown in a forfeited option or visible trade-off. Orientation anchors early (tower, Kael, blackout timeframe). The nested-box sequence provides cadence, but the turn—Dr. Aris's epiphany—arrives via explanation, not a choice that narrows Kael's path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tower's obsidian lens and nectar-dusk refraction directly cause the drone failure, constraining the diagnostic mystery. Lacquer box and matchbox provide tactile anchors across beats. Spatial choreography (window, desk, door, stairs) remains clear. The nectar dusk charges both the inciting imagery and the riddle's answer ("golden tear"), satisfying the micro-setting test for choice constraint and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: reveal the blackout cause while honoring wonder over data. The tightening occurs when Dr. Aris arrives desperate for answers, but Kael's choice to use the riddle versus a direct log entry is pre-decided—no on-page deliberation or friction tests commitment. The riddle's unfolding provides texture, yet the escalation is cognitive (puzzle-solving) rather than a narrowing of Kael's options with visible cost. Earned under the Accumulative lens but lacks a felt price at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—technology humbled by natural beauty—emerges organically from the nectar-dusk failure and the riddle's answer. The matchbox-within-box structure enacts "truth wrapped in poetry." Dr. Aris's shift from urgency to awe dramatizes the conceptual repricing without overt moralizing. The final image ("involuntary truth of his satisfaction") gestures at the theme but borders on labeled emotion rather than a charged particular.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited on Kael. Perceptual signature (nectar dusk, obsidian lens, cathedral metaphors) is consistent and character-specific. Dialogue pursues goals cleanly, though Dr. Aris's lines lean expository ("Why did the drone beehive fail?"). Kael's diction ("candid nature forbidding evasion") occasionally tilts abstract. The riddle text itself—voiced as grandfather's—provides a distinct register shift that enriches rather than muddies focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Overwriting in the opening: "nectar dusk, a rare alchemy of sunset and storm-cleared air, draped the lightning collection tower in liquid gold and deep violet shadows, gilding the silent spires where the drone beehive's hum should have resonated" stacks ornament without advancing pressure (−0.4). Paraphrase loops: "preserve wonder within routine, ensuring the tower remained a cathedral of sky and science, not mere infrastructure" rephrases motivation just stated (−0.2). Cumulative word-count annotations are scaffolding tokens, ignored per rubric. Propulsion is steady in the riddle sequence; clarity holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Core synthesis—drones misread sunset refraction as lightning—is conceptually fresh and earned by the tower's obsidian lens. The nested riddle method offers a graceful frame. However, the emotional arc (keeper reveals obscure cause to grateful engineer) follows a well-worn template: the wise custodian educates the technical expert. Transformation of that template is partial; the grandfather's riddle adds texture but does not fundamentally alter the arc's predictability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael appears in all major beats (window vigil, lacquer-box presentation, final reflection). His choice to use the riddle method rather than a data log is stated as motivation but not dramatized as a live decision under competing pressure. "Candid" (involuntarily truthful) does not constrain an on-page choice. Present throughout, but agency is limited to staging the reveal rather than navigating a fork with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lacquer box introduced early (scarred oak desk), handled by Dr. Aris mid-scene (she lifts the lid), and its nested structure (matchbox within) enacts the "truth wrapped in poetry" method. Charged reprise: Aris descends with the box, carrying the philosophy forward. Causal role in two beats (presentation, Aris's epiphany). Irreplaceability: the nested form matters to the thematic frame.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drone beehive failure is the inciting mystery, the diagnostic puzzle's core, and the riddle's answer ("thousand eager eyes... flee the sun's single golden tear"). The concept shapes stakes (city-wide blackout), tactics (Kael's riddle versus log), and the final repricing (sensors blinded by beauty). Removal would collapse plot and theme. Early signal, causal pressure, closure linkage all satisfied.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Involuntarily truthful" is asserted twice ("candid nature," "condition woven into his bones") but never constrains an on-page choice. Kael speaks truth freely to Dr. Aris; no moment shows him compelled against preference or cost. Label-only trait without dramatized friction (−0.6 for ornamental use, −0.3 for label pattern). Present in setup but absent from middle development and closure action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Reveal" drives the scene structure: Dr. Aris pleads, Kael gestures to the box, the riddle unfolds, epiphany lands. The action shapes two beats (the offering, the reading) and participates in closure (Aris departs with new philosophy). However, the reveal is pre-decided—no on-page pivot where Kael chooses to reveal versus withhold under competing cost. Functional, beats the two-gate threshold, but lacks the forked-path irreplaceability for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Matchbox-within-lacquer-box and the riddle text are introduced early (desk scene), handled mid-scene (Aris extracts and reads), and deliver the closure mechanism (the riddle's answer reframes the failure). The nested method enacts Kael's "truth wrapped in poetry" motivation. Two-beat involvement, closure linkage present. Swappability check: a different puzzle form could serve similar function, but the nested matchbox's intimacy and heirloom frame tighten thematic fit.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Lightning collection tower is the spatial anchor and causal engine: the obsidian lens refracts nectar dusk, causing the drone swarm collapse. Setting introduced in line one, shapes the inciting failure, and charges the final image ("silent spires," "renewed purpose" in the vigil). Micro-setting (tower window, scarred desk) grounds all major beats. Setting drives plot and theme; removal breaks causality and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"After the city-wide blackout" anchors the inciting situation and creates diagnostic urgency. "Three nights prior" specifies the failure's onset. However, no live clock tightens tactics within the reveal scene itself—elapsed time does not narrow options or escalate stakes. Timeframe provides context (setup gate) but does not constrain middle choices or shape closure pressure. Functional background element.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Preserve wonder within routine" is stated as Kael's motivation and drives his choice to use the riddle method over clinical data. The desire appears in setup ("quiet crusade") and is paid off thematically when Dr. Aris adopts the philosophy ("redesign with respect"). Friction is limited: no on-page moment where wonder conflicts with duty or cost. Motivation shapes method but lacks visible trade-off at closure. Two-beat involvement, closure linkage via Aris's restatement.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Nectar dusk opens the story ("rare alchemy of sunset and storm-cleared air"), causes the sensor failure (amber wavelength floods blue-white-calibrated drones), anchors the riddle's answer ("golden tear"), and bookends at closure ("nectar dusk had passed, but its lesson lived on"). Tone modulates from elegiac opening to investigative middle to reverential close. The image charges both causality and thematic repricing. Indispensable to logic and resonance.</comment>
