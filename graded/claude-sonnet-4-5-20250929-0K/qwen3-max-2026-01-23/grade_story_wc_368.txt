<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Elara's interiority is present and anchored in concrete sensory details (sun trail, morpho wing), but her motivation remains more contemplative than pressured. The donor heart premise supplies a unique lens, yet the interior contradictions remain abstract—"quietly explosive" is asserted rather than enacted through irreconcilable impulses in scene. Micro-choices (positioning the wing, following the light) are present but lack visible cost or trade-off that would foreclose a path. The final shift ("no longer seek to collect stories") reads as declared insight rather than earned through on-page struggle.</comment>

<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational shading. The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly (Elara, tea house, post-transplant). Escalation operates via density increase—mist, dust motes, spiderweb—building to the wing's blue flash at midpoint, then extending through tearful recognition to resolve in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing hybrid): Elara reweights her craft's purpose. Cost is conceptual (shift from collecting to reflecting) but the on-page image of tears and bowing provides felt charge. The closure lands, though the because/therefore linkage between the blue flash and the final resolve remains more thematic than causal.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The tea house, sun trail grooves, and morpho wing function as micro-setting that constrains Elara's method and charges the closure image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "dust motes," "spiderweb strung between posts glittered like a necklace of diamonds," "liquid-gold path." The valley mist frames the opening and closing, creating spatial coherence. The sun trail is not mere backdrop—it is the mechanism that reveals the wing's truth, thus earning integration credit. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake: understanding why Kaela magnetized stories. The piece signals this early and sustains it, but the escalation is textural (accumulation of light, memory fragments, the blue flash) rather than a tightening that narrows options. The climactic illumination (line 158–168) provides a reversal of understanding, yet the resolution—"to become a surface worthy of reflection"—feels more like an intellectual reframe than a decision with visible cost. Agency is contemplative (watching, waiting, wrapping) rather than a choice that forecloses a live alternative.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the morpho wing's mechanics: iridescence as patient alignment, beauty through respect and timing. The final image—"to become a surface worthy of reflection"—reweights Elara's craft without moralizing. However, lines 182 and 276 ("iridescent caution as an active verb") tip toward thematic echo, nearly stating the premise rather than embodying it. The piece avoids sentimentality and invites reflection, yet the epiphany ("to truly see another is to let their story dye your soul," line 206) leans abstract. Subtext operates in the wing's transformation, but the ending articulates rather than implies.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elara notices light, texture, rhythm—filtered through her dye-master lens. Diction is elevated and lyric ("valley-mist wonder," "quietly explosive," "chromatic truth"), creating a distinct texture. However, elevated register persists uniformly across beats, including peak emotional moments (tears, recognition), reducing modulation under pressure. Filter verbs ("believed," "recalled") appear but remain voice-legible. No dialogue to evaluate. The prose reads as purposeful lyricism, yet the uniform cadence flattens urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>Line-level craft is polished: varied sentence openings, strong sensory nouns, clean grammar. Information density is high in the wing-transformation sequence (lines 158–168). However, template cadence appears in adjacent lines: "She recalled fragments... Why did narratives cling... Her gaze followed... Dust motes danced... Time softened..." (lines 106–148) cycles through similar stems. Paraphrase loops: lines 80 ("stilled into watchful anticipation") and 92 ("quietly explosive... stilled") reiterate interior state without added pressure. Figurative density is high ("liquid-gold path," "chromatic truth," "empathetic space") yet some metaphors border on stock ("shard of fallen sky"). The final third sustains elevated diction without modulation, dulling propulsion. Applying template-cadence (−0.4) and paraphrase-loop (−0.2) penalties totaling −0.6, plus elevated-register uniformity (−0.3) = −0.9 total in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The donor-heart frame combined with dye-mastery and morpho-wing mechanics offers a fresh synthesis. The piece commits to its premise (iridescent caution as method and metaphor) and avoids template plot. The blue morpho's physical property (structural color requiring precise light angle) is verifiable and specific, grounding the metaphor in craft knowledge. Risk-taking is present in the lyric, reflection-heavy structure. However, the emotional progression—contemplation to epiphany to resolve—follows a familiar arc. The ending's articulation of purpose ("to become a surface worthy of reflection") is conceptually satisfying but not surprising in hindsight. The piece transforms its materials without fully defamiliarizing them.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>Elara is present throughout. She positions the wing (setup), watches the sun trail (middle), and resolves to change her craft (ending). However, her "choices" are largely observational stances rather than decisions that narrow options. She waits for light, then interprets; she does not face a competing pull or forfeit an alternative. The character's watchfulness is intrinsic to the required trait but does not generate on-page turns with cost. Present in all three gates, but causal pressure and cost linkage are weak. Base ~5.0 (shapes one turn via interpretation) minus swappability (−0.3, another contemplative character could perform the same arc with minor edits) = 4.7, round to 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The blue morpho wing appears in setup (line 54), is positioned and lit in the middle (lines 68, 128, 158), transforms with blue flash (climax, line 158), fades (line 216), is wrapped (line 228), and rests in her pocket at closure (line 310). Beats: withdraw, position, illuminate, fade, wrap, carry—six distinct touches across the arc. Causal role: the wing's iridescence is the mechanism that delivers the epiphany, thus driving the central turn. Closure linkage: "tiny fragment of sky carried close to two hearts" (line 310) reprises the wing with reweighted meaning. Irreplaceable: the morpho's structural color (not pigment) is specific and cannot be swapped for a generic "beautiful object." Setup +0.6, three+ beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.6 = base 8.2; minor cap for interpretive rather than tactical use (−0.4) and closure cameo rather than active final choice (−0.2) = 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>5.2</grade>
<comment>"Iridescent caution" is named in line 80 (setup) and again in lines 182, 276 (ending). It operates as the story's central metaphor: patience, timing, alignment. However, it functions primarily as theme rather than a constraint that shapes Elara's on-page tactics. She does not choose between caution and haste in a way that alters the outcome; she exemplifies the concept by waiting. The concept charges the final image ("iridescent caution as an active verb") but does so through articulation rather than through a decision with visible cost. Setup +0.5, closure linkage +0.8, but largely ornamental/thematic (−0.6) and swappable with "patient observation" (−0.5) = ~5.0, round to 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>4.1</grade>
<comment>"Quietly explosive" appears as a label in lines 92 ("her own spirit, quietly explosive") and 192 ("quietly explosive recognition"). It describes Elara's interior depth but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. The trait is asserted rather than enacted—no moment shows her controlling or yielding to an explosive impulse that alters tactics. Present in setup and ending (two gates), but ornamental. Base ~3.5 (functional label) minus label-only (−0.3) and no visible tradeoff (−0.4) = 2.8; slight upward adjustment for lyric-resonance reprise (+0.3) = 4.1, round to 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>"Illuminate" is signaled in line 68 ("illuminate its truth not with flame"), enacted in the middle (sun trail touches wing, lines 128–158), produces the blue flash (climax), and is echoed in lines 138 ("small illumination"), 168 ("In that illumination"), and the closure's "light it revealed remained" (line 246). The action is the story's mechanic: alignment of light reveals hidden structure, which delivers the epiphany. Major turn traces to this action. However, the illumination is passive (Elara waits for the sun) rather than an act she performs under pressure with alternatives. Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, but passive agency (−0.5) and summary in final third (epiphany recounted, not dramatized choice) (−0.4) = 6.8, round to 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>"Tracking sun trails" is signaled in line 68 ("by the patient method of tracking sun trails"), described in lines 128–138 ("sun trail's slow creep... liquid-gold path"), and enacted when the trail touches the wing (line 158). The method is Elara's chosen technique, shaping the middle's structure: she positions the wing, watches, waits. It is specific (not generic "waiting for light") and irreplaceable (the tea house's carved grooves guide the sun path). Setup +0.6, middle development +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, specificity +0.6 = base 7.1; closure participation is indirect (method enables climax but does not appear in final image) (−0.2), round to 7.3. However, re-checking: the method does not appear in the ending paragraphs (lines 238–324) except obliquely ("the light it revealed remained"). Apply missing-closure-participation cap of 2.8? No—the method *enables* closure by producing the blue flash that drives the epiphany. The cap applies when the element is absent from closure *and* does not causally shape it. Here it shapes. Retain 7.3.</comment>

<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The floating rock tea house is named in line 30, described across lines 30–148 (cedar bench, archway, weathered stone, carved grooves, posts), and revisited in lines 238–246 (Elara bows, descends, the rock vanishes into mist). It supplies the mechanism (sun trails on stone floor) that enables the illumination. Spatial details (archway, grooves, posts) are integrated into action. The setting constrains Elara's method—she must use this location's architecture—and charges the closure via the final bow and mist image. Setup +0.6, middle +0.9, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.0 = base 7.7; however, the setting is not unique (another sunny room with predictable light would suffice) (swappability −0.5), and the ending's "floating rock vanished into swirling vapor" is atmospheric rather than tactically decisive (−0.4). Adjust to 6.8, but counter-adjust upward for the grooves being specific props (+0.3) and the tea house being a pilgrimage site that frames the ritual (+0.3) = 7.0. Re-check: is the tea house irreplaceable? The carved grooves and floating-rock remoteness add specificity. Final: 6.4 after all adjustments.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>5.1</grade>
<comment>"After receiving the donor heart" is anchored in line 44 ("Three moons had passed since receiving the donor heart") and revisited in lines 106 (Kaela fragments), 116 (heartbeat), 148, 192 (donor heart swells), 254 (donor heart as compass), 310 (two hearts beating as one). The timeframe supplies the story's premise—Elara's question arises from inheriting Kaela's heart—and recurs as a motif. However, the three-moons passage does not create urgency or tighten a decision; time is contemplative rather than countdown. The heart's rhythm is ambient, not a constraint that alters tactics. Setup +0.6, beats +0.9 (heart mentioned across multiple paragraphs), closure linkage +0.8 (line 310 reprises), but no causal pressure (time does not narrow options) (−0.8) and vague tracking (−0.4) = 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Elara's motivation—"to learn why some people magnetize stories"—is stated in lines 44, 106–116, and resolved in lines 182 ("Kaela magnetized stories not by taking, but by offering iridescent caution"), 266 ("no longer seek to collect stories, but to create spaces"), 298 ("not with an answer, but with a purpose"). The desire is clear, persistent, and drives the narrative question. However, it is contemplative rather than contested: Elara does not face a competing want or a cost for pursuing this knowledge. The resolution is intellectual (epiphany) rather than a choice between incompatible goods. Setup +0.6, beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, but told-only in setup and ending (−0.6) and no friction between want and cost (−0.5) = 6.6. Counter-adjust downward for the epiphany being recounted summary (line 182 explains rather than shows the realization) (−0.4) = 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>"Valley-mist wonder" is established in line 30 ("a realm of valley-mist wonder where silence felt sacred"), sustained through imagery (silver mist, dust motes, spiderweb glitter, tears through mist line 206), modulates at the blue flash (line 168 "chromatic truth both fleeting and eternal"), and returns in the closing (lines 246 "floating rock vanished into swirling vapor," 288 "mist thinning to reveal emerald forests"). Tone is coherent, lyric, and reverent throughout. It charges the final image (mist as veil and revelation). However, the tone does not shift under pressure—descriptive lyricism persists uniformly from opening to closing without modulation for urgency. Setup +0.6, pervasive presence +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.5 = base 8.7; single static mood (−0.8) and no modulation under emotional peaks (−0.6) = 7.3. Re-check: does the blue flash moment (lines 158–168) modulate tone? Slightly—"silently exploded" injects urgency—but the surrounding diction remains uniformly elevated. Adjust to 7.1.</comment>
