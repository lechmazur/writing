<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent—uncovering suppressed history—but his interior life reads abstract rather than embodied. The retrocognitive experience offers vivid action, yet his emotional processing ("tears streamed," "profound relief") leans on summary labels rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to write is declared rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure, and the "archival certainty" arrives without visible struggle or trade-off that would earn the shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story establishes who, where, and when early (zeppelin library, Elias, post-discovery). The retrocognitive vision provides a clear tightening—Elias corrects Anya's directional error—but the closure unit lacks visible cost on the page; Elias returns to his chair with "profound relief" and begins writing, a fulfillment rather than a foreclosure. The official record is revealed as a lie, yet no on-page decision alters Elias's options or forecloses a path. The lens reads Causal through the vision sequence, but the ending delivers Conceptual Repricing without undeniable cost, landing as resolution rather than reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The zeppelin library is vividly anchored (oak panels, engine hum, "floating sanctuary") and the obsidian lagoon is rendered with strong sensory detail (salt, fear, starlit surface). The beach debris—stones, conch, driftwood—constrains Elias's ghostly intervention and shapes the pivotal correction. Spatial choreography in the vision (dune, waterline, ridge) remains clear. The setting charges the final image of truth "no longer trapped in sand or memory," meeting the 9+ gate for constraint and closure participation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—correcting historical suppression—is signaled early and drives the retrocognitive vision. The tightening occurs when Elias rearranges the stones to redirect Anya, narrowing her options and enabling escape. Yet the escalation is spectral; Elias faces no on-page trade-off or price for his intervention, and the resolution (Anya escapes, official record is false) arrives as discovery rather than choice under duress. The vision provides one meaningful reversal, but cost legibility is missing at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: truth versus suppression, memory as redemption, the archivist's reverence for recovered voices. The obsidian lagoon and beach-debris messages function as motifs that constrain choice and recur with reweighted meaning ("truth drinks the moon" → "no longer trapped"). The piece avoids overt moralizing and the ending image—writing to "shape the future"—resonates without thesis statement. Subtext operates in gesture (Anya's nod, Elias's trembling focus) and the encrypted diary's layered meanings.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third with a consistent archival register ("ink stains of forgotten truths," "meticulous care"). Perceptual signature is present but leans elevated throughout, even under stress ("searing reverie," "archival certainty"). Diction occasionally drifts into glossy abstraction ("vessel for redemption," "absolution") that feels voice-polished rather than character-lived. Psychic distance is controlled, and the retrocognitive trap motivates the shift to Anya's viewpoint without head-hopping, though Elias's internal texture under peak pressure remains abstract rather than sensorily compressed.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but the prose carries overwriting in peak beats: "searing reverie," "violent immersion," "profound relief," "archival certainty"—elevated diction that stacks rather than sharpens. The opening and vision sequences are vivid, yet scaffolding appears in phrases like "the core concept of the discovery was no mere academic exercise" and "this was the tension he sought to resolve," which announce rather than dramatize. No loops or major artifacts obscure causality, but figurative density in high-pressure moments ("swallow the starlight," "wave of profound relief") tilts toward glossy metaphor without pattern-teaching or payoff. The closure beat is clean of major slips.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The retrocognitive-trap mechanic and the zeppelin archive offer fresh angles on historical-recovery material, and the beach-debris cipher is specific and well-integrated. However, the core arc—archivist uncovers suppressed truth and corrects the record—follows a familiar template without a non-obvious moral calculus or lived friction that transforms it. Emotional truth is present but the ending's "vessel for redemption" rhetoric leans toward stock resolution. The synthesis is competent and the vision sequence memorable, yet the premise does not surprise in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias frames the story and his motivation drives the retrocognitive dive, but his key action—rearranging the stones—occurs within the vision, not as a present-scene choice under live pressure. He observes, decrypts, experiences, and writes, but the pivotal turn is channeled through Anya's past rather than his own on-page decision with cost. Present in setup, middle reflection, and ending write-up, yet the climactic agency is ghostly and consequence-free for him.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon appears early in the decrypted phrase, anchors the retrocognitive vision as the literal setting where Elias intervenes, and returns in the final image ("truth of the obsidian lagoon no longer trapped"). It constrains the vision's geography and charges the closure by naming the site of recovered truth. Three beats (diary phrase, vision scene, ending reflection) with clear causal and thematic weight.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The encrypted diary frames the entire premise: Elias spends three nights decrypting it, its final phrase triggers the retrocognitive trap, and its fragmented entries guide his correction of Anya's arrow. The diary's contents shape stakes (suppressed history) and tactics (cross-referencing to identify the fatal error). Present in setup, driving the middle vision, and named at closure as the artifact now "broken...by lived truth."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The retrocognitive trap is signaled early ("a searing reverie seized him"), enables the entire middle vision sequence where Elias is "a conscious prisoner within Anya's final hours," and constrains his intervention to symbolic stone-moving rather than direct contact. It governs the method and stakes of the correction. Cost is implicit (the agony of immersion) but not foregrounded as a trade-off that alters his later options.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The parley occurs when Elias rearranges the stones "not with voices, but with symbols" and Anya nods acknowledgment. This silent negotiation across time drives the vision's climax and enables her escape. However, it is brief and the mechanics are spectral rather than contested; removing "parley" and calling it "intervention" would not break the structure. Present and functional, but not load-bearing across multiple beats.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Beach-debris messaging is described in the diary, demonstrated by Anya in the vision (driftwood, shells, sea glass spelling "PATROL APPROACHES"), and becomes the method Elias uses to intervene by moving basalt stones and adding the conch-moon symbol. The method constrains his ghostly agency and shapes the pivotal correction. Signaled early, active in the climax, and essential to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The zeppelin library provides vivid initial atmosphere (oak panels, engine hum, "floating sanctuary") and bookends the vision by anchoring Elias's return. However, it does not constrain his choices or supply resources that affect the outcome; the vision and correction occur in the past, and the library functions as backdrop rather than pressure. Postcard-level description that sets tone but does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the letters are found" is implicit—Elias has already decrypted the diary over three nights and the vision occurs in the present narrative moment. However, time does not tighten decisions; the vision is a fixed window into Anya's past, and Elias faces no clock pressure in his decision to write afterward. Present as context, but not a live constraint on tactics or escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elias's motivation—"to uncover truth in tension, to mend the tear in history's fabric"—is stated explicitly and drives his three-night decryption and retrocognitive immersion. The tension between documented tragedy and hidden victory shapes his goal. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized in conflicted on-page choices; he pursues it without visible friction or cost that forces him to weigh competing desires. Present throughout, functional, but not deeply contested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tone of "searing reverie" is taught early ("a searing reverie seized him—not a memory of his own, but a violent immersion") and sustained through the vision with visceral language (gritty chill, salt and fear, desperate grace). It modulates from solemn archive work to immersive intensity and back to quiet resolution. The tone charges the final image of tears and writing, and the "agony and absolution" phrase anchors the reverie's cost. Coherent and purposeful across turns.</comment>
