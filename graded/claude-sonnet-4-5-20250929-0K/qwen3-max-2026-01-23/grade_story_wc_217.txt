<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clearly established, but her agency is minimal—she observes, walks, picks up a feather, and writes. The dominant action is contemplation rather than decision under pressure. The transformation from witnessing a snapped kite string to writing verse feels more like an aesthetic exercise than a choice with foreclosed paths or visible cost. Interiority relies heavily on abstract concepts ("warmly attentive stillness," "reverent care") rather than embodied contradiction or struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when early enough (poet at lagoon cove, post-rain twilight). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the kite's fall seeds the feather discovery, which charges the writing act. However, the closure—Elara writing and leaving the kite for the tide—lacks a legible cost or a before/after shift in her options or stance; she intended to write "Woven Dawns" and does so, with the feather as a convenient new quill rather than a constraint that narrows or reweights her method. The Orientation Test penalty is waived (anchors arrive promptly), but Cost proof test fails: no exact line shows a foreclosed path or felt price at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered ("liquid obsidian," "drake's tail feather...vanes shifting from lagoon-cobalt to ember-copper"). The lagoon, dunes, and tide are present throughout and lend atmosphere. The feather functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image, lifting the score above postcard description. Spatial choreography is clean (bench, dunes, far shore, sea oats, return to bench).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering beauty in the incomplete—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or cost. The kite's fall is an external event Elara passively witnesses; her response (walk, find feather, write) unfolds without friction, trade-off, or tightening. No reversal or deepening alters her options; the feather arrives as a gift rather than a constraint. The escalation guardrail for Accumulative/Textural requires density increase or pattern break that reweights the stake with cost; here the found feather simply enables the predetermined act of writing with no visible price or foreclosed alternative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—beauty in brokenness, harmonizing discord—emerges from concrete images (snapped string, crumpled kite, storm-forged feather) rather than direct statement until the closing paragraph's mild moralizing ("resilient art of weaving gold through breaks"). The feather's iridescence and the line "The string surrenders...to teach the kite the wind's true name" offer non-literal answers. However, the final paragraph edge toward thesis ("true beauty resided not in flawless sunrises") and the protagonist's internal arc lacks complication—she arrives with her method intact and executes it without friction, so thematic resonance feels illustrative rather than earned through struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, consistent, and distinct ("burnished hush," "sleeping birds," "raw poetry stirred"). POV remains stable third-limited throughout with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present: Elara notices ripples, cloud-shapes, the feather's barb alignment. However, the prose leans heavily on elevated diction and metaphor even in peak beats (kite fall, feather discovery), creating a static lyric register that does not modulate with urgency. Free indirect style is clean; no dialogue appears.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clarity and grammar are sound. However, overwriting is pervasive: nearly every sentence in high-pressure beats (kite fall, feather handling, writing) carries figurative language ("sharp *twang* shattered," "feather...humming with wild sky-memory," "anointed it her quill," "words flowed"). Density penalty applies (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: the concept of harmonizing discord is restated across multiple paragraphs without added pressure ("harmonizing its discord into verse," "let it deepen the dawn she crafted"). Template cadence in the closing section ("She had not erased...she had listened," "walking home, her warmly attentive spirit felt") adds −0.4. Stock metaphors ("thread by fragile thread," "weaving gold through breaks") in the final third add −0.3. Total artifact deductions: approximately −1.2, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The core premise—poet finds symbolic object and writes verse—is a widely used writing template. The drake's tail feather as myth-relic adds genre color but does not transform the underlying convenience: the object arrives exactly when needed to supply a quill and thematic metaphor without complication. Emotional arc is linear (Elara begins attuned to incomplete beauty and ends reaffirmed in that stance with no friction). The kite/feather pairing is symbolically tidy rather than surprising. Derivative Premise Guardrail triggers −0.8; the story does not offer a non-obvious synthesis or bold risk that heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout (setup ✓), walks to find the feather (development, minimal choice), and writes in the ending (payoff ✓). Two gates met, eligible up to ~6.0. However, her choices are passive observation and execution of a pre-existing method with no constraint or cost. The feather enables rather than complicates her goal. Swappability is high: another contemplative artist would function identically. Early signal +0.3, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, but ornamental use −0.8 and swappability −0.8 bring the score to mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The drake's tail feather appears in three beats: discovery at the dunes (setup past first third, −0.3), handling and description mid-story (development), and use as quill in the ending (payoff ✓). Three gates met. Beat involvement (three beats) +1.4, closure linkage +0.9, specificity (vanes shift color, holds lightning's echo) +0.5. Late first appearance −0.3. However, the feather resolves a problem it did not help create (provides a quill and thematic symbol without prior friction), triggering the cap at 3.0 floor guidance; the strong closure linkage and irreplaceability lift it into the 6.0–6.3 zone via lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Woven dawns" is named in the opening (setup ✓), referenced in the journal title, and restated in the closing moral. However, it functions as a thematic label rather than a stake or tactic that shapes on-page choices. Elara's method (harmonizing discord) remains unchanged; the concept does not narrow options or create friction. Lyric reprise present but no middle beat where the concept alters a decision. Two gates, eligible to ~6.0, but label-only use −0.6 and no causal pressure caps the score below 4.0.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Warmly attentive" is applied as a descriptor throughout (setup ✓, development ✓, ending ✓), but it never constrains or enables a choice with cost. It reads as a personality label rather than a trait that creates friction or tradeoff. Three gates technically met via mentions, but label-only use without action pressure −1.0 and swappability (another calm observer would function identically) −0.8 hold the score in the low 3s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Tend" frames Elara's approach early ("to tend to its silent narratives," "she would tend to this fractured moment") and appears in the climactic writing beat ("by harmonizing its discord"). Setup ✓, development ✓, payoff ✓. Three gates. However, the action is metaphorical and does not involve a turn or cost; she executes tending as planned with no obstacle. Beat involvement (three) +1.4, closure linkage +0.8, but swappability (another gentle verb—"honor," "weave"—would function identically) −0.7 and no causal pressure constraining options limits the score to mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Harmonizing discord" is named early as Elara's method (setup ✓), applied to the snapped branch example, and explicitly invoked in the writing scene ("harmonizing its discord into verse," payoff ✓). Setup and payoff present; middle development is the branch example. Two to three gates. However, the method is asserted rather than tested—no moment where discord resists harmonizing or demands a cost. Beat involvement (two) +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, but summary-only mechanics (told she harmonizes, not shown struggling with or sacrificing for the method) −0.7 and no cost connection −0.4 keep the score below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The cobalt lagoon is established in the opening (setup ✓), provides the setting throughout (development ✓), and Elara leaves the kite "for the tide" at the end (payoff ✓). Three gates. The lagoon anchors atmosphere and supplies the final gesture (offering to the tide), giving it mild closure linkage +0.5. However, it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—Elara could write anywhere. Beat involvement (three) +1.4, but postcard description without tactical pressure −0.8 limits the score to low-5s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "as a kite string snaps" is named and dramatized in the inciting incident (setup ✓). The text notes "The timeframe was crystalline: as a kite string snaps, a narrative pivots between loss and liberation." However, no clock tightens decisions afterward; the piece unfolds in a leisurely twilight with no time pressure. Development and payoff gates missing. One gate (setup) caps eligibility at 4.6. Early signal +0.5, specificity (the snap as pivot metaphor) +0.4, but no causal pressure or tightening −1.0 and ornamental thematic use −0.5 bring the score to mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Elara's motivation "to discover beauty in the incomplete" is stated early (setup ✓), reflected in her observation of the fractured shell and kite (development ✓), and fulfilled in the writing act (payoff ✓). Three gates. However, the desire is never conflicted or tested by cost—she seeks incomplete beauty and finds it without friction or trade-off. Beat involvement (three) +1.4, closure linkage +0.8, but told-only without want-versus-fear tension or sacrifice −0.9 and no visible price −0.4 cap the score in the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Burnished hush" is established in the opening (setup ✓), returns after the kite falls, and is invoked in the closing ("The burnished hush had returned, now layered with the story woven into its silence," payoff ✓). Tone modulates slightly with the kite's *twang* disruption, then re-settles. Three gates. The tone charges the final image by layering story into silence, satisfying closure linkage +1.2. Beat involvement (three) +1.4, early signal +0.5. However, the modulation is minimal and the tone remains largely static, preventing entry to higher bands. Coherent through turns and purposeful at closure lifts the score to the upper 6s.</comment>
