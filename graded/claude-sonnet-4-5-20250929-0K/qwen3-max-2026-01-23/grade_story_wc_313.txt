<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is coherent and her "precisely humane" attribute does enable the key choice to rescue versus expunge the bottle. However, interiority leans heavily on abstract description ("compassionate was not sentimentality but intentional, respectful action") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The grief memory at the bottle's discovery shows embodied emotion, but the resolution feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle—she simply wraps the artifact and moves forward without visible internal cost or foreclosed alternative.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive early and are clear. The piece opts for an accumulative/textural lens: Elara descends, finds the bottle, experiences memory, and reaffirms her mission. The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (reweighting her purpose from sorrow to connection), but the final image—"no longer a path of shadows, but an illuminated conduit for memory"—is stated theme rather than a dramatized cost. No live option is foreclosed on the page; she intended to rescue artifacts and does so without friction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The Midnight Ridgeway, exposed cobblestones, and the water-stained foundation create vivid spatial grounding. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's professional attention. The green bottle's discovery is anchored in concrete space (nestled against foundation stone) and the ridgeway's visual rhythm ("shadows pooled thick even at noon") contributes to tone. The micro-setting (the exposed porch foundation) does enable the key find, meeting the 9+ gate requirement, but the environment does not meaningfully constrain her choice—she retrieves the bottle without spatial friction or resource limit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—honoring memory versus bureaucratic erasure—is signaled early. The directive to "expunge all personal artifacts" provides potential friction, but Elara never faces a live choice between compliance and defiance; her decision to rescue the bottle is her default position from the opening. The piece deepens her understanding (liqueur = loss → liqueur = courage lesson) but does not tighten options or impose visible cost. Under an accumulative lens, one meaningful intensification is present (the grief memory), but no tactic shifts or consequences land on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the bottle, photographs, and resurfacing town: memory as foundation rather than ghost. The final image attempts to reweight the ridgeway from shadow-path to "illuminated conduit," but this arrives through direct statement ("She carried Oakhaven not as a burden of sorrow, but as a compass of connection") rather than a non-literal image or earned insight. The sapphire-hued label does link past (Gran's liqueur) to future (school lesson), providing a concrete particular, but the thematic answer is narrated rather than discovered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, distance is consistent, and narrative certainty matches Elara's knowledge. Diction is controlled and purpose-driven, with perceptual signature ("she felt the absence of sound like a shift in atmospheric pressure"). However, register occasionally drifts elevated ("forging a tangible bridge between image and object, past and present") in ways that feel more essayistic than character-particular under stress. The prose maintains texture and rhythm; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks appear.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high and sentences often do double duty (e.g., "skeletal remains of Oakhaven—a town deliberately flooded sixty years prior"). Rhythm varies appropriately and no paraphrase loops or template cadence runs appear. However, several lines in the final third lean into abstraction and summary ("proving the past was not a ghost to fear but a foundation to honor," "all held within the mirrored hush of the resurfacing world") that dull immediacy. Figurative language occasionally stacks without clear payoff ("poignant perfume of return," "sacred space waiting for truth"). Apply −0.6 in Q7 for density and register drift in closure vicinity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The core premise—levee warden as memory-keeper during drought exposing a drowned town—offers a fresh synthesis. Elara's choice to rescue versus sanitize transforms a familiar "bureaucracy vs. humanity" trope through the specificity of the photograph folio and Gran's liqueur. However, the emotional arc and final wisdom ("memory as foundation") resolve into a tidy, explicitly stated lesson that avoids ambiguity or meaningful risk. The transformation test is borderline: swapping names and setting would leave the arc largely unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her decision to rescue the bottle (versus expunge per directive) is the story's key action. However, her choice was never in doubt—she intends to honor memory from the opening and encounters no friction that would shift her tactics. The turn (grief → courage lesson) is internal reframing rather than a decision that alters options. Present across beats, drives one turn, but swappable role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sapphire-hued label appears first in memory (Gran pouring cerulean liqueur at twilight) and returns as the physical bottle Elara retrieves. It anchors the grief memory and will become the school artifact, linking three beats. However, its properties are color and association; the label itself does not constrain a choice or create a visible cost—Elara wraps and pockets it without friction. Present in setup, middle memory, and ending plan; lyric reprise reweights from loss to lesson.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The resurfacing reservoir town is the story's engine: drought exposes Oakhaven, enabling Elara's descent and artifact recovery. It shapes the dominant stake (memory versus erasure) and supplies the spatial pressure (exposed cobblestones, water-stained foundation). The concept is causally active in setup (town surfaces), middle (descent to exposed porch), and ending (rescued artifact will become communal lesson). Essential across beats; removing it breaks the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Precisely humane" is defined on the page ("compassion was not sentimentality but intentional, respectful action") and motivates the rescue choice. However, it functions more as character label than lived constraint—Elara does not face a dilemma where precision and humanity pull in opposite directions, nor does the trait impose visible cost. Mentioned at setup, informs the key choice, but does not constrain with friction or tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Expunge" appears as the authority's directive (erase/catalog/secure) and as Elara's counter-move (rescue the bottle to "expunge...from vulnerable exposure"). The wordplay anchors the thematic turn (erasure → rescue), but the action itself is straightforward retrieval without complication. Present in setup (directive), drives the key choice (rescue), and echoes in her rationale. Functional across beats but the mechanics are simple; swapping "remove" or "secure" would require only minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The photograph folio is Elara's "method" and is signaled early ("chronological trail...taken by her grandfather"). Tonight's photo shows Gran's porch, guiding Elara to the exact exposed spot where she finds the bottle. The folio will return in the ending plan (photo + label on the school desk). Present in setup, enables the middle search, and participates in closure. However, the mechanics are passive—any map or record could serve the same function with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The Midnight Ridgeway at twilight is vividly rendered ("shadows pooled thick even at noon, now softened by the violet bleed of dusk") and frames the opening and closing. It provides spatial anchor and tone (silence, mirrored hush). However, it does not constrain Elara's choice or supply a resource friction—she descends, retrieves the bottle, and ascends without difficulty. Present at setup and closure with clear sensory texture, but micro-setting function is limited.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The wind chime's silence is the story's temporal anchor: "the brass wind chime ceased its gentle song...the silence arriving precisely as foretold." It signals the porch's exposure and triggers Elara's descent. The timeframe (twilight deepening to dusk/stars) tracks across the piece and the chime's silence bookends the action (opening cue, final firefly near "silent chime"). However, time does not tighten decisions—Elara has weeks of preparation and no urgency forces a tactical shift.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation "to spin these unearthed fragments into shared meaning for the descendants" is stated early and anchors her descent and rescue. The liqueur bottle will become the school artifact, fulfilling this desire on the page. However, the motivation is told and never conflicts with another want or cost—she intends to teach, retrieves an artifact, and will teach. Present across beats, drives the key action, but no friction or trade-off appears.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Mirrored hush" is established early (wind chime silence, reservoir's glassy surface reflecting stars and streets) and recurs at closure ("mirrored hush of the resurfacing world"). Tone modulates appropriately from vigilant stillness to reflective resolve. The final image (firefly, silent chime, ridgeway as "illuminated conduit") attempts to charge the tone shift from shadow to light, and the reflection motif ("to hold up such mirrors") ties to theme. Coherent and purposeful, present at setup and ending, but the tonal reconfiguration is stated rather than landed in image.</comment>
