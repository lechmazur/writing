<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's internal state is handled mostly through static description and label-only traits ("carefully inventive," "quiet renown") rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. The clipboard attachment and pseudonym work feel ornamental rather than arising from embodied need. The chalk-code revelation produces tears but the emotional progression lacks credible irrationality or cost—she simply adopts "Aurora" without friction. The final choice feels unmotivated by prior causality; "Lyra" and "Corbin" are discarded via assertion, not dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who Elara is (pseudonym creator), what she's doing (finalizing a signature), and why it matters emerge gradually across the first third without concrete stakes. The dominant lens reads Accumulative/Textural, but no meaningful tightening occurs—the chalk code simply hands her a solution. Closure is a Conceptual Reprising (the margin speaks), yet cost is absent: she feels "lighter," the letter is mailed, and no path is foreclosed. The ending reconfigures meaning thematically but lacks visible or felt price on the page, failing the Cost proof test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The golden arcade is vividly rendered with nano-forged alloy, holographic koi, and real sparrows establishing futuristic nostalgia. Sensory detail is purposeful (ozone, jasmine, polished floor) and the chalk on the floor constrains Elara's final choice, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement. However, spatial choreography is vague—her movements from standing to kneeling to the mailbox lack clear positional anchors, and the arcade's layout remains abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finalizing the pseudonym—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal or tightening occurs; the chalk code conveniently delivers the answer without narrowing options or forcing a trade-off. Elara's agency is passive observation, not decision under pressure. The mailing of the letter carries no dramatized cost; it's ritualistic rather than conflicted, and no live option is foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme (meaning in the margins) emerges clearly from the chalk code and surface mail but is over-articulated in the final third: "meaning had been discovered exactly where she always sought it: in the margins" and "the most important messages live not in ink, but in the spaces between." The ending offers a resonant image (chalk dust on shoes) but the prior moralizing undercuts subtlety. Futuristic nostalgia is shown rather than told, elevating craft, but the protagonist's arc feels pre-determined rather than inextricable from the thematic question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third limited, and perceptual signature is present (Elara notices craft, margins, ephemeral art). However, diction drifts into elevated register ("delicate ecosystem of sound, history, and hidden emotional resonance") that feels authorial rather than character-bound. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is consistent but lacks modulation under pressure; the voice remains the same calm throughout, even at the tears-pricking moment, flattening emotional texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound: "carefully inventive" appears twice; "margin/margins" recurs six times in near-identical thematic claims; "futuristic nostalgia" is stated twice and restated conceptually in multiple beats. Template cadence in the final third: "She remembered... She cherished... She turned..." Filter-verb stacks ("felt," "knew," "carried") dull immediacy in peak beats. Mixed metaphor: "ebony clipboard... was her sanctuary" then "vessel that had held perfect alignment." Stock phrasing: "tears pricked her eyes," "promise sent into the world." These artifacts cluster near closure, triggering the artifact penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The pseudonym-creator premise is specific but the arc—artisan finds inspiration in ephemeral street art—is a familiar template executed without fresh synthesis. The chalk-code solution arrives conveniently rather than through earned struggle. Surface mail as rebellion and futuristic nostalgia are told more than transformed through choice. No bold risk heightens stakes; the story settles into a median option (gentle affirming arc) that avoids ambiguity or cost.</comment>
