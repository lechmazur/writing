<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is signaled early and her wilting response to dishonesty provides embodied constraint. The final acceptance of the neighbor's confession demonstrates earned agency, though the arc from isolation to receptivity relies heavily on exposition about what she "felt" in the chamber rather than dramatized internal conflict. The child and elder encounters function more as symbolic stations than genuine pressure points that force contradictory impulses to act simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the story gathers candor moments toward a final reweighting. Orientation is clear by the opening beat. The closure—Elara as "gardener of moments" who will now honor small truths—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (stance crystallization), but the cost is more asserted than felt; the neighbor's orchids provide a reprise, yet the stakes never visibly narrow or force a trade-off. The chamber revelation tells us lost conversations live in candor rather than showing Elara sacrifice or foreclose a prior belief with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse city under toxic sky is vividly rendered and consistently present; the zinc fragment, oak table, and Northern Arch supply tangible anchors. The derelict arch with its feather-shaped slot constrains Elara's method and charges the threshold crossing. Spatial choreography remains clean across all moves, and the greenhouse veins metaphor weaves setting into theme without postcard detachment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding where lost conversations go—is signaled early. The story offers one meaningful deepening when Elara realizes candor in small moments rather than a physical vault, yet this realization arrives more as epiphany than as a choice that narrows options or exacts visible cost. The child's and elder's confessions accumulate pressure texturally but do not force Elara to renounce a prior tactic or pay a legible price; she simply receives truth and her hands "still" without dramatized internal friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—candor as the deepest oasis—emerges organically from the greenhouse metaphor, the zinc fragment, and the small-truth encounters. The final image of Elara as "gardener of moments" reweights prior material without stating a moral, and the child's inscribed words provide resonant, non-literal closure. Minor penalty: the phrase "honesty was the deepest oasis" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward explicit theme statement, though it follows from scene work rather than replacing it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance and Elara's perceptual bias (gilded-leaf craft, sensitivity to lies). Diction is controlled and voice-specific. Two frictions lower the score: elevated register in peak beats ("a plea for coherence," "dissolution" metaphors) occasionally drifts above the concrete sensory anchors established early, and some interiority ("The warmth of a mother's lullaby hummed in the air") tells emotion rather than filtering it through Elara's body and micro-choices under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with purposeful rhythm and vivid imagery. Deductions: paraphrase loops appear ("lost conversations were not stored here—they lived"; "not as an archivist of words, but as a gardener of moments" recycles the same conceptual beat), and template cadence runs cluster in the chamber scene ("No vault… Only a circular chamber… But as Elara stepped…"). Figurative density in the opening and closing paragraphs (wilting vines, night-blooming cereus, compass needle) borders on overwriting without always doing multiple jobs. Apply −0.6 for loops and template stems, −0.3 for figurative excess near closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The gilded-leaf calligrapher who wilts near lies offers a fresh synthesis, and the shift from seeking a vault to recognizing candor in small moments provides a non-obvious turn. However, the map-under-floorboards device and the derelict-arch puzzle slot follow familiar treasure-hunt templates, and the resolution—truth lives in moments, not archives—echoes common epiphany structures. The ending commits to its premise with vivid particulars (neighbor's orchids, child's moss), lifting the score within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's choices drive all major beats: prying loose the floorboard, piecing the map, venturing to the arch, and accepting the neighbor's flowers. Her agency shapes the closure (deciding to inscribe small truths). Present throughout, with causal pressure and closure linkage intact.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The zinc fragment appears early (map discovery), returns with reweighted meaning (child and elder warm it), and unlocks the arch slot—three distinct beats. It charges the final threshold and carries symbolic weight ("key left by truth-keepers"), though the warming detail is told rather than dramatized. Strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Candor in small moments is seeded early (child's confession, elder's admission) and explicitly names the closure realization. It shapes Elara's final stance and the orchid acceptance. However, it functions more as thematic echo than on-page constraint that narrows options; the concept is asserted rather than forcing a visible trade-off or tactical shift under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Wilting near dishonesty is embodied early (merchant's lie makes her hands tremble), vanishes during candor (child's truth stills her hands), and returns in principle at closure ("when lies drifted near, she would wilt"). It constrains one key beat (market passage) and charges the final stance. Cost is visible but the trait does not force a hard choice or alter tactics across multiple beats.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rereading appears three times with escalating stakes: the zinc etching (coordinate reveal), the map's final clue ("Where silence drinks memory"), and thematic resonance when she paints the child's words. Each instance advances knowledge and shapes the next beat. Removing rereading would break causal flow, though the action itself is not irreplaceable (examining, deciphering could substitute).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Piecing the shredded map is dramatized early (tweezers, breath held, oak table), enables the zinc discovery, and sets up the arch journey. It appears in the first third, drives one major beat (map reconstruction), and primes closure by revealing the coordinate. Swappability moderate: another discovery method could serve similar function with edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse city under toxic sky is established in the opening, supplies resources (hydroponic farms, vine-nets), pressures tactics (Elara hurries through humid corridors to find candor), and charges the final image (glass veins, artificial stars). Setting is indispensable to logic, tone, and closure; removing it would collapse the oasis/candor metaphor and world coherence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dried oasis is backstory context ("twenty years prior") that anchors the toxic sky and scarcity metaphor. It does not tighten decisions or function as a live clock; no on-page deadline or temporal pressure alters Elara's tactics. Present thematically but does not constrain choices or escalate urgency in real time.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Finding where lost conversations go is stated early, drives the map quest and arch journey, and receives explicit answer at closure ("they reside in the space between a confession and a nod"). The motivation shapes all major beats. Friction: the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or costs that Elara must weigh; it functions as quest-driver but lacks visible trade-off or internal contradiction under pressure.</comment>
