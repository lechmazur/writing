<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's grief is embodied through tactile actions (soldering, touching the censer foot), but her interiority relies heavily on abstract label-speak: "geography of loss," "raw solace," "reverse migration" repeated without concrete contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice to complete the circuit feels unmotivated—no struggle, no competing impulse dramatized. The "patchwork navigator" concept remains decorative; her salvaged-parts body never constrains a choice or creates friction under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The piece teaches an accumulative/textural lens early (memory-building ritual, moon-phase modulation) and maintains it through closure. The final circuit completion triggers a vision sequence that reweights prior material, qualifying as Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the phone-call mechanism arrives unmotivated (no hint of why a rotary phone exists in a signal station or who calls), and the cost at closure is asserted ("peace settled") rather than shown through a visible forfeiture or tactical shift. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly within the first ~100 words.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The starlit signal station is anchored early with vivid sensory detail (dome, waxing gibbous moon, cold console). The censer foot's tactile presence (verdigris, lotus carving) grounds micro-setting work. The broken hydraulics frame the opening but never constrain a later choice; the station remains a backdrop rather than a pressure source. Spatial choreography is coherent but the environment does not force a tactical shift or charge the final image beyond mood.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—navigating grief to reclaim love's essence—is signaled early and held throughout. The "reverse migration" method provides a through-line, but pressure remains static: Elara builds the device without meaningful obstacle, the phone calls deliver instructions without conflict, and the circuit completes effortlessly. The "fluctuates with moon phases" attribute is mentioned but never narrows options or forces a trade-off. No on-page tightening or deepening alters tactics; the final vision sequence delivers emotional release without visible cost or forfeited path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete images (censer foot, soldering, sandalwood memory) rather than statement, and "raw solace" is enacted via tactile ritual. However, the final third drifts into thematic echo: "raw solace not in forgetting, but in carrying Kael forward" and "love navigates even the deepest voids" replace scene pressure with summary moralizing. The "geography of loss" motif recurs so frequently it becomes a label rather than an evolving image. The ending offers resonance but leans on restated theme rather than a non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and the perceptual signature (star charts, salvaged parts, rosin scent) is character-specific. Diction remains within Elara's technical-grieving register throughout. However, peak emotional beats rely on filter verbs and abstraction: "tears fell—not of despair, but release" tells rather than showing contradictory impulses. The phone-voice dialogue ("Seek the anchor in the ash") is serviceable but generic. Rhythmic control is present but does not modulate under pressure; syntactic variety is limited by repeated "She [verb]" stems across the middle third.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Clarity is high and sensory detail is specific (patina bronze, verdigris, rosin). However, paraphrase loops proliferate: "geography of loss" appears in lines 3, 11, 22, 29 with minimal variation; "raw solace" in lines 12, 15, 23, 31 similarly churns. Template cadence runs dominate the final third: "The [noun] was [state]... [noun] were [state]..." across six consecutive sentences (lines 21–26). Figurative density ("mosaic of salvaged parts mirroring fractured landscape," "copper threads through geography") appears in most sentences of high-pressure beats without payoff. Bracket counts ([11, total 23]) are scaffolding tokens but do not obscure causality. Apply −0.8 for loops and template cadence, −0.4 for figurative muddle in peak beats; total −1.2 in Q7, plus disallow 9+ globally per artifact-in-final-third rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The "signal station + grief ritual + cryptic phone calls" synthesis is non-obvious and the censer-foot anchor is specific. However, the "navigator charts inner geography" conceit is a widely used metaphor for grief work, and the phone-call framing device (mysterious instructions leading to epiphany) is a familiar template. Emotional truth is present in tactile memory (burnt tea, crinkle by his eyes) but the arc—building a device to unlock visions—does not transform the premise through lived friction or surprising moral calculus. The patchwork-body motif is introduced but never leveraged; Elara's salvaged parts could be swapped for any grief metaphor with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her hands perform actions (soldering, touching the censer foot). However, her choices are instructed by the phone rather than generated by internal conflict: "Seek the anchor" → she finds it; "Complete the circuit" → she complies. No moment shows her deciding between competing options or altering tactics under pressure. Present but not decision-driving; functional role only.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The censer foot appears in lines 6 (pocket anchor), 10 (soldering target), 13 (phone instruction references it), 19 (returns to pocket warm), and 24 (warm secret). It is handled in multiple beats, its verdigris texture is specified, and it returns with reweighted meaning (compass, warm from resonance). The lotus carving detail and the "all that remained of Kael's burner" backstory tie it to the dead lover. It participates in closure (warm in pocket after the circuit completes) and is causally active in the ritual build. Strong setup, development, and payoff; nears indispensability for the ritual's tactile grounding.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Reverse migration" is named in lines 3, 4, 11, 15, 25 but functions as thematic label rather than a stake that narrows options. The concept is explained (journey backward through grief) but never tested: Elara does not face a choice between moving forward and dwelling, nor does the "migration" impose a cost or constraint. Present and conceptually consistent, but swappable with "grief work" or "memory pilgrimage" without structural change. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Fluctuates with moon phases" is mentioned once in line 9 ("full moon clarity... tonight's crescent demanded faith"), but no on-page action changes because of the moon's state. The crescent does not prevent her from completing the circuit or force a different tactic. The waxing gibbous moon in line 8 provides light but does not enable or constrain a choice. Label-only attribute; decorative mention without mechanical consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Build" is signaled in line 8 and executed across lines 8–10 (laying wires, crystal, censer foot) and line 13 (soldering filament). The ritual assembly structures the middle sequence and the completed circuit in line 14 triggers the vision payoff. The action is not easily swappable—removing "build" would eliminate the tactile ritual that grounds the story. However, the build itself faces no obstacle or failed attempt; it proceeds smoothly from instruction to completion. Shapes one key turn (circuit completion) and the ending, but lacks developmental friction. Essential across beats and ending, but mechanical rather than choice-driven.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The phone calls are seeded in line 5 (rotary phone's shrill ring) and recur in lines 6 (last night's instruction), 13 (midnight instruction), and 20 (would cease). The method delivers the two instructions that guide Elara's actions (seek anchor, complete circuit) and thus shapes her attempts. However, the mechanism is unexplained—no hint why a rotary phone exists in a signal station or who calls—and it does not constrain her; she never struggles to interpret or resist an instruction. Present early, involved in two beats, and linked to closure, but the mysterious-caller trope is generic and the phone could be replaced with a journal, dream, or memory without major structural change. Functional across beats but ultimately swappable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The starlit signal station is named in the opening line and recurs in line 12 (sanctuary), line 21 (sleeping habitat module mentioned), and line 26 (moonlight on broken dish). The dome provides moonlight that "streamed through" in line 8, and the broken hydraulics frame the opening. However, the station never pressures a choice: the failed hydraulics do not block the ritual, the dome does not constrain access, and the habitat module is mentioned only in passing. Micro-setting (the console, the dome) anchors atmosphere but does not alter tactics or supply a resource that affects outcome. Present early and at closure, but postcard function; one minor causal role (moonlight enables work) lifts it slightly above ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"After the hydraulics fail" anchors the opening (three nights ago) and is repeated in line 18 ("since the failure") and implicit throughout. The timeframe establishes a post-disaster state but does not tighten decisions: no repair deadline, no resource depletion, no countdown. The "midnight" phone calls provide a ritual clock but do not create urgency—Elara waits for them rather than racing against them. The moon phases are mentioned but do not track a ticking constraint. Present throughout but vague; time does not shape tactics or escalate pressure. Functional setup without development or cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Navigate the geography of loss" is stated in line 3 and recurs in lines 11, 22, 29. The desire drives the ritual build and the final circuit completion. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants: Elara never weighs the cost of dwelling in grief versus moving on, nor does she face friction between honoring Kael and preserving herself. The ending asserts "peace settled" and "forward journey" without showing a visible trade-off. Present early and at closure, drives the through-line, but friction between want and cost is minimal. One key structural role (ritual purpose) with thematic payoff, but choice-level conflict is absent.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Raw solace" is named in line 12 and recurs in lines 15, 23, 31, explicitly defining the emotional register. The tone is consistent—bittersweet, tactile, grief-infused—and modulates slightly from cold calculation (opening) to companionable silence (ending). The final image (moonlight, warm censer foot, steady hands) charges the tone with quiet resolution. However, the tone label is stated rather than embodied in half the mentions ("raw solace lived in specifics" tells rather than showing). Coherent through turns, purposeful reprise, and modulates with pressure; reaches low-7s for integration but capped at 6.3 due to reliance on the label itself rather than purely enacted mood.</comment>
