<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is established early and drives the sewing action, but her interiority remains abstract and label-heavy ("hauntingly optimistic," "fierce hope," "profound peace"). The sleepwalking backstory anchors her method but reads as exposition rather than contradictory impulse under pressure. The final choice—tying thread to the orchid—feels predetermined by the sleepwalking convergence rather than earned by on-page struggle. Embodied emotion appears in tears and calloused fingers, but the peak beats lack genuine flaws or mistakes that compound before resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara enters the labyrinth, follows her sleepwalking paths, and sews the thread to completion. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The closure—tying thread to the resilient orchid—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (reverence earned through embodied action), but the cost remains conceptual and asserted ("broken precedents were alchemized") rather than felt on the page. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the sewing proceeds as planned from the outset.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The red canyon labyrinth is anchored early with vivid sensory detail (wind-softened spirals, crimson walls, dust-filled basin). The ghost orchid's fragrance recurs purposefully, and the basin crack that births the orchid constrains Elara's final choice—she ties the thread to a living emblem rather than restoring the vanished garden. Spatial choreography remains clear across alcoves and the central chamber. Minor density: some descriptions (falcon smoothed to anonymity) add texture without altering tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—carving a path from ruin to reverence—is signaled early and held throughout. However, no on-page reversal or tightening narrows Elara's options; she follows her sleepwalking paths exactly as planned. The sewing proceeds without complication, error, or trade-off. The final act (tying thread to the orchid) reweights the goal from restoration to living resilience, but this shift feels thematic rather than a choice forced by pressure. Cost is asserted ("tears traced clean paths") but remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme—honoring loss while seeding renewal—emerges organically from the thread-sewing and orchid imagery. The final image (thread tied to the canyon orchid) offers a non-literal answer: reverence becomes resilience, not restoration. However, explicit thematic statements proliferate ("not by erasure, but by weaving compassion," "alchemized," "hauntingly optimistic solace"), edging toward moralizing. The orchid motif recurs with purpose, shifting from ghost fragrance to rooted emblem, but the "broken precedents" remain abstract and unexamined.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The single-POV narration maintains stable psychic distance and a lyric, elevated register consistent with "poetic wharf weaver." Vocabulary is purposeful ("cobalt and ochre," "moon-silk and sea-grass"), though some phrasing edges toward stock lyricism ("honeyed fragrance," "profound hush"). The repeated phrase "hauntingly optimistic" and similar constructions ("fierce hope," "orchid solace") flatten the voice slightly. No dialogue appears; perception remains first-person close. Brief compression during sewing maintains texture without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout, with metaphor in nearly every sentence ("liquid mirror," "ghost of intention," "tapestry of hauntingly optimistic solace"). This creates cumulative register drift and some mixed vehicles (thread "gleaming like captured starlight" then "charged by dream-consensus"). Paraphrase loops appear: "haunted by hauntingly optimistic resolve/balance/solace" recurs three times; "broken precedents" appears twice in identical phrasing without added pressure. Template cadence in the sewing sequence ("She began to sew... Each stitch carried... Where two dream-paths overlapped...") and minor filter-verb stacks ("she believed," "reminded that") dull immediacy in peak beats. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph, triggering the −1.7 penalty and the global 9+ disqualifier.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The premise—sewing a labyrinth path guided by sleepwalking dreams—offers a fresh synthesis of ritual, memory, and embodied cartography. However, the execution leans on familiar "restore the sacred site" and "lone artisan heals the land" templates without sharp friction or counter-pressure. The orchid-as-resilience turn is earned but not unexpected. Vocabulary and imagery ("moon-silk," "ghost orchid," "silver thread and dream-memory") feel curated rather than inevitable. Risk-taking remains modest; the story executes its lyric mode cleanly but safely.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her choice to sew the thread drives all beats. However, her decisions follow the sleepwalking convergence map exactly; no on-page choice alters tactics or forecloses a live option. Her role is executioner of a pre-determined plan rather than protagonist under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The storybook plate appears in three beats: discovery (backstory), alignment with dust (kneeling), and pocketing at closure. It frames expectation and bridges memory to action, but its mechanics remain static—it is consulted, not reweighted. The falcon detail (smoothed to anonymity) adds texture without changing Elara's approach. Swappable with "map" or "diagram."</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Broken precedents" is named three times and shapes the story's thematic goal (mending severed memory), but the concept remains abstract. No on-page action dramatizes what the precedents were, how they broke, or what honoring them costs Elara in the present. The theme is asserted ("alchemized") rather than tested.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Hauntingly optimistic" appears as a label four times ("resolve," "balance," "solace") but does not constrain or enable a specific choice. The trait describes Elara's mood rather than forcing a trade-off (e.g., optimism blinding her to danger, or haunting causing hesitation). Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sewing is the core action across all major beats: kneeling, stitching the crescent-moon fissure, looping at convergences, circling the basin, tying to the orchid. Removing sewing would collapse the plot. The action is specific (whalebone needle, moon-silk thread, resin seal) and irreplaceable. However, no sewing attempt fails or forces adaptation; execution is flawless.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The overlapping sleepwalking paths are signaled early (thirty nights, dream-logic) and govern Elara's method throughout: she sews only where paths converge. The three-path alcove and basin circle are dramatized as validations. The method is specific and causal, though no tension arises from conflicting paths or ambiguous convergence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The red canyon labyrinth provides the spatial structure and the basin crack births the orchid that anchors the closure. Wind-softened stone, dust, and the collapsed arch are handled across beats. The setting constrains Elara's path (she follows carved corridors) and supplies the orchid resource. Micro-setting (fissure, alcove, basin edge) shapes sewing placement.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the tide pools empty" anchors the opening and the final star punctuates the exit, but no ticking clock tightens decisions. Thirty nights of sleepwalking are backstory; the on-page sewing unfolds without duration or urgency. Time is atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation to carve a path from ruin to reverence is stated early, pursued across all beats, and achieved at closure (thread tied to orchid emblem). However, no friction tests the desire—Elara never doubts, hesitates, or confronts a cost that might redirect her goal. The motivation is told and executed, not dramatized under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Orchid solace" recurs as fragrance in the breeze, a reminder of beauty in broken places, and a final kept promise. The tone is elegiac and hopeful, coherent across beats. However, the phrase "hauntingly optimistic solace" in the final paragraph names the tone rather than letting the orchid image charge it. The tone modulates minimally; grief and hope are asserted in parallel rather than layered under pressure.</comment>
