<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (reading scars) is established early but remains abstract; her internal shift from "prying wounds" to "listening" is told through summary and label-speak ("understanding bloomed," "crystalline clarity") rather than embodied contradiction. The telepathy grants information but Elara never makes a micro-choice under competing pressures—she receives wisdom passively. The fern's memory and the oak's journey do narrative work, but Elara's agency is observation, not decision with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers plant-transmitted memories and symbolic objects (hourglass, coffee ring, scars) toward a conceptual repricing at closure. Orientation anchors clearly by line 25 (tower, dawn, post-surgery). The closure reweights "scars as tunnels" and "displaced miracles," but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized—Elara's renunciation of wound-probing is declared in summary ("She would no longer seek closure by opening wounds") without an on-page forfeiture or choice that forecloses a live path. The resonant reconfiguration relies on thematic echo more than felt pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tower setting, frosted hourglass, potted fern, and coffee ring are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (frost defying warmth, fractal lacework). The micro-setting (bedside objects, window view) constrains Elara's attention and the fern's root-tunnel vision charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout, and the dawn light melting the hourglass frost provides a purposeful environmental shift at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Elara's drive to decipher scars and find closure. The piece deepens understanding via plant-transmitted memories (broken frond, buried acorn), but there is no on-page reversal or choice under competing pressure—Elara receives insight passively. The "tightening" is conceptual reweighting rather than narrowed options or a trade-off with visible cost. No antagonist or obstacle forces agency; the escalation is textural accumulation rather than protagonist-driven tension.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (scars as tunnels, displaced miracles, listening vs. prying) emerges through concrete images and plant memories, avoiding overt thesis until the final paragraphs. However, lines 306, 318, and 356 deliver explicit thematic summaries ("True closure was not a destination…," "scars are tunnels…") that replace resonance with statement. The coffee ring and oak acorn earn their weight; the conceptual repricing would score higher if the final beat trusted image over articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable with a lyric register (e.g., "meteor hush," "glacial slowness," "fractal lacework"). Diction is elevated but consistent; no head-hopping. However, perceptual signature lacks character-specific bias—descriptions feel polished but generic, and the vocabulary ("verdant wave of thought," "reverent attention") trends toward a uniform literary idiom rather than Elara's embodied particularity. Filter verbs ("her gaze found," "her eyes drifted") appear but do not dull urgency in this accumulative mode.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is coherent ("river deltas and branching nerves," "roots wove a living tunnel"). However, the piece suffers from paraphrase loops and summary redundancy: lines 221–227, 306, 318, 335, 345, and 356 restate the scars-as-tunnels thesis with synonym churn ("stories are witnessed," "true closure," "scars are tunnels"). The final third recycles the core insight across multiple beats without added pressure, flattening momentum. Template cadence appears in exposition blocks ("She had spent decades…," "She would no longer…"). Deduct −0.6 for loops and scaffold touching the closure zone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The combination of plant telepathy, coffee-ring divination, and scars-as-narrative is specific, but the emotional arc (closure-seeker learns to listen) follows a familiar epiphany template without transformation through high-stakes choice. The oak acorn's germination in darkness offers a fresh image, yet the piece resolves into abstraction ("displaced miracles") rather than embodied particulars. The surgery-as-telepathy origin and frosted hourglass add texture but do not fundamentally alter the trajectory; swapping them for other symbolic objects would leave the thematic statement intact.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's trait (closure seeker who opens wounds) is introduced early (line 53, 62) and the ending declares her renunciation (line 335), but the reversal is told, not enacted through a decision under pressure. She observes and receives wisdom; no on-page choice forecloses a live path. Present in setup and closure summary, but missing middle development via agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Frosted hourglass appears at line 75, reappears at lines 248 (frost melts, final grain falls), and 329 (symbol of clarity gained). It measures anesthesia's end and provides a visual marker at closure, but it does not constrain choice or alter tactics—Elara does not interact with it. Lyric reprise reweights meaning modestly; swappable with another time-marker without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Displaced miracle" is named at lines 154, 159, 194, 212, 306, 318, and 356. The oak acorn's germination in darkness (lines 168–182) and Elara's telepathy (line 212, 318) embody the concept and shape the final reweighting. It frames the dominant stake and charges the closure image, but resolution is conceptual repricing rather than decision-driven turn. Strong thematic integration; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Accidental plant telepathy is introduced at line 122, enables the fern's memory (line 143) and root-tunnel vision (line 154), and is reframed at closure (line 318) as "the displaced miracle she needed." It provides information but does not constrain choice or impose visible cost—Elara passively receives insight. Present across setup, middle, and closure; functional but not indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Tunnel" appears as root-tunnel (line 154, 182), scar-as-tunnel metaphor (line 204, 269), and closure thesis (line 356). The root-tunnel vision from the fern reweights Elara's understanding, and the final image ("scars are tunnels") reprices the premise. The action is conceptual rather than physical; it shapes the ending's charge but could be replaced by another metaphor (e.g., "bridge," "passage") without breaking causality.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Coffee rings introduced at line 95; method described at line 104 ("traced evaporative patterns to find hidden geographies"); examined at line 113 (fractal lacework). The ring's "perfect, unbroken circle" offers thematic input at line 221 ("stories are witnessed with reverent attention"). Present in setup and thematic reprise; method is described but not enacted under pressure or used to solve a problem. Functional accent but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Tower setting anchored early (line 1, 25) and returns in closure framing (line 281, 345, 356). The bedside objects (fern, hourglass, coffee mug) and window view (olive tree) provide micro-setting that charges the final image. Setting enables the tableau but does not constrain movement or force choice; Elara remains stationary throughout. Solid atmospheric integration without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Timeframe ("after the anesthesia wears off") is signaled at line 1, measured by the hourglass (line 83), and concludes at lines 252–257 ("The final grain of sand fell. The anesthesia's last whisper vanished"). It brackets the narrative and the hourglass provides a visible countdown, but the clock does not tighten decisions—Elara's epiphany unfolds at contemplative pace without urgency. Clear temporal structure; low tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Motivation ("to learn to read the stories in scars") established at line 53, echoed at lines 143 (fern's scar memory), 204 (scar as tunnel), and repriced at closure (lines 295, 345, 356). The desire drives the thematic arc and frames the ending, but it is not dramatized through conflicting choices or visible cost—Elara's shift is contemplative realization rather than renunciation under pressure. Told across beats; friction is conceptual.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" named at lines 1, 281; tone is sustained through lyric diction ("glacial slowness," "verdant wave," "gnarled bark"), quiet revelation, and dawn imagery. The tone modulates subtly from post-anesthesia fog to "crystalline clarity" (line 257) and charges the final tableau (lines 281, 345). Coherent and purposeful, but the single static register trends mid-band; no sharp tonal shift under pressure.</comment>
