<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is handled through poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction—"balanced clarity" and "steadfast flame" label states without showing impulses in collision. The core action of smelting fragments demonstrates commitment to her role, but the choice lacks visible cost or foreclosed alternatives; she performs ritual without dramatized struggle. The moon-phase attribute is mentioned but never constrains an on-page decision. Motivation remains asserted rather than tested under pressure that would reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density and pattern (tide, creel, fragments, smelting) build toward the final image of tidal continuity. Orientation anchors within ~120 words (librarian, atrium, post-tomorrow timeframe). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Elara continues her ritual with "serene certainty," accepting the cyclical role—but cost is implied rather than on-page; no option is visibly foreclosed, no tactic altered. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early and holds it, but the ending restates rather than reweights.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tidal atrium is vivid and coherent: bronze gears "taller than an ancient oak," wintersun light, brine and aged paper scent. The creel functions as micro-setting, handled twice (placement, retrieval) and charged with meaning. Spatial choreography is clear (watermark, stone bench, mist-shrouded shelves). The setting subtly mirrors Elara's internal rhythm and constrains the ritual's choreography, though it does not force a pivotal choice that alters outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled: "preserve wonder in routine." The smelting of contradictory fragments offers a single meaningful action, but pressure never tightens—no fragment resists fusion, no cost narrows options. The desert and memory shards resolve instantly through Elara's verbal acceptance with no struggle, foreclosed path, or felt price. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening would suffice, but here the act is repeated without escalation or complication. No reversal or tightening alters tactics or knowledge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: embracing paradox, continuity within change, wonder preserved through ritual. The smelted fragments ("emptiness holds space for stars") embody the concept without stating a moral. The final image of the waiting creel offers resonance. However, the piece leans on abstractions ("wonder," "oblivion," "sacred") and Elara's insights arrive without earned friction—contradictions dissolve on cue rather than through dramatized cost. The closing line "forever tending the light" edges toward thematic summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Diction is lyric and controlled: "sediment in still water," "glacial grace," "moon-silk pouch." Perceptual signature is present but general—Elara notices beauty and meaning without the idiosyncratic bias that would sharpen her lens. Register occasionally drifts elevated ("perpetual present where yesterday's echoes swirled") in ways that feel authorial rather than character-particular. No dialogue to assess. Compression is purposeful and the pattern is taught early, maintaining legibility.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled and varied; sentence openings shift. Clarity is high with no causality breaks. Figurative language is dense but largely coherent ("titan-gear," "luminous fragments," "migrating identities"). Two penalties: (1) paraphrase loops across adjacent lines—"Elara smiled, her identity peacefully migrating" restates the established pattern without new pressure (−0.2), and (2) stock metaphor strings in the final third ("seed," "star reignited," "endless sky of memory") feel templated rather than particular (−0.4). Information density is moderate; some lines serve atmosphere more than advancement.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise (librarian smelting migrating identity-fragments in a tidal atrium) is imaginative but executed through abstract ritual rather than specific transformation. The smelting mechanism and "migrating identities" remain conceptual—fragments shift meaning off-page without on-page causality. Emotional specificity is thin; Elara's "awe" and "serene certainty" are told rather than embodied through fresh, irreplaceable detail. The piece commits to its lyric frame but does not risk a turn that would complicate the serene tone or test the protagonist's stance.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara places the creel, retrieves it, smelts fragments, shelves them, resets the creel—functional involvement across beats. Her choices are ritualistic rather than turning; no decision alters tactics or forecloses a path. Present in setup, middle, and ending, meeting all three gates, but her agency is observational and repetitive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The bamboo creel is handled in two distinct beats (placement at watermark, retrieval to bench) and returns in the final image ("The creel waited for the next tide"). Its woven ribs and salt-worn history add specificity. It functions as the vessel that enables the smelting ritual, but could be replaced with another container without breaking story logic. Present in setup, middle, and closure; causal role in enabling the ritual (+0.9), closure linkage (+0.7), but swappable (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Migrating identities" is named and described—fragments shift from "queen's decree" to "child's lullaby"—but the migration occurs off-page and does not constrain Elara's choices or alter her tactics. It functions as thematic backdrop rather than active stake. Mentioned in setup and ending but never pressures a decision. Ornamental use (−0.8).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>Moon-phase fluctuation is explained in exposition ("waxing crescent granted balanced clarity") and mentioned at closure ("her identity peacefully migrating with the moon"). It does not constrain or enable any on-page action; Elara's choices proceed identically regardless. Label-only trait (−0.3), no visible tradeoff, no cost. Present in setup and ending but purely descriptive.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Smelting is the central action: Elara cradles the shards, whispers acceptance, watches them merge. It occupies two full beats (desert pair, memory pair) and defines the ritual's mechanism. The final image references smelted stories as "stars reignited." Causally essential—removing it collapses the plot. Early signal (+0.6), two beats (+0.9), closure linkage (+1.2), specificity (+0.5). Slight swappability: another fusion metaphor could substitute with edits (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The method is signaled early ("accepting contradictions as complementary truths") and demonstrated twice on-page (desert shards, memory shards). Elara speaks the acceptance aloud, and the text shows fragments merging in response. It shapes the smelting attempts and recurs at closure. However, the mechanics are assertion—fragments fuse because Elara declares them compatible, without resistance or iterative refinement. Early signal (+0.6), two beats (+0.9), closure mention (+0.5), but summary-only mechanism (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tidal atrium is anchored early and sustained: gears regulate time and tide, water deposits fragments at the creel, the dome's light and receding tide mark rhythm. The setting enables the ritual (tide brings fragments) and mirrors theme (cyclical flow). It constrains choreography (watermark placement, stone bench, shelves) and charges the final image (crescent moon silvering the atrium). Early setup (+0.7), beat involvement (tide cycle, gear turning) (+0.9), closure linkage (+1.0), micro-setting that alters tactics (+0.6). Could function in another liminal space with edits (−0.8).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"After tomorrow disappears" is mentioned in the opening as a perpetual present, creating atmospheric context. It does not constrain Elara's choices, impose urgency, or tighten decisions. The ritual proceeds in cyclical time without a ticking clock. Present in setup but absent from middle beats and closure as a live pressure. Ornamental (−0.8), no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation "to preserve wonder in routine" is stated early and frames the ritual. The smelting and shelving demonstrate this desire. However, the motivation is never conflicted—no friction between preserving wonder and another want, no cost that tests commitment. It remains a guiding principle rather than a dramatized stake with on-page tension. Early signal (+0.6), shapes action (+0.4), closure echo (+0.3), but told-only without friction (−0.8).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Wintersun serenity" is established early (gentle gold, crisp air, long shadows, silence broken only by water and gears) and sustained through closure (twilight, crescent moon silvering the atrium, "serene certainty"). Tone modulates subtly—Elara's tear at the smelted memory adds emotional texture—without breaking the meditative frame. The tone charges the final image of peaceful continuity. Coherent throughout (+1.2), modulates with pressure (+0.5), closure linkage (+0.8), but static mood without sharp turn (−0.7). A single serene register trends mid-band per guidance.</comment>
