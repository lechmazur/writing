<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is stated clearly and her diligent curiosity drives the sequence of observations. However, interiority remains thin—her discovery unfolds through puzzle-solving rather than internal contradiction or struggle. The final tears and "keeper of light" label feel asserted rather than earned through embodied emotion under pressure. No meaningful choice forecloses a path; she solves the puzzle and succeeds without visible cost or renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive early (airship, Elara, primary lamp dimmed). The causal chain is linear: observation → cross-reference → sequence → compartment → lamp → success. Closure is a Decisive Change (ship reanimated), but the cost is absent—no tradeoff, no path foreclosed, only triumph. The lens reads Causal with clean because/therefore links, but the final beat lacks the felt price required for high-band eligibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The airship setting is vivid (brass fittings, silk balloons, teak deck, hopscotch board) and the observatory window frames the starling murmuration effectively. The hopscotch board supplies the cipher and the crystal orb lives in a hidden compartment, so micro-setting does constrain the solution. However, the environment functions primarily as backdrop and puzzle-box rather than applying pressure that narrows Elara's choices; the discovery feels convenient rather than hard-won through spatial friction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restore the ship's aether-lamp—is signaled early and drives the sequence. Escalation is present (shadows → glyphs → sequence → compartment) but each step succeeds without friction or cost; no live option is foreclosed, no tradeoff made. The starlings and phrasebook arrive as clues rather than obstacles, so pressure never tightens into a choice with visible price. Agency is observation and execution, not decision under duress.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The theme of "listening to whispers" and honoring the past emerges, and "stranded luminance" recurs with metaphorical weight. Yet the final notation—"Discovery lies in reading the quiet maps left by kindred spirits"—is a thesis statement rather than a resonant image. The phrasebook dog-ear and hopscotch board function as puzzle pieces, not motifs that reweight meaning at closure. Subtext is minimal; the ending declares triumph without ambiguity or conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable and Elara's voice is distinct (cartographer's discipline, treasured phrasebook, whispered translations). Diction remains consistent with minor elevation ("sociable isolation," "resonant hum"). However, the perceptual signature is generic—she notices clues without bias or selective attention shaped by flaw. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested. The prose modulates smoothly but lacks the rhythmic control or elision that would elevate it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and most sentences advance action or description. However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "stranded luminance" is re-explained across paragraphs; "diligently curious" is restated as "Her diligently curious mind"; the final paragraph summarizes theme already shown. Template cadence is mild ("She would note… she sketched… she found…"). Figurative language ("living tapestry," "captive ember," "warm embrace") is workmanlike but not dense enough to obscure; the main issue is redundancy that softens momentum into the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The airship-with-lost-lamp premise is familiar steampunk/puzzle-quest territory. The starling murmuration as cipher is a fresh visual, but the hopscotch-board-as-key and hidden-compartment resolution follow template beats without transformation. Emotional arc is linear (isolation → discovery → triumph) and could transfer to any puzzle plot. No risk-taking in structure or perspective; the piece executes the prompt cleanly but offers no non-obvious synthesis or conceptual surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her curiosity drives the observation sequence. She appears in setup (map apprentice, vigil), development (cross-referencing charts, sketching shadows), and payoff (presses squares, slots the orb). However, her role is puzzle-solver rather than decision-maker under pressure; no choice alters tactics or forecloses a path. The trait is functional but her agency is execution, not conflict-driven choice with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The phrasebook appears early (setup: retrieved from satchel, dog-eared page 47), middle (development: verse in seven languages, marginalia cross-referenced), and ending (payoff: kinship with polyglot, matching symbols). It enables the cipher solution and carries thematic weight (kindred spirits across time). However, its meaning does not shift under pressure; it remains a static clue rather than an object whose cost or use evolves. Strong integration across beats but no reweighting at closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Stranded luminance" is named in paragraph one (dimmed lamp), reappears as the phrasebook verse, and is restored at closure (crystal orb, cascading light). It frames the central stake (restore the ship's heart) and the final image (luminance restored). However, it functions more as metaphor and goal than a concept that constrains tactics or forces a choice. Present in all three gates but more thematic echo than active pressure on options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Diligently curious" is stated twice (paragraph 6, paragraph 22) and shown through her cross-referencing and sketching. It appears in setup and development but does not constrain a choice with cost—there is no moment where her curiosity compels a tradeoff or risk. The trait is label-heavy and does not enable a visible friction. Functional but swappable with "methodical" or "observant" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The action "note" (and its verb forms: noting, notation) recurs throughout: she notes details (paragraph 18), sketches shadow sequences (paragraph 19), and adds a triumphant notation to her chart (paragraph 26). The final charting act bookends her identity as map apprentice and closes the arc. The verb is integral to her method and profession, and the final notation charges the theme. Present in development and payoff with clear causal role; however, the action itself is observational rather than a high-stakes turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The method is signaled early (paragraph 9: dusty hopscotch board, slanted sunbeam, starling shadows on squares 3/7/1) and its mechanics matter throughout: she sketches shadow sequences, observes dust in grooves revealing glyphs, cross-references glyphs with the phrasebook. The sequence 7-3-1 is pressed at the climax to open the compartment. The method is indispensable to the solution and shapes her attempts across multiple beats. Present in setup, development, and payoff with strong causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The antique airship is established in paragraph 1 (brass fittings, silk balloons, dormant core) and anchors the spatial world (hushed corridors, observatory window, teak deck, bridge). The ship provides the hopscotch board, the hidden compartment, and the aether-lamp housing. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop and puzzle-box; it does not pressure Elara's choices or supply resources she must work around. Micro-setting (hopscotch board) enables the cipher but does not alter tactics under friction. Present across all gates but more stage than crucible.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The starling murmuration is vivid and present throughout the discovery sequence: it frames the window view (paragraph 7), its shadows mark the hopscotch squares (paragraph 10), and it erupts in a joyous spiral when the ship awakens (paragraph 24). The timeframe is "this evening" with amber light and unfolding dusk. The murmurations shape the cipher directly and bookend the action. However, time does not tighten decisions—Elara works without a clock or deadline, so the timeframe is atmospheric rather than a forcing function. Present in setup and payoff; functional but not high-pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to chart the next great discovery" is stated in paragraph 5 and drives her cross-referencing and sketching. It appears in setup and is fulfilled at closure (triumphant notation, chart entry). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or costs; there is no friction between her goal and a competing need or fear. The motivation is functional but never tested under pressure. Swappable with "restore the ship" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Sociable isolation" is named in paragraph 4 (she cherishes it, conversing with ghostly echoes) and returns in paragraph 27 (deck now feels like a warm embrace). The tone modulates from solitary reverence to connection with the ship's history. However, the tone is more poetic label than lived friction; Elara is alone throughout without the tension between solitude and longing for presence. The phrase charges the theme but does not pressure a choice. Present in setup and payoff with coherent modulation but minimal stake-driven cost.</comment>
