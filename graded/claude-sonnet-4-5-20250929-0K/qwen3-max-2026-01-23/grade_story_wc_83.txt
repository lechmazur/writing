<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior grief and her methodical hunt are embodied through scarred fingers and the geode's tactile presence. The perturbation experiment and the vision of stolen possibilities feel concrete, though the leap to "understanding her survival" arrives without sufficient on-page contradiction or micro-choice friction. The final stance ("to carry this map within her") emerges more from realization than from a forfeiture that narrows options. Backstory (wedding strike, Liam's loss) anchors her present action but occupies ~25% without altering a present tactic until the vision itself.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Elara, floating observatory, grief-driven hunt) land by the opening lines. The piece accumulates pressure through the perturbation ritual, the vision of the pool, and the power-surge interruption, then closes on a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara pockets the geode and commits to "begin again," reweighting her survival from crater to canvas. Cost is felt ("bleak exhilaration," tears, trembling legs) but oblique—no on-page forfeiture of a live option. The circuit-breaker timeframe provides a ticking constraint that ends the trance but does not force a trade-off choice. Under the accumulative lens, the final cadence shift and image ("potential pools… in the courage to begin again") reconfigure meaning with visible emotional cost, meeting the closure gate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The floating observatory, viewport, Earth below, and geode are rendered with vivid, selective detail (scarred fingers, cold steel, amethyst heart, "silent ocean"). The geode's warming and humming charge the closure image and constrain the experiment's success. Spatial choreography is clear (viewport, hatch descent), and the setting's latent energy and dead main systems create purposeful pressure. No occupational depth is required at this length, and the micro-setting (geode as tool/anchor) shapes the final stance, qualifying for the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: discovering where unused potential pools. The perturbation experiment tightens pressure (bone-deep shift, vision of the pool), and the circuit-breaker deadline forces a reversal that dissolves the vision but leaves knowledge intact. Agency is present in Elara's mental nudge and her decision to pocket the geode and descend, though the peak moment is realization rather than a choice between competing goods. Cost is visible in tears, trembling, and the "bleak exhilaration," and the final stance forecloses dwelling in the past. Under the accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening (vision → knowledge etched into soul) suffices, though a sharper trade-off would reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—grief as lens to perceive unused potential, survival as witness rather than dwelling—emerges organically from the vision and Elara's final choice. The geode as resonator and the pool imagery recur with reweighted meaning at closure ("not a destination, but a lens"). "Bleak exhilaration" is embodied through contradictory feelings (soaring joy fused with crushing weight) and avoids platitudes. The final image ("courage to begin again") offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. No thematic echo or sermonizing in the last paragraph; the conceptual repricing (potential pools in the fragile now) lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with Elara's perceptual signature (grief, physicist's precision, tactile focus on the geode). Diction is elevated but consistent with her intellectual background. No dialogue appears. The phrase "intangibly tangible" and "bleak exhilaration" read as authorial rather than character-specific lexicon, creating brief register drift. Psychic distance tightens during the vision, then widens for the final reflection, both shifts purposeful. Free indirect style is clean, though the closure paragraph's syntactic rhythm ("The hunt was complete. She stood…") edges toward template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies across most beats, with vivid images (geode's rough exterior, Earth's wounded beauty, tears cutting clean paths). However, the final third accumulates paraphrase loops: "The unused potential was not a destination, but a lens" restates the prior realization without new pressure; "intangibly tangible" appears twice (para 11 and 33) as a phrase-stamp; and the closure run ("She pocketed… She descended… The observatory drifted…") uses template cadence (She [verb]… walking toward… ready to…). Figurative density is high ("silent ocean," "crater of the past," "canvas alive with echoes") but mostly coherent. Filter verbs ("she perceived," "she understood," "she looked") cluster in reflective beats without harming immediacy. The paraphrase and template issues in the final third trigger −0.6 and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—applying perturbation theory to hunt for pools of unused potential after a wedding drone strike—offers a fresh SF-grief synthesis. The geode as resonator and the floating observatory provide concrete anchoring. However, the core emotional arc (trauma survivor finds meaning through metaphysical vision, commits to begin again) follows a familiar template, and the "unused potential pools" concept, while vivid, arrives through vision rather than a choice-driven discovery. The "bleak exhilaration" tone and the geode's tactile recurrence add specificity, but the final stance ("courage to begin again") resolves toward uplift without a sharper, non-obvious moral calculus or trade-off. Transformation is present but moderate; swapping the physics metaphor for another metaphysical frame would leave the arc largely intact.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara (drone strike wedding survivor) drives every beat: she initiates the perturbation, experiences the vision, and decides to pocket the geode and descend. Her survivor identity anchors motivation and the final stance. Setup is immediate (opening line); middle involvement is strong (vision sequence); closure linkage is clear (pocketing the geode, descending to the world below). However, her choices are observation and commitment rather than a contested decision between competing goods; the vision arrives rather than being wrestled from competing tactics. Causal pressure is moderate; cost is felt but not a visible forfeiture of a live option. All three gates are met, but peak agency is realization-based, capping the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The geode appears in the opening line (scarred fingers tracing its exterior), is held and focused on during the perturbation, warms and hums in sympathetic resonance during the vision, is "inert yet transformed" post-vision, and is pocketed at closure ("its weight a comfort"). Setup, development (resonator function), and payoff (pocketed, "a key to an invisible world") are all present. It constrains the experiment's success (crystalline lattice attuned to frequencies) and charges the final image. Specificity is high (amethyst heart, salvaged from chapel rubble where Liam's ring glinted), and cost connection is visible (comfort against grief). Irreplaceability is strong; removing the geode would break the perturbation logic and the tactile closure beat.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Unfiltered awakening" is named explicitly in para 9 ("This was the unfiltered awakening: raw perception stripping away denial") but functions as a thematic label rather than a stake-shaping force. It describes the vision's effect but does not constrain tactics or alter options; the perturbation method and the geode do that work. Setup is present (para 9, mid-story), but no middle choice is gated by "unfiltered" versus "filtered" perception, and closure does not hinge on the concept's mechanics. The element reads as decorative gloss on the vision rather than a driver of pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Intangibly tangible" is introduced in para 11 ("It was intangibly tangible; she could not touch it, yet felt its cool depth") and reprised in para 33 ("the intangibly tangible truth: potential pools… in the courage to begin again"). Setup is mid-story (para 11, ~40% mark), limiting cap to 4.6 under the late-introduction rule. However, the attribute describes the pool's paradoxical nature and is echoed in the final realization, creating a purposeful lyric reprise that reweights the stake. Development involvement is thin (label-only in para 11, no middle choice gated by intangibility), but the final reprise charges the closure image with the same paradox. Under the lyric-resonance allowance, the score reaches mid-5s despite late arrival and lack of middle beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Hunt" is declared in para 3 ("She was hunting… for the answer"), frames the perturbation experiment (para 7: "focused her grief into a precise mental nudge"), and closes with "The hunt was complete" (para 24) after the vision. Setup, development (the perturbation and vision sequence), and payoff (hunt completion, knowledge etched) are all present. The action shapes the dominant stake and the vision beat, but the hunt itself is passive observation once the perturbation triggers; no mid-hunt tactical shift or contested choice occurs. Cost is felt (tears, trembling) but not tied to hunt-specific tradeoffs (e.g., risking harm to pursue the answer). Causal pressure is moderate; the hunt frames rather than redefines options.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Perturbation theory" is introduced in para 4 as Elara's method (applying it to reality itself, introducing minute disturbances), shown in para 7 (the mental nudge), and pays off in the vision and ripple description (para 10). Setup, development (the nudge and resulting shift), and closure participation (knowledge of the pool) are present. However, the mechanics remain abstract; no on-page detail explains how the nudge differs from meditation or why the geode's lattice matters beyond metaphor. The method is signaled and used, but its specifics do not constrain a choice or fail in a way that forces adaptation. Swappable with "focused meditation" or "psychic resonance" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The floating observatory provides spatial grounding (viewport, cold steel, hatch), the dead main systems and cooling circuit breakers create the window of silence necessary for the experiment, and Earth below serves as a visual anchor for Elara's grief. Setup is immediate; the timeframe (circuit breakers cooling) provides development pressure; closure involves descent through the hatch. The setting constrains the experiment (power must be off) and supplies the ticking clock (breakers will cool and power will surge back). However, the observatory's floating status and specific location do not shape tactics beyond providing isolation, and the "latent energy" is mentioned but not leveraged. Micro-setting (the geode, the viewport) does more work than the macro-setting. All three gates met, causal involvement moderate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The circuit-breaker timeframe is introduced in para 6 ("the main systems were dead; circuit breakers cooled in their housings, granting this fragile window of silence"), tracked in para 18 ("A sharp metallic click shattered the trance—the circuit breakers had cooled"), and closes the vision window when power surges back. Setup, development (the cooling period enables the experiment), and payoff (power returns, vision dissolves) are present. The timeframe tightens the experiment and provides a reversal beat, but Elara does not race against it or adjust tactics as time runs out; the power surge is a passive interruption rather than a choice-forcing deadline. The clock is live but does not alter moves, capping pressure contribution.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The motivation ("where does unused potential pool?") is declared in para 3, drives the perturbation experiment and the vision sequence, and is answered at closure ("potential pools… in the courage to begin again"). Setup is early; development spans the experiment and vision; closure directly addresses the question. The motivation is dramatized through Elara's scarred fingers, her grief-fueled nudge, and the tears and trembling at the vision's end. Friction is present between the desire to know and the "crushing weight" of the answer, and cost is felt (bleak exhilaration, the new purpose forecloses dwelling in the past). However, the motivation is pursued without a competing want that forces a trade-off; the hunt is unopposed until the power surge ends it. High integration with moderate friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Bleak exhilaration" is introduced in para 14 ("A bleak exhilaration flooded her—a soaring joy… fused inseparably with the crushing weight"), modulates through the vision (para 13: "every stolen possibility"; para 22: "tears cut clean paths"), and closes in para 30 ("The exhilaration remained, bleak as a winter dawn, yet it warmed her from within"). Setup is mid-story (~45% mark), limiting cap under the late-introduction rule, but the tone is embodied through contradictory feelings (joy/weight, trembling/unshakable spirit) and reprised at closure to charge the final image. The tone coheres across the vision and resolution beats, supporting the accumulative lens. Development involvement is strong (the vision sequence embodies the tone); closure linkage is explicit and reweights the stake. Despite late setup, the tone's causal role and closure charge push the score into the 7s.</comment>
