<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (to collect burdens) is clear and her task is legible, but interiority remains abstract—"flowing consciousness," "ancestral wisdom," and "whalebone reverie" label states rather than embodying contradictory impulses in scene. The childhood pebble memory adds compassion but arrives as exposition rather than friction that complicates a present choice. Her final solitude is asserted ("boundary-lessly trapped existence") without dramatized cost that forecloses a path. The weaving action demonstrates competence, but no blind spot or mistake creates genuine struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (layered atmosphere and weaving process build toward calcification). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines; no penalty. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: Elara honors her vow, maintains flexible compassion, and steps outside into renewal), but the cost is conceptual—stated in reflection ("refusing to calcify into cold detachment") rather than shown through a forfeited path or visible price on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when the anxiety calcifies, yet the scene reads more as ritual completion than a choice that narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The bronze grotto, starlight, kerosene lamp, and whalebone shuttle anchor setting and atmosphere with vivid sensory detail (metallic walls, cool floor, lamplight bending). The whalebone shuttle constrains the method (its curves guide the weave) and charges the final image of renewal. Spatial choreography is coherent and the damp earth provides a tangible close. However, the grotto functions more as backdrop than pressure; no environmental detail alters Elara's tactics or forces adaptation during the weaving.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: transform the merchant's anxiety into tangible weight. One meaningful tightening occurs when the anxiety resists and Elara adjusts the central thread, triggering calcification. Agency is present (the shuttle adjustment), but the resistance feels atmospheric rather than a live obstacle that forces a trade-off. The obsidian sculpture is the result, yet the cost—what Elara forfeits or endures to achieve it—is told in reflection ("her own solitude") rather than dramatized through a visible price paid in the weaving scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (bearing burdens, transformation, compassion vs. detachment) emerges through the weave's mechanics and the shelf of collected weights. The obsidian sculpture and the childhood pebble offer concrete particulars that avoid abstraction. However, the ending states the thematic answer—"by orienting properly her compassion… refusing to calcify"—rather than letting the damp earth and fading stars provide a non-literal reconfiguration. The final image whispers continuity but does not reweight prior material with a fresh tension or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV, third-person limited with stable distance. Voice is consistent and lyric—"shingled hush," "whalebone reverie"—but elevated diction ("boundary-lessly trapped," "granulating") occasionally drifts from embodied perception into abstract register during peak beats. No head-hopping. Perceptual signature (Elara's attention to thread angles, lamplight, ancestral memory) is selective and purposeful. Under pressure, the narration compresses into process description without losing internal texture, though some filter verbs ("she recalled," "she felt") dull immediacy when the weave intensifies.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high—"shingled hush," "boundary-lessly trapped anxiety," "calcify," "whalebone reverie," "granulating into faint, crystalline sparks"—across most sentences without a taught pattern or clear payoff, triggering overwriting concerns (−0.5). Register drift into elevated abstraction ("boundary-lessly," "permeation") at peak beats adds −0.3. Paraphrase loop: "The kerosene lamp burner provided… / The kerosene lamp burner flared… / The kerosene lamp burner guttered…" recycles the same anchor without new pressure (−0.2). Template cadence: "She began to weave… / She wove with increasing precision… / She placed it…" runs across multiple beats with parallel stems (−0.4). Total artifact debt ≈−1.4 in Q7; artifacts do not obscure closure but pervade the weaving sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The fractal-weaver premise and the alchemy of calcifying emotions offer a fresh synthesis. Whalebone shuttle, kerosene lamp, and bronze grotto are specific anchors rather than generic placeholders. However, the core arc (artisan performs ritual task, reflects on vocation, renews purpose) follows a familiar template without a non-obvious turn. Emotional specificity (the childhood pebble, the merchant's unnamed plea) adds texture, but the resolution—Elara steps outside, ready for the next soul—feels predictable and does not transform the premise through a bold choice or unexpected cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara (fractal weaver) is present throughout and her shuttle adjustment triggers the anxiety's calcification (middle beat) and she places the sculpture on the shelf (closure participation). Early signal, two distinct beats, closure linkage present. However, her choice is a technical adjustment within a ritual rather than a decision that narrows competing options or forecloses a path with visible cost. The role is essential to the premise but the character's agency does not create a key turn that redefines stakes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Kerosene lamp burner appears three times: provides warm light (setup), flares as the weave intensifies (middle beat), gutters low at dawn (closure scene). Meets the gate model (setup, development, closure participation) and is handled across beats. However, its role is atmospheric—it marks time and intensity—rather than constraining choice or supplying a resource that alters tactics. Late first appearance past opening paragraph, and easily swappable with any light source without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Shingled hush" is named in the opening and reappears in the final paragraphs ("the grotto settled deeper into the shingled hush"). Lyric reprise present, but the concept remains a label for layered silence rather than a mechanic that shapes stakes or tactics. It sets tone but does not constrain action or change options on the page. No middle development; the element is ornamental and does not participate causally in the weaving or closure choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Boundary-lessly trapped" describes the merchant's anxiety (early) and Elara's own existence (final third). Present in setup and closure scene, but no middle development. The attribute is told rather than dramatized—Elara does not face a choice where being "boundary-lessly trapped" enables or constrains an action with visible cost. The label adds thematic color but does not alter tactics or pay off in the weave mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Calcify" is the central action: Elara's task is to calcify anxiety, the process is described across multiple beats, and the obsidian sculpture (calcified weight) is the closure artifact. Early signal, beat involvement (adjustment triggers granulation, final sculpture placed on shelf), closure participation strong. The action is irreplaceable—removing "calcify" would collapse the story's logic. However, the mechanics remain abstract (adjustment of thread angle → calcification) without a visible tradeoff or cost that deepens the turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"By orienting properly" is signaled early (the master's teaching: "Orientation is empathy") and Elara adjusts the central thread's angle to mirror the burden's shape, triggering calcification (middle beat). Appears again in the final reflection ("by orienting properly her compassion"). Setup and closure participation present; middle development is functional. However, the method is a label for technique rather than a mechanic with visible cost—what does improper orientation risk? The thread adjustment works without friction, limiting causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Bronze grotto under starlight is anchored in the opening, provides spatial coherence (central dais, shelf of burdens), and the setting's cool floor and damp earth bookend the scene. Early signal, present across beats, closure participation (Elara steps outside, earth cools her feet). The grotto supplies the ritual space and the shelf where the sculpture is placed. However, the environment does not constrain choice or force adaptation—no spatial or resource pressure alters Elara's tactics. Postcard function elevated slightly by the shelf's role as repository.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"After the first snowmelt" anchors the opening and the damp earth at closure echoes the season, but no ticking clock or seasonal pressure tightens decisions. The timeframe sets atmosphere (renewal, transition) without constraining tactics or creating urgency. Dawn arrives passively ("dawn's pale light softened the starlight") rather than imposing a deadline. Present in setup and closure scene as backdrop; no middle development or causal role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To collect the weights of different burdens" is Elara's stated motivation (early signal), drives the weaving task (middle beats), and the sculpture joins the shelf of collected weights (closure participation). Setup, development, closure all present. The desire is clear and pursued on the page. However, the motivation is not conflicted—no friction between wanting to help and a personal cost or competing need. The vow is honored without dramatized tension, limiting the felt cost and reducing the motivation's causal pressure on choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Whalebone reverie" is named and described as a flowing consciousness state that guides Elara's hands (middle beat) and the whalebone shuttle is present throughout. The tone is lyric, contemplative, and coherent. However, the mood remains static—no modulation under pressure when the anxiety resists or when the weave locks into place. The reverie is a label for the working state rather than a tonal shift that charges the final image. Present across beats but does not escalate or deepen to support closure.</comment>
