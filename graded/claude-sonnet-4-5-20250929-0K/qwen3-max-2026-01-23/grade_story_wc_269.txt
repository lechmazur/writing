<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and embodied through the tapping practice, and her motivation—assembling ecological memory—drives consistent micro-choices at the console. The delayed-revelation turn (discovering her own failsafe) feels unmotivated: no prior cue suggests she would forget encoding a biometric key, and the shift from "drifting moored" passivity to renewed purpose arrives via convenient plot device rather than earned internal friction. The final transformation reads cleanly, but the causality gap at the pivotal beat prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a late Causal turn (the AI prompt). Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first paragraph. The closure unit—Elara's shift from mourning to cartography, "moored to purpose"—lands on the page, but the cost remains abstract: no tactical choice is foreclosed, no resource spent, only a tonal reconfiguration. The delayed-revelation mechanism (tapping unlocks a forgotten video) introduces a rule late without prior setup, weakening causality. The ending reweights grief into hope, qualifying as Resonant Reconfiguration, but the conceptual price ("some paths vanish") is told rather than dramatized with visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The monitoring station, console, and viewport anchor action throughout; the torn atlas page appears in three beats and charges the closure when overlaid with animated pathways. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "salt-stiffened joints," "turquoise water," "moon's shimmering path." The console's haptic surface constrains Elara's tapping practice, directly enabling the biometric unlock. Spatial choreography remains coherent across moves, and the setting's post-ban timeline subtly pressures her remembrance work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering why ecological pathways disappeared—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through Elara's tapping ritual and the appearance of the AI overlay, but escalation lacks a live choice under duress: the video unlocks automatically, and her shift to "cultivating remembrance" involves no visible tradeoff or foreclosed alternative. The final image reweights her solitary grief into archival purpose, a meaningful deepening, yet the protagonist's agency at closure is observational rather than decisional. One tightening (sacred rhythm → video reveal) narrows knowledge but not options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—memory as cartography, the living archive versus silence—emerges organically from the tapping practice and ecological imagery without overt statement. The final line ("periodically eternal moon watched over her work") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to why paths disappear: the rhythm sustains the path. Subtext operates in the atlas page's "tactile prayer" and the AI's prompt "Memory sustains the path," though the latter edges toward thematic echo. The piece resists tidy morals, embracing ambiguity in Elara's transformation from witness to keeper, and the ending charges prior material without summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; psychic distance modulates purposefully from close ("quiet, persistent ache") to distant lyric sweep ("periodically eternal"). Diction remains controlled: "skeletal structure of recycled polymer," "chemical whispers guiding coral larvae." The prose carries a distinct textural signature—elegiac, precise—and free indirect style is clean. One register slip: "Submersion was secondary; the silence was primary" reads as authorial thesis rather than Elara's voice. Elision of the failsafe's encoding is purposeful but unearned, slightly undermining POV modesty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "salt-stiffened joints" = setting, character state, world cost). Rhythm varies naturally, and sentence openings avoid template stems. Two frictions: "periodically eternal" recurs four times, drifting toward stock phrase; the phrase "drifting moored" toggles mechanically between states without evolving its charge. The AI display text ("Analysis: Paths disappeared due to ecological silence") reads expository, undercutting show-through at a peak beat. No loops or scaffold, but figurative density ("threads," "tapestry," "symphony," "stitches") clusters without pattern payoff in the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The tapping-as-biometric-key mechanic offers a fresh synthesis of grief ritual and ecological memory, and the "living archive of sound" premise avoids generic climate-fiction templates. However, the delayed-revelation trope (forgotten video failsafe) is widely used, and the transformation—mourning to remembrance—follows a predictable arc. The torn atlas page and moon imagery feel particular, but the ending's tonal shift (despair → hope) opts for emotional safety over harder calculus. Specificity in coral-bleaching detail and the monitoring station anchors freshness, yet the core turn lacks bold risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her witnessing frames the motivation. Her tapping decision at the harvest moon triggers the AI reveal, a key turn. However, most beats involve observation and memory rather than high-stakes choice under pressure. She shifts from passive monitoring to active archiving at closure, but the turn is enabled by the video prompt rather than her own tactical agency. Two-gate integration (setup, payoff) with modest causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The torn atlas page appears in three beats: tactile prayer (paragraph 7), AI overlay catalyst (paragraph 20), and closure echo (implicit in "living archive"). Its ragged edge and 1978 timestamp anchor loss concretely. The AI overlays it with nutrient flows and spawning grounds, reweighting it from mourning token to navigational truth. Swappability is low—another object would not carry the same cartographic and familial charge—but the page does not constrain a mid-story choice, only charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Delayed revelation—Elara's forgotten biometric failsafe—drives the central turn: her younger self's video unlocks the AI and reframes her tapping as cartography. The concept shapes stakes (why did she forget?) and alters her tactic from passive grief to active assembly. Introduced at midpoint and paid off immediately in the AI prompt, it redefines options and forecloses her prior drift. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage, though the setup is implicit (no earlier cue that she encoded the rhythm).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Periodically eternal" describes the moon in four beats, framing the story's cyclical imagery (moon's cycle, tide's pull, human memory). It constrains no on-page action but charges the final image: "The periodically eternal moon watched over her work." The attribute is ornamental until closure, where it reweights the theme of endurance. Lyric resonance without mechanical pressure; two-gate integration (setup, payoff) with thematic load but no tactical cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Assemble" appears explicitly in the AI prompt ("Continue assembly") and drives the final paragraphs: Elara assembles ecological memory through tapping, "stitches weaving past into present." The action redefines her work from monitoring loss to cultivating remembrance, a decisive shift. Her tapping becomes assembly across three beats (sacred rhythm, AI activation, final archive). Major turn traces directly to this verb; removing it would flatten the closure's cartographic logic. High irreplaceability and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Tapping rhythms appear in six beats: paragraph 9 (three quick taps system), paragraph 15 (sacred spawning rhythm unlocks video), paragraphs 26–28 (deliberate archive assembly). The practice enables the biometric key, constrains her grief management, and charges the closure ("her fingers tracing paths across time"). Mechanics matter: tap patterns encode ecological cues, and the method shapes her transformation from witness to keeper. Essential across beats and indispensable to ending logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The sea level monitoring station anchors all action and supplies the console, viewport, and AI tools. It pressures Elara's solitary work and frames the drowned-forest setting. The outpost's isolation reinforces "drifting moored," and the console surface enables the tapping unlock. However, the station's resources do not constrain a choice—Elara could perform similar work elsewhere—and its micro-details (polymer, steel) are descriptive rather than tactical. Three-gate integration with modest causal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Third decade after the global fossil fuel ban" anchors the world state and motivates the drowned villages, but the timeframe does not tighten on-page decisions. No clock pressures Elara's tapping or the AI reveal. The "twenty-two years prior" timestamp on the video log clarifies backstory but does not alter present tactics. Time is setting-level context, present but not tactical. Two-gate integration (setup, brief middle use) without escalation leverage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The motivation—"to discover why some paths disappear"—is stated in paragraph 6 and dramatized through Elara's tapping (encoding pathways), the AI analysis ("Paths disappeared due to ecological silence"), and her final shift to archival cartography. The desire drives her console work and the sacred-rhythm choice that unlocks the video. Friction between grief (loss) and agency (assembly) charges the ending. Strong causal role across three beats with visible cost at closure (foreclosing passive drift).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Drifting moored" is introduced in paragraph 12 and recurs in the final paragraph ("moored firmly to hope while drifting gently through grief"). Tone is coherent—elegiac, suspended—and modulates with the AI reveal: the drift transforms into moored purpose. The paradox charges the closure image, reweighting her earlier stasis. However, the tone is declared rather than enacted through rhythm or syntax shifts under pressure; the phrase toggles mechanically rather than evolving. Lyric reprise with modest tonal escalation.</comment>
