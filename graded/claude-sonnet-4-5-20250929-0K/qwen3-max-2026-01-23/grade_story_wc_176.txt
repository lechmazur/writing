<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—preserving forgotten names—is concrete and drives the sanctum sequence. Her technically gentle hands are shown in action (loosening braids, translating perforations), and the lost-wax-caster philosophy provides a character-particular lens. However, interiority leans on abstract phrases ("snowmelt ardor," "hard-won peace") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene, and the final emotional release ("tears traced warm paths") edges toward performed sentiment without complicating cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the rope-reconfiguration ritual accumulates pressure through patient detail until the aurora-triggered illumination reweights the sanctum's function. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the ice archive shifts from tomb to living repository) with conceptual cost legible in the final image—Elara becomes a keeper of echoes, her purpose redefined. Orientation anchors (sanctum, aurora, rope, punched card) arrive early. One deduction: the middle ritual beats feel more like procedural checklist than a meaningful tightening that narrows options or raises felt stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum, aurora, ceremonial rope, and punched card scrap function as micro-setting elements that constrain Elara's method and charge the ending. The aurora's light unlocking the crystalline matrix is a purposeful spatial-mechanical detail. Sensory work is vivid and selective ("whisper of fiber on fiber," "delicate chime of the first snowmelt drip"). Minor slip: the glacial setting occasionally reads as postcard catalog ("endless ice," "living light") without altering tactics mid-scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving forgotten names before silence becomes eternal—is signaled early and pursued with one meaningful deepening (the rope's final braid becomes a "permanent cipher"). The reconfiguration imposes tactile patience and forecloses alternate methods. Cost is conceptual rather than visceral: Elara's role shifts from bronze caster to keeper of echoes, a renunciation with felt weight. Under the Accumulative lens, this suffices, though no on-page reversal tests commitment; the ritual proceeds without complication or forced trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—memory preservation through craft, loss as precondition for permanence—emerges organically from the lost-wax philosophy and the rope-as-cipher conceit. The ending's image (names held safe in ice, Elara walking forward without looking back) offers a resonant answer to the central question without stating a moral. "Forgiveness had been the mold; her skill, the pour" risks thematic echo but stays concrete enough. One slip: "snowmelt ardor" recurs as a label rather than evolving through image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent perceptual signature (hands, pressure metaphors, caster vocabulary). Diction remains within Elara's register except for occasional elevated phrases ("confluent ardor," "sacred trust for the waking world") that drift slightly corporate-spiritual. Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the illumination beat. No head-hopping; the narrative stance holds. Minor template-cadence risk in the final third: several paragraphs open with "The sanctum / She / Each / The aurora" in sequence, creating mild rhythmic predictability.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean and rhythmically varied in the ritual center, with strong concrete nouns ("hemp fibers," "perforations," "braids"). Information density is high during the reconfiguration sequence. However, the final third accumulates minor loops: "snowmelt ardor" appears three times with near-identical framing; "technically gentle" recurs as a label without fresh action; and several lines paraphrase closure ("sound endured," "names safe," "promise kept") across adjacent beats. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase-loop density in the ending and stock metaphor strings ("liquid dawn," "living light"). No filter-verb stacks or register breaks touch the closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of lost-wax casting philosophy, street-organ punched cards, and ceremonial rope reconfiguration is inventive and specific. The piece commits to its premise and follows through with tactile detail. However, the emotional arc—forgiveness → preservation → keeper-of-echoes—tracks a familiar template (redemptive quest, artisan finds new purpose), and the aurora-as-deus-ex-machina illumination feels convenient rather than earned by prior constraint. Transformation is present but modest; swapping "rope" for "loom" or "bell" would leave the emotional beats largely intact.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's choice to reconfigure the rope creates the key turn; her hands translate the card's pattern, and the resolution (becoming keeper of echoes) grows from her action. Present in setup, middle, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The punched card scrap is handled in setup (held in palm), guides the rope reconfiguration in the middle, and its melody ("Anya") returns in the ice's whisper at closure. Evolving use with charged reprise.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Transcribed memory shapes the stakes (preserving sound) and the method (card → rope encoding). It appears in the opening premise and the ending's release of voices. However, the concept operates more as thematic frame than on-page tactical constraint during the ritual.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Technically gentle" is shown in action ("infinitesimal care," "reverence to the hemp fibers," "smoothing wax") and enables the delicate reconfiguration. Present in setup and middle beats. Cost is implied (patience versus urgency) but not foregrounded as a trade-off that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Illuminate" is the story's hinge: the reconfigured rope triggers golden light that unlocks the ice archive. The action redefines the sanctum's state and is causally essential to closure. Early framed, middle executed, ending paid off.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Reconfiguring the rope braids is signaled early, drives the middle sequence with visible mechanics (loosening, weaving pattern), and produces the illumination. The method is irreplaceable; swapping it would break the closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum provides the archive structure, the aurora supplies the unlocking energy, and the ice ceiling's crystalline matrix is mechanically essential. The setting pressures the method and charges the ending image. Micro-setting elements (rope arch, ice walls) constrain action.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After forgiving yourself" frames the opening emotional state and explains Elara's readiness to act. It seeds the "mold/pour" metaphor at closure. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions mid-scene; the ritual proceeds without urgency or a ticking constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The desire to preserve forgotten names is dramatized in Elara's ritual choices and in the ice's release of voices. It drives setup, middle, and closure. Friction between preserving sound and accepting her own prior erasure (shattered bell casting) is present but understated.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Snowmelt ardor"—gentle, persistent warmth—modulates coherently from opening motivation through patient ritual to the final emotional flood. The tone charges the ending's thaw imagery. However, it recurs as a fixed label rather than evolving through varied sensory anchors, limiting its dynamic range.</comment>
