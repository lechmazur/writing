<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—encrypting vulnerability as strength—is stated but not embodied in contradictory impulses under pressure. The dance moments feel ornamental rather than showing genuine internal conflict; when frustrated she dances and immediately gains clarity without visible struggle or cost. The final tear and smile read as labeled emotion rather than embodied contradiction. Interior voice relies on abstract metaphor ("loom weaving meaning," "silken thread") that distances rather than grounds her particular mind.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page: the buoy releases, carrying research and her message, and she accepts solitude with agency (Resonant Reconfiguration/Earned Stasis). Cost is present but muted—she remains trapped yet feels connected. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through decoder-dance cycles until the third-chime insight releases the buoy. Causality holds at the macro level (journal → dance → insight → valve turn → buoy), though the "listen" epiphany arrives conveniently after dice and dance without clear dramatized friction that the dance resolves.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The sunken lab is vividly anchored early (flooded lower level, air pocket, rusted consoles, pressure gauge). Spatial choreography is coherent and the gauge chime becomes a constraint that enables the climax. The valve, dice, and journal are handled on-page across beats. However, the setting mostly provides atmosphere; it pressures choice only at the valve moment. The "ocean's ancient pulse" final image recharges the lab as cradle rather than tomb, meeting the micro-setting standard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decrypt journal to send signal and escape isolation—is clear early. One meaningful tightening occurs: frustration → dice roll → dance → clarity → valve turn at third chime. Agency is present (she dances to solve, then acts), and the buoy release forecloses waiting passively. Cost is visible (she remains below, rescue now "inevitable" but not yet arrived). However, escalation is gentle; the puzzle yields after one cycle without a failed attempt or deepening price that narrows options before success.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme—vulnerability as strength, brokenness as liberation—is stated overtly in the journal's final line and Elara's internal narration rather than emerging from dramatized particulars. The dice shift from "chance" to "earned wisdom" via assertion, not scene work. The dance and encryption metaphors recur but remain abstract; no concrete choice costs her one value to gain another. The buoy image offers quiet closure, but the thematic answer is told: "To be seen in brokenness is the truest liberation."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent access to Elara's interiority. Perceptual signature leans toward elevated lyricism ("sediment settling in perpetual twilight," "silent poem of resilience") that feels authorial rather than character-particular—no evidence Elara thinks in such studied metaphor under stress. Diction remains poetic throughout without modulation for urgency. No dialogue present. Psychic distance is consistent but the voice reads as narrator-controlled rather than Elara's embodied mind.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high across most beats: "loom weaving meaning," "silken thread," "spider spins its web," "cradle of hope," "silent poem," "seismic gesture." Register drifts elevated ("lyrical code breaker," "mysterious familiarity," "seawater's ancient pulse") without grounding in Elara's lexicon. Paraphrase loops appear: "fear into action, vulnerability into strength" echoes "encrypt vulnerability as strength"; "quiet vow" / "calm defiance" / "quiet triumph" / "quiet rebellion" recycle the same idea. Template stems: "She was," "She had," "She danced," "She approached" stack without variation. Deductions: density without pattern-teaching −0.5, register drift −0.4, paraphrase loops −0.3, template cadence −0.4 = cumulative −1.6 applied once in Q7 per policy. Artifacts touch closure paragraph ("silent poem," "seismic gesture"), preventing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The premise—isolated scientist solves predecessor's cipher via interpretive dance to signal rescue—offers a fresh synthesis. However, execution leans on familiar beats: decoder finds journal, struggles, experiences epiphany, activates mechanism, feels bittersweet triumph. The dance-as-decryption method is specific but ornamental; she dances once, gains insight immediately, no failed attempts or trade-offs. Thorne remains a cipher whose despair is asserted, not shown. Emotional arc follows a template: frustration → clarity → calm acceptance. The "vulnerability as strength" frame is stated rather than discovered through surprising particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara (lyrical code breaker) is present throughout and makes the key choice to turn the valve at the third chime. Setup early, middle development via dance-insight cycle, payoff at valve turn. However, her choices are reactive—journal prompts, frustration triggers dance, clarity arrives, she acts—rather than creating reversals. The "code breaker" label is told; on-page she decodes one entry without visible method. One causal beat (valve turn) + closure participation + signal early, but limited agency and no visible cost tied to her character trait. Band ~4.8 for functional presence with minimal transformation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Hangman's dice appear in three beats: description on console (setup), rolled to "LISTEN" (middle), pocketed as "tokens of earned wisdom" (closure reprise). Setup early, middle enables insight, payoff via reprise. However, the dice function as prompt rather than constraint—rolling them delivers the answer without cost or trade-off. The runes are described but mechanics never matter; any insight trigger would substitute. Two touches + closure mention + early signal, but swappable and ornamental. Band ~5.3 for adequate recurrence without causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Calm defiance" is named repeatedly ("calm defiance against the crushing deep," "This calm defiance was her legacy," "quiet rebellion") but shown only in the final dance after success, not tested under pressure. It shapes tone and the ending stance (Earned Stasis: she remains below yet connected) but does not alter tactics or create a mid-scene choice. Present in closure image (she dances, smiles), but label-only in escalation. One beat (ending) + thematic echo, no middle constraint. Band ~4.9 for closure participation without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Explains through dance" is signaled early, used twice (frustration dance → clarity, final grateful spiral), and shapes the key turn (dance yields "listen" insight). Setup paragraph 7, middle development delivers solution, payoff in closure dance. Cost: she must pause decoding to embody the cipher, and the method is specific (spiral = recursion, gestures = dice). Two distinct beats + closure + early signal + enables tactic. However, the dance-insight link is asserted ("clarity bloomed") rather than shown as embodied discovery with friction. Band ~6.1 for two-beat causal involvement with minimal visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Liberate" drives the entire arc: she decrypts to free Thorne's research and her own survival message, culminating in the buoy release. Setup (motivation paragraph 5: "liberate research"), middle (decoding attempts), climax (buoy "carrying Thorne's liberated research"), closure ("the truth she had liberated"). Present in three beats, enables the ending choice, irreplaceable verb that frames the dominant stake. Causal pressure across escalation + closure linkage + cost (she remains below; liberation is partial). Band ~7.2 for essential multi-beat involvement and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Via coded journal entries" is the method: journal present on console (setup paragraph 4), today's entry quoted and wrestled with (middle beats), final decoded line echoes at closure. Three beats: description, active decoding ("The lock is in the listening"), thematic payoff ("To be seen in brokenness"). Mechanics matter minimally—water-stained pages, runes, cipher recursion mentioned but the actual decoding act is elided. Early signal + middle constraint (entry poses puzzle) + closure (decoded wisdom). Shapes attempts and ending insight. Band ~6.8 for sustained presence and causal role with thin mechanical specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sunken laboratory anchors who/where early (paragraphs 1–2: flooded lower level, air pocket, consoles, valve, gauge). Setting provides the pressure gauge (chimes hourly, third chime = key), valve (object of climax), emergency buoy (mechanism of liberation). Three beats: orientation, chime constraint enables solution, buoy launch. Micro-setting (gauge, valve) constrains the climactic choice and charges the final image (lab "once a tomb, now hummed with quiet triumph"). Irreplaceable: no other setting supplies these exact constraints. Band ~7.4 for essential multi-beat causal pressure and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"As a spider spins its web" appears once (paragraph 6: "Time unfolded precisely as a spider spins its web—patient, deliberate") as metaphor, not tracked constraint. No clock tightens decisions; elapsed time is vague ("today's entry," "hourly" chime mentioned but not counted on-page until climax). The spider image does not return or shape tactics. Setup metaphor only, no middle development, no closure participation. Ornamental. Band ~3.2 for single decorative mention without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"To encrypt vulnerability as strength" is stated as motivation (paragraph 5), recurs in thought ("She had encrypted her fear into action, vulnerability into unbreakable strength"), and frames the thematic closure. Setup early, thematic echo at ending, but no middle choice where she must trade vulnerability for strength or vice versa with visible cost. The motivation is told and mirrored in theme, not tested in conflicting wants. Two touches (statement + closure reflection) + early signal, but no friction or on-page price. Band ~5.7 for presence in setup and closure without dramatized conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Mysterious familiarity" is named once near the end ("she felt a mysterious familiarity—the rhythm of her breath syncing with the ocean's ancient pulse") and echoed in the tone of recursive images (dice, dance, web, pulse). Tone is lyric-somber throughout with minor modulation (frustration → clarity → gratitude). No middle development; the phrase arrives late to label an existing effect. Setup absent, development absent, closure mention only. Late appearance (~85% through) + ornamental label + no causal work. Cap 4.6 for late introduction. Band ~4.6 for single late mention without tonal constraint.</comment>
