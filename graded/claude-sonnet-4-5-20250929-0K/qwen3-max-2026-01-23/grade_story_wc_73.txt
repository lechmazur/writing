<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and specific—capturing the sensory texture of a missed moment—and her "grim optimist" stance is illustrated through decades of proof-writing. However, interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("profound ache of her silence") and label-speak ("quiet courage of remembrance") in the final third, reducing embodied emotion at peak beats. The change from isolation to "gentle peace" is told rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Internal conflict is summarized across time rather than dramatized within pressure moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: repetitive climbing, proof-etching, and dice-rolling build density toward the rupture climax. The rupture offers Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the texture floods in, she absorbs it, and the staircase transforms from prison to sanctuary with visible emotional cost ("despair had dissolved into purpose"). Orientation is clear early. The closure lands on the page, though the cost reads more emotional than material, and the final third's abstract phrasing ("Each equation was a tribute") slightly dilutes the concrete charge of the rupture moment itself.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The infinite staircase is vivid and persistent: pearlescent haze, cool worn stone, steps vanishing into light and shadow. Spatial anchors remain stable throughout. The staircase constrains all movement (boundless confinement) and the etched proofs form a recurring micro-setting element. The chipped die, handled across multiple beats, charges the final image ("catching the light / Perfectly imperfect"). The setting functions as both physical constraint and thematic canvas, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment must constrain choice or charge the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capturing the texture of regret through mathematical proof—is signaled early and tightens through decades of etching, culminating in "The Rupture Theorem" at t=0. The rupture itself is a meaningful turn that reweights her relationship to the staircase. However, escalation is told across "decades measured in footsteps" rather than dramatized in scene; the climax ("final limit symbol") arrives without visible obstacles or tactical choices within the text's present action. Cost is legible (she remains on the staircase) but felt rather than materially paid in the closure beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—memory as reclamation, imperfection as grace—emerges organically from the chipped die, the rupture, and the transformation from prison to sanctuary. The final image ("Perfectly imperfect. True.") reweights prior material without overt moralizing. However, the closing paragraphs approach label-territory with lines like "quiet courage of remembrance" and "testament," nudging toward abstraction. The rupture offers a non-literal answer to the central question (can regret be mathematically captured?) but the extended coda slightly dilutes the resonance by restating theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout, filtered through Elara's technical and introspective idiom. Diction suits a mathematician's perceptual signature ("infinitesimal moment," "perpetual motion paradox"). However, peak stress moments rely on elevated abstractions ("communion across time," "sacred constant") that drift from embodied perception into philosophical voice. The final third's syntactic parallelism ("Each symbol a star. Each step a breath.") reads purposeful but borders on template cadence. No head-hopping; focalization is controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies initially, but the final third employs heavy parallelism and fragment chains ("Each equation was a tribute. She carried the texture. It was imperfect, tender, entirely hers. The dice shifted.") that create a drumbeat effect. Multiple paraphrase loops appear: "boundless confinement no longer felt like punishment but a sanctuary" is restated conceptually three times in the closing. Stock metaphors ("proofs bloomed across the stone like constellations") and scaffold phrasing ("The chipped die was no longer... It was...") reduce density. Clarity remains high, but information density drops in the extended coda.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of infinite-staircase purgatory, mathematical proof as emotional instrument, and the chipped die as rupture-catalyst is specific and non-obvious. The rupture that validates rather than liberates avoids the obvious escape trope. However, the "solve regret through logic" frame echoes familiar redemption-through-craft templates, and the piece leans on prompt-furnished elements (grim optimist, balancedly daring, perpetual motion) without fully transforming them into lived detail. The ending's abstraction ("She was finally, wholly, free") undercuts the boldness of staying confined.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her "grim optimist" stance is illustrated through proof-writing and continued climbing. She makes the key choice to absorb the rupture moment rather than step through, altering her stance from seeking escape to seeking understanding. However, the trait functions more as thematic label than tactical constraint—her optimism is told across decades rather than tested in a single pressure point. She appears in setup, middle proof-writing, and the rupture beat (all three gates), and her final choice reweights the staircase, meeting the two-of-three threshold solidly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The chipped die is introduced early (pocket, artifact of rupture), handled ritually before each proof (middle beat), and appears in the final image ("landed tilted, catching the light / Perfectly imperfect"). It evolves from reminder of failure to "compass" pointing toward grace, reweighting its symbolic meaning at closure. The object constrains her method (she rolls them before proofs) and charges the ending. All three gates met; causal pressure moderate (ritual tool) and closure linkage strong (final image). Irreplaceable due to the chip from Kael's toss.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Perpetual motion is framed as the staircase's paradox and fuels her theoretical work ("The Rupture Theorem" treats the staircase as perpetual motion fueled by regret). It shapes her method (mathematical approach) and is present in setup, middle proofs, and the ending realization that the climb continues. However, it functions more as thematic backdrop than tactical constraint—the perpetual quality is static description rather than a problem she solves or leverages. Two-of-three gates (setup, payoff) with middle development weak; moderate closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Balancedly daring" is declared twice in exposition ("Boundless confinement defined her existence—a paradox she met with balancedly daring resolve" and "Balancedly daring, she wove audacious theorems...") but functions as label rather than lived trait. No on-page moment where balance and daring conflict or trade off; her proof-writing is methodical without visible risk or tactical cost tied to this specific attribute. Present in setup and thematically claimed at climax, but no middle beat where the trait enables or constrains a choice. Ornamental use; swappable with "methodical" or "persistent."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The rupture is the climax: her final proof tears reality open, flooding textures of the missed moment. She chooses to absorb rather than step through, fundamentally redefining her stance toward the staircase. The rupture is seeded (she seeks to "fracture reality's fabric"), executed on-page ("the air tore open"), and transforms the resolution. Removing it collapses the story's logic. All three gates met with strong causal pressure and closure linkage. The action is irreplaceable and carries visible cost (she remains, but transformed).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mathematical proofs are her method throughout: she etches calculus, topology, temporal loop theorems, and "The Rupture Theorem" across decades. The method is signaled early (first third), shapes her middle attempts (proof-writing as pressure response), and the final proof triggers the rupture. However, the mechanics remain abstract—no on-page proof content or logical struggle; "defining t=0" and "final limit symbol" are gestural. The method enables the climax but is told rather than shown at the granular level. All three gates met; moderate causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The infinite staircase is immediate ("Elara climbed"), persistent (all action occurs there), and constrains every choice: no escape, repetition forces ritual, boundlessness becomes sanctuary. It pressures her method (etching proofs on risers) and charges the final image ("she climbed, balanced between memory and motion"). The setting is irreplaceable—removing it breaks the story's logic and tone. All three gates met with strong causal pressure and closure integration. Micro-setting (body in motion, stone underfoot) and macro (infinite loop) both function.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Her desire to "capture the precise sensory texture of the missed opportunity" is the story's engine: she recalls the cottage lamplight and Kael's question in the first third, pursues it through decades of proof-etching (middle), and achieves verification at the rupture ("rough-hewn table grain... pine smoke... his hopeful eyes"). The motivation is specific, dramatized through her proof-work, and drives the climax. Visible cost: fidelity over freedom. All three gates met; strong causal pressure and closure linkage. The motive is irreplaceable and forecloses the escape path.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Boundless confinement" is established early (vast space yielding no progress) and modulates through the rupture: initially punishment, then sanctuary. The paradox charges the final image ("in the boundless confinement, she was finally, wholly, free"). Tone is coherent and purposeful, supporting the accumulative lens. However, the extended lyric coda slightly flattens the oxymoron into abstract celebration rather than maintaining tension. Present in setup, developed through proof-writing, and reweighted at closure. All three gates; strong closure linkage.</comment>
