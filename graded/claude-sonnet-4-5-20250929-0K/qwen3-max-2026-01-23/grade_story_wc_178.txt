<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Enlil's motivation is clear and sustained—sealing a covenant through mathematical alignment—but his interior life dissolves into abstract devotion rather than embodied contradiction. The "frugal" trait appears only as lamp-oil measurement and never constrains a meaningful choice under pressure. Emotional states are declared ("warmth flowed," "silent affirmation") rather than dramatically earned through on-page micro-choices that reveal conflicting impulses. The final transformation reads as assertion: "his skepticism had been the very path to grace" lacks the credible struggle or visible cost that would make renunciation or endurance feel earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and remain stable. The dominant stake—aligning the tile to reveal the hidden star chart—drives toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (internal homecoming), but the closure unit lacks visible cost: the tile glows, warmth flows, and Enlil feels "answered" without forfeiting an alternate path or paying a dramatized price. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (twenty years of preparation, patient overlay, final alignment), yet the ending delivers emotional affirmation without the reweighting of prior material or cadence shift that would charge the image. "A permanent map of belonging" is told, not shown through tactical change or constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ziggurat observatory, cedar table, and clay tile are anchored with selective sensory detail (dust-scented air, grooves worn smooth). The tile's physical presence—positioned, rotated, cradled—constrains the ritual action at closure, satisfying the micro-setting test. However, spatial choreography remains vague (where is Polaris relative to the nexus? how does rotating clay cause charcoal to glow?) and the palace "suspended between regimes" functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than a pressure that alters Enlil's choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (align tile to uncloak resonance) is signaled early but escalation is minimal: Enlil rotates the tile "with infinitesimal care" and alignment clicks into place without obstacle, trade-off, or failed attempt. The "twenty years" of preparation occur off-page; on-page action is a single rotation that succeeds immediately. No reversal or tightening narrows options, and the cost is purely affirmative (warmth, recognition, covenant sealed) rather than a visible forfeiture or endurance that forecloses a path. Pressure remains static from setup to resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The thematic question—can rigorous intellect court transcendent connection?—emerges from particulars (magic square, schematic star positions, empirical skepticism). The ending image (warm tile, glowing schematics, "dusky harmony") attempts a non-literal answer, but the payoff is undercut by direct thematic statement: "his skepticism had been the very path to grace; rigor had unlocked reverence." The phrase "encrypted devotion" recurs as a label rather than accumulating pressure through contradictory choices. The conceptual repricing (alignment over supplication) reads as summary rather than resonant discovery earned through on-page friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single-POV third-person limited remains stable with clean focalization. Perceptual signature is present (frugal precision, schematic thinking) but the elevated register ("poised anticipation," "silent symphony," "perpetual dawn sealed within his soul") clashes with the astronomer's practical idiom established early (measuring lamp oil, tracing reed stylus). No dialogue. Filter verbs ("felt," "understood," "knowing") cluster in the final third without immediacy under peak pressure. Distance control is consistent but the voice lacks texture variation across emotional beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Severe overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "dusky harmony—indigo sky bleeding into amber horizon," "silent symphony of numbers, light, and answered seeking," "perpetual dawn sealed within his soul." Mixed metaphors abound ("suspended silence mirror his own poised anticipation," "warmth flowed...recognition"). Paraphrase loops recur: three sentences (~para 20–22) restate "covenant sealed through alignment" without advancing pressure. Template cadence: "He would continue...he smiled...he whispered" in the final third. Stock phrases ("weathered face," "soft counterpoint") and synonym churn ("encrypted devotion" ×5, "dusky harmony" ×3) dull momentum. Register drift into abstract diction ("ontological," "empirically ironic") violates the practical astronomer's lexicon. Cumulative artifact debt: −1.4 in Q7, disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of Babylonian astronomy, magic square as star chart, and mathematical faith offers modest freshness, but the "skeptic finds grace through rigor" template is widely used and transformed only at surface level (clay tile, cuneiform) without deeper moral calculus or lived friction. The magic-square-as-constellation reveal arrives as convenience rather than earned discovery. The ending's risk-averse affirmation ("a homecoming written in numbers," "to seek with sincerity is to be found") opts for safety over bold stakes. Transformation test: swap "Babylonian astronomer" for "medieval monk with sacred geometry" and the arc remains unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Enlil's frugality (lamp oil measurement) is mentioned twice but never constrains a choice or creates tension; it functions as decorative trait rather than driver of turns. He observes, positions, and rotates the tile without opposition or cost, making his agency passive. Late summary ("his frugal vigil had been the key") claims causality not demonstrated on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The tile appears in setup (described), middle (positioned at nexus, rotated), and closure (emits luminescence, cradled warm). It shapes two beats (alignment action, final embrace) and its transformation (cold clay → pulsing warmth) reweights prior material. However, the tile's mechanics remain abstract (why does rotation cause glow?) and cost is absent—it solves without complication. Scores in the "essential across beats" band but lacks indispensability due to swappability (any ritual object could serve the same function with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Encrypted devotion" is named five times but functions as thematic label rather than stake-shaping force. It does not constrain tactics or create on-page friction; Enlil's devotion is declared ("reverence for the unknown woven into sums") but never tested by competing desire or price. The concept echoes in theme without altering choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Empirically ironic" is declared twice ("empirically ironic core," "empirically ironic truth") but never dramatized as a trait that constrains or enables action. No on-page moment shows skepticism blocking a step or rigor costing him an alternate path. Label-only mention without visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Uncloak" is the climactic action: Enlil rotates the tile to reveal the constellation. It appears in setup (goal stated), executed at the turn (rotation + glow), and named in closure ("uncloaking had not revealed..."). The action drives the story's lone reversal (hidden → revealed). However, it is easily swappable (any ritual gesture—chant, gesture, alignment—could serve), and the mechanics remain vague (what exactly uncloaks?). Scores mid-band for shaping the turn without irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Schematic representations" are signaled early (reed stylus, damp clay tablets, star positions as geometric diagrams), shape middle beats (matching Jupiter's azimuth, Venus's descent to numerals), and return at closure (charcoal lines glow, "glowed behind his lids"). The method enables the alignment tactic and its charged reprise ("permanent map") reweights prior labor. Cost is absent—schematics succeed without error or sacrifice. Scores solidly for three-gate presence and closure linkage but lacks the felt price needed for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The palace and ziggurat are established early with selective detail (mudbrick, glazed-brick constellations, dust-scented night air) and the "between regimes" frame recurs in closure. However, setting does not constrain Enlil's choice or alter tactics; it provides atmospheric backdrop. The observatory's spatial layout remains vague (how does tile position relate to Polaris?). Functional but replaceable—any isolated ritual space would serve.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Between regimes" is named in the opening and closing paragraphs but does not tighten decisions or create urgency. No live clock or regime-change pressure affects Enlil's twenty-year vigil or the alignment action. The timeframe is ornamental context rather than a force that shapes tactics or forecloses options.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation ("to seal a covenant with the unknown") is stated early, sustained through the alignment ritual, and fulfilled at closure. However, it is never dramatized as conflicted desire: no competing want (safety, recognition, doubt) tests Enlil's commitment or exacts a visible cost. The covenant is received as pure affirmation without friction between devotion and price. Functional but one-note.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Dusky harmony" is named four times, anchoring tone in the opening (dusk deepens), middle (indigo/amber sky), and closure (settled deep within). Tone modulates subtly from anticipation to fulfillment, and the phrase charges the final image ("dusky harmony...resonant truth"). However, the tone remains static—reverent and meditative throughout—without sharp contrast or pressure-driven shift. A purposeful early–final reprise with modest reweighting, scoring mid-band.</comment>
