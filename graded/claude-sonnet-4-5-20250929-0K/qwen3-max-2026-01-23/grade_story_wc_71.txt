<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior world is rendered through observations rather than micro-choices under pressure; she moves as a witness who documents rather than an agent who acts with visible stakes. The "hushed blaze of understanding" and "tears traced warm paths" label emotional states without embodied contradiction or cost that forecloses options. The motivation to understand why houses feel alive remains abstract and contemplative, never tested by a dilemma that would reveal hierarchy of values. Interiority relies on elevated diction ("sanctifying spaces through displaced objects") that reads more like thesis than character-specific thought under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the orris root placement, the hush descends, and Elara's perception deepens to see the cottage's displaced objects as sacred archive. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (understanding that "aliveness was not in the structure, but in the love displaced and placed") with conceptual cost felt in the shift from search to witness. However, the cost is declared rather than dramatized—no on-page forfeiture of a prior path or tactic. The single beat (kneeling, placing shard, perceiving archive) constitutes the one meaningful deepening required at this length, but the "instantly" transition and the catalogue of objects (sea-glass, crayon drawing, jay's feather) arrive as exposition rather than discoveries that narrow her options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The bay, cottage, and streetlights are anchored early with sensory specificity (damp cobblestones, cedar shingles silvered by salt, amber streaks of sunset). The orris root shard functions as micro-setting object that constrains the central choice: Elara must place it with intention to test her theory. The spring twilight setting and the cottage's garden gate provide spatial coherence, and the final image's "streetlights continued their gentle daydream" recharges the opening motif with accumulated meaning. Reaches mid-7s because the object-as-setting constrains the protagonist's method and the environment charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why some houses feel alive—is signaled early but remains contemplative rather than urgent. The single on-page action (placing the shard) produces immediate revelation without complication or resistance; "instantly" a hush descends and the answer appears fully formed. No tightening of options occurs because Elara faces no competing desire, external obstacle, or internal friction; her theory is confirmed rather than tested. The comparison to newer houses with "purchased, not carried" objects provides thematic contrast but no causal pressure on Elara's present choice. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening is sufficient, but the absence of visible cost or foreclosed path keeps this in mid-5s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the accumulation of displaced objects (sea-glass, crayon drawing, jay's feather) as vessels of intentional love, and the orris root shard's placement enacts rather than states the concept. The final realization—"aliveness was not in the structure, but in the love displaced and placed"—edges toward direct thesis but is grounded in prior imagery. The contrast between Fisher cottage and newer houses with "purchased, not carried" objects sharpens the thematic question without false balance. The "hushed blaze" and "quiet mystery" motifs recur with accumulated meaning. However, the inadvertently profound truth "settled in her bones" declares insight rather than letting the closing image speak, and "each object a quiet, deliberate prayer" borders on overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout ("solidified silence," "the fierce tenderness of care as sacred act") which remains consistent but drifts from embodied perception into abstract register during peak beats. Perceptual signature is present in Elara's attention to "subtle shifts others never saw," but the texture flattens under pressure into thesis-like declarations. The orris root's "powdery violet scent rising faintly against the bay's damp breath" demonstrates sensory filtering, and "the streetlights' daydream deepened" sustains a coherent metaphor across the piece. However, the phrase "inadvertently profound truth settled in her bones" and "the alchemy by which a displaced seashell holds an ocean of memory" read as narrator-assisted insight rather than character-constrained thought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Significant density of figurative language in most sentences without pattern-teaching triggers overwriting concern: "boots whispered," "streetlights flickered...daydreaming of daylight," "the bay's breath kissed the garden gate," "threads of memory," "heartbeat," "testament," "sanctuary," "prayer," "alchemy," "seeds in fertile soil"—the metaphoric load is heavy and some vehicles contradict (streetlights cannot both "daydream of daylight" and serve as "guardians of the hush"). Template cadence appears in parallel structure: "The water lay still...the air carried...the streetlights flickered." Paraphrase loops: "a quiet blaze of intentional love" and "hushed blaze of understanding" restate the same concept. The scaffold phrase "not as a solution, but as a question" and the thesis-summary final paragraphs ("She understood now: aliveness was not in the structure...") slow momentum. Information density is moderate; many sentences do double duty, but the closure paragraphs recycle the insight across multiple restatements. No major causality breaks, so artifacts remain here.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The premise—objects carried with intention sanctify spaces—offers a contemplative angle but executes as a thesis demonstration rather than dramatic discovery. The "creeping normality noticer" observing which houses feel alive has potential freshness, but the resolution confirms her theory without complication or surprise. The orris root shard as "solidified silence" is a specific object choice, yet its function (placed to "draw forth a home's unspoken voice") follows New Age/animism templates without transformation through obstacle or cost. The contrast between Fisher cottage and newer houses gestures toward critique of consumerism but remains surface-level. Emotional specificity is present in Elara's patient documentation over two springs, but the final revelation arrives as expected and the closing image reiterates rather than reweights.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The "creeping normality noticer" trait frames Elara's observational method and her two-spring documentation signals early setup. In the middle beat, her noticing enables the identification of the cottage's displaced objects (sea-glass, crayon drawing, jay's feather) as pattern. At closure, her role shifts from searcher to witness, which is a stance change. However, her choice to place the shard is presented as a predetermined ritual ("part of her method") rather than a decision under competing pressures. The observation enables thematic insight but does not constrain a dilemma or incur visible cost. Present across all three gates with causal linkage to the ending, but the trait operates more as lens than as constraint on choice—places it in functional mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The orris root shard appears early (first third) as "solidified silence" with specific sensory detail (brittle fragment, faded blue linen, powdery violet scent). In the middle beat, Elara unwraps and places it with intention, enacting her method. At closure, it becomes "part of this living archive" and its absence in her pocket is noted as "a new presence...a shard of hush carried within her heart," reweighting the object as internalized compass. The shard's unique property (Tuscan origin, concentrated quiet) matters to the sanctification logic. It drives two distinct beats (unwrapping/placement and the resulting hush/revelation) and shapes the final image. Specific cost is conceptual (her quest transforms from search to witness) rather than material. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff with irreplaceable specificity places it in mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "shard of hush" concept is introduced early as the orris root's metaphoric property ("solidified silence"). In the middle beat, placing the shard produces "a profound hush...not an absence of sound, but a thick, velvety presence" that enables Elara's expanded perception of the cottage's archive. At closure, the shard's hush is internalized ("a permanent shard of hush carried within her heart"). The concept shapes the method (silence as medium for revelation) and alters Elara's stance from seeker to witness. However, the hush does not constrain tactics or create friction; it functions as atmospheric catalyst rather than as pressure. The lyric reprise (introduced early, returned at closure with reweighted meaning) qualifies for low-6s under the lyric-resonance allowance, but the lack of causal constraint or cost tied to the concept itself keeps it from higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Inadvertently profound" is declared as attribute in the phrase "the inadvertently profound truth settled in her bones" near closure. It appears only as label without prior setup or middle development. The trait does not constrain an earlier action or enable a choice with visible cost; instead, it describes the quality of her final insight. No evidence that Elara's profundity is unintentional or that the "inadvertent" nature creates friction or surprise. Label-only mention in the final third without causal work places it in ornamental low-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Sanctify" is signaled early as Elara's method ("sanctifying spaces through displaced objects") and enacted in the middle beat when she places the orris root shard "as a question" that produces the hush and revelation. At closure, the shard "sanctif[ies] not just the soil, but her own lifelong quest," and the final paragraphs return to sanctification as the core alchemy. The action is specific to the story's logic (displacement + intention = aliveness) and drives the single major turn (placement → hush → understanding). Removing "sanctify" would require reframing the entire spiritual/ritual dimension. Present across all three gates, causally essential to the revelation, and irreplaceable within the story's metaphysics. Strong integration across beats and closure with specificity elevates it to mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The method "through displaced objects" is signaled early as Elara's belief system and documented in the cottage's prior changes (sea-glass wind chime last May, smooth stone this week). In the middle beat, the orris root shard is explicitly "an item carried far from its origin" to "awaken a place's hidden spirit when placed with intention." At closure, the cottage is revealed as "a living tapestry woven with displaced objects" (sea-worn glass, crayon drawing, jay's feather), each "carried from elsewhere and placed with love." The method's mechanics (displacement + intentional placement = sanctification) structure the entire narrative logic and the final understanding. Removing this method would collapse the story's causal spine. Present across setup, development, and payoff with high irreplaceability and causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "quiet bay in spring" is established early with sensory detail (damp cobblestones, cherry blossoms, polished slate water, blooming lilacs, twilight). The bay's stillness and the cottage's position "where the bay's breath kissed the garden gate" provide spatial coherence. At closure, "the bay sighed around her, cradling the sleeping village." However, the setting does not constrain Elara's choice or supply a resource that alters tactics; the placement of the shard could occur in any contemplative locale. The bay functions as atmospheric frame rather than as pressure or obstacle. Present across beginning and ending with purposeful sensory layering but without causal constraint on the central action, placing it in mid-5s under the lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "while the streetlights daydream" is signaled in the opening ("the streetlights flickered on with a soft hum...daydreaming of daylight") and returns at closure ("The streetlights continued their gentle daydream"). However, the streetlights' "daydream" is metaphoric mood rather than a time constraint that tightens decisions. No ticking clock or temporal pressure; Elara moves with "patience" and the action unfolds in a single contemplative beat. The timeframe does not narrow options or alter tactics. The lyric reprise (streetlights as bookends) charges the final image but does not function as live constraint. Present in setup and payoff but without causal pressure on choices, placing it in low-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to understand why some houses feel alive" is signaled early ("This quiet vigilance fueled her deepest motivation") and frames Elara's two-spring documentation of the Fisher cottage. In the middle beat, her desire drives the placement of the orris root shard "not as a solution, but as a question." At closure, her motivation transforms from "search for answers" to "commitment to witness the sacred ordinary." The desire is dramatized through repeated observation and the ritual placement, and the shift from seeker to witness constitutes a stance change with conceptual cost (forfeiture of the quest frame). However, the motivation is never conflicted or tested by competing wants; no internal friction or external obstacle challenges her commitment. Present across all three gates with clear arc from search to witness, but the lack of friction or visible trade-off keeps it from higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The tone "hushed blaze" is embodied early through contrasts: "the water lay still as polished slate" paired with "cherry blossoms into a blush of pink," "the patience of a creeping normality noticer" alongside "deepest motivation," "quiet vigilance" fueling understanding. In the middle beat, the hush descends as "a profound...velvety presence" and Elara experiences "a hushed blaze of understanding—the fierce tenderness of care as sacred act." At closure, the tone resolves to "quiet blaze of intentional love" and "a permanent shard of hush carried within her heart." The tone modulates from twilight observation to mystical revelation to internalized peace, charging the final image. However, the direct naming of "hushed blaze" in the text verges on self-labeling. Present across beats with coherent modulation and closure charge; the specificity and consistency support mid-6s.</comment>
