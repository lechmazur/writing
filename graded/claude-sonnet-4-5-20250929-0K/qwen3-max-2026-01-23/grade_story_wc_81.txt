<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—verifying whether the Charter erases the Deep-Singers—but her execution reads as competent puzzle-solving without meaningful internal friction or cost. The character demonstrates observational skill ("tranquilly perceptive" label recurs) but no contradictory impulses act simultaneously; she moves from hypothesis to confirmation in a steady line. The final "quiet victory" and "chest tight" are asserted emotions rather than embodied struggle. Micro-choices exist (using the blank stamp end, not the carved face) but they feel like methodical steps rather than decisions that foreclose live alternatives or reveal competing values under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece layers sensory detail and archival clues toward a final reconfiguration. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening paragraph. Closure occurs on-page: Elara stamps both the hidden sigil and the margin, creating a "permanent testament" that honors silenced truth—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant). However, the cost remains abstract; the "chest tight with quiet victory" and the claim that "the truth was now anchored" assert stakes rather than dramatizing a forfeited path or visible price. The accumulation of clues is coherent, but the final image doesn't reweight prior material with undeniable pressure—the library "no longer forgotten" reads as thematic claim rather than a concrete shift in Elara's options or the world's state.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sunken-city library is vividly rendered with selective detail: coral-veined stone, bioluminescent anemones, mother-of-pearl mosaic, salt and vellum scent. Sensory selection reflects Elara's archival focus (ink chemistry, fiber weave, watermark angles). The vault's spatial choreography remains clear, and the environment supplies the antique stamp, the Charter, and the blackout context. The blackout as constraint is signaled but not pressed—power returning at the end creates no urgency because "she felt no urgency." The setting charges the final image when "the dappled light from the ceiling anemones brightened as if in acknowledgment," but this moment leans symbolic rather than materially constraining choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clearly signaled: verify the Charter's authenticity and recover the Deep-Singer truth. One tightening occurs when marginalia ink and fiber weave reveal dissonance, forcing Elara to "readjust her entire approach" and use the stamp's blank end instead of the carved face. This reversal narrows her method but doesn't foreclose a competing want or impose visible cost—she achieves her goal without trading anything away. The resolution is protagonist-driven but reads as procedural success rather than a choice under competing pressures. No live alternative (e.g., preserving institutional authority vs. truth) is dramatized and rejected on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—truth vs. erasure, the recovery of silenced voices—emerges organically from the Charter investigation and the Deep-Singer sigil reveal. Subtext operates in the palimpsest metaphor and the dual stamping (lie and truth witnessed together). The final image of the library "no longer forgotten—it was remembered" and the tendril "like a blessing" gesture toward resonance but tip toward overt symbolic statement rather than an image that reweights prior material non-literally. The piece resists false equivalence (the Charter is a lie; the Deep-Singers were erased) but doesn't complicate the binary—Elara's discovery is unambiguous validation, and no counterpressure tests her interpretation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single-POV third-person limited with stable focalization through Elara. Diction is elevated and controlled ("dappled resolve," "tranquilly perceptive," "reclaimed stillness") but leans toward template phrasing—these exact phrases recur without evolution, and "dappled" appears five times across light, resolve, and the final reprise, bordering on motif-by-label. Filter verbs ("she noted," "she felt") are present but voice-motivated for an archival mindset. Psychic distance is consistent; perceptual signature reflects her indexer focus (ink chemistry, fiber weave). Under peak stress (the reveal), diction remains ornate ("wave of dappled resolve") rather than compressing to match urgency, creating mild register drift from embodied pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is clear and grammatically clean with varied sentence structure and strong sensory specificity (leviathan bone, seagrass-and-coral watermark). Information density is high in the investigation beats. However, paraphrase loops appear: "She had not altered history; she had restored a silenced voice" / "no longer forgotten—it was remembered" restate the closure concept without added pressure. The phrase "dappled resolve" recurs in paragraph 2, 20, and 28 without reweighting; "tranquilly perceptive" appears in paragraphs 4, 10, and as "tranquilly perceptive observation" in 23, reading as template anchors. Stock metaphor: "quiet fire" (motivation) and "stones themselves seeming to exhale" (pathetic fallacy) in peak beats. Cumulative pattern artifacts total approximately −0.8 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The sunken-city archive and palimpsest-Charter premise offer atmospheric specificity, and the dual-stamping closure (blank impression honoring the hidden sigil, carved face witnessing both) is a purposeful twist. However, the core arc—scholar discovers suppressed truth and restores it—follows a familiar template without transformation through moral calculus or lived cost. The Deep-Singer erasure is revealed but not complicated; Elara's method (alternative hypothesis, watermark check, stamp use) reads as competent procedure rather than risky synthesis. The "logical page indexer" and "tranquilly perceptive" labels anchor character more than choice-driven particulars. Proximity check: "quiet fire" and "forgotten syllables" are near-stock.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's "logical page indexer" role frames her method (formulating alternative hypotheses, checking watermarks, using the stamp) across three beats: initial approach, discovering the dissonance, and the dual stamping. Her choices create the investigation's key turns, but the logic proceeds without friction—she's competent and correct at each step, with no live alternative decision dramatized. The archival skill constrains method but doesn't impose visible cost. Present in setup, middle, and closure; drives beats but replaceable archetype (any truth-seeking archivist).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The antique ink stamp appears in four beats: withdrawal from satchel (paragraph 6), description of its dual faces (carved sigil vs. blank handle), the decision to use the blank end (paragraph 18), and the final dual stamping (paragraphs 19-20). Its unique properties—carved face bonds only to pre-Submersion paper; blank end can leave impressions—enable the closure action (honoring hidden truth + witnessing the lie). The stamp is causally necessary: without it, Elara cannot verify or mark the Charter. Specificity and irreplaceability are high; closure linkage is direct. Cost connection is present but mild—using the stamp resolves the problem without trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Reclaimed stillness" is introduced in paragraph 1 (blackout allows it to rise) and reprised in paragraphs 21 (transforms from passive to active) and 26 (remains, now woven with truth). It frames the atmospheric condition that enables Elara's focus but doesn't constrain a choice or alter tactics—she would investigate with or without the quiet. The concept functions as tone and thematic echo rather than causal pressure. Lyric reprise reweights the stake mildly (stillness now affirms truth), but removal wouldn't break the plot.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Tranquilly perceptive" appears as a label in paragraphs 4, 10, and 23 ("tranquilly perceptive observation"). It describes Elara's observational style (noticing dissonance in ink, fiber weave, watermark) but doesn't constrain or enable a discrete action with cost—any careful observer could perform the same steps. The trait is present across beats but functions as descriptor rather than driver; swappable with "meticulous" or "patient" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Readjust" appears twice: in paragraph 11 ("forced her to readjust her entire approach") when the dissonance is revealed, and in paragraph 18 ("readjusted the antique ink stamp in her palm") to use the blank end. The first instance is the investigation's key reversal—Elara shifts from surface verification to uncovering the palimpsest—and the second is a tactical micro-turn that shapes the dual stamping. Both uses are causally tied to major beats and the closure. The action is specific to the investigation and not easily swappable, though the concept "readjust" itself is mid-specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Alternative hypothesis" is introduced in paragraph 5 ("Her method demanded she formulate an alternative hypothesis: what if the Charter was not a founding document but a rewritten treaty of surrender?") and validated in paragraph 17 ("Her alternative hypothesis solidified into truth"). It shapes Elara's investigative frame—prompting her to look beneath the surface text—and the payoff (palimpsest discovery) directly answers the hypothesis. The method is signaled early and its mechanics (questioning the official narrative) guide attempts. However, the hypothesis functions as investigative mindset rather than a tool with unique properties; a synonym like "working theory" would serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The forgotten library inside a sunken city anchors all action across setup (paragraph 1), the vault investigation (paragraphs 7-20), and the exit (paragraphs 25-27). The blackout removes power (enabling stillness), the vault supplies the Charter and lectern, and the bioluminescent anemones provide the "dappled light" crucial for revealing the watermark (paragraph 12). Spatial detail (mother-of-pearl mosaic, coral-veined stone) grounds choreography. The setting pressures choices mildly—the blackout creates opportunity, the vault restricts access—but most constraints are atmospheric rather than tactical. Removal would strip the story's core staging and thematic resonance (submerged truth, reclaimed stillness).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The blackout is introduced in paragraph 1 ("scheduled blackout settled") and ends in paragraph 22 ("distant thrum of returning power"), framing the investigation window. The timeframe creates the opportunity (geothermal hum ceases, stillness rises) but doesn't tighten decisions—Elara explicitly "felt no urgency" when power returns. The clock is present in setup and closure but functions as atmospheric bracket rather than live constraint that alters tactics. If the blackout were replaced with "after-hours access," the plot would proceed unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—"to verify whether the celebrated Founders' Charter documented true inception or deliberate erasure of the indigenous Deep-Singers"—is stated in paragraph 3 and frames every beat: hypothesis formulation, stamp preparation, vault entry, Charter inspection, and dual stamping. The desire is clear and consistent, driving all on-page choices. However, it is never conflicted or tested against a competing want (e.g., institutional loyalty, career risk, fear of consequences). The investigation succeeds without friction, and the final "quiet victory" fulfills the motivation without visible cost. Dramatized through action across all beats; present in closure; but lacks friction between want and price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Dappled resolve" appears in paragraphs 4 ("dappled resolve of the chamber"), 13 ("holding the page at a precise angle to the dappled light"), 20 ("A wave of dappled resolve filled her"), and 24 ("The dappled light from the ceiling anemones brightened"). The phrase anchors tone—calm, purposeful, light-dappled perception—across setup, investigation, and closure. It modulates mildly (from chamber quality to internal state to closure affirmation) and charges the final image when the anemones brighten "as if in acknowledgment." However, "dappled" as repeated descriptor trends toward motif-by-label, and the tone remains static (tranquil purpose) without inflection under pressure. Coherent and present at closure, but single-mood rather than dynamically charged.</comment>
