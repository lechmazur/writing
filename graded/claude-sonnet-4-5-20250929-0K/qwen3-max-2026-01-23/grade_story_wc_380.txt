<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (finding deleted memories via Lyra's disappearance) is clear and emotionally grounded through the locket and pressed wildflowers. Her method of interpreting coffee grounds and navigating the chamber shows purposeful action under pressure. However, interiority leans toward poetic summary rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene; the resolution feels delivered by the world's mechanics (salt yielding, gravity stilling) rather than earned through a difficult choice with visible cost. The sister's memory floods her senses but no present-moment trade-off or renunciation forecloses a path on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Closure occurs on the page: Elara exhumes Lyra's memory, experiences its return, and seals the wildflowers in the geode, achieving a Resonant Reconfiguration (the chamber's gravity stills, the harbor's silence transforms). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through setting details, the whale's symbolic tear, and the salt chamber's prismatic imagery, culminating in a cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake. Cost is implied (decades of absence, tears, the act of sealing the flowers) but not shown as a present-moment forfeiture or trade-off that narrows future options. The narrative holds a single POV across two spatial shards (harbor to chamber) within one contiguous window, meeting Track A defaults.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The salt crystal chamber is vividly rendered with specific sensory detail (moonlight fracturing through the dome, prismatic shards, fluctuating gravity) and directly constrains Elara's navigation ("one step lifted her weightlessly while the next pinned her with crushing force"). The geode at the chamber's heart is the physical anchor for the memory's exhumation, charging the final image when the salt flows "like liquid glass" to seal the wildflowers. Spatial choreography is clear throughout both harbor and chamber settings. The body and the recurring object (wildflowers) function as micro-setting elements that shape the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering where deleted memories go and reclaiming Lyra's farewell—is signaled early and sustained throughout. Pressure accumulates through Elara's journey (coffee-ground divination, climbing the cliffs, navigating gravity fluctuations) and tightens when she reaches the geode and must "pour her longing into the salt." The resolution is a meaningful deepening (the memory restored, the chamber's gravity stilled) with emotional cost (tears, decades of absence). However, the final turn is more world-response than protagonist agency; the salt softens "beneath her touch" and the gravity stills "instantly" without a visible trade-off or difficult renunciation on Elara's part.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the premise: memories are not lost but hidden, waiting for courage and love to call them home. The pressed wildflowers, the salt chamber, and the whale's beaching form a coherent symbolic structure without overt moralizing. The final image (Elara descending with the "gleaming silence within her soul," the lanterns forming a golden path) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. However, the closing paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("her true work was tending memory's fragile, enduring light") rather than letting the scene imagery alone carry the weight, and the wildflowers' recurrence feels somewhat token rather than continually reweighted through choices.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited throughout, with no head-hopping. Voice carries a consistent lyric-elevated register ("colossal shadow," "gleaming silence," "forests of salt crystals") that matches the story's tone. Perceptual signature is present (Elara's sailor's intuition, the coffee-ground map "etched in her mind") though somewhat generic. Purposeful compression and poetic diction are pattern-taught and sustained. However, the prose leans toward uniform poetic elevation without modulation under peak stress; the climactic exhumation beat maintains the same lyric distance as the opening harbor scene, reducing immediacy when pressure should spike.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence structure and vivid imagery ("salt flowed like liquid glass," "star-dusted sky"). Information density is high; nearly every line advances setting, character, or atmosphere. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "gleaming silence" recurs four times across the story without meaningful reweighting; "pressed wildflowers" are described redundantly in adjacent beats; and the closing two paragraphs restate the same thematic point (memories reclaimed, silence transformed, light tended). Template cadence runs in the chamber sequence ("She navigated... her eyes fixed... Her purpose burned"). These artifacts dull momentum at closure and prevent higher scoring. Apply −0.8 for loops and template stems (Q7 only, per non-closure accumulation cap).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The core premise—deleted memories stored in physical locations, retrieved through divination and deliberate exhumation—offers a fresh speculative angle. The salt crystal chamber with fluctuating gravity is a specific, non-generic setting. However, the emotional arc (lost sister, grief, memory restored) follows a familiar template without a transformative twist; the resolution delivers satisfaction without surprise or moral complexity. The coffee-ground method and the wildflowers function more as atmospheric tokens than causally irreplaceable elements. The whale's beaching, while evocative, remains decorative rather than integrated into the plot's mechanics or closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara appears in setup, development (interprets coffee grounds, climbs to chamber, navigates gravity, exhumes memory), and closure (seals wildflowers, descends). Her occupation as lantern lighter frames the opening and closing but does not constrain choices in the chamber sequence. Her decisions (following the coffee-ground map, placing wildflowers in the hollow) shape two beats and contribute to the ending's charge. However, the climactic turn (salt yielding, gravity stilling) is triggered by her touch and longing rather than a difficult trade-off or renunciation, reducing causal pressure. Swapping her occupation would not break the story's core logic. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, minus swappability −0.6 = ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Pressed wildflowers appear in setup (locket contents, anchor to memory), development (fragile forms haunting Elara), and closure (placed into the geode hollow, sealed by salt). They drive the motivation and charge the final image with visible cost (permanent entombment). However, they remain largely symbolic rather than operationally constraining; Elara could pursue the same quest without them with minor edits. Their reweighted meaning at closure (physical anchor for reclaimed memory, "gleaming tomb of remembrance") is strong but the object itself does not alter tactics mid-journey. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, cost connection +0.4, minus ornamental middle use −0.5 = ~7.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Pockets of gravity appear in the chamber sequence as a physical obstacle ("one step lifted her weightlessly while the next pinned her with crushing force") and resolve at closure when "the fluctuating gravity stilled." They constrain one beat (Elara's navigation) with embodied difficulty. However, they do not shape tactics beyond requiring "a sailor's intuition" and are not signaled until the chamber arrival (~120 words in). The concept's resolution (gravity stills instantly) feels convenient rather than earned through Elara's agency. The phrase "pockets of gravity" echoes the title/theme but the mechanics remain decorative. Late signal −0.4, one beat +0.4, closure mention +0.4, swappability −0.5 = ~4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Fluctuation (mysteriously) characterizes the gravity but does not enable or constrain choices beyond the single navigation beat. The mysterious quality is asserted ("a legacy of unstable geology") but not explored or leveraged. It functions as a label-only trait without visible trade-offs. One beat +0.4, closure mention +0.3, minus label-only −0.6, ornamental −0.5 = ~3.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Exhume appears in setup (Elara's purpose "to exhume the specific memory"), development (she "gently exhume[s] the buried moment... with pure intention"), and closure (the memory floods her senses). The action defines the climactic beat and could not be easily swapped. However, the exhumation itself is passive—salt yields beneath her touch without a difficult physical or moral cost on her part; "pure intention" and whispering Lyra's name suffice. The action matters structurally but lacks the embodied struggle or trade-off that would make it indispensable. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.4, minus passive execution −0.6, cost gap −0.4 = ~6.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Coffee grounds method appears in setup (passed down through generations, silent language) and development (swirled, upended, spiral pointing toward cliffs). It shapes one key turn (directs Elara to the chamber) and is signaled early. However, its mechanics are ornamental; the divination could be replaced by a map, a dream, or direct knowledge with minor edits. The method does not constrain attempts or return at closure. Early signal +0.6, one beat +0.4, causal pressure +0.5, swappability −0.7 = ~5.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Salt crystal growing chamber appears in development (coffee grounds point to it) and closure (the memory is exhumed there, wildflowers sealed, gravity stills). The setting provides the geode that enables the exhumation and supplies the visual/tactile imagery ("salt flowed like liquid glass") that charges the final image. Its unique properties (crystals, fluctuating gravity, the geode's luminescence) are irreplaceable. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.7, causal pressure +1.2 = ~7.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the whale beaches" brackets the story (whale at dawn, hauled away by next dawn) but does not tighten decisions or tactics. Elara's actions unfold across one afternoon/evening without time pressure; she could perform the same quest on any day. The whale functions as a symbolic catalyst ("a tear in the world's fabric") rather than a live clock. Setup present +0.3, closure mention +0.3, ornamental −0.7, no urgency −0.5 = ~3.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Motivation to find where deleted memories go is signaled early, dramatized through the locket/wildflowers, and drives all of Elara's choices (divination, journey, exhumation). It converges with the personal stake (Lyra's farewell) and is paid off at closure when the memory is restored and sealed. However, the motivation is more told than conflicted; Elara never doubts, hesitates, or faces friction between her want and another cost. The quest proceeds linearly without internal contradiction or competing desires. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.4, cost connection +0.5, minus no friction −0.8, told-heavy −0.4 = ~6.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Gleaming silence is coherent throughout: the harbor "wrapped in gleaming silence," the chamber's "profound, gleaming silence," the gravity's "silent storm," Elara carrying "the chamber's gleaming silence within her soul," and the harbor's "gentle resonance." Tone modulates subtly from the opening's mournful hush to the closing's transformed quiet. It charges the final image and recurs with reweighted meaning. However, the phrase is repeated verbatim four times without variation, edging toward ornamental rather than functional recurrence. The tone remains static rather than modulating sharply under peak stress. Setup +0.6, closure linkage +1.4, recurrence +0.8, minus repetition without variation −0.6, static under pressure −0.5 = ~6.6.</comment>
