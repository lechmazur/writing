<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to map silence is clearly established and her obsessive focus drives the stylus work forward. However, the piece offers primarily observation and execution without genuine internal conflict or a constraining choice with visible cost. The trait "mildly obsessed" is invoked but never complicates a decision or forecloses an option. The ending delivers completion rather than a renunciation or transformation earned by prior contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres around intensifying density—gravel settling, meltwater drip, wolf cry—building toward the completed map as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Orientation anchors arrive promptly (ridge fort, storm aftermath, oracle at work). The closure unit lands on the page with conceptual cost (the map as testament, warm weight against heart), and the lens holds without contradiction. One meaningful deepening (the cartography itself) is sufficient at this length, though the cost remains felt rather than a visible forfeiture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Spatial choreography is coherent (ridge, ramparts, courtyard, barracks, watchtower) and sensory detail is vivid and selective. The fort and its post-storm stillness supply atmosphere and constrain Elara's work to the precise timeframe when one star remains. However, the environment does not materially alter a choice or tactic; it provides backdrop rather than shaping the map's creation or its final charge. The booklet and stylus function more as tools than as micro-setting that reconfigures stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—to chart the night's emotional terrain through silence—is signaled early and pursued throughout. Pressure remains coherent under the Accumulative lens as Elara layers silence upon silence. Yet there is no on-page reversal, tightening choice, or live tradeoff that narrows options or imposes a visible price. The task proceeds without complication; coincidence does not intrude, but neither does agency force a difficult turn. One meaningful deepening is present (the act of inscription itself), but the cost is implied warmth rather than a felt forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the cartography of absence: silence as healing truth, the psychological weight of the endless watch. The final image (map as timeless key, warm weight against heart) offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the contrast between storm's fury and ambered hush, and the booklet's flaking gold symbolizes lost sound without becoming token ornament. The piece resists tidy resolution and invites reflection on darkness and quiet's power, though the oracle's success leans toward affirmation without counter-pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single POV is stable throughout; distance and focalization remain consistent. Diction is elevated and lyric ("ambered hush," "marbled hush," "crystalline fragments"), controlled and purposeful, though occasionally the register climbs into decorative territory ("pinpoint of stillness feeling like a celestial promise"). Perceptual signature is clear: Elara notices sound-absences and silence-layers in a profession-specific way. No head-hopping, and the narrative stance modulates appropriately as the work progresses. Sentence rhythm varies and supports the contemplative tone without lapsing into template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and rhythmically controlled, with varied sentence openings and vivid concrete detail. However, figurative density is high throughout ("bruised and weeping sky," "granite ramparts clawed," "salt-bleached," "diamond pinned to fading velvet," "fossilized within the calm," "dense tapestry," "silver-threaded hush") without pattern-teaching or clear payoff tied to a causal beat. Paraphrase loops appear: "ambered hush" is defined, then re-explained as "silence so absolute it felt encased in golden resin," then restated as "dense tapestry woven from absent wind." The final third repeats "marbled hush" and "ambered hush" without new pressure. Overwriting in peak beats triggers −0.5; paraphrase loops add −0.4; combined artifacts total approximately −0.9 within Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—mapping silence rather than stars—offers a fresh angle on cartography and the oracle trope. The booklet's flaking gold as deliberate void is a specific, non-obvious choice. Emotional specificity (the fort's collective sigh, sentinels' solace) grounds the elevated register. However, the story proceeds along a predictable arc (establish task → execute task → complete task) without a surprising turn or risk that heightens stakes. The oracle succeeds without friction, and the conceptual integrity, while coherent, does not challenge the reader's expectations or subvert the frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her role as oracle frames the entire action. However, her choices are limited to selecting a shard of obsidian, closing her eyes, and descending with the stylus—execution rather than decision under competing pressures. The map-making itself is her doing, but no key turn or tactic shift traces to a choice she makes; she completes her task without complication. Present in setup, development, and closure, but her agency does not create a reversal or narrow options with visible cost. Swappability is moderate; another reflective character could perform similar contemplative work.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The flaking gold leaf booklet is handled across multiple beats: unfastened from the belt, opened to pristine gold leaf, filled page after page, and finally closed and secured. Its cover sheds fragments that become deliberate voids symbolizing lost sound—evolving use that ties directly to the map's logic. Early signal (first paragraph), beat involvement (≥3 touches), closure linkage (secured at dawn as the map's container), and specificity (flaking property matters) all strengthen integration. The booklet is indispensable to the cartography premise. Cost connection is conceptual (fragments as voids) rather than a visible tradeoff, preventing entry to the 8.5+ band.</question>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "ambered hush" is defined early and recurs throughout as the oracle's ink, compass, and truth. It shapes the map's content (what she inscribes) and charges the final image ("captured, preserved within the gold"). However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics under stress; Elara never faces friction from the silence itself. The concept functions more as thematic motif than causal force. Early signal, development as descriptive anchor, and closure reprise grant eligibility near 6.0, but lack of on-page pressure or cost tied to the concept keeps it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The attribute "mildly obsessed" is mentioned twice: as "quiet fixation" and later as lending "unwavering precision" and "calm, deep focus." It informs her sustained attention but never constrains or complicates a beat with visible cost. The obsession does not force a tradeoff, generate error, or foreclose an option. Label-only use across setup and development; no closure participation beyond the general mood of accomplishment. Swappable with "dedicated" or "focused" without altering structure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The action "retell the storm's saga" is signaled early ("Her action was to retell the storm's saga") and operationalized through the map-making beats. Each inscription (line, dots, spiral, barracks silence, lone star) is an instance of retelling. The method structures the middle and delivers the completed map at closure. However, the act of retelling does not create a turn or narrow options; it proceeds smoothly without complication. Present across setup, development, and closure, but the major "turn" is completion rather than transformation. Not easily swappable (the story is built on this action), yet its execution lacks on-page friction or cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The method "by summarizing silence" is established early ("her method was to summarize silence—the voids between thunderclaps") and operationalized in the middle beats (minute dots, intricate spiral, profound silence of barracks). It shapes the map's mechanics and reappears at closure ("retold the night not with words of sound, but by summarizing its profound and healing silence"). Early signal, beat involvement (≥2), and closure reprise support integration. Yet the method does not impose a visible constraint or cost; Elara never struggles with how to summarize silence or faces a failure that forces tactical adjustment. Lyric reprise without mid-scene friction places it in the 6.0–6.5 range.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The storm-tossed ridge fort is anchored immediately and provides spatial grounding throughout (ramparts, courtyard, barracks, watchtower, hearth, stone steps). The setting supplies atmosphere and post-storm conditions that occasion the map-making. However, the fort does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it is backdrop rather than constraint. Early signal, continuous presence, and closure participation (Elara descends the steps) grant eligibility near 6.0, but lack of tactical impact or cost tied to the location prevents a higher score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "when only one star remains in a dimming sky" is established early ("precise timeframe when only one star remained visible") and reprised at closure ("worked until the lone star began to pale against the approaching dawn"). It bounds the map-making session and creates a mild urgency (the window is closing). However, the clock does not visibly tighten a decision or force a tradeoff; Elara completes her task before dawn without complication. Early signal and closure participation support mid-band placement, but lack of on-page pressure or tactical adjustment tied to the timeframe keeps it below 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to draw a map of the endless night" is stated early ("Her motivation burned with clarity") and drives every beat of the map-making. The desire is operationalized through the stylus work and culminates in the completed booklet ("entire soul of the endless night"). Early signal, beat involvement, and closure linkage are strong. Yet the motivation is never conflicted or tested by a competing want or cost; Elara pursues it without friction, hesitation, or sacrifice. No on-page moment where desire clashes with fear, resource limit, or moral calculus. Swappability is low (the story is built on this goal), but lack of dramatized friction caps the score in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tone "marbled hush" is established early ("prevailing tone of her work was a marbled hush") and woven throughout the piece via diction, pacing, and imagery ("silence streaked with veins of fear, resilience, memory, and fragile hope"). The tone modulates subtly as Elara layers different silences and intensifies at closure ("marbled hush of her accomplishment a warm weight"). Coherent through all turns and charged at the final image. However, the tone itself does not constrain a choice or create on-page friction; it is maintained atmosphere rather than causal force. Strong integration across beats and ending, but lack of tactical cost or pressure tied to the tone keeps it below the 7.0 threshold.</comment>
