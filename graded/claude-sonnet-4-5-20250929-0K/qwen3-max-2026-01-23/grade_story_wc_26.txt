<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("to preserve the shape of hope") is clear and her shift from guardian-against-change to witness feels earned through the archive discovery. However, her interiority leans heavily on abstract emotional labels—"luminous regret," "sacred motivation"—rather than embodied contradiction. The river stone serves as concrete anchor, but her transformation proceeds through exposition rather than micro-choices under live pressure. Internal conflict remains more told than enacted in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara's archive review deepens understanding, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (her acceptance of evolution as preservation). Closure lands on the page with felt cost—she surrenders her belief in stasis and the stone metamorphoses, reweighting her role. Orientation is clean by the opening lines. The weak point: the shadow's seven-dusk observation occurs off-page, and the climactic discovery unfolds through summary ("Over silent decades of footage, she witnessed...") rather than dramatized beats, blunting immediacy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The blooming library is vividly rendered—"archways of woven light," "dream-vines," "breath[ing]" shelves—and setting details (the archive nook, console screens, the stone's warmth) anchor choices. The river stone and the archive footage constrain Elara's method and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear; no impossible positions. The setting's organic architecture supports the metamorphosis theme without slipping into postcard catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving hope's shape versus allowing its evolution—is signaled early and tightens through Elara's archive work. However, escalation is passive: she observes footage rather than making tactical choices that narrow options under live resistance. The shadow's "gentle catalyst" nature is discovered, not confronted, so the reversal lacks agency-driven pressure. The cost (surrendering her belief in stasis) is legible but arrives through realization rather than a decision that forecloses a path with immediate consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (hope requires evolution, not stasis) emerges organically from the river stone's crystalline veins and the shadow's collaborative role. The piece avoids moralizing until the final third, where lines like "beauty requires contrast, and hope must change to remain vital" edge toward thesis statement. The stone's lesson is delivered through image (internal radiance, silver veins) but the surrounding prose explains rather than trusts the reader. Subtext operates in the shadow's patient journey; the ending reweights prior material with earned wisdom, though the last paragraphs risk redundancy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable; perceptual signature ("sharp-eyed dusk noticer") is character-specific. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated register—"luminous regret," "sacred necessity," "bittersweet understanding"—that feels authorial rather than Elara's natural idiom under stress. Psychic distance wavers: the narrator alternates between close ("With a breath of surrender") and expository ("Her role transformed; she was no longer..."). Filter verbs ("she saw," "she witnessed") stack in the archive sequence without voice motivation, dulling immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose clarity is generally high, but repetitive scaffold mars momentum: "luminous regret" appears three times, "softly deliberate" twice, "shape of hope" recurs without accumulation. Template cadence in the final third ("Her luminous regret..."; "She finally understood..."; "She would notice...") flattens propulsion. Mixed metaphors: "wave of luminous regret" blends liquid and light without coherent vehicle. Information density is moderate; several sentences paraphrase ("The shadow was not an invader but a gentle catalyst urging..." followed by "It did not consume dreams; it conversed with them"). No grammar errors; proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise—archive footage reveals a shadow as evolution rather than corruption—offers a fresh angle on preservation-versus-change. The river stone's hidden crystalline structure is a specific, non-obvious detail that pays off thematically. However, the emotional arc (fear of change → acceptance) is familiar, and the shadow's benign reveal lacks complication or cost that would resist tidy resolution. The library's "after dreams became shareable" setting remains underexplored; the shared-dream mechanism never constrains choice. Execution is competent but safe, avoiding bold risk in structure or moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's "sharp-eyed" observation is essential to noticing the shadow and analyzing footage, shaping the discovery beat. However, her choices are reactive (reviewing archives) rather than creating tactical turns. The trait enables investigation but does not constrain action with visible cost. Present in setup, middle development, and closure, satisfying the gate model, but the role is more functional than indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The river stone appears in setup (pocket talisman), middle (placed on console), and closure (metamorphoses with silver veins), reweighting from static anchor to evolving emblem. Its transformation directly shapes the ending's charge and embodies the theme. The stone's warmth and radiance constrain Elara's final realization. High irreplaceability: removing it would flatten the closure image. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage push it into the high 7s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"A shadow unbound" is the central puzzle: its presence drives Elara's investigation and its nature (catalyst versus corruption) defines the stake. Present in setup (seven consecutive dusks), middle (flicker in archival film), and closure (cherished collaborator). The concept shapes tactics (archive comparison method) and alters Elara's understanding. However, the shadow remains abstract; its mechanics are told rather than dramatized in action beats. Causal role is solid but specificity is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Softly deliberate" appears twice as label ("softly deliberate grace," "softly deliberate hands") but does not constrain an on-page choice with visible cost. The trait describes Elara's manner without enabling or foreclosing tactical options. Setup and middle presence, but no closure participation beyond atmospheric recurrence. Ornamental use that could be removed without breaking logic or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Metamorphose" is the story's conceptual hinge: the shadow urges dreams to metamorphose, and the river stone metamorphoses at closure, crystallizing Elara's shift. The action redefines the central question (preservation as frozen stasis versus dynamic evolution) and charges the final image. Present in setup (shadow's effect on dreams), middle (Elara's resistance to metamorphosis), and closure (stone's transformation). High irreplaceability and strong closure linkage. The verb itself is foregrounded, not swappable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Comparing silent video footage is Elara's investigative method, signaled early ("silent archive nook," "comparing silent video footage") and executed in the middle beat. The method enables discovery of the shadow's origin and patient journey. However, the footage review is summarized rather than dramatized, reducing tangible constraint. Present in setup, middle, and implied in closure (the console with screens), but mechanics remain abstract. Functional but not indispensable; another detection method could substitute with moderate edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The blooming library is vividly rendered and omnipresent, providing resources (archive nook, dream-vines, console) that enable Elara's work. However, the setting does not pressure choices or supply unexpected obstacles; it remains a benign container. Setup and closure presence, but middle development is atmospheric rather than constraining. Micro-setting (console, stone) does more tactical work than the macro library. The "above clouds" detail is decorative. Strong setup and closure presence lift it above ornamental, but causal pressure is weak.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After dreams became shareable" is the premise's temporal anchor, mentioned in opening and closing lines. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page. The "seven consecutive dusks" observation window occurs off-page, and the archive spans "decades" without specific pressure. The shared-dream mechanism never constrains Elara's choices. Present but largely ornamental; removing the shared-dream premise would not break story logic or closure. Functional world-building without causal role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"To preserve the shape of hope" is Elara's stated motivation, driving her resistance to the shadow and her archive investigation. The desire is dramatized through her clutching the river stone and her "luminous regret" at resisting evolution. Closure hinges on her redefining preservation from stasis to growth. Present in setup, middle friction (fear of change), and closure transformation. However, interiority leans on abstract labels rather than embodied want-versus-fear conflict. Strong presence and closure linkage, moderate embodiment.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Luminous regret" is foregrounded three times and modulates through the arc: initial fear, middle realization, final "quiet joy" blended with "bittersweet understanding." The tone charges the final image (Elara's smile, transformed role). However, the repetition of the exact phrase feels ornamental rather than deepening, and the tone remains static rather than shifting under pressure. Coherent through turns, present in closure, but lacks the intensification or break that would elevate it to indispensable. Solid presence without peak pressure modulation.</comment>
