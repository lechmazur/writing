<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and sustained, but her interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. The "healing" sequence proceeds without meaningful internal resistance or cost—she performs the ritual flawlessly with no impulse to abandon or doubt it. The past-life memory and sailor's regret are told rather than lived through micro-choices that reveal competing desires. The final transformation from seeker to "active compassion" feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens with breathing cycles deepening the obscura's revelations. Orientation arrives promptly (artist, viaduct, twilight, post-memory). However, closure rests on a conceptual repricing—"unused love is not a debt, but potential"—that is stated rather than dramatized through a final image that reweights prior material with undeniable cost. The golden light dissolving "like dandelion seeds" offers a pretty visual but no felt forfeiture or choice that forecloses a path. The resonance is asserted in the penultimate paragraph rather than landing through action or renunciation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The viaduct's wisteria, moonflower, and moss-veined stone are vivid and purposeful, filtering through Elara's artist eye. The camera obscura functions as micro-setting, constraining perception (inverted world) and enabling the discovery of the carved heart. Kwan Yin's tear physically channels sunset into the chamber, materially shaping the reveal. The environment supplies resources (stone heart reservoir, blossoms radiating) that charge the final image, lifting the score into the 7-band despite some decorative excess in the opening cascade.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—is signaled early and pursued through the breathing ritual. One tightening occurs when the solitary spark multiplies into a constellation, then coalesces into the map. However, the resolution arrives without protagonist agency testing a tradeoff; the golden reservoir simply flows free once she whispers recognition. No live option is foreclosed, no cost paid—Elara's compassionate exhales succeed on first attempt. The sailor's regret transmutes off-stage into gratitude without friction or renunciation visible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the camera obscura's inversion and the breathing ritual: unused love as potential rather than debt. The final image—blossoms glowing, Kwan Yin's tear warming—resonates without overt moralizing. Yet the penultimate paragraph ("Foggy lucidity crystallized into truth...") states the theme rather than trusting the reader to infer it from particulars. The closing lines recover some restraint, offering breath as prayer, but the conceptual payoff leans heavily on abstraction ("active compassion," "one mindful exhale") instead of a concrete, non-literal answer rooted in prior action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third with a distinct perceptual signature: light, shadow, inverted optics. Diction is consistent and controlled, favoring lyric compression ("pilgrim of sparks," "theater of reversed reality"). However, elevated register pervades even peak moments—"visceral flash," "compassion's memory," "seamless harmony"—without modulation under pressure. The breathing sequence could tighten syntactically to reflect urgency, but instead maintains an even, ceremonial cadence throughout. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; the voice is singular but unvaried by tension.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high across most beats: "pilgrim of sparks," "liquid gold," "seeds on a breeze," "altar of healed hearts." Many adjacent sentences restate the same content with decorative variation (e.g., "recognition; this love was not wasted, but preserved" followed immediately by theme statement). Template cadence appears in the breathing sequence: "She closed her eyes... As she exhaled... Another breath... Her breathing shifted..." The loop triggers −0.6, and the unmodulated metaphor strings in peak beats (golden light, dandelion seeds, blossoms radiant) add −0.4 for density without escalation. Final-third artifacts disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The camera obscura as vehicle for spiritual healing offers a fresh synthesis of optics and compassion. However, the core premise—releasing stored emotional residue through ritualized breath and a mystical lens—closely tracks familiar writing templates (spiritual pilgrim + past-life memory + healing object). The piece does not transform the template through lived-in contradiction or non-obvious moral calculus; Elara's journey proceeds smoothly from memory to discovery to release without complication. The viaduct and obscura are specific, but the emotional arc could function unchanged with different names and places. Derivative premise penalty: −0.8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara assembles the obscura, peers into it, holds Kwan Yin's tear before the aperture, and whispers offerings—functional beats but not choices that alter tactics under pressure. Her artist identity flavors perception but does not constrain a climactic decision. Present in setup, middle, and ending, meeting the gate model's three-part test, but the causal role is observational rather than transformative. Mid-band functional use without swappability pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kwan Yin's tear is withdrawn early, held during the breathing ritual, catches sunset to cast a cerulean beam into the chamber (enabling the stone heart's reveal), and warms at closure as testament to healing. Three distinct beats: pouch → aperture → warm proof. Causal pressure: the beam illuminates the secret, linking tool to discovery. Closure linkage: the warming crystal signals completion. Specificity: aquamarine coolness → gentle heat tracks transformation. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff; irreplaceability lifts it above mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Pilgrim of sparks" frames Elara's journey in the opening third and recurs in the final line. The golden sparks guide her to the viaduct and later become "companions rather than guides," marking a shift in stance. However, the concept functions primarily as atmospheric metaphor rather than a mechanical constraint that narrows options. It shapes theme and tone but does not force a mid-scene tactical choice with cost. Early seed and final reprise with reweighted meaning place it in the 5.0–6.9 band; lack of causal pressure in beats caps it near the floor.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Spiritually curious mind adrift" is stated once in the opening third to establish Elara's receptivity to the past-life memory. The trait is asserted rather than demonstrated through an on-page action where curiosity enables or constrains a choice with visible cost. It flavors her motivation but does not create friction or tradeoff. Label-only mention without beat involvement or closure linkage; setup gate met but development and payoff missing. Mid-band functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Heal" is the explicit goal signaled early and drives the breathing ritual sequence. The action structures the middle beats (breathing cycles reveal the map, the reservoir, the release) and the ending pronounces healing complete (tear warms, regret transmutes). However, the healing proceeds without complication or failed attempt; it could be swapped for "release" or "honor" with minimal edit. Present across all three gates and central to the arc, but the lack of on-page cost or irreplaceability caps it in the 6-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The method is signaled early ("no incantation—only the subtle alchemy of her own breath") and structures the entire middle: slow inhale, soft exhale, lengthened exhale, conscious pause, measured cycles. Each breath change produces a mechanical effect (shimmer, tremor, spark multiplication, constellation map). The method shapes multiple beats and charges the ending when her exhales become offerings that brighten the golden light. Causal pressure across setup, development, and payoff; specificity of mechanics (nose inhale, parted-lip exhale, peak pause) makes it irreplaceable. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The twilight viaduct supplies the moss-veined railing for the obscura, the carved stone heart at the apex (container for unused love), and the blooming wisteria/moonflower that glow at closure. The setting provides the physical anchor for discovery and the final image ("viaduct stood not as ruin, but as altar"). Present across all three gates; the stone heart is causally essential to the reveal. However, the viaduct itself is largely postcard description until the ending reweights it as "bridge of healed hearts." Solid integration with closure linkage, but not tactical constraint during the ritual.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the past life memory surfaces" anchors the opening ("minutes ago") and establishes urgency. However, time pressure does not tighten decisions thereafter—Elara's ritual proceeds at her own pace with no clock or consequence. The timeframe is present but does not alter tactics or escalate stakes. Setup gate met, but development and payoff missing; swappable with "after the vision" or similar. Functional context, not causal driver.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The desire to find where unused love is stored is stated early, drives the obscura ritual, and achieves payoff when the stone heart's reservoir is revealed. The motivation is clear and structures the arc. However, it is pursued without internal friction or competing want—Elara never doubts, hesitates, or trades off another need. The motivation is told as "quiet but persistent" rather than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices. Present across all three gates with causal linkage to closure, but lacks cost-driven complexity. Solid functional integration in the 6-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Foggy lucidity" is stated explicitly in the resolution paragraph and implied throughout via the interplay of inverted clarity (obscura) and mystical softness (sparks, moonflower, mist). Tone is coherent and modulates subtly from breathless opening to ceremonial ritual to peaceful closure. However, it remains largely static across pressure beats—no sharp tonal shift when stakes tighten. The tone charges the final image (blossoms radiant, humming peace) but does not create friction or contrast that deepens the closure. Present across all three gates with thematic coherence; specificity and closure linkage place it in the upper 5-band.</comment>
