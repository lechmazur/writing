<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clearly framed (protect vulnerable voices), but her interior life is thinly embodied—no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene. The hearing-aid tracing unfolds without struggle or misstep; she never faces a meaningful trade-off or blind spot that compounds before resolution. Lily's grief is asserted ("rendered her nearly invisible") rather than dramatized through contradictory behavior. The final "quiet triumph" and straightened shoulders read as summary rather than earned emotional complexity with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors are present by paragraph two (atrium, twilight, Elara's role). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered sensory detail and the hearing-aid pulse, culminating in Lily's acceptance and the mist's glow. However, the closure unit (Lily's tears and smile, the atrium's glow) lacks a legible *cost*—no option is foreclosed, no visible price paid; the resolution is additive (more voices fortified) without friction. The Cost Proof Test fails: I cannot point to a sentence where Elara or Lily loses something tangible at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight is vivid and purposeful, filtering sensory detail through Elara's professional focus (marble "veined like frozen rivers," violet haze, pearlescent glow). The hearing aid functions as micro-setting, constraining her method (absolute stillness required) and charging the final image when the mist glows. Spatial choreography is clear (archway, Lily approaching, kneeling). The setting does not, however, *alter* Elara's tactics or force a navigational choice under pressure—it frames and amplifies rather than constrains.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake is signaled early (protect Arthur's voice before it dissolves). One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara isolates the faint pulse and decodes the message, which enables the assurance to Lily. Yet the escalation is linear and frictionless: no reversal, no live option foreclosed, no visible price. Coincidence (the social worker arriving "as if summoned") delivers Lily precisely when needed, and Elara's success fortifies the atrium without cost—a net gain that undercuts felt pressure at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (love's persistence across death, the cumulative weight of small kindnesses) emerges organically from the hearing-aid trace and Lily's response. The final image—mist glowing, other voices rising—reweights the premise, suggesting ripple effects. However, the ending leans toward summary moralizing: "heroism was never a grand gesture but the cumulative weight of small, assured kindnesses…every heart she traced…became a vital stitch in the gentle, ongoing mending of the world." This explicit thematic statement replaces scene pressure and pulls the reader out of the concrete moment, reducing resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara; perceptual signature is profession-inflected (tracing pulses, listening for resonances). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, though elevated ("profound reeling hush," "spider silk," "pearlescent light") in ways that occasionally drift from Elara's workday interiority. Elara's dialogue to Lily is purposeful and goal-driven ("your grandfather left you a message…"). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The prose maintains consistent psychic distance, but the final two paragraphs shift into summary omniscience ("heroism was never a grand gesture") that blurs focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, patterned artifacts cluster in high-pressure beats: "a pulse so faint it felt like memory itself," "thin as spider silk yet threaded with urgent tenderness," "fragile echoes…fragile smile…fragile exchange" (synonym loops on "fragile"). Template cadence appears in the final third: "She had sought…she had inadvertently…she had assured…she had fortified." The closure beat suffers from stacked summary clauses ("watching Lily's shoulders straighten…Elara felt the quiet triumph") that dull immediacy. Applying patterned-artifact penalty: baseline −0.6 for loops and stems in the final third, plus −0.3 for figurative density without payoff in peak beats (−0.9 total).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The "contact tracer for hearts" frame offers a fresh metaphor, and the hearing-aid as residual-energy vessel is specific. Yet the emotional arc (grieving child receives grandfather's love) and resolution (tears, smile, strengthened shoulders) follow familiar template beats without a non-obvious moral calculus or lived friction. The atrium's chorus amplification and Elara's "incidental heroism" restate the premise rather than transforming it. The piece commits to its lyric premise but retreats into abstraction ("cumulative weight of small kindnesses") at closure, which undercuts bold specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara ("contact tracer for hearts") is present throughout and her role frames the premise. She makes one key on-page choice: to deliver Arthur's message to Lily (beats: lifting the hearing aid, tracing the pulse, kneeling to speak). However, her decisions are linear and frictionless—no tactical shift, no visible cost tied to her role. The "incidental" framing undercuts agency: success arrives without struggle. Setup clear, middle functional, closure present but not causally pressured by her choices. Swappable with "medium" or "grief counselor" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The photograph appears in one beat (paragraph five: Arthur smiling beside Lily, rose arbor, hearing aid visible). It anchors the case but is not handled again or charged at closure—Lily's locket and the white rose (from the message) carry the ending weight, not the photograph itself. Setup present, no middle development, no closure reprise. Functional but replaceable with "file" or "intake form."</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Incidental heroism" is asserted twice in exposition ("incidental heroism unfolded without intention," "heroism was never a grand gesture") but not dramatized through a choice that risks or rejects conventional heroism. Elara's success is frictionless and additive; the concept remains thematic label rather than stake-shaping pressure. Present as theme, absent as tactic or cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Persistently curious" is mentioned once in exposition ("Elara's persistently curious nature had long taught her…") and implied when she "leaned into the silence, her curiosity a steady anchor." No on-page cost or constraint tied to curiosity—no moment where curiosity delays, risks error, or trades off against caution. Label-only trait without visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Assure" drives two beats: Elara's verbal assurance to Lily ("He wanted you to know, with absolute certainty, that his love surrounds you still") and the resulting emotional shift (Lily's tears, smile, straightened shoulders). The action is central to closure and could not be swapped without loss. However, it appears only in the final third; no earlier failed or partial assurance complicates the attempt. Late signal (−0.4), closure-active (+1.2), two beats (+0.9), but no cost tied to the assuring itself.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The hearing-aid method is signaled early (paragraph six: "lifting the decades-old hearing aid…pressing the cool plastic to her ear"), structures the middle attempt (tracking pulses, decoding syllables), and delivers the key information ("Under the white rose…"). The mechanics matter: absolute stillness required, corroded circuits, layered static. Three beats, causal pressure (enables the message), irreplaceable specificity. Missing only a complication or cost tied to the method itself (no failed trace, no interference).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight is vividly established (paragraphs one–two: marble, violet haze, sacred tension) and returns at closure (mist glows, whispers rise). The setting frames tone and amplifies the ending image but does not constrain Elara's choices or alter tactics—no locked door, no eavesdropper, no environmental obstacle. Early seed, lyric reprise with reweighted meaning (+0.8), but no causal pressure or cost linkage (−0.5). Postcard description elevated by charged return.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"When the dead call" is mentioned once in paragraph two ("the hour when the dead call") and implied by "tonight's case" urgency. No live clock, no tightening deadline that alters Elara's tactics or forces a trade-off. Time remains atmospheric rather than stake-shaping. Present as mood, absent as pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Motivation ("to protect vulnerable voices—the final whispers…that risked dissolving into silence") is stated early and drives Elara's on-page actions (lifting the hearing aid, decoding, delivering the message to Lily). Two beats, causal linkage to closure. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices—no moment where protecting one voice costs another, or where Elara doubts her method. Present and functional, but friction between want and cost is absent.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Reeling hush" is established early ("profound reeling hush hung in the air") and sustained through controlled diction (whispers, stillness, "deepening twilight hush"). Tone modulates subtly: static and silence in the tracing, tears and glowing mist at closure. The final image charges the hush with pearlescent light and rising whispers, reweighting stillness as chorus. Coherent through turns, charges the ending, but static mood in the middle (no tonal friction or break under pressure).</comment>
