<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Anahera's interiority is consistently rendered through the brain coral fragment as tactile anchor and her translator's lens applied to Leo's cast. Her motivation to "graft new meaning onto old wounds" shapes her decryption work and generates micro-choices (leaning closer, whispering comfort). However, the internal arc relies heavily on reflective summary rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; the camp-boy memory and grandmother's wisdom arrive as backstory rather than live pressure. The final whispered declaration feels slightly over-articulated for peak emotional authenticity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece opens with clear anchors (Anahera, atrium, sleeping Leo, cast) and builds density through interleaved memory and present decryption. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): placing the coral beside the cast and whispering comfort crystallizes her shift from armored wound to connective purpose, with the cost felt in her acknowledgment of "every anxious soul she'd ever failed to comfort." The cost is conceptual and relational rather than a decisive physical change, but the final image reweights her solitary Pacific grief as "a fragile, unbreakable cord" to Leo's urban fear. One modest deduction: the climactic whisper and coral placement are stacked with interpretive summary ("This was the lotus-hearted ache…") that slightly dilutes immediacy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight is anchored early and modulates from sterile to sanctuary as pressure shifts. The brain coral fragment functions as micro-setting, warming in her palm and mirroring human worry's complexity; placing it beside the cast charges the final image. Spatial choreography (Anahera beside sleeping Leo, her proximity to the cast) remains clear. The atrium's glass ceiling and swirling mist supply atmospheric specificity without overwhelming the beat. One slip: the setting does not meaningfully constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics; it pressures tone but not decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to transform her trauma-bearing isolation into present empathy for Leo. The piece tightens through one meaningful deepening—decrypting the cast's symbols triggers the camp-boy memory, which she then reframes as "a bridge" rather than "a ghost," enabling the whispered comfort and coral placement. Agency is enacted through attention and renunciation (unknotting old silence into present purpose) with visible cost: acknowledging failure to comfort past souls. The escalation is Accumulative rather than Causal; density increases via layered interpretation until the final image reconfigures her burden as connection. No overt antagonist or reversal, but the design holds under its chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—shared vulnerability as connective tissue—emerges from the decryption action and the recurring coral/lotus imagery without overt statement until the grandmother's aphorism, which is brief and voice-appropriate. The piece resists tidy resolution: Anahera's comfort to Leo is also self-comfort, layering complexity. The final image (coral on cast, vigil under stars) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to "Will the dark stay forever?" through juxtaposition rather than declaration. One penalty: "a pacific translator of sorrows, forever grafting hope onto history" in the closing beat edges toward thematic summary, though it remains embodied in her ongoing vigil.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Anahera with consistent focalization and perceptual signature (translator's gaze, Pacific anchors). Diction ("shrewdly innocent," "lotus-hearted ache," "unknot," "graft") recurs in patterns that support the concept but occasionally tip into authorial summary rather than Anahera's lived idiom. The whispered dialogue to Leo is the sole speech and reads natural. Filter verbs ("she saw," "she felt," "she knew") cluster in the reflective middle without severe drag. Larger issue: the prose occasionally elevates into poetic register ("The mist swirled beyond the glass, catching starlight…") that, while beautiful, slightly exceeds the urgency of the vigil moment and converges with authorial voice rather than Anahera's stressed perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is generally high; sentences advance character and atmosphere. However, several prose artifacts accumulate: paraphrase loops (e.g., "unknot the rigid terror" / "unknotting was not erasure" / "unknot the meaning"), template cadence in the reflective middle ("This was…" / "That memory had been…" / "But here…"), and stock metaphor strings ("watercolor haze," "cold knot in her chest," "hollow stares"). The closing third stacks elevated diction ("pacific translator of sorrows") and summary beats that dilute propulsion. No single artifact severely harms closure, but the cumulative effect lowers momentum and disallows 9+ globally per the artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of Pacific conflict-zone interpreter + pediatric hospital vigil + decrypting a child's cast offers a specific, non-obvious angle. The brain coral as tactile anchor and the "unknot/graft" verb pair unify concept and action. Risk: accumulative/lyric mode at this length without a sharp reversal. However, the piece does not fully escape template emotional-healing arcs; the grandmother's lotus wisdom and the "shared anxieties bridge isolation" premise read familiar. Transformation occurs through verifiable Pacific and interpreter detail, lifting the score into the upper 6s, but the ending's poetic summary ("a pacific translator of sorrows, forever grafting…") courts abstraction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Anahera as pacific conflict-zone translator is seeded early, enables the method (decryption as professional skill), drives her choice to interpret the cast with "patient decryption," and her whispered comfort at closure. The attribute directly alters tactics and charges the ending. Present across setup, middle choice, and payoff with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Brain coral fragment is introduced in the opening line as tactile anchor, reappears warming in her palm mid-piece, and is placed beside Leo's cast at closure as a symbolic graft. Three beats, purposeful reprise, and the final placement charges the image. Does not constrain a choice with cost but does reweight meaning at the end. Strong lyric integration just short of causal indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Shared anxieties (her camp-boy memory, Leo's fear of darkness) frame the dominant stake and enable the bridge metaphor that shifts her stance. The concept shapes her interpretation method and the whispered comfort. Present across setup (refugee-tent memory), development (bridge realization), and payoff (speaking to all anxious souls). Functional but somewhat abstract; the stake is more "transform isolation" than "shared anxiety as live choice."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Shrewdly innocent" is labeled twice (opening paragraph, late reprise "with shrewd innocence") but never enacts a visible tradeoff or constrains an on-page action. It colors her gaze and is asserted to be "forged in war zones yet unhardened," but no moment shows the attribute enabling one tactic while foreclosing another. Ornamental trait without cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Unknot" appears in the title of the anesthetic's effect on Leo, her method ("unknot the meaning, symbol by symbol"), and the closing realization ("unknotting was not erasure"). The verb drives her interpretive work across the middle and frames the closure stance. Removing it would require substantial rewrite. Strong thematic and tactical integration with closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Decrypting smudged notes on the cast is signaled early, occupies the entire middle (blue wave, red dots, jagged line, scribbled sun, blurred phrase), and generates the memory-bridge turn that enables closure. The method's mechanics (treating each smudge as sacred evidence) matter on the page and shape her final whispered translation. Present across all three gates with causal pressure and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Mist-clad atrium at twilight is anchored early and modulates from sterile to sanctuary, supporting tone. The glass ceiling and swirling mist appear at opening and closing. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource; it atmospherically frames rather than pressures. Two-gate lyric reprise (first paragraph → final image) with tonal work but no tactical impact.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the anesthetic kicks in" anchors the opening (Leo "slept deeply, the surgical anesthetic having finally unknot the rigid terror"). The timeframe is a static background—vigil during sleep—rather than a live constraint. No clock tightens her decryption work or alters tactics. Present but non-tactical; setup only, no development or payoff pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To graft new meaning onto old wounds" is stated as her motivation in paragraph six, enacted through the decryption-as-graft method, and literalized in placing the coral (resilient life) on the cast (injury) at closure. The desire is told rather than shown in friction, but it does organize her choices and the final action. Present across setup, development (bridge realization), and payoff with moderate causal linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Lotus-hearted ache" is named once mid-piece ("This was the lotus-hearted ache she carried") and echoed in the grandmother's lotus-in-mud wisdom near the end. The tone—compassionate sorrow intertwined with resilient hope—is coherent through the vigil and charges the final star-pierced image. Modulates subtly (sterile → sanctuary) without major tonal break. Lyric callback with closure resonance but not indispensable; a strong metaphoric throughline.</comment>
