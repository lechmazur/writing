<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is concrete and crystalline throughout, and his internal conflict between revelation and preservation drives the tablet decision authentically. The "agonize immediately" moment (line 132) shows contradiction under pressure, and the final choice to hide the tablet forecloses the path of immediate truth-telling with visible cost. Minor deduction: interiority occasionally tilts toward diagnostic self-awareness ("rebellion was rational, not emotional") rather than fully embodied contradiction, though the core choice remains earned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure operates as Earned Stasis—Kael's decision to preserve rather than proclaim forecloses the revolutionary path with on-page cost (ten years of work risked, the weight of silence accepted). Orientation anchors cleanly by line 25 (who/where/when). The tablet discovery deepens pressure and the sedimentary method recurs with reweighted meaning at closure. One meaningful tightening (the agonize/decide sequence) narrows options under an accumulative lens, and the cog's return in the final third charges the ending image with precision-as-promise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sewer tunnels, sedimentary layers, and Kael's workbench anchor spatial choreography throughout. The chronometer cog—handled twice, first as treasured object (line 63), then returned to the bench (line 244)—constrains the final choice by symbolizing empirical patience. Micro-setting (drip of water, collapsed archive chamber, oilcloth compartment) integrates into action and mirrors the accumulative pressure. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered; the "abrasive calm" modulates with emotional intensity without becoming a postcard tour.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve knowledge vs. reveal truth) is signaled early and tested once meaningfully when the tablet's implication shatters his narrative framework (line 138). Kael's agency—wrapping and sealing the tablet—forecloses the revelation path with visible cost: bearing the weight of silence and risking annihilation of his archive. Under the Accumulative lens, the tightening reads as a deepening that reweights his custodian role. No antagonist is required; Councilor Valerius exists as offstage pressure, and the resolution is Kael's own stance crystallization with on-page consequences.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme (truth as seed vs. weapon, preservation as active rebellion) emerges organically from the tablet discovery and sedimentary method without overt statement until the final third, where "seed-keeper in cultural winter" (line 237) and "precision endures" (line 289) land as earned images rather than thematic proclamation. The cog's return charges the closure without a stated moral. Subtext operates in the competing-narrative frame and Kael's rational calculus. Minor slip: "not a failed revolutionary shouting into voids" (line 237) tilts slightly toward meta-commentary, though it remains anchored in his choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature (geological surveys, sedimentary strata, "abrasive calm") is character-specific and filters detail consistently. Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the agonize beat. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("crystalline," "rationally rebellious," "abrasive calm") that reads more authorial than Kael's lived texture under pressure, especially in peak beats where compression would sharpen voice. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though a few filter verbs ("felt cold and certain," line 185) dull immediacy without voice motivation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sentence openings vary and paragraph rhythm supports accumulative pressure. Information density is high in the tablet-discovery sequence. However, several text-pattern artifacts weaken momentum: paraphrase loops ("competing narrative was not contrarianism but a vital framework" closely echoes the prior geological-survey line, ~line 81–87), template cadence in the middle third ("Each dawn, he employed…" / "Today, his brush uncovered…"), and stock metaphor strings ("keys to the past's true voice," "seed-keeper in cultural winter"). The artifacts do not obscure causality but dull the closure image's sharpness. Apply −0.6 baseline in Q7 for spread; −0.2 additional for touching final-third phrasing ("quiet certainty," "silent promise").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The sedimentary-layer method as truth-seeking framework and the chronometer cog as precision-anchor offer fresh synthesis, and Kael's rational renunciation (preservation over proclamation) avoids the stock revolutionary arc. The "child's star chart" turn is specific and non-obvious. However, the sunken-city-after-plague premise and custodian-versus-official-narrative frame echo widely used post-apocalyptic templates without full transformation; the surface society remains abstract and the tablet's discovery follows expected beats. The "seed-keeper in cultural winter" image (line 237) is evocative but borders on familiar metaphor. Within-band: the sedimentary layering and cog's charged return elevate, but the underlying scaffold limits top-band entry.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael (wannabe philosopher, scavenger) is present throughout and his choices—daily excavation, agonizing over the tablet, sealing it—create the story's key turns. However, "wannabe philosopher" functions more as label than constraint; his aspiration does not visibly limit or enable tactics in the tablet beat. The scavenger role drives action, but the philosopher attribute remains ornamental. Gates: setup (line 1), development (excavation method), closure (custodian decision). Causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, but aspiration-attribute swappability −0.5, label-only philosopher trait −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The chronometer cog appears twice with reweighted meaning: treasured symbol of empirical truth (line 63), then returned to workbench as "silent promise that precision endures" (line 289). It anchors Kael's rational calculus during the agonize beat ("cog in his pocket felt cold and certain," line 185) and charges the final image. Gates: setup (line 63), development (pocket anchor, line 185), closure (workbench return, line 289). Beat involvement +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, causal pressure +0.8, specificity +0.5. Minor: the cog enables but does not constrain choice, capping high-band entry.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Competing narratives (divine punishment vs. seismic/seawall failure) frame Kael's motivation and the tablet's threat from line 36 onward. The discovery that "sophisticated knowledge was commonplace" (line 138) shatters the surface myth and forces the hide/reveal decision, altering tactics. The concept charges the closure: "competing narratives would clash above, but here…ancient methods were safe" (line 229). Gates: setup (line 36), development (tablet implication, line 138), closure (line 229). Causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, beat involvement +0.9, irreplaceability +0.6.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Rationally rebellious" is declared (line 81) and revisited ("rebellion was rational, not emotional," line 173; "active rebellion," line 214; final line 299). The trait enables Kael's calculus—weighing consequences "with the same care he used on sedimentary strata"—but does not visibly constrain an option with cost. The attribute functions more as thematic label than tactical limiter. Gates: setup (line 81), development (line 173 decision frame), closure (line 299 reprise). Beat involvement +0.4, thematic presence +0.3, but label-only use −0.5, no visible tradeoff −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Agonize" (line 132) triggers the story's central turn: Kael's mind races through scenarios, his hands tremble, and he weighs ten years of work against the tablet's threat. The action is irreplaceable—removing it collapses the decision sequence. It redefines options (reveal/risk vs. hide/wait) and links directly to closure (sealing the tablet, accepting custodian role). Gates: setup (implicit in prior tension), development (line 132–173 decision), closure (seal action, line 208). Causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, irreplaceability +0.7, cost connection +0.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sedimentary-layer method is introduced early (line 95: "descending…to excavate through sedimentary layers") and structures Kael's truth-seeking throughout: plague ash, flood silt, compacted clay. The tablet's discovery in the plague-ash layer (line 120) tests the method's implication, and the method returns in the final beats ("next sedimentary layer," line 273; "one layer…at a time," line 299). Gates: setup (line 95), development (tablet-in-layer, line 120), closure (line 273–299). Beat involvement +0.9, causal shaping +0.8, closure linkage +0.9, specificity +0.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Sunken city ruins and the sewer's "dry upper tunnels" anchor the entire narrative from line 1. The collapsed archive chamber (line 95) supplies the tablet, and the hidden compartment (line 208) enables preservation. Spatial choreography (drip of water, broken archways, workbench) remains coherent. However, the setting functions more as backdrop than active constraint; it does not pressure a choice the way a ticking resource or closing access would. Gates: setup (line 1), development (archive chamber, line 95), closure (workbench, line 244). Causal enabling +0.6, closure presence +0.5, specificity +0.4, but minimal tactical constraint −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"A decade had passed since the plague's fever broke" (line 36) and "ten years of solitude" (line 157) establish temporal context and weight Kael's investment. The timeframe does not impose a live clock or tighten decision windows during the tablet beat; it functions as backstory anchor rather than tactical pressure. Gates: setup (line 36), development (line 157 stakes reminder), no closure participation beyond thematic weight. Early signal +0.5, cost connection (ten years at risk) +0.4, but no tactical tightening −0.6, summary-only −0.3, missing closure participation (cap 2.8 waived by thematic charge) elevated by felt weight to mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to preserve ancient methods is dramatized from line 1 (filtering water, safeguarding hydrology/astronomy) and tested by the tablet's threat: preserve in silence or risk revelation (line 165). The friction between wanting to correct the surface narrative and needing to protect his archive drives the agonize sequence and sealing choice. The final image ("knowledge…would outlast any plague or lie," line 283) reaffirms the motivation with visible cost (bearing silence). Gates: setup (line 1), development (line 165 test), closure (line 283). Causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.5, friction dramatized +0.8, cost +0.5.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Abrasive calm" is introduced (line 43: "abrasive calm of perpetual twilight") and modulates with pressure: cracking under the tablet's implication (line 132), then settling again (line 196: "abrasive calm settled over him"). The tone charges the final image ("in the abrasive calm of the deep, Kael continued," line 299) and reflects Kael's rational endurance. It remains coherent through turns without flattening into static mood. Gates: setup (line 43), development (line 196 return), closure (line 299). Closure linkage +1.3, modulation +0.8, coherence +0.6, rhythmic charge +0.5. Minor: the phrase borders on authorial descriptor rather than fully embodied perception, limiting top-band entry.</comment>
