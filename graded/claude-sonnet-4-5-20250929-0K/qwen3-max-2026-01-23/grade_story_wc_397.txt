<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior arc from seeking death's sound to honoring life's symphony unfolds through embodied moments (hands gripping nets, parasol tip warming). The transformation feels rushed in the final third, jumping from "choice remained hers" to full embrace of belonging without a dramatized pivot moment that forces cost. Internal contradiction is present (tourist vs. volunteer) but the climactic shift toward community reads more as emotional summary than earned crisis. Minor: "grips reality loosely" remains label-only without a concrete micro-choice where this trait creates visible friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density increases through recurring motifs (parasol tip, ice groan, folding) that reweight the dominant stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara will keep her appointment but tonight sits with the community, crystallizing options with felt cost. Orientation anchors appear by line 2 (Arctic marina, bunkhouse). One pressure tightening occurs when the net surfaces with the journal, shifting her motivation from ending's sound to survival's symphony. Cost is felt but oblique—the final image charges the parasol tip with "dawn's promise" yet the immediate consequence of her choice (appointment tomorrow) remains ambiguous, weakening the before/after legibility slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina constrains Elara's work (slush, broken nets, windborne cold) and the parasol tip functions as micro-setting, warming in her pocket and catching aurora glow at closure. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "deep-throated groan of ancient ice," "coarse hemp," "violet and rose gold twilight." The setting charges the final image (aurora, porcelain bud, Arctic quiet) and the ice's transformation from threat to lullaby reweights her stance. Minor: spatial choreography during the skiff scene is clean but the transition from marina to bunkhouse to cot compresses without clear movement cues.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether to proceed with euthanasia appointment, signaled in paragraph 2. One meaningful tightening: the net surfaces with Lars's father's journal, reframing the "sound of approaching endings" from void to resonance. Elara's agency crystallizes in the decision to keep the appointment "with clarity" yet sit with the community tonight—a stance that forecloses neither path fully, which under Accumulative lens qualifies as Charged Poise but lacks a dramatized trade-off scene. Cost is present (she delays, she listens) but the escalation from volunteer work to community belonging feels more textural deepening than pressure-driven turn. No antagonist required; coincidence (finding the journal) complicates without resolving.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme of patience as active fold, creating pockets for hope, emerges through grandmother's lace memory and nets. The parasol tip shifts from "relic of loss" to "compass pointing to connection," and the final image offers a non-literal answer: "her own breath, woven into the wind's eternal song." However, the final paragraph edges toward moralizing ("to hear endings, one must first listen to courage in continuing") and the thematic pivot is stated rather than fully embodied in a concrete action. The story resists simple binaries (life vs. death becomes continuity vs. isolation) but the resolution feels slightly platitudinous in its delivery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV anchored to Elara; distance is stable with controlled intimacy. Perceptual signature is strong: she notices texture (coarse hemp, cool porcelain, slush) and sound (ice groan, wind moan). Diction remains consistent and elevated ("windborne solace," "fold in patience") without register breaks. Dialogue is minimal (Lars: "My father's") and purposeful. Two weaknesses: "stubborn continuity" and "windborne solace" recur as thematic labels in a way that edges toward over-articulation, and the parasol tip's metaphorical charge is narrated ("no longer a relic of loss, but a compass") rather than shown through Elara's micro-choice with it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but controlled in most beats. Overwriting cluster in final third: "violet and rose gold," "star-dusted sky," "dawn's promise," "eternal song of memory, grace, and continuing light" stack metaphors without fresh particulars, triggering −0.5. Paraphrase loop: paragraphs 12–13 restate the sound's nature ("not void, but resonance" / "textured, layered, alive") without added pressure, −0.2. Minor template cadence in transitions ("She recalled," "She would," "She understood"). Information density is high in early beats (net work, parasol tip anchor) but the final quarter summarizes emotional shifts rather than dramatizing them. No causality breaks; artifacts cluster in closure zone, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Core premise—euthanasia tourist finds meaning in Arctic disaster relief—offers a fresh synthesis of end-of-life tourism and voluntary service. The parasol tip as heirloom anchor and "fold in patience" as thematic pivot are specific. However, the emotional arc (despair → community → tentative hope) follows a familiar redemption template without a non-obvious moral calculus; the journal discovery as catalyst feels coincidental rather than organically earned. The aurora and ice imagery, while vivid, recur as stock Arctic motifs. Transformation test: the plot and arc could translate to another setting (mountain village, coastal outpost) with minor adjustments, suggesting modest originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara as euthanasia tourist frames the dominant stake (appointment tomorrow) and her choice to delay shapes the narrative. She makes two key decisions: volunteering after the storm (paragraph 4) and sitting with the community tonight (paragraph 14). However, the tourist status is more backdrop than active constraint—the story could function with "grief traveler" or "retreat visitor" with minor edits. Her altered stance at closure (keeping appointment "with clarity") is stated rather than dramatized through a specific on-page choice that narrows options. Setup present, middle choice functional, closure participation declarative. Swappability and summary use lower the score; two-beat involvement and closure linkage raise it modestly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Parasol tip appears in four beats: pocket anchor (paragraph 5), warming during memory (paragraph 9), steady in pocket under aurora (paragraph 17), catching glow on nightstand (paragraph 23). It shifts from "relic of loss" to "compass pointing to connection" to "porcelain bud holding dawn's promise," reweighting meaning across the arc. Early signal strong, spaced touches across beginning/middle/end, closure image charged. However, Elara never handles or uses it on the page in a way that constrains a physical choice—its function is symbolic throughout. The object participates in closure but does not drive a causal turn. Lyric reprise qualifies for mid-6s; lack of tactical constraint and moderate swappability (any heirloom could serve) cap below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Fold in patience" appears as grandmother's teaching (paragraph 9) and is echoed in paragraph 8 ("a fold in patience occurred") and paragraph 15 ("fold in her patience had become a cradle"). It functions as thematic claim rather than on-page stake or tactic. Elara's patience with net-hauling is mentioned but does not create a specific choice-point or cost; the concept could be replaced with "waiting" or "endurance" without structural change. Setup present via memory, middle mention ornamental, closure absent (final image is breath/wind, not fold). Functional presence without causal pressure or specificity. Thematic echo without beat involvement caps at mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Grips reality loosely" is stated in paragraph 3 ("hands, which usually gripped reality loosely as if holding smoke") and contrasted with "found solid anchor in the coarse hemp." The trait is mentioned but never constrains an on-page action or creates visible cost—there is no moment where her loose grip causes a mistake, delay, or tactical adjustment. Paragraph 13 claims "her grip on reality firmed," yet this is summary without dramatized friction. Label-only attribute without enabling/constraining a choice. Present in setup, absent in middle development and closure. Ornamental mention and swappability (could be "distracted" or "uncertain") limit to low-3s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Trawl work shapes three beats: gripping nets (paragraph 3), long haul where patience deepens (paragraph 8), net surfaces with journal (paragraph 10). The journal discovery reframes Elara's motivation from seeking endings to honoring survival, a key turn. The action enables the central event and is irreplaceable—no other disaster-relief method would surface the father's legacy. Early signal, middle development (hauling as patience crucible), closure linkage (journal fragment informs final stance). Specific mechanics (hemp texture, slush, tangled debris) ground the action. Minor: the trawl itself does not constrain her final choice (to sit with community); the journal does. Causal pressure strong, closure linkage indirect. Two-beat involvement and irreplaceable specificity elevate to low-7s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Disaster relief volunteering is signaled in paragraph 4 ("delayed her appointment to mend nets and haul debris after the storm shattered the village fleet") and executed in paragraphs 7–10 (skiff, net work). It provides the mechanism for encountering Lars and the journal, a causal turn. The method is functional but not deeply specified—"volunteering" could be replaced with "day labor" or "helping fishermen" with minor narrative edits. Setup clear, middle beat (net haul) essential, closure absent (final image is community gathering, not the work itself). Enables key discovery but lacks tactical constraint or cost tied to the volunteering method itself. Functional participation across setup/middle without closure presence or irreplaceability caps at mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina anchors every beat: ice groan travels through bunkhouse (paragraph 1), skiff cuts through slush (paragraph 7), twilight paints marina (paragraph 16), ice groan becomes lullaby (paragraph 21). The setting pressures Elara's work (cold, debris, broken fleet) and supplies the aurora and ice as charged final images. Setup immediate, middle involvement (slush complicates trawl), closure strong (aurora glow, ice lullaby transform threat into endurance). Spatial choreography clear (bunkhouse → skiff → marina → bunkhouse → cot). The setting is irreplaceable—no other locale offers drift ice, Arctic twilight, or the ice-memory motif. Causal constraint, closure charge, and specificity elevate to mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"After waking up changed" is stated in paragraph 2 ("first morning after waking up changed") but the timeframe is vague—changed from what, when? The story unfolds over ~one day (morning work → twilight → night), but the window between "waking changed" and the tomorrow appointment is not tightened or tracked in a way that alters tactics. No countdown or live clock pressures choices. The "tomorrow" appointment is mentioned twice (paragraphs 4, 14) but does not narrow options on the page. Setup present, middle absent (time does not constrain the net work or community gathering), closure mentions tomorrow without urgency. Functional but replaceable; "days after arriving" would serve equally. Vague tracking and no tactical constraint cap at high-4s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Motivation "to learn the sound of approaching endings" is stated in paragraph 6 and recurs in paragraphs 12, 16, 19, 20, 24. It frames the dominant stake and shifts from void (paragraph 6) to resonance (paragraph 12) to breath (paragraph 24). The desire is told rather than dramatized in a choice-point—Elara does not make a specific on-page decision driven by this want versus a competing cost. The motivation is transformed at closure (final image: "her own breath, woven into the wind's eternal song") but the pivot is narrated summary. Setup strong, middle development thematic (listening to Lars, elders), closure participation declarative. Lyric reprise reweights meaning; lack of friction or trade-off scene caps at mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Windborne solace" appears as phrase in paragraphs 7, 15, 22 and as felt texture throughout (wind carrying absolution, wind moaning, wind's eternal song). Tone coheres across turns: early cold menace → middle breath of grace → final lullaby. The wind modulates with pressure (storm debris → hush → moan → song) and charges the final image ("her own breath, woven into the wind's eternal song"). Setup immediate (paragraph 7), middle deepening (paragraph 15: "windborne solace—a peace as enduring as the ice fields"), closure strong (wind as eternal continuity). The tone is specific and irreplaceable—"solace" distinguishes from mere "peace" or "calm," tying breath, wind, and endurance. Coherent modulation, closure charge, and specificity elevate to high-7s.</comment>
