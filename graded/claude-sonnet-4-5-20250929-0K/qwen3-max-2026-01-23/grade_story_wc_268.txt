<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. The "regally unpretentious grace" remains a label without visible cost or behavioral tradeoff on the page. Internal experience is summarized across centuries rather than embodied in a single pressured moment where contradictory wants collide. The closure dissolves him into light without a final choice that forecloses a living path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed past 120 words—who, where, and when emerge slowly through elevated description. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural, but the closure is a passive dissolution rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible cost; Kael's fulfillment is told, and the library fades without an on-page action that narrows options or reweights prior material. The historian's courtroom scene occurs off-stage in summary, undercutting causal closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The Chronos Athenaeum is vividly rendered with obsidian halls, Font of Echoes, and crystalline dome. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the library does not constrain a choice or force a tactical adjustment at closure. The final image of dissolving shelves charges the ending with atmosphere, lifting the score into mid-band, but the environment does not pressure Kael's tactics in the final beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unmasking Valerius—is signaled early but never tightens on the page. Kael's method (cryptic messages) operates in summary across centuries without a single beat where a tactical choice narrows options or imposes felt cost. The courtroom reversal happens off-stage and is recounted rather than dramatized, undercutting escalation. Elara's intervention, not Kael's agency, triggers the resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme of duty and integrity emerges through Kael's patient subversion, and "sovereignty resided in integrity, not gilded chairs" encapsulates the premise. Yet the final paragraph moralizes directly ("He had never sought the throne, only truth's restoration") rather than letting the image resonate without statement. The ink pellet placed on the desk offers a non-literal gesture, but the closure is undercut by the prior explicit summary of fulfillment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Third-person distance is stable, and elevated diction ("regally unpretentious," "void-space," "crystallized memory") establishes a consistent mythic register. However, the voice leans toward catalog and summary rather than embodied perception under pressure. Kael's interiority is reported across epochs rather than filtered through a single urgent moment. The prose remains legible but lacks the perceptual signature and rhythmic modulation that would charge peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Sentence openings vary, but figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff ("titan of cosmic lineage housed in a form no larger than a sparrow's egg," "serpent's smile," "seeds planted in time's soil"). Mixed metaphors and elevated diction blur clarity in high-pressure beats. Paraphrase loops appear: "graceful collapse of the lie" is restated as "profound and graceful collapse" within two lines. Template cadence runs ("He felt," "He placed," "He had") stack in the final third, applying −0.6 for line-level artifacts touching closure and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—miniaturized cosmic heir in timeless exile using cryptic library messages—combines familiar fantasy tropes (rightful heir, magical artifact, temporal prison) without transforming them through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The courtroom reversal and Valerius's weathered reveal echo stock images. The "diminutive titan" paradox is stated rather than explored through on-page constraints that force tactical trade-offs. The synthesis is competent but derivative, trending mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Kael is present throughout but does not make a single on-page decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. His centuries-long vigil is summarized; the courtroom turn is enacted by Elara. The diminutive scale is declared ("no larger than a sparrow's egg") but never constrains a choice or shapes the closure beat. Label-only presence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The iron gall ink pellet appears in three beats: forging, daily shaving, and the final placement on the desk. It is handled and its diminishing state is tracked. However, its evolving use does not constrain a mid-scene choice, and the final placement is a symbolic gesture rather than a causal pressure point. The pellet shapes the method but does not drive the closure action, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The rune of drift appears twice: Valerius's corrupted version severs Kael's tether, and Kael inscribes the true rune in messages that Elara activates. The concept enables the plot but does not constrain an on-page choice or alter tactics under pressure. The courtroom sunder is recounted rather than dramatized. Early signal and closure linkage are present, but causal pressure and cost are absent, placing the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Regally unpretentious" is declared in paragraph three and illustrated with spider-silk mending and silent reverence, but these are summary examples rather than on-page choices with visible cost. The attribute does not constrain a beat or enable a tactical trade-off. It remains a label without dramatized friction, scoring below functional integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Sunder" appears twice: as the action Valerius used to sever Kael's tether and as the verb describing the rune's effect on Valerius's disguise. The term is thematic but the decisive act occurs off-stage in the courtroom and is narrated rather than dramatized. Removing "sunder" and substituting "break" or "dissolve" would not alter the story's logic or closure. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The method is signaled early, developed through specific examples (corrected birth-chart, marginal note, hidden map), and directly shapes the courtroom climax when Elara reads the encoded messages. However, the courtroom beat is summarized rather than dramatized, and Kael's inscription process is described in reflection rather than enacted in a pressured scene. Essential across beats but the closure participation is indirect, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The Chronos Athenaeum is established early, furnished with the Font of Echoes and crystalline dome, and its dissolution marks the closure. The library provides the medium (books) and resource (ink water), but does not constrain a choice or force a tactical adjustment in the peak beat. The final image of dissolving shelves charges the ending, but the setting's causal role is limited to enabling the method rather than pressuring decisions.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Across the pause of shifting constellations" frames the vigil and is reprised in the final sentence ("constellations beyond the vanishing dome stilled for one perfect heartbeat"). However, the timeframe is atmospheric rather than tactical; no clock tightens decisions or alters Kael's moves. The span is declared but does not constrain choices or shape escalation. Present but ornamental, trending low-mid.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to unmask Valerius is signaled early and sustains the entire arc. However, it is declared rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or on-page friction. The desire never forces a choice where cost is visible; the courtroom reversal is enacted by Elara. The motivation frames the premise and recurs across beats, but lacks the internal conflict or trade-off that would push it higher.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Tone of "graceful collapse" is coherent and modulates from patient vigil through the courtroom dissolution to Kael's serene fading. The crown crumbling "without a sound" and Kael dissolving into light embody the tone. However, the final paragraphs over-explain fulfillment ("He had never sought the throne, only truth's restoration"), reducing the tone's charge. The image work is strong, but explicit moralizing undercuts the grace, placing the score mid-band.</comment>
