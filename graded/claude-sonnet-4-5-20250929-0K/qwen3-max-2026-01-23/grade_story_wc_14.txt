<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's "earnestly studious nature" drives the charting ritual, but interiority remains largely observational rather than conflicted. The invented histories show devotion, yet no on-page choice tests competing impulses or forecloses a path with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present in physical details (tracing the notepad, filtering sounds), but the final walk toward the cottage offers continuity without a stance-altering decision that demonstrates internal contradiction acting in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens is taught early and held: dawn charting becomes the frame for invented histories, and the final gold-leaf forest image reweights the opening labyrinth with undeniable resonance. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The Resonant Reconfiguration (charged poise: "every leaf whispered a story waiting to be charted") lands with conceptual cost—silence transformed into continuous creative obligation—but the cost reads as affirmed devotion rather than a visible forfeiture or narrowing of options on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The bonsai labyrinth, lamp, and workshop nest concrete particulars within the POV's studious attention. The gold leaf applied "days prior" and the shimmering forest at closure charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate for constraint. Sensory hierarchy (filtering sparrow chirps, focusing on hum) reflects professional priority. Spatial choreography is clean throughout, and the micro-setting (lamp, notepad, bench) structures the charting ritual that anchors the entire arc.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—archiving atmosphere to honor absence—is signaled early and sustained. The charting ritual provides one meaningful deepening (hum fades, dawn victorious) under the accumulative lens, but agency reads as continuity rather than a choice that narrows options or imposes a trade-off. No live option is foreclosed; the final walk promises "tomorrow's hum," confirming perpetual devotion without visible friction or cost that would elevate escalation into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: invented histories as "empathetic translations," gold leaf as tribute to transience, the lamp's hum carrying ghosted lives. The final shimmering labyrinth offers a resonant, non-literal answer—silence as canvas rather than void—without moralizing. Subtext operates cleanly in image and gesture. The piece invites reflection on attention's sacred power, but the lack of friction or ambiguity at closure (the ending affirms rather than complicates) keeps it just below the 9+ threshold.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable, single-focus, and closely filtered through Elara's studious attention. Diction remains controlled and purposeful ("incandescent restraint," "blooming labyrinth"), with perceptual signature (charting micro-shifts, filtering sensory detail) consistent throughout. Register is elevated but voice-motivated. No head-hopping or POV leakage. The piece does not quite reach 9+ because rhythmic compression at peak beats ("Touching a gilded cherry branch, she felt...") edges toward summary rather than scene-present perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence openings and paragraph lengths vary purposefully, and information density is high. However, repeated stems ("She [verb]" openers in paragraphs 10–14, 22–23) and template cadence ("Each dawn," "No customer," "The mountain held") accumulate to −0.6. Paraphrase loop: paragraphs 15–18 restate "invented histories honor silence" without added pressure, triggering −0.2. Figurative density ("blooming labyrinth," "incandescent restraint," "rose-gold," "frozen laughter") pervades without pattern-teaching or payoff at closure, applying −0.5. Total −1.3 in Q7. Clarity remains high, but the artifact load and loop presence disallow 9+ globally and prevent high-band entry here.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis—solitary archivist charting lamp vibrations to invent compassionate histories for an empty town—feels specific and non-obvious. Gilded bonsai and fluorescent-hum charting avoid stock imagery. Yet the emotional arc (devoted → devoted) and the absence of friction or surprise at closure keep the piece replaceable at the conceptual level: swap lamp for another ambient signal and bonsai for another miniature craft without structural loss. The frame is fresh, but the lack of risk or transformation in the ending prevents high-band scoring.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and performs the charting action, but her choices are observational continuity rather than decision-turns. She enters, charts, writes, walks—no on-page moment where she chooses between competing options or alters tactics. Present in closure (walks toward cottage, listens for tomorrow's hum) but not causally active there. Gate: setup ✓, middle ✓ (charting), closure participation weak (cameo walk). Swappable role: "devoted archivist" could be generic. Late first-person agency at closure would lift score; as stands, functional but mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Notepad appears in four beats: clutched at paragraph 5, opened/used paragraphs 11–12, closed/traced paragraph 23, carried at paragraph 31. Gate: setup ✓, middle ✓ (active use), closure ✓ (traced, carried). Causal pressure: enables charting and invented histories. Specificity: "battered," "rain, charcoal smudges, years" make it irreplaceable as a carrier of continuity. Cost connection: "ghosts of countless dawns pressed into leather." Strong integration, but the final closure beat is a walk with the notepad as steady weight—present, not reweighted or transformed. Eligible for 7+ but the closure linkage reads as continuity rather than decisive charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Invented histories frame the charting ritual from paragraph 4 and structure paragraphs 15–18 (Old Man Hemlock, Anya). Gate: setup ✓, middle ✓ (written on page), closure weak (implied in "stories waiting to be charted" but not dramatized). Shapes one key turn: the hum becomes a vehicle for empathetic narrative. Cost connection: "honoring dignity" and "empathetic translations" tie to theme, but no visible tactical constraint or trade-off on the page. Present and thematically central, but swappable with "memory preservation" or "archival ritual" without structural loss. Mid-band: functional, one-beat causal role.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Labeled at paragraph 6 ("earnestly studious nature") and enacted in filtering sounds (paragraph 12), charting (paragraphs 13–14), and "rebellion against erasure" (paragraph 30). Gate: setup ✓, middle ✓ (enacted in charting), closure weak (thematic reprise without on-page choice). Constraint: enables focus but does not impose visible cost or force a trade-off. Swappability: "devotion" or "meticulous attention" would serve identically. Ornamental at closure. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Refract is named at paragraph 8 and demonstrated in the charting ritual (paragraphs 10–21): bending the lamp's hum through perception to reveal invented histories. Gate: setup ✓, middle ✓ (active method), closure ✓ (final image of gold-leaf light and "stories waiting to be charted"). Causal pressure: the refractive lens structures the entire narrative. Specificity: "perception's prism" and "hidden spectrum" make it distinct. Cost connection: labor of attention and continuity. Strong integration across beats and ending. Eligible for 7+ but the closure beat is thematic echo rather than a reweighted action, capping at mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Method appears at paragraph 9, executed paragraphs 10–21 (lamp sputtered, hum charted, annotations, surrender at 5:41 AM), and reprised at paragraph 31 ("tomorrow's hum"). Gate: setup ✓, middle ✓ (active across multiple beats), closure ✓ (shapes continuity promise). Causal pressure: the hum's arc (surge, plateau, tremor, fade) structures the invented histories and the dawn's "victory." Specificity: fluorescent lamp at first light is irreplaceable. Cost: sustained attention and perpetual devotion. Strong integration, beats 2+ middle involvement, closure linkage clear. Eligible for high 7s; swappability test: no generic "recording" would carry the same sensory and temporal charge.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Bonsai labyrinth frames opening and closing (paragraphs 1–2, 26–29), with workshop nested between trees (paragraph 9). Gate: setup ✓, middle ✓ (workshop as workspace), closure ✓ (shimmering gold-leaf forest). Causal pressure: minimal—setting provides atmosphere but does not constrain tactics or alter a choice. Closure linkage: final image charges the labyrinth with "incandescent light" and "stories waiting," reweighting the opening's "blooming labyrinth." Lyric reprise qualifies under the allowance. Specificity: mountaintop bonsai forest is unique. Mid-6s: strong setup and closure participation, weak middle constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Timeframe is established early (paragraph 3: "three winters ago") and present at closure (paragraph 29: "town's silence...filled with invented histories"). Gate: setup ✓, closure ✓ (thematic), middle weak (no on-page friction tied to the town's silence during the charting ritual). Does not tighten decisions or tactics; the empty town is backdrop, not live pressure. Swappable: "after a disaster" or "in isolation" would serve identically. Functional atmosphere but replaceable without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Motivation stated at paragraph 4 ("to collect textures...before they dissolve") and demonstrated in the charting ritual. Gate: setup ✓, middle ✓ (charting enacts collection), closure ✓ (continuity promise, "tomorrow's hum"). Causal pressure: drives the daily ritual. Cost connection: devotion and perpetual labor implied. Friction: minimal—no competing want or obstacle tests the desire on the page. The motivation is told and enacted but not dramatized through choice under conflicting pressure. Mid-band: functional, one-beat causal role, no visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tone is named at paragraph 19 ("incandescent restraint") and sustained throughout: elevated yet precise diction, immense feeling held in meticulous observation, quiet beauty in the final shimmering labyrinth. Modulates with pressure: focused intensity during charting (paragraphs 10–21), softer resonance at closure (paragraphs 26–32). Coherent through all turns. Charges the final image: "soft, incandescent light—a testament to restraint and enduring beauty." Strong integration, tone inseparable from voice and theme. Eligible for high 7s; does not quite reach 8+ because the tonal register remains static (no sharp modulation under peak stress).</comment>
