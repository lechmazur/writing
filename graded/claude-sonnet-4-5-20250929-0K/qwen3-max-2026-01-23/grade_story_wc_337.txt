<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to ground spirits is clear and her scarred fingers and years handling sorrow provide embodied history. Internal conflict emerges through "lucid unrest" settling into "quiet understanding," but the progression feels too smooth—no genuine struggle between competing impulses dramatized in scene. The final realization about restoration is articulated rather than discovered through contradictory micro-choices. The grandmother's journal and apprentice sacrifice backstory anchor present action, but Elara's agency reads more as ritual executor than someone wrestling with flawed impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the first paragraph. The piece accumulates silence through a pattern of knot-unraveling that reweights the stake from restless spirits to Elara's own fractured spirit, delivering Resonant Reconfiguration (her fractures mend with acceptance). One meaningful deepening occurs when the final knot reveals the fisherman's sacrifice, charging the closure image. Cost is visible: Elara's tears and the shift from "restorer of broken things" to "weaver of solace" forecloses her prior defensive posture. The lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary, obsidian dais, and tapestry needle constrain Elara's method and charge the final image where starlight "no longer fractured by sorrow" pools around the empty net. Sensory detail is vivid (salt-bleached fibers, moss-flecked floor, cold brilliant starlight) and filtered through Elara's restorative focus. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. However, the sanctuary's rules and the mechanics of how prisms or starlight interact with spirits remain decorative rather than applying pressure to her choices mid-scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—grounding restless spirits—is signaled immediately and tightens through each knot's revelation, culminating in the fisherman's sacrificial choice that forces Elara to confront her own fractures. One meaningful deepening occurs when "the secret began to unfold across the sharing of this memory" and intensifies at the final knot. Cost is legible: Elara's defensive posture as a "restorer of broken masks" is foreclosed in favor of "weaver of solace," and her tears mark the emotional price. Agency is consistent—her choice to speak truths and unravel knots drives each beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the net's knots as prisons for memories and the "interlaced hush" as collective peace, avoiding direct statement until the earned insight: "restoration was not erasing breaks, but weaving the story of the break into the whole." The final image of starlight pooling around the empty net reweights prior material with quiet resonance. Subtext operates in Elara's whispered truths and the spirits' dissolution into "motes of serene radiance." Minor slip: "lucid unrest" feels abstractly named rather than fully embodied in contradictory impulses, and the grandmother's journal is a convenient wisdom deposit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains stable; Elara's perceptual signature filters detail through her restorative lens (scarred fingers, surgeon's precision, the needle as familiar tool). Diction is elevated and consistent, though occasional phrases ("the interlaced hush, the core concept her grandmother's journal described") slip into expository summary mid-scene. The dialogue—Elara's whispered truths—feels purposeful and goal-driven. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the final knot. No head-hopping, and narrative certainty matches Elara's knowledge throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Overwriting is pervasive: nearly every sentence carries figurative load ("coiled like smoke," "settling frost," "wave of pure peace") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering the density penalty (−0.5). Mixed metaphors appear ("silence...accumulate...thickening like settling frost" conflates liquid and solid states). Register occasionally drifts into workshop abstraction ("lucid unrest," "interlaced hush") that clashes with the hands-on POV. Template cadence in the knot-sequence beats ("A knot of terror released...A knot of longing revealed") adds −0.4. Paraphrase loops in the final paragraph ("no longer merely a restorer...but a weaver") restate the same realization. Total artifact deduction: −1.3, and since artifacts touch the closure beat, 9+ is disallowed globally and high-band entries capped at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—grief stored in knots of a fisherman's net—offers a fresh synthesis of object, memory, and ritual. Transformation of the restorer-of-masks trope through literal unraveling is specific and non-obvious. However, the emotional arc (fractured restorer heals while healing others) follows a familiar template without sufficient lived detail or moral calculus to fully distinguish it. The "interlaced hush" concept is intriguing but remains abstractly named rather than made inevitable through prior particulars. No proximity issues or gimmickry, and the piece commits fully to its premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara's choice to unravel each knot and speak truths drives all major beats and the closure. She is present from the opening and her agency—inserting the needle, murmuring acknowledgments—narrows options (spirits dissolve, her own fractures mend). The final realization about restoration is tied directly to her action. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. However, her internal conflict is told more than dramatized in contradictory micro-choices, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tapestry needle is signaled early ("from her worn leather pouch"), used in at least three beats (first knot, subsequent knots, final knot with reverence), and its "silver shaft cool and familiar" quality is tied to Elara's restorative identity. It enables the method and is present in the closure beat ("Elara lowered the needle"). The repurposing from mending tapestries to sacred unraveling adds specificity. Strong setup, beat involvement, and closure linkage push it into the 7+ range.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Interlaced hush" is described as "a woven calm formed when individual silences of acceptance braid into collective peace" and accumulates through the unraveling, shaping the sanctuary's atmosphere and the spirits' resolution. It is present in the middle beats ("the interlaced hush became a living tapestry") and at closure ("accumulated silence—a testament to courage"). However, it does not constrain a specific choice or alter tactics; it remains an atmospheric concept rather than a mechanical pressure. Lyric reprise and thematic resonance earn mid-band placement.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Silence accumulates visibly through each knot's unraveling: "profound quiet began to accumulate," "the accumulated silence grew more substantial," "swelled into a wave of pure peace." It is present from the first knot, develops through middle beats, and charges the closure ("perfect, accumulated silence"). It enables the spirits' grounding and Elara's own settling. However, it does not constrain a specific choice with cost—it is a result of action rather than a limiting attribute. Strong setup and closure linkage, but no visible tradeoff, caps it just below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Exhume" is signaled early ("to exhume a buried truth") and defines the action across all beats: each knot releases a buried memory (shanty/ribbon, storm, cottage window, sacrificial choice). The final knot exhumes the fisherman's ultimate secret, which triggers the closure. The action is irreplaceable—"unraveling" or "revealing" would lack the burial/unearthing weight that ties to the spirits' anchorage in grief. Strong causal pressure, beat involvement, and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The method is signaled early ("by unraveling knots in the net") and its mechanics drive every beat: "worked with surgeon's precision," "teasing apart hemp fibers," "knot by stubborn knot." The net is present from the dais to the closure ("empty net, now smooth and serene"). The specificity of the fisherman's net (centuries-old, salt-bleached, with lead weight and blue ribbon) makes it irreplaceable. The unraveling process constrains Elara's choices (she must work each knot individually) and the final knot's surrender triggers the climax. Setup, development, and closure participation are all strong.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary is anchored in the opening and its mechanics (prisms fracturing starlight into sapphire/silver rivers) establish the atmosphere. The obsidian dais provides the platform for the net. At closure, "starlight, no longer fractured by sorrow, pooled gently" reweights the setting's symbolic role. However, the setting does not constrain Elara's choices mid-scene—she could perform this ritual elsewhere. The prisms and starlight are decorative rather than tactical. Strong setup and closure reprise, but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Across sharing a secret" is present in the middle beat ("The secret began to unfold across the sharing of this memory") and at closure (fisherman's final secret revealed). However, time is not tracked as a tightening constraint—Elara works at her own pace without urgency. The "sharing" is one-directional (Elara speaks truths; spirits dissolve) rather than reciprocal. The timeframe is more thematic label than mechanical pressure. Lyric presence without causal constraint caps it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to ground restless spirits" is stated immediately ("quiet imperative") and drives every beat: Elara unravels knots to release memories and silence the spirits' "constant dissonance." The final knot's resolution achieves the goal (spirits dissolve). Friction emerges when grounding the spirits forces Elara to confront her own fractures, though this cost is more revealed than dramatized as a conflicting want. Strong setup, beat involvement, and closure linkage, with minor friction visible on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Lucid unrest" is named in the penultimate paragraph ("The lucid unrest that had defined her existence...began to settle") and modulates from the opening's "fractured spirit" and "restless spirits" dissonance to the closure's "perfect, accumulated silence." The tone's clarity-amid-turmoil quality is consistent through turns. However, it is more told than embodied in diction and rhythm—prose remains uniformly elevated and figurative rather than sharpening under pressure. Coherent modulation and closure charge, but static execution caps it at mid-6s.</comment>
