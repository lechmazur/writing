<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Corbin's motivation (navigate without moving) is clear and distinct, but his interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("spirit yearned to map the canyon's true geography—not of stone, but of resonance") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice—humming the foundational tone and becoming a bridge—feels more asserted than earned through prior micro-decisions under pressure. Emotional progression is largely contemplative without visceral conflict; thepiece tells us his resolve is "weathered" and "scarred by decades of failed dawns" but shows no on-page struggle or mistake that would dramatize those limits.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the Pulse's bifurcation is revealed through the bird pattern, then integrated through Corbin's humming, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid) where he becomes the canyon's anchor. Cost is conceptual—he "did not rise… did not need to," foreclosing physical motion—but the price feels more stated than viscerally demonstrated. Orientation is present by line five (elder in throne, canyon). One meaningful deepening occurs when the flock splits, reweighting the stakes from "lost Pulse" to "bifurcated Pulse needing integration."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The bone towers and canyon echoes are vividly rendered ("rib cages vast as cathedrals," "tusk-spired tower") and constraining: Corbin's brittle body binds him to the throne, making stillness the only viable tactic. The stone arrowhead's warmth and vibration at the climax directly charge the final act. Spatial choreography is clear (throne, towers, fissure, rim), and the birds' flight paths map the resonance geography, turning setting into actionable information.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving—is signaled early and drives one meaningful deepening: the flock's split reveals the Pulse is bifurcated, not lost, forcing Corbin to shift from seeking direction to becoming integration. Agency is present (he hums the First Song), but the turn feels more like enacting a solution than wrestling with a dilemma. The cost (remaining seated, becoming the anchor) is legible but contemplative; there's no on-page trade-off or foreclosed alternative that narrows options under friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: navigation via stillness, integration of dust and sky, seeker becoming sanctuary. The arrowhead's return to the throne niche and the birds' convergence into a sphere are concrete images that reweight the premise without moralizing. However, lines like "from seeker to sanctuary" and "paths walked inward" edge toward abstract summation. The piece resists a tidy moral but offers little ambiguity or counter-reading; the resolution feels harmonious rather than complex.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Single POV, third-person limited, stable and apt. Perceptual signature is present—Corbin sees "libraries" in bone, "sacred page[s]" in dust—but the prose often elevates into lyric register ("whispers layered through centuries," "chorus of memory") that feels more authorial than character-specific. Psychic distance is consistent, though filter verbs ("he saw," "he understood") occasionally dull immediacy. No dialogue. Diction remains within a contemplative-mystical register throughout, which fits the concept but offers limited modulation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Rhythm is ceremonial and sustained, but density suffers: multiple adjacent sentences restate the same idea in elevated synonyms (e.g., paragraph two's "monolithic spines, colossal skulls, rib cages vast as cathedrals" and "hollow chambers amplifying each breath into a chorus of memory" both describe the towers' acoustic scale without advancing situation). Paraphrase loops appear in the opening (wind/dust/prayers; bone/libraries/pages) and at closure ("did not rise… did not need to" followed by "weathered resolve had become the canyon's new harmonic anchor"). Figurative language is dense throughout without pattern-teaching, and some metaphors blur (dust as "forgotten prayers," "living river of shadow and light"). Template cadence: several sentences open with "The [noun]" or "[Possessive] [trait/motivation]" in succession. Stock phrases like "quiet urgency" and "breath stilled" appear. Line-level clarity is generally intact, but momentum drags under decorative layering. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops, −0.4 for template cadence, −0.3 for figurative density without payoff = baseline deduction ~−1.3 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The premise—navigate via stillness by integrating a bifurcated Pulse—offers a non-obvious angle on the "seeker becomes guide" arc. The bird-flock appraisal and the arrowhead's sympathetic vibration are specific choices that anchor the mystical in observable phenomena. However, the emotional and thematic arc (elder learns unity, becomes anchor) follows a familiar wisdom-quest template without transformation through lived friction or moral calculus. The resolution feels preordained rather than earned through surprise or risk. Proximity check passes; no close echoes of famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Corbin is present throughout, and his decision to hum the First Song is the climactic act. However, his on-page choices are minimal: he watches, understands, hums, and places the arrowhead. These are more enactments of insight than contested decisions that alter tactics under pressure. Setup clear, middle observation-driven, payoff present but passive agency. Cap at 4.6 for observation-heavy middle; +0.2 for closure participation = 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The stone arrowhead appears in paragraph four (clutched, humming with memory), vibrates in sympathy during the bird dance (paragraph sixteen), is placed over Corbin's heart while he hums (paragraph eighteen), and is nestled into the throne niche at closure (paragraph twenty-two). Four distinct beats, causal pressure (its vibration confirms the Pulse's presence and unity), closure linkage (final act of return/seed), specificity (knapped by First Builder hands, spiraled etchings). Early signal +0.5, four beats +1.4, causal +0.8, closure +1.0, specificity +0.4 = 7.3 (rounded down from 7.1 base + 3.1).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The Pulse left wandering is introduced in paragraph five, frames the central problem (navigation without moving), is revealed bifurcated in paragraph fifteen, and is integrated in paragraph nineteen (dual harmonics merge). It shapes stakes (find/restore the Pulse) and the ending's success (Pulse unified, canyon echoes purposeful). Setup by first third, middle revelation reweights tactics, closure delivers integration. Three gates met; causal pressure across beats; closure linkage strong. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal +1.0, closure +1.2 = 6.1 (rounded down from base 3.0 + 3.7).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Historically reverent" appears in paragraph three as label ("Corbin was historically reverent to his marrow") and informs his treatment of the arrowhead and dust, but no on-page choice dramatizes a trade-off between reverence and another need. It colors motivation but does not constrain action with visible cost. Setup present, no middle friction, ornamental at closure. Cap 4.6 for missing development; −0.8 for label-only, −0.3 for ornamental = 3.2 (rounded down from 4.6 − 1.1).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Appraise is the method by which Corbin assesses the Pulse (paragraph seven: "appraise the Pulse's fractured state… through the patterns in a flock of birds"). The bird observation (paragraphs ten–fifteen) is the appraisal in action, yielding the bifurcation revelation that redefines the problem. The action is signaled, executed, and pivotal. Setup +0.5, one major beat (observation → insight) +0.4, causal +1.0, closure indirect (insight enables solution) +0.5 = 6.8 (rounded down from base 3.0 + 2.4 + indirect closure).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The flock of birds is introduced in paragraph seven (echo-weavers whose feathers shift with sound currents), observed descending and splitting in paragraphs ten–fifteen (the appraisal), and converges into a shimmering sphere in paragraph nineteen to complete the integration. Three beats, causal (their split reveals bifurcation, their convergence enacts unity), closure participation strong. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal +1.2, closure +1.4, specificity (iridescent feathers, sound-tracking) +0.5 = 7.6 (rounded down from base 3.0 + 5.2).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The bone towers and canyon are present from the opening, anchor Corbin's immobility (brittle body on bone throne), and amplify his humming in paragraph eighteen ("vibration traveling through his bones into the throne beneath him"). The towers witness the closure (paragraph twenty-four) and their echoes shift from directionless to purposeful, charging the final image. Setup immediate, middle constrains (body brittle, throne immobile), closure resonance strong. Early signal +0.8, causal constraint +1.0, closure charge +1.2, specificity +0.5 = 6.4 (rounded down from base 3.0 + 3.5).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Centuries of layered dust" appears in the opening and paragraph twenty-two ("layered dust settled around his feet"), framing deep time but not creating urgency. No on-page clock tightens decisions; Corbin's "decades of failed dawns" (paragraph eight) is backstory, not present pressure. Time is thematic texture, not tactical constraint. Setup present, no middle pressure, closure reprise ornamental. Cap 4.6 for missing development; −0.4 for ornamental use = 4.2, adjust down to 4.1 for swappability (centuries could be "ages" without impact).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The motivation "to learn to navigate without moving" is stated in paragraph six, drives the appraisal method (watching birds rather than walking), and is fulfilled at closure when Corbin becomes the stationary anchor. Friction is present: his brittle body (paragraph six) and "decades of failed dawns" (paragraph eight) imply prior struggle, though not dramatized on the page. Setup clear, middle method tied to it, closure delivers. Early signal +0.6, two beats (appraisal, integration) +0.9, causal +1.0, closure +1.2, cost (renouncing motion) +0.4 = 7.2 (rounded down from base 3.0 + 4.1).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Weathered resolve" is named in paragraph eight and recurs in paragraph twenty-three ("His weathered resolve had become the canyon's new harmonic anchor"). The tone is ceremonial, contemplative, and sustained throughout—no tonal modulation under pressure, but coherent and matching the material. The final image (Corbin seated, dust settling, spirit flowing) is charged by the tone's consistency. Setup explicit, no middle shift (static mood), closure charge moderate. Early signal +0.4, closure charge +0.9, coherence +0.6 = 6.7 (rounded down from base 3.0 + 1.9), but static single mood caps practical ceiling; adjust to 6.7.</comment>
