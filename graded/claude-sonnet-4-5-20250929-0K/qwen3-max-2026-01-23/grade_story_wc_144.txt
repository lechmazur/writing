<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her tactile mastery is well-embodied through sensory particulars. However, her agency operates entirely without friction or internal contradiction—she executes a repair with unbroken calm and no moment where competence wavers or competing impulses surface. The final satisfaction is declared rather than earned through visible cost or renunciation; she ends precisely where she began, making the arc more demonstration than transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when by the second paragraph and maintains a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens through the water-basin ritual. The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: her covenant with her method persists), but the cost remains conceptual and retrospective rather than legibly felt on the page. The repair succeeds without complication, and the final image recycles the opening's "magnetic calm" and water symbolism without a decisive reweighting or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The mist-coated depot, cedar-scented shop, and especially the slate basin fed by the copper heron spout are vividly rendered and specific. The water feature directly constrains Elara's method—she reads refraction to diagnose the fracture—meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Sensory detail is filtered through her blindness (warmth/shadow on skin, vibration through floor), anchoring POV bias. The spatial choreography remains clear across moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (repair the drone before the ship departs) is signaled early and the harbor bell provides a time marker. However, pressure never tightens: Elara proceeds methodically without reversal, complication, or visible tradeoff. The resin application succeeds on the first attempt, and the drone's awakening is straightforward affirmation. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or cost is required; here the escalation is atmospheric declaration rather than dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme (blindness as deeper sight, restoration as sacred listening) emerges organically from the water-basin diagnosis and Elara's tactile mastery. The final image of the water feature as "symbol of her enduring covenant with hope" and the closing line "magnetic calm of her purpose remained" veer toward overt thematic statement rather than resonant non-literal answer. The piece resists tidy morals elsewhere but summarizes its own meaning in the final paragraph, weakening subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third, and diction is controlled with consistent perceptual signature (light through water translated to warmth/shadow on skin, "voices" in metal fatigue). Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the repair. However, elevated register ("magnetic calm settling over her like a familiar cloak," "sanctuary of ordered warmth") occasionally drifts above the tactile immediacy that anchors most beats, and the final paragraph's reflective summary flattens voice into thematic declaration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sensory detail is specific (moonstone-infused resin warmed "pliable as honey," brush "finer than spider silk"). However, template stems recur across the final third: "She [verb]" opens six sentences in quick succession during the patch sequence, and paraphrase loops appear ("calm," "magnetic calm," "profound calm" within two paragraphs). The closing lines cycle through theme statements ("she saw the path," "her calm a steady anchor," "magnetic calm of her purpose") without advancing pressure, triggering −0.6 for cadence and loop artifacts in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The core premise—blind artisan uses water refraction to repair intricate tech—is specific and freshly synthesized. However, the execution trends toward demonstration of the method rather than transformation through risk. Elara's unbroken competence and the frictionless success curve lack the bold stakes or non-obvious moral calculus that elevate originality. The mist-and-steam setting and the hummingbird drone are vivid but not leveraged to complicate her mastery, leaving the piece grounded in craft without ingenuity in conflict design.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara selects resin, warms it, mixes conductive dust, applies the patch, and releases the drone—multiple on-page decisions that advance the repair. Her choices create the key turn (drone awakens) and her method shapes all tactics. However, these are procedural steps rather than dilemma-driven agency; no choice forecloses a path or incurs visible cost, capping the score below high integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The drone appears in the opening (setup), is examined and repaired across multiple beats (development), and is released in the final sequence (payoff). Its fractured crystal drives the stakes, and its awakening hum confirms closure. Specificity is high: jeweled wings, thorax joint, guidance crystal. However, it does not return with reweighted meaning; its role is linear problem-object rather than charged motif.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The repair shop frames the setting and Elara's role, appearing early and housing the climactic patch work. It shapes tactics (the water basin is part of her shop's design) and provides spatial coherence. However, "repair shop" as concept functions primarily as backdrop; the water-refraction method and Elara's blindness supply the causal mechanics, making the shop itself replaceable with any workspace containing the basin.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Blindness is signaled early, constrains Elara's method (she reads warmth/shadow rather than visual detail), and enables the water-refraction technique. The attribute appears across beats and charges the thematic closure ("she was blind, yet she saw"). However, the constraint is bypassed so seamlessly—her tactile and thermal senses are flawless—that visible cost or tradeoff never surfaces, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The patch is prepared, applied, and tested on the page; its success triggers the drone's awakening and enables the release. The action drives the climax and shapes the ending. Early setup (fractured crystal diagnosis) and specificity (moonstone resin, conductive silver dust, spider-silk brush) make it essential. However, the patch succeeds without complication or visible cost, slightly reducing its causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The water-feature method is introduced early, demonstrated in the diagnosis beat (light refraction reveals the fissure), and reprised in the verification beat (smooth amber flow confirms the fix). It shapes two key actions and is tied to Elara's blindness, making it functionally necessary. However, the mechanics are told rather than tested under friction; one application would suffice, and the second is confirmation rather than discovery.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The mist-coated rail depot anchors the opening and provides the time pressure (anchor lifting, harbor bell). However, the repair occurs entirely within the shop's interior; the depot's mist, steam, and gantries supply atmosphere but do not constrain Elara's choices or supply resources that affect the outcome. The setting is vivid but functionally ornamental to the repair stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The maiden voyage deadline is established early and the harbor bell tolls as a final warning during the patch application, creating temporal pressure. However, Elara's focus remains "absolute" and untroubled; the timeframe does not force a tradeoff or alter her method. The drone is released successfully, so the clock's threat never materializes, leaving it as backdrop tension rather than tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—to decode mechanical feedback into precise healing direction—is stated early and drives her use of the water basin. Her refusal to guess and commitment to her method shape the diagnosis and patch beats. However, the motivation is never tested by friction or competing desire; she executes without doubt or cost, making it a guiding principle rather than a dramatized internal conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Magnetic calm is declared in the opening, invoked during the patch sequence ("magnetic calm settling over her"), and repeated in the closing line ("magnetic calm of her purpose remained"). Tone is coherent and consistent but static; it does not modulate with the harbor bell's urgency or the drone's awakening. The lack of tonal shift under pressure limits its charge, and the final reprise feels ornamental rather than earned through contrast.</comment>
