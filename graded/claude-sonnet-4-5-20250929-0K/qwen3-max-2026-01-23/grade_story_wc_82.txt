<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—to transform grief by folding it into cranes—is clear and drives her actions through polishing, recording, and folding. The shadow detachment is offered as backstory, creating an emotional anchor, but interiority leans toward abstraction ("quiet, desperate alchemy," "visceral recollection") rather than embodied contradiction. The final tear and acknowledgment offer a credible micro-shift, though the choice to continue folding feels more like reaffirmation than genuine transformation with foreclosed paths. The piece stays within BRR allowances and ties reflection to present micro-choices, but the closure moment lacks the visceral cost that would push this higher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph: Elara, floating island tea garden, post-shadow detachment. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: polishing → basilica ritual → dream recording → origami folding builds density and culminates in a pattern break (the tear of acknowledgment rather than despair). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image reweights the grief-folding ritual with renewed purpose and undeniable emotional pressure. Cost is legible in "the grief would be folded again" and the recognition that torment remains but now has bearable shape. The lens holds, though the accumulation could tighten with fewer mid-story abstractions to reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating island, tea garden, glass basilica, and workshop are established early with vivid sensory detail ("waterfalls cascading into misty voids," "crystalline walls," "silver-leafed blooms"). Spatial choreography is clean across moves: workshop → path → basilica → back to workshop. The gem and paper function as micro-setting elements that constrain action (polishing precision, folding geometry). However, the environment itself doesn't force a choice at closure—the physical world remains backdrop rather than active constraint. The recurring crane-filled windowsill charges the final image but doesn't alter tactics, keeping this shy of 8.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming unbearable grief into bearable form—is signaled early and sustained through polishing, recording, and folding. Pressure accumulates through the Accumulative lens: each ritual step deepens the process until the final crane placement and decision to continue. The choice to fold again forecloses retreat with visible emotional cost (the acknowledgment tear, the acceptance that torment persists). However, the escalation path is smooth rather than sharply tightened; no reversal or mid-story complication tests commitment. Agency is present in the decision to persist, but a single meaningful deepening without a turn or forced trade-off caps this below 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—grief as material that can be shaped but not erased—emerges organically from the polishing, recording, and folding actions without overt statement. The final image (selecting another sheet of paper) offers a resonant answer: transformation is iterative, not conclusive. The crane motif accumulates across beats and shifts meaning at closure from monument to ongoing practice. However, "luminous torment" and "descent into ascent" edge toward thematic echo; the shadow's "light it once provided" risks sentimentality. The piece resists tidy resolution and invites reflection through purposeful ambiguity, keeping it solidly in the 7-range with minor slips preventing higher entry.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with consistent psychic distance and no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in craft-filtered observations ("valley fold here, a mountain fold there") and embodied grief ("world had shrunk to the size of her grief"). However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction during emotional peaks ("quiet, desperate alchemy," "essential attribute," "paradoxical state") that feel more authorial than character-particular. Voice modulates appropriately with pressure but lacks strong rhythmic distinctiveness. Free indirect style is clean; no dialogue is present to judge. The prose serves the character but doesn't achieve a singular, irreplaceable texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Clarity and concision are generally solid with purposeful detail, but several passages carry overwriting: "impossible beauty," "woven from light and longing," "torment transmuted into tenderness" stack metaphor without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the middle third: "It was not erased; it was shaped... It was not a tear of despair, but of acknowledgment." Minor paraphrase loop at "The grief would be folded again" versus prior folding description. No major artifacts touch closure, but density in high-pressure beats (dream-recording sequence) dilutes propulsion. Information density is adequate but not exceptional; these cumulative issues prevent entry to 7.5+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of grief-processing through lantern-making and origami folding in a floating-island setting offers a specific, non-obvious angle. The dream-recording mechanism and shadow-detachment premise are particular to this world. However, the emotional arc—artisan transforming grief through repeated craft ritual—follows a recognizable template, and the resolution (continuing the work) is structurally familiar. The "descend to ascend" paradox is stated rather than discovered. Details are grounded and voice-consistent, but the premise doesn't transform its template through unexpected moral calculus or a turn that redefines prior material. Solid mid-band originality with room for bolder risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara drives all three major beats: polishing the gem (opening), performing the dream-recording ritual (middle), and folding the crane with the decision to continue (closure). Each choice narrows options and alters tactics under the Accumulative lens. Her decision to select another sheet of paper at the end forecloses retreat and crystallizes her purpose with visible emotional cost. Early signal, multi-beat involvement, causal pressure, and closure linkage all present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The glass basilica appears in setup (Elara walks toward it), middle (she enters and performs the ritual inside), and closure (referenced as part of the floating island ascending). It provides the spatial crucible for the dream-recording transformation. However, its specific properties (intricate fragility, light-woven structure) don't constrain tactics—any sacred space could serve the same function. Present across beats but not irreplaceable; functional rather than essential.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dream recording is signaled early (polishing gem for "sacred duty: to record a dream"), drives the central basilica ritual where grief is "drawn into the gem's light, refined by the recording process," and its output (luminescent paper) enables the origami folding at closure. The mechanics matter: only polished surfaces achieve distortion-free recording. The concept shapes stakes (transforming raw grief into shapeable form) and tactics (the ritual sequence). Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Descends while ascending" is introduced early as "essential attribute of her craft" and embodied in the dream-recording beat: "consciousness ascended... Simultaneously, she descended." It constrains the ritual process (must descend into torment to ascend into dream-realm) and the island's literal ascent contrasts with her emotional descent throughout. However, the trait operates more as thematic device than tactical constraint—removing it wouldn't break the mechanics. Present across beats with thematic charge but mid-band on causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Transform" is the through-line: polishing transforms quartz, dream-recording transforms grief, folding transforms paper. The action drives all three major beats and the closure effect (grief given bearable shape). Each transformation step narrows options and accumulates pressure toward the final choice to continue the practice. The word "transformation" appears explicitly at the climactic folding beat. Swapping this action for another verb would require wholesale restructuring. Strong causal pressure, beat involvement, and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Gem polishing opens the story, is named as Elara's "life's work," and its mechanics (circular motion, tear-dampened cloth, achieving perfect surface) are shown on the page. The method enables the dream-recording by preparing the gem for distortion-free capture. However, after setup it yields to the ritual and folding; polishing itself doesn't return or constrain later choices. Present early, causal for one beat, but doesn't shape closure directly. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The floating island tea garden is established early with vivid detail (waterfalls, silver-leafed blooms, ascending air currents) and frames all action. The workshop among tea bushes provides the folding-paper finale, and the island's ascent contrasts Elara's descent throughout. However, the setting functions primarily as atmospheric container—the tea bushes, waterfalls, and floating mechanism don't constrain tactics or provide resources that alter outcome. Early signal and closure presence with lyric reprise (ascending island) but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the shadow detaches" is anchored early ("three moons since"), establishes the wound that motivates all action, and returns at closure ("silent thank you to the shadow for the light it once provided"). The temporal marker creates urgency (grief still raw) and the recent loss explains both the ritual's emotional intensity and the decision to persist. The shadow detachment shapes every beat's emotional charge. Strong setup and payoff with coherent pressure, though the three-moon gap itself doesn't tighten tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation—to fold grief into origami cranes—is named early, drives the polishing and recording preparation, and culminates in the on-page folding sequence where "grief fold inward, compacted into something small, beautiful, and bearable." The friction between wanting relief and accepting that "torment remained luminous" creates visible cost. The final choice to select another sheet dramatizes renewed commitment with the cost of ongoing labor. Early signal, multi-beat involvement, causal pressure at closure, and embodied friction between desire and reality.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Luminous torment" is established in the opening (polished gem, "world had shrunk to the size of her grief") and sustained through the dream-recording paradox (ascending/descending), the cranes as "luminous monument to folded sorrow," and the final image of ongoing craft "in the luminous torment of the floating island tea garden." Tone modulates appropriately—compressed anguish in the ritual, fragile peace in the folding, quiet resolve at closure—and charges the final image with undeniable pressure. The exact phrase appears at closure, reweighting prior usage. Strong coherence and closure participation.</comment>
