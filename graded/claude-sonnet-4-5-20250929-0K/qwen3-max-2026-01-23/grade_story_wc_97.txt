<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—strategically creative grief-work—is coherent and her choice to enter the arbor is earned, but her interiority relies heavily on label-speak ("steely longing," "strategically creative") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final laugh and "renewed purpose" feel declarative rather than embodied through micro-choices that reveal competing desires. Leo's spectral appearance offers closure, but the protagonist's transformation reads more as relief than a genuine foreclosure with visible cost. Internal conflict is summarized more than dramatized at peak beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The closure—clock hands moving from 3:17 to 3:18—lands on the page and offers a Decisive Change with conceptual cost (one minute restored, not full resurrection). However, the journey to the arbor proceeds through convenience: the film-reel cipher is explained rather than discovered through friction, and the projector/ritual sequence lacks causality testing (no false starts, no price for entry). The lens reads Causal-leaning Hybrid, but the middle escalation ("flickering compasses" guide without real wrong turns) weakens the because/therefore chain. Orientation is clear early, preventing penalty there.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The tidal arbor is vividly rendered (abalone bark, mercury leaves, lavender sky) and the flickering compasses guide Elara's path, but the environment functions more as backdrop than constraint—no wrong turn or spatial friction alters her tactics. The station terminal anchors the frame cleanly. The broken clock is handled across beats (bench, clutched during ascent, placed on the arbor piano) and charges the final image when its hands move, qualifying as micro-setting that participates in closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reaching the arbor to commune with Leo and "surprise fate"—is signaled early, but escalation is linear: Elara decodes the cipher, plays the sequence, ascends, follows compasses, plays the duet, and succeeds without meaningful friction or cost during the attempt. The compasses "flicker violently" but settle "decisively," offering guidance rather than testing her resolve. The clock's one-minute advance at closure provides a tightening conceptual cost, but the middle lacks a reversal or tactical price that narrows options under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—love transcending time's tyranny—emerges through the broken clock, the arbor ritual, and the final one-minute restoration. The duet as "unplanned encore" and "defiant coda" are vivid particulars. However, the final paragraph edges toward thesis statement ("a different light had taken root") and Elara's "steely laugh" followed by "renewed purpose" feels moralized rather than resonant. The clock's micro-advance is a strong non-literal answer, but the terminal epilogue over-explains the shift rather than trusting the image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and the prose carries a heightened, lyric register ("coaxed a fragile melody," "time flowed like the sea"). Elara's perceptual signature—pianist's attention to sound, "strategically creative" framing—is consistent, but elevated diction ("steely longing," "liminal hour," "sonic key") recurs in peak beats without variation, flattening voice under pressure. No dialogue appears; the Leo vision is silent, which suits the tone. Psychic distance is controlled, though the final paragraph's "quiet resolve" and "renewed purpose" read more declarative than filtered through her immediate perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense throughout high-pressure beats: "tethered to," "monument to time's cruel punctuation," "veils between worlds grew thin," "heart-maps," "pulsed with the music's crescendo," "love resonates beyond time's tyranny." Multiple adjacent sentences in the arbor sequence rely on elevated metaphor without grounding action, creating opacity. Template cadence appears in the middle: "She landed... she saw... one compass... she followed... she would fulfill... placing the broken clock... she closed her eyes... she poured." Paraphrase loop: "flicker" and compass guidance are restated across three consecutive beats without added pressure. The final "different light had taken root" echoes the opening's "afternoon light bled through," but the return feels decorative rather than earned by a pattern taught early.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—hidden cipher in a film reel unlocking a liminal arbor—combines portal fantasy and grief-work, but the emotional arc (bereaved partner seeks magical reunion, receives peaceful closure) follows a familiar template without fresh moral calculus or lived complication. The flickering compasses as "heart-maps" is a vivid detail, yet they guide without friction, reducing their transformation of the trope. The one-minute clock advance offers a specific inflection, but the safe middle—she succeeds, gains peace, returns renewed—avoids the bold risk that might elevate originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara (wistful station pianist) makes the key choice to decode the cipher and perform the ritual, but her decisions proceed without reversals—she is guided by compasses rather than forced to weigh competing costs. Present in setup (opening paragraph), middle (decoding, playing), and ending (performing duet, receiving the clock's change), meeting all three gates. Causal role is functional but her occupation as pianist matters primarily for tone and the duet skill; "wistful" is a label more than a trait shaping tactics. Swappable with "grieving musician" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The broken anniversary clock appears in setup (piano bench, frozen at 3:17), is clutched during ascent (middle), placed on the arbor piano stand (middle beat two), and its hands move to 3:18 at closure, directly charging the final image and providing the story's primary conceptual cost. Three distinct beats, all three gates, closure linkage strong, and the clock's specific frozen time (moment of Leo's death) makes it irreplaceable. The one-minute advance is the story's decisive change, earning high integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Flickering compasses (core concept) appear only in the arbor sequence (after midpoint), guide Elara's path by locking onto emotional truths, but do not constrain or test her—they settle "decisively" without wrong turns or cost. Present in middle (guidance) and contribute atmospheric charge, but late first appearance and lack of friction cap the score. Swappable with any magical wayfinding device (glowing threads, spirit guides) without altering the story's logic. Missing setup gate; functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Strategically creative" (attribute) is named in paragraph four and again in the arbor ("her strategically creative spirit recognized the pattern"), but no on-page action demonstrates this trait under pressure—she follows the compasses' guidance rather than solving a puzzle or improvising a workaround. The cipher decoding is recounted, not dramatized, so the trait remains label-only. Present in setup exposition and middle narration but does not enable or constrain a visible choice with cost. Swappable with "determined" or "resourceful."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Refuge" (action) is stated as her purpose ("This was the refuge she sought") and drives the journey's goal, but the story's major turn is the clock's restoration and Leo's spectral confirmation of peace, not the act of seeking refuge itself. The refuge frames her motivation and shapes two beats (entering the arbor, finding the clearing), meeting setup and middle gates, but at closure the emphasis shifts to the duet and the clock. Essential but not indispensable—rephrasing to "reunion" or "communion" would preserve the arc with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The black-and-white film reel with "hidden sections" (method) is introduced in paragraph five, its mechanics explained (microscopic notations, star charts), and used once (threaded into projector, played as "sonic key") to trigger the arbor transition. Present in setup exposition and middle action, meeting two gates, but the method is convenience—no failed attempt, no cost for decoding. At closure, the projector is "dark" but the reel does not return or reweight. Functional enabler but swappable with any encoded ritual object.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tidal arbor (setting) is vividly described (abalone bark, mercury leaves, cloud-ocean) and provides the stage for the duet and Leo's appearance, meeting middle and closure gates. However, it functions as backdrop rather than constraint—no environmental friction alters Elara's tactics, and the moonwood piano is a gift rather than a challenge. The arbor's "breath" and cyclone of leaves participate in the closure image, adding atmospheric charge, but specificity without pressure caps the score in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Until the horizon invites night" (timeframe) is mentioned twice: "liminal hour until the horizon invited night" and "as the horizon blazed its final invitation to night." The ritual window is vague (dusk to full night) and never tightens decisions—Elara completes the duet before the deadline without time pressure forcing a tradeoff. Present in setup and closure narration but does not alter tactics. Swappable with "during twilight" or "at the liminal hour" without impact. Functional atmosphere but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"To surprise fate with an unplanned encore" (motivation) is stated mid-story ("Here, she would fulfill her motivation") and echoed at closure ("she had surprised fate"). It frames her goal and provides thematic charge, but the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants—no on-page moment shows her weighing the cost of defying grief versus accepting loss. Present in middle exposition and closure reflection, meeting two gates, but the motivation remains abstract until the clock's change externalizes it. Functional but the friction between want and cost is asserted, not embodied.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>"Steely longing" (tone) is named twice ("breath shallow with steely longing," "steely laugh") and the prose sustains a wistful, elevated register throughout (fragile melody, hollow ache, fevered whispers, quiet resolve). The tone modulates slightly—wistful at opening, determined during the ritual, peaceful at closure—but "steely" as a descriptor feels imposed rather than emergent from diction and rhythm. The final image ("twilight resilience," "different light") carries coherent emotional charge. Tone is consistent and charges the ending but lacks the syntactic embodiment that would lift it above mid-6s.</comment>
