<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is stated but never tested by contradictory impulses in scene. The internal experience remains abstract—"featherly determined resolve," "quiet ache"—without embodied emotion or visible micro-choices under pressure. The tear at the end is the sole physical marker, but acceptance arrives without dramatized struggle or foreclosed paths. No meaningful change occurs; she completes a pilgrimage to understanding without cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (acceptance of necessary distances), but cost remains entirely abstract—no on-page action, forfeiture, or altered tactic demonstrates what Elara gives up or what path she forecloses. The piece is retrospective meditation rather than present-scene pressure; the logbook entry and mother's disappearance anchor the reflection, but no causal turn tightens options in the present. Orientation is clear (who, where, when by the opening), but the drive lens is ambiguous: accumulative texture competes with a causal framing that never delivers because/therefore linkage in the present scene. The final image ("fractured hush settled around her like a blessing") reweights prior material conceptually but without felt price on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace supplies vivid sensory anchors—emerald light, fractured hush, ozone—and the bench's wood grain micro-setting drives Elara's method (analyzing grain). The terrace's angle shift illuminates the spiral pattern, a purposeful detail that charges the ending image. However, the terrace itself does not constrain choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it remains backdrop for reflection rather than participant in pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering why thresholds feel sacred—is signaled early but never faces on-page resistance or complication. No reversal narrows options; Elara traces grain, recalls her mother's words, reads the logbook, and arrives at insight without friction. The stated butterfly effect (the diverted flight) is backstory context, not present-scene escalation. Cost is declared ("painful gap," "necessary distances") but not demonstrated through a trade-off or foreclosed path in the present moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme (necessary distances sanctify thresholds) emerges from image and event—wood grain, maze design, logbook weather code—and the final realization reweights the mother's absence as sacred architecture. However, the ending articulates the theme overtly: "thresholds feel sacred precisely because of the necessary distances honored in reaching them; the journey imbues meaning." This explicit moralizing in the penultimate paragraph replaces scene pressure with thesis statement, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty. The particulars (weather code, maze, bench) are specific and non-generic, which prevents a lower score.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; distance and focalization remain consistent. Diction carries a distinct lyric register—"featherly determined," "fractured hush," "ozone and possibility"—that creates texture but risks elevating above the character's demonstrated voice under pressure. Purposeful compression and patterned vocabulary (e.g., "fractured hush" recurs as motif) are legible and taught by repetition, so experimental tolerance applies. However, perceptual signature is generic in peak beats: Elara's noticing is poetic but not character-specific (anyone could trace grain and see spirals). No dialogue to test voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—"breathless space," "featherly determined," "tapestry of understood truths"—without pattern-teaching or visible payoff beyond texture. Adjacent lines paraphrase without added pressure: "The fractured hush was no longer empty silence; it was a tapestry of understood truths" immediately follows "Her featherly determined spirit held firm with acceptance." Template cadence appears in the middle third: multiple paragraphs open with "She [verb]" or "The [noun]." These artifacts dull momentum and trigger the patterned-artifact penalty pack. Information density is moderate; many lines restate insight rather than advance it. Clarity remains intact, so no causality break.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The synthesis—pilot's weather code as metaphor for life's necessary distances, maze architecture as grief's framework—is thematically coherent and non-obvious. The logbook and corn maze integration feels organic rather than checklist. However, the emotional arc (lost child seeks understanding, finds acceptance through reflection) follows a familiar template without a risky inflection. The butterfly effect framing is invoked by title but remains abstract backstory rather than on-page transformation. Specificity (weather code "CB BUILDING RAPID, DIVERT WEST, SEEK CLEAR") elevates above generic, but the resolution—acceptance through remembered wisdom—is a median choice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her choices (tracing grain, opening logbook, walking to terrace edge) structure the sequence, but these are observational rituals rather than decisions that narrow options or alter tactics. Setup clear; middle involves the logbook; closure shows her walking to the edge with "quiet confidence." However, no choice creates a key turn—she moves through a predetermined meditation without friction or cost. Functional but swappable with another reflective protagonist.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The logbook appears early (setup), is opened and read mid-scene (development), and the weather code "SEEK CLEAR" is reweighted under prism light at closure. Two distinct beats (withdrawal from satchel, reading under emerald light). The code "CB BUILDING RAPID, DIVERT WEST, SEEK CLEAR" supplies the story's central metaphor (necessary distances). However, the logbook does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under stress; it provides remembered meaning rather than present-scene pressure. Closure linkage is metaphorical (the code glows, Elara intuits connection) rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Necessary distances" is seeded early (mother's voice: "the space between stalks was as vital as the path itself"), shapes the reflective stake (why thresholds feel sacred), and is explicitly answered at closure ("thresholds feel sacred precisely because of the necessary distances honored in reaching them"). The concept frames expectation and the ending reweights it as acceptance of absence. However, it operates as theme rather than on-page constraint—it does not narrow options or change tactics in the present scene. All three gates met, but causal pressure is absent.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Featherly determined" appears as label in the fourth paragraph and recurs once near the end ("her featherly determined spirit held firm"). No action is constrained or enabled by this attribute; it describes her manner without dramatizing a tradeoff. The trait does not differentiate her choices from what a "gently persistent" or "quietly resolute" character would do. Label-only use; no visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Intuit" is named twice: "attempted to intuit the deeper resonance" (mid-scene) and "Elara could intuit the connection" (late). The action is central to the reflective method, but it is not dramatized—we see the result (insight) without the mechanics of intuition constraining or enabling a choice. The story turns on this action conceptually, yet it could be swapped for "recognize," "sense," or "grasp" with minor edits. Functional but not irreplaceable; late second appearance lowers the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Analyzing wood grain is seeded early ("meditative practice of analyzing the grain"), executed mid-scene ("fingertips traced the bench's intricate whorls, she saw echoes"), and the grain's spiral pattern is illuminated at closure. Two beats (tracing, illumination). The method shapes her reflective ritual and the spiral echo charges the final realization. However, the mechanics do not constrain a choice—she reads meaning rather than solving a problem through this analysis. Setup and closure gates met; middle development present but passive.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The terrace is introduced in the opening line, the bench sits on it, and the terrace's angle shift sends emerald light across the bench mid-scene. Closure shows Elara at the terrace's edge. Three touches across setup, middle, closure. However, the terrace is postcard backdrop—it does not constrain movement, supply a resource, or pressure a choice. The angle shift is coincidental illumination, not a tactic-altering event. Present across all gates but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the butterfly effect" is title-framing and contextualizes the backstory (mother's diverted flight, subsequent maze, disappearance, years since). The timeframe is vague—no clock or urgency in the present scene. The phrase "in the years since" anchors duration but does not tighten decisions. The butterfly effect is thematic metaphor rather than live pressure. Setup present (title, early reference); closure absent as active force. Swappable with "years later" or "in the aftermath."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation ("to discover why some thresholds feel sacred") is stated early, structures the reflective journey, and is answered at closure ("she had discovered the answer"). Setup, development (tracing grain, reading logbook to explore the question), and payoff all present. However, the desire is never conflicted—no competing want or cost forces a tradeoff. Elara pursues understanding without friction; the motivation drives the frame but not dramatized choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Fractured hush" appears in the opening line, recurs mid-scene ("crowd fell into a collective, fractured hush"), and returns in the final two paragraphs ("fractured hush settled around her like a blessing"). The tone is stable—contemplative, suspended, reverent—and modulates subtly (from "swallow all sound" to "tapestry of understood truths" to "blessing"). Setup and closure clear; middle reprise present. The tone charges the final image with quiet acceptance. However, it does not shift under pressure or constrain a choice; it remains static mood rather than dynamic register.</comment>
