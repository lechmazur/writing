<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's core motivation is clear and her method coherent, but interiority leans heavily toward abstractions ("quiet but fierce," "mended deception") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The marble-polishing ritual embodies persistence, yet the confrontation with Kael resolves too tidily—his panic and flight feel thin, lacking the messy cost or trade-off that would foreclose a path with visible weight. The phoenix vine choice carries some embodied emotion, but the final beats drift toward thematic summary ("wordless covenant") instead of dramatizing the flawed, specific struggle that would elevate the arc.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Orientation is solid (who, where, when by the opening beats), and the causal lens is stable: Elara's polishing ritual frames the confrontation, and the maze's response to Kael's closed heart follows from established lore (the Great Frost backstory, prior marbles). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the maze knows her name, honoring the covenant—with a conceptual cost legible in the contrast between her "scars" and Kael's cracked meter. However, the cost at the ending remains largely implied; the final paragraph ("every crack…beautifully, completely mended") tells more than it shows, and the maze's sentient agency arrives late without prior on-page demonstration. One meaningful tightening (the confrontation) is present, but the turn lacks a second beat of Elara choosing under new pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The garden maze is vividly rendered—jasmine tangled with clematis, moss-stained bench, leaf-shaped niches—and the blooming/withering duality is consistent. The phoenix vine and the marble niche actively constrain Elara's ritual choices, and the living labyrinth sealing Kael's retreat charges the confrontation. Spatial choreography is clear (Elara on bench, Kael at path's edge, thorns coiling), and the yew hedge detail anchors the final image. The luck meter provides a world-rule anchor for the timeframe, though its mechanics remain abstract. Micro-setting (the bench, the marbles in the hedge) effectively functions as the stage for all key actions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving gardens know their gardeners—is signaled early and drives the ritual and confrontation. The phoenix vine's emergence provides one tightening; Kael's arrival and the maze's response form a second reversal that narrows options (his meter cracks, he flees). The cost is visible in the contrast (Elara's 2.9% versus his 98.7%), and the maze's agency forecloses Kael's challenge. However, the resolution feels coincidental rather than earned by Elara's active choice in the moment—the maze acts autonomously, reducing her agency. A second on-page choice or complication driven by Elara herself would have elevated the escalation and cost clarity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme—broken things hold beauty and history—emerges clearly from the marble ritual and the blooming/withering contrast. The "mended deception" concept is integrated through the polishing action and the phoenix vine. However, the final two paragraphs ("The mended deception was clear…") slip into explicit thematic statement ("the world's deception was that broken things lack value") rather than letting the image resonate. The closing line ("every crack…beautifully, completely mended") over-articulates the thesis, undermining the particulars (the marble, the vine) that carried the weight. A quieter final image would have honored the earned work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara; psychic distance is controlled, and the perceptual signature (soil over silicon, breath syncing with motion) is character-specific. The dialogue exchange with Kael is functional and advances the confrontation, though Elara's line "The garden knows a closed heart" borders on thematic exposition. Free indirect style is clean ("wisely pragmatic resolve," "rustle of gratitude deeper than wind"), but occasional elevated diction ("embodied the core concept of mended deception") pulls out of lived voice into meta-commentary. Rhythm modulates well under pressure (short bursts during the confrontation, longer cadences in ritual), and no head-hopping is present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high in the ritual beats. However, paraphrase loops appear: "cracks as failure—a deception of worthlessness. But her polish did not hide flaws; it illuminated them, filling fissures with light, mending the lie by revealing beauty" restates the same idea across three clauses. The phrase "blooming potential and withering history in honest balance" recurs conceptually in multiple forms, and the final paragraph ("every crack in glass or vine was not hidden but healed, not broken but beautifully, completely mended") loops the central metaphor without propulsion. Filter verbs ("she felt the maze exhale," "Elara felt it") cluster in high-pressure beats, dulling immediacy. Template cadence in the opening lines (mapped/tangled, blooming/withering) reads as patterned setup but remains legible. Clarity is strong, but momentum drags in the closing third due to repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The luck-meter world rule and sentient maze offer a fresh synthesis, and the marble ritual transforms the "broken things" trope through specific action (beeswax, lamb's wool, the niche). The blooming/withering duality is purposeful and consistent. However, the maze's autonomy (sealing Kael's retreat, cracking his meter) arrives late without prior on-page demonstration, reducing the sense of inevitability. The thematic architecture (mended deception) is coherent but over-articulated in the text, and the confrontation resolution (Kael flees) lacks the bold risk or non-obvious complication that would distinguish the premise from similar "nature vs. technology" templates. The specificity of the marbles and the phoenix vine elevate the piece within its frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara is on the page throughout. Her choice to polish the marble after the phoenix vine's emergence drives the ritual beat, and her pressing the cobalt marble to release Kael is a second decision that alters tactics. She frames the confrontation ("You measure chance. I measure care") and the ending anchors on her name and covenant. Her withered hands and patience constrain her method. All three gates (setup, development, payoff) are met, and her decisions shape two key beats. However, Kael's expulsion is partly driven by the maze's autonomous action, slightly diluting her agency in the climax. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; cost is visible in the contrast with Kael.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The marble collection is introduced early (velvet pouch, each one cracked) and used in two distinct beats: the polishing ritual for the phoenix vine (milky marble webbed with hairline fractures) and the pressing of the cobalt marble to free Kael. The marbles return at closure ("hundreds…a constellation of trust earned") and their properties (cracks, polish, light) charge the final image. Specificity is high (lamb's wool, beeswax, leaf-shaped niche), and the collection's history (first marble from the rose after the Great Frost) ties to the timeframe and motivation. The marbles could not be swapped without breaking the logic of the ritual and the theme. Cost connection is clear: each fracture marks a saved vine or bloom.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mended deception is explained on the page ("Society saw cracks as failure—a deception of worthlessness. But her polish did not hide flaws; it illuminated them") and shapes the ritual action (polishing to reveal beauty in cracks). It frames the confrontation (Kael's pristine meter versus Elara's trust in care) and returns at closure ("the world's deception…the mending was in seeing history as strength"). However, the concept is largely told rather than tested through a choice where deception/truth alters options. Kael's meter cracks, but the mending mechanic does not constrain or enable a tactical decision in the beat. Setup and payoff gates are met; middle development is weak. The concept themes strongly but does not visibly narrow choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Wisely pragmatic" appears early ("ignored with wisely pragmatic resolve") and is embodied in Elara's dismissal of the luck meter in favor of soil and ritual. It enables her refusal to panic when Kael challenges her (she points to the phoenix vine) and her calm action pressing the marble to release him. The trait constrains her method (she trusts slow, tangible work over quantified fortune) and is paid off at closure (her patience and scars are known). However, the phrase itself is a label; the pragmatism is shown more through the ritual and the vine than through a visible trade-off or cost. Setup and development gates are met; payoff is thematic rather than action-driven.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Polishing is the central action of the ritual beat: Elara selects the milky marble, uses lamb's wool and beeswax, rubs slow circles, and places the gleaming sphere in the niche. The action is tied to the phoenix vine's victory and recurs when she presses the cobalt marble to free Kael. The ending references polishing as a future vow ("polish another marble, add another truth"). The mechanics are specific (breath syncing with motion, filling fissures with light) and cannot be easily swapped. However, the climactic turn (the maze sealing Kael) is driven more by the maze's autonomy than by Elara's polishing in that beat. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met; causal pressure is strong but not singular at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The method is introduced early ("Her method was deliberate ritual: commemorating small victories elaborately, transforming fleeting hope into tangible tribute") and demonstrated through the marble polishing (selecting, polishing with beeswax, whispering, placing in the niche). It shapes the middle beat (honoring the phoenix vine's shoot) and is promised again at closure ("She would polish another marble"). The mechanics matter: the ritual is elaborate (slow circles, breath syncing), and the placement in the hedge's niche creates the constellation of trust. The method is irreplaceable and ties directly to the motivation and theme. However, it does not constrain a tactical choice in the confrontation; Kael's expulsion is driven by the maze, not by Elara performing the ritual under pressure. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The garden maze is on the page throughout: paths where life and decay partner, the emerald curtain, the moss-stained bench, the yew hedge with niches. It pressures the confrontation by sealing Kael's retreat ("Branches sealed his retreat; thorns coiled where path had been") and provides the resource (the cobalt marble in the hedge) that Elara uses to free him. The maze's sentience is established through the Great Frost backstory and the hundreds of marbles earning trust. It charges the final image ("The garden knew her patience…her scars…her name"). Spatial choreography is clear, and the setting constrains choices (Kael's meter cracks when the thorns coil). All three gates are met; causal pressure and closure linkage are strong. The maze is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The timeframe (after luck becomes measurable) is introduced early via the luck meter ("this era where fortune was quantified to three decimal places") and anchors the world rule. It enables the confrontation (Kael's meter blazing 98.7%, Elara's 2.9%) and is paid off when the maze cracks Kael's meter to 0.4%. The Great Frost backstory ties the timeframe to Elara's marble practice. However, the timeframe does not tighten a deadline or constrain a tactical choice in real time; it functions as context rather than a live clock. Setup and payoff gates are met; middle development is weak. The era shapes stakes conceptually but does not pressure the pacing of the scene.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation is stated early ("to prove gardens know their gardeners, that reciprocity outweighed random chance") and drives the ritual (polishing the marble to honor the phoenix vine). It frames the confrontation with Kael ("You measure chance. I measure care. This bloomed because it knew my hands, not my luck") and is paid off at closure ("The garden knew her patience…her scars…her name"). The desire is tested when Kael challenges her methods, and her response (pointing to the vine) dramatizes the friction between her care-based belief and his luck-based worldview. The cost is visible in the contrast (her low meter versus his high one) and in her decades of withering while blooming purpose. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met; causal pressure and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The blooming/withering tone is signaled in the opening ("blooming jasmine tangled with withering clematis," "life and decay existed not as opposites but as partners") and sustained throughout: the phoenix vine's shoot through dead bark, Elara's withered hands, the cracked marbles. It modulates during the confrontation (Kael's rigid immaculacy versus the wild green) and charges the final image ("every vibrant petal and gracefully withering stem with equal reverence"). The tone is coherent and purposeful, reflecting the theme without static repetition. However, it remains atmospheric rather than a driver of tactical pressure; the blooming/withering duality colors perception but does not constrain a choice. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met; tone supports rather than shapes closure.</comment>
