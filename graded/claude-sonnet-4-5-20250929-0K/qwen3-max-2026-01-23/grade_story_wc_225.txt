<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's guilt-driven motivation is consistent and his chess-analogy perception feels character-specific. The exile penance and prince's Scholar's Mate failure ground his interior world. However, the final "deep, quiet peace" arrives without sufficient on-page contradiction or struggle in the decoding sequence itself—he fidgets, winnows threads, and succeeds cleanly. The tearless crying ("could not fall in this frozen realm") and channeled ache feel more asserted than embodied through micro-choices that cost him something in the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is immediate (who, where, frozen village by ~50 words). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through chess metaphor, thread-decoding, and guilt layering until the labyrinth opens and sound returns. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the village awakens; Kael achieves "fierce repose" and ends his self-exile). Cost is present but somewhat abstract—he faced his blunder and "chose forgiveness," yet the on-page price during the decoding feels more intellectual than visceral. The causal spine (decode tapestry → align rings → break stasis) is clean, and the midpoint turn (recognizing the defensive sequence he failed to teach) tightens focus, meeting the one-deepening requirement for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The frozen village is vivid and specific: suspended raindrops, mid-spill flour, moss-crowned well. Sensory details are filtered through Kael's chess-tutor lens (living chessboard, pawn structures). The platinum labyrinth and tapestry border constrain his final action—he must decode threads to manipulate rings—so the micro-setting shapes the closure. The awakening sensory rush (hammer clang, laughter, baker's greeting) charges the ending. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: break the woven hush to atone for his past mistake. Pressure accumulates through the decoding task, which becomes a silent game where "each thread was a move" and "each knot a lesson he'd neglected." The method (winnowing frayed threads, isolating intentional breaks) narrows his path to the labyrinth solution. One meaningful tightening occurs when the border reveals "the perfect defense against Scholar's Mate"—the lesson he denied his prince—forcing him to accept it now. Agency is decision-based (he chooses to decode, align, and release the village), and the village's awakening is the direct result. Cost is somewhat diffuse: he "untangled his own guilt" and "chose forgiveness," but the on-page price during the labor itself is more contemplative than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from the chess-guilt-atonement arc without thesis statements. The tapestry's defensive cipher mirrors the lesson Kael failed to teach, and the final silver king-knot ("wisdom is woven from broken strands") recapitulates the premise without moralizing. The woven hush as gilded cage and the decoding as path to grace both resist simple binaries. The ending offers a resonant answer—he cannot alter the past, but honoring its lesson untangles his guilt—and the distant thunder's shift from metaphor to "merely weather" reweights prior imagery. However, phrases like "fierce repose: the calm of a mind that had faced its blunder, decoded its meaning, and chosen forgiveness" edge toward thematic echo in the penultimate paragraph, summarizing rather than purely showing the realization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, and Kael's chess-tutor perceptual signature is consistent (pawn structures, defensive nuances, silent game). Diction remains elevated and metaphor-dense throughout, which fits the reflective tone but occasionally slips into uniform lyricism ("a breath held between the storm's growls," "spun moonlight"). The prose modulates slightly—clinical during decoding, warmer at the village's awakening—but the syntactic texture is fairly uniform. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is close and controlled, with no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. The voice is distinct, though the elevated register is consistent rather than character-specific under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and mostly coherent, but nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated phrasing, creating a uniform lyric cadence that can dull momentum: "woven hush," "gilded cage," "grandmaster evaluates," "thread of spun moonlight," "symphony warm and unbroken." Mixed metaphor risk appears in "winnow truth from ruin" (agricultural image) paired with "grandmaster evaluates pawn structures" (chess) within adjacent beats. Several paraphrase loops: "not victory, but absolution" / "not for conquest, but for protection" / "not passive, but earned" recycle the negation-contrast template. Line-level clarity is generally good, but information density is moderate—many lines do one job (description or metaphor) rather than two. Template cadence appears in the reflection block: "Each thread was a move… each knot a lesson." No major grammatical errors; proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The exiled-tutor-seeks-redemption and frozen-village premises are familiar, and the chess-as-life-lesson metaphor is well-worn. The story transforms these through specific detail (Scholar's Mate, platinum labyrinth, tapestry border cipher) and commits fully to the chess-guilt synthesis. The decoding method (winnowing threads by hue and texture as pawn-structure analysis) is a fresh inflection. However, the emotional arc—guilt → task → atonement → peace—follows a predictable template, and the village's awakening as payoff for symbolic labor is a common fantasy structure. The final silver king-knot is a purposeful image, but the overall design does not take bold structural or perspectival risks. Specificity elevates execution, but the core synthesis feels inevitable rather than surprising.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael is present from line one, his exile and guilt are signaled early, and his choices drive all major beats: approaching the tapestry, decoding threads, manipulating the labyrinth rings. His decision to winnow threads (mid-story) and align the engravings (climax) are on-page actions with causal force. The ending turn (village awakens, he walks toward the edge) is a direct result of his labor. Removing Kael breaks the story. Early signal +0.5, three distinct beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, cost connection +0.4. No significant frictions. 3.0 + 5.0 = 8.0, rounded to 7.8 for moderate swappability (any guilt-driven protagonist could serve if reframed).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The platinum labyrinth is introduced early ("Before the moss-crowned well stood the platinum labyrinth"), named as the lock, and its interlocking rings are handled on-page in the climax ("His fingers… manipulated the rings, aligning celestial engravings"). It appears in two beats (introduction, climax) and enables the closure (the labyrinth's chime breaks the woven hush). Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.5. No middle development (Kael does not test or examine it between introduction and climax) −0.3, and it could be swapped for any puzzle-lock with minor edits −0.5. 3.0 + 4.1 − 0.8 = 6.3, but strong closure linkage lifts to 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "woven hush" is named in paragraph three as the magical stasis, and it is the dominant constraint: Kael cannot leave the village while it is frozen, and breaking it is his goal. It shapes his tactics (he must decode the tapestry to unlock the labyrinth) and the closure (the chime "shattered the woven hush"). Early signal +0.7, three beats (setup, middle goal articulation, climax) +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.6. 3.0 + 5.6 = 8.6, but the term itself is ornamental (the story would work with "stasis" or "freeze") −0.4, and it is more premise than active force. Lowered to 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Fidgets productively" is introduced early ("his hands… now fidgeted productively with a silver thread… braiding it into miniature chess knots") and transforms into the final king-knot in his pocket. The trait enables his focus during decoding ("productive fidgeting transforming into precise action"). Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.7, closure linkage +0.9, specificity +0.4. Late payoff (final paragraph cameo) and swappability (any calming habit could serve) −0.6. 3.0 + 3.5 − 0.6 = 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Winnow" is introduced as the method ("winnow truth from ruin by decoding the frayed threads") and the verb recurs in the labor beat ("He winnowed relentlessly: discarding threads frayed by weather, isolating those with intentional breaks"). The action is the core of the middle section and directly produces the cipher that enables the climax. Early signal +0.7, three beats (method statement, labor, resolution) +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.7. 3.0 + 5.4 = 8.4, but moderate swappability (decode, sort, or parse could substitute with minor edits) −0.3. Final 8.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The method is signaled early ("by decoding the frayed threads in a tapestry's border… separating the village's intended story from time's decay"), demonstrated on-page in the labor beat ("fingernails separating threads by hue and texture"), and produces the solution ("The border revealed its cipher—a sequence mirroring the perfect defense against Scholar's Mate"). Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.5, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.8. 3.0 + 5.9 = 8.9, minor swappability (any decode-the-artifact method could serve) −0.6. Final 8.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The time-frozen village is introduced immediately and is the story's central constraint: Kael cannot leave, and breaking the stasis is his goal. The setting supplies the tapestry and labyrinth (resources) and the frozen sensory details that charge the awakening. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.7, specificity +0.6. 3.0 + 5.9 = 8.9, but swappability (any cursed/locked village premise could serve with minor edits) −1.0. Final 7.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"During the lull of distant thunder" appears twice (opening and penultimate paragraph: "The distant thunder rumbled again, but it was merely weather now") as a tonal frame. It does not tighten decisions or create a live clock—the story's time is indeterminate, and Kael's decoding proceeds at his own pace. The thunder is metaphorical rather than tactical. Early signal +0.4, lyric reprise +0.6, closure linkage +0.5. 3.0 + 1.5 = 4.5, but ornamental use (no time pressure) −1.0 and swappability (any weather could serve) −0.3. Final 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The motivation ("to forgive oneself for past mistakes") is signaled early ("Guilt was his constant opponent… he sought not victory, but absolution") and drives every choice: his self-exile, the decoding labor ("to see the lesson he'd denied his prince, and accept it now"), and the closure ("he had untangled his own guilt"). Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.6, closure linkage +1.8, cost connection +0.5. 3.0 + 6.1 = 9.1, minor tell-only phrasing in the ending ("chose forgiveness") rather than fully embodied cost −0.5. Final 8.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Fierce repose" is named in the penultimate paragraph ("This was fierce repose: the calm of a mind that had faced its blunder, decoded its meaning, and chosen forgiveness") and the tone—contemplative intensity—is consistent throughout: reflective yet purposeful, no melodrama. The tone modulates slightly from guilt-laden opening to peaceful closure. The final image (Kael walking toward the village edge) is charged by the tonal arc. Late explicit naming (second-to-last paragraph) −0.8, but the tone itself is coherent and charges the ending. 3.0 + 4.5 (closure linkage +1.4, coherence across beats +1.2, cadence shift +0.9, specificity +0.5, cost +0.5) − 0.8 = 6.7.</comment>
