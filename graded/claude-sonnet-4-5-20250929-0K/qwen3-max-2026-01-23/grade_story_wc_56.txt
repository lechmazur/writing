<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to understand deception is established early and her internal arc—from chasing legends to becoming a "guardian of authenticity"—traces a clear path. However, the interiority relies heavily on abstract exposition ("serene upheaval," "architecture of lies") rather than embodied contradiction; the moment of realization (discovering coordinates) feels more intellectual puzzle-solving than emotional reckoning with visible cost. Thorne's betrayal is recounted entirely in reflection without on-page friction or a present micro-choice that dramatizes her struggle between exposing him and moving forward. The final renunciation of vengeance reads as label ("She would not seek vengeance") rather than a decision with competing impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (Elara, twilight barge, canal) arrive promptly and remain stable. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Elara's hindsight clarity deepens through a series of reflective beats (scent of paper, Thorne's darting eyes, coordinates reveal) that reweight her understanding and culminate in a renunciation of vengeance. The closure effect is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—she chooses documentation over revenge, forecloses the revenge path, and adopts a new identity as "guardian of authenticity." However, the cost is largely asserted ("hard-won wisdom," "serene upheaval") rather than dramatized; no on-page action or forfeiture makes the price visceral at the ending beat. The sundial discovery and coordinate realization are told in summary, which flattens the turn's immediacy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The twilight barge canal is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (moss-slick deck, obsidian surface, skeletal cranes, owl's hoot) filtered through Elara's contemplative stance. The canal's stillness mirrors her emotional state and the barge's groaning wood provides micro-setting texture. The sundial functions as a recurring object that constrains her focus and charges the final image ("warmed against her thigh, a quiet promise"). The shift from twilight to first stars tracks time and supports the thematic movement from darkness to clarity, and spatial choreography (deck → railing → stepping onto path) remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the architecture of lies and salvaging integrity—is signaled early and coheres throughout. The single meaningful tightening occurs when Elara deciphers the coordinates, collapsing the expedition's false premise and exposing Thorne's theft. However, this turn is delivered entirely in reflection ("collapsed in her mind") without on-page obstacles or a present reversal that narrows options. The resolution (choosing documentation over vengeance) is protagonist-driven but the price remains abstract; no action or forfeiture concretizes what she relinquishes or gains at the closure beat. Agency reads as contemplative stance-taking rather than a decision under visible pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the architecture-of-lies conceit and Elara's shift from "errant legend seeker" to "guardian of authenticity." The sundial's transformation from "shackle of shame into a compass of resolve" and the final image of stars as "ancient truth" support the thematic question without overt moralizing. Subtext operates in the canal's silence, Thorne's "darting eyes," and the choice to document rather than destroy. However, the final paragraph edges toward explicit theme statements ("carrying salvaged truth like a lantern") that risk telegraphing rather than trusting the image, and "serene upheaval" is named repeatedly rather than fully embodied in scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the perceptual signature (focus on dissonance, micro-expressions, instincts) is character-specific. Diction stays consistent, though phrases like "architecture of lies," "serene upheaval," and "cathedral of deceit" recur without fresh variation and edge toward elevated register that feels authorial rather than Elara's lived idiom. Free indirect style is mostly clean, but several filter verbs ("she recalled," "she saw") dull immediacy during reflective beats. The transition from Thorne's study to present-tense realization is smooth, but the voice in peak reflection ("hindsight clarity arrived not as a shock, but as a gentle, inevitable tide") reads more poetic than urgent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong figurative control in places ("sky bleeding from amber to deep indigo," "wood groaning softly beneath her worn boots like a shared sigh") and information density is generally high. However, template cadence and paraphrase loops pervade: "thoughtfully clear focus honed through solitude" and "This attribute of clarity was her hard-won shield" restate the same idea; "serene upheaval" appears three times without functional variation; "architecture of lies" recurs in identical phrasing across multiple paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("fires of public ridicule," "key turning in a rusted lock," "cathedral of deceit") cluster in the middle third without fresh specificity. Synonym churn for "clarity" (hindsight clarity, thoughtfully clear, clarity was her shield) and "errant legend seeker" → "guardian of authenticity" labels reduce propulsion. Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack for loops, template cadence, and stock metaphor strings in peak beats: baseline −1.0 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The errant-legend-seeker premise and betrayal-by-mentor arc follow familiar templates, but the specific synthesis—pocket sundial hiding coordinates, staged expedition as artifact-smuggling cover, canal barge as contemplative frame—offers a modest fresh angle. The choice to document rather than confront adds a non-obvious inflection to the revenge-renunciation trope. However, the emotional arc (disillusionment → clarity → resolve) and the metaphorical architecture (lies as cathedral, truth as lantern) rely on well-worn conceits without transformative specificity. The "architecture of lies" and "guardian of authenticity" labels feel prompt-adjacent rather than lived-in discovery. Elara's internal journey could transplant to other betrayal narratives with minor edits, suggesting the freshness is more syntactic than structural.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara (errant legend seeker) is established in paragraph three and drives all major beats: salvaging the sundial at dawn, deciphering coordinates, collapsing the expedition narrative, and choosing documentation over vengeance. Her decisions (wading into cold water, opening the sundial at twilight, renouncing revenge) alter tactics and foreclose the revenge path. However, most beats occur in reflection rather than present-tense scene pressure, and the final choice is declared ("She would not seek vengeance") rather than dramatized with visible cost. Present by end of first third, constrains two beats, and shapes the ending; causal pressure and cost are moderate. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, cost connection +0.4, summary-only use −0.5, late declaration −0.3 = base ~6.7.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The antique pocket sundial is salvaged in paragraph six, opened and studied in paragraphs eight and nine, reveals coordinates in paragraph fifteen, transforms meaning in paragraph twenty-four ("weight transformed from shackle… into compass"), appears in the penultimate paragraph ("pocketed… warmed against her thigh"), and charges the final image. Handled or referenced in five distinct beats with evolving function: retrieval, examination, revelation, symbolic transformation, and embodied promise. Early signal +0.6, three+ beats +1.4, causal pressure (reveals coordinates) +1.2, closure linkage (final image) +1.5, specificity (unique brass casing, hidden numerals) +0.6, cost connection (shame → resolve) +0.5 = base ~7.8. No major frictions; highly integrated.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Hindsight clarity is named in paragraph thirteen ("Hindsight clarity arrived…") and operates throughout as Elara reinterprets Thorne's micro-expressions, the staged expedition, and the sundial's true function. It shapes her final stance (documentation over vengeance) and is reinforced in the closing beats ("hard-won wisdom," "serene upheaval of hard-won wisdom"). However, the concept is primarily thematic and asserted rather than dramatized through on-page choices that narrow options under present pressure; most realization occurs in reflection. Present by first third, touches multiple beats, shapes ending stance, but causal pressure is moderate and cost is implied rather than visible. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.4, summary-only −0.6, label-only −0.4 = base ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Thoughtfully clear" is named in paragraph eight ("thoughtfully clear focus") and paragraph nine ("This attribute of clarity"). It describes Elara's perceptual state and is tied to her ability to decode the sundial, but it does not constrain a choice with visible cost; instead, it functions as a label for her mental capacity. The trait enables the coordinate discovery but is not tested against a competing impulse or pressure. Present by first third, enables one beat, but remains label-only without dramatized tradeoff. Early signal +0.4, one beat +0.4, causal pressure (enables) +0.5, label-only −0.6, no visible cost −0.4 = base ~5.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Salvage appears in paragraph six (retrieving the sundial from muddy banks), paragraph twenty-one ("came to salvage her integrity"), and paragraph twenty-six ("true salvage"). It frames the story's action and thematic turn, but most salvage is metaphorical (integrity, truth) rather than a distinct physical act that creates turns. The sundial retrieval is recounted in one line; the metaphorical salvage is asserted in reflection. Present early, touches ending, but physical salvage is summary-only and metaphorical salvage is declarative. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, swappability (retrieval could be "found" or "discovered") −0.6, summary-only −0.5, ornamental metaphorical use −0.4 = base ~6.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"By training instincts" is named in paragraph seven ("by training instincts dulled by years of ambition") and paragraph eleven ("Her trained instincts now screamed"). The method is signaled and its mechanics (listening to subtle dissonance, noticing micro-expressions) matter in the coordinate discovery. However, the instinct-training is told rather than shown; we do not see her apply the method under present pressure or face a choice where the method imposes cost. Present by first third, enables one key beat, but mechanics are asserted. Early signal +0.5, one beat +0.4, causal pressure (enables discovery) +0.8, summary-only −0.5, label-only −0.3 = base ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The twilight barge canal anchors all action and provides vivid micro-setting (moss-slick deck, obsidian surface, canal's gentle lap). The barge's stillness mirrors Elara's contemplative state, the groaning wood offers embodied texture, and the canal's reflection holds her final image before she steps onto the path. The setting constrains her focus (solitude, silence) and charges the ending's spatial shift from barge to distant streetlights. Present from opening, permeates all beats, and charges the final image. Early signal +0.8, three+ beats +1.4, causal pressure (solitude enables reflection) +0.9, closure linkage (reflection → path) +1.5, specificity +0.7 = base ~7.2.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"The silence of morning radio" is named in paragraph four and returns in paragraph twenty-three ("The silence of the morning radio was no longer empty"). The timeframe (twilight → dawn's approach) is implied by the sky's shift and emerging stars, but the radio's silence functions more as metaphor (void → vessel of truth) than a live clock that tightens decisions. Time passes but does not alter tactics or impose urgency. Present early, touches ending metaphorically, but does not constrain present choices. Early signal +0.4, lyric reprise +0.6, ornamental metaphor −0.7, no tactical pressure −0.5 = base ~4.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The motivation "to understand the architecture of lies" is stated in paragraph three and drives Elara's reflective reconstruction of Thorne's deception (paragraphs ten–nineteen) and her final choice to document rather than avenge. The desire is present throughout and shapes the ending stance. However, it is primarily told and thematic; we do not see her wrestle with competing wants (e.g., revenge vs. understanding) in a present-tense choice with visible cost. The motivation is consistent but not conflicted on the page. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.5, told-only −0.6, no on-page friction −0.4 = base ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Serene upheaval" is named in paragraph twenty ("A serene upheaval settled within her bones") and returns in the final paragraph ("the serene upheaval of hard-won wisdom"). The tone aims for calm-amid-transformation and is supported by imagery (still canal, slowing heartbeat, distant owl) and diction (profound quiet, gentle tide). However, the phrase is abstract and repeated without fresh variation; the tone is more asserted than modulated through rhythm or syntax under pressure. Present by midpoint, touches ending, but relies on label repetition. Midpoint signal +0.3, closure linkage +0.8, specificity (oxymoric pairing) +0.4, label-only −0.6, static mood −0.4 = base ~6.1.</comment>
