<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her choice to pursue laughter-integration drives the sequence, but her arc lacks internal contradiction—she executes her method smoothly without genuine struggle or cost that forecloses a visible path. The specter Cora shows more dynamic range (regret → laughter → dissolution) than the protagonist, whose calm remains undisturbed. Embodiment is present ("crocodile's tooth pressed to her heart") but interiority leans toward poetic summary rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final "bittersweet weight of release" tells state rather than showing a choice that narrows options with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when promptly. The piece accumulates pressure through distorted harp notes → spectral confession → laughter integration, culminating in Cora's dissolution—a Resonant Reconfiguration (spectral release) with visible cost (her form dissolves, Elara feels the weight). One meaningful deepening occurs when Elara shifts from sorrow-anchoring to laughter-weaving, altering Cora's state. The closure lands on the page with felt cost, though the cost is more emotional release than a path foreclosed for Elara herself, keeping this shy of high 8s.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Echo Gorge is vividly rendered with sensory specificity ("obsidian cliffs," "moss-cushioned ledge," "mist coalescing") and the acoustics actively shape Elara's method (distorted notes "fractured against canyon walls"). The misaligned harp and crocodile's tooth function as micro-setting elements that constrain and enable her healing work. However, the environment does not impose a tactical choice or narrow options under pressure—it amplifies but does not resist. The final image uses the gorge's sunrise to charge Cora's dissolution, meeting the 9+ gate's "charges the final image" criterion, but the lack of environmental resistance caps the score at mid-7s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: integrating laughter to heal Cora's spectral regret. Pressure coheres through the Accumulative lens—Elara's playing invites confession, then shifts to laughter-weaving, which brightens Cora's form and triggers release. One meaningful tightening: the transition from sorrow-anchoring to joy-injection narrows the tactic and changes Cora's state. However, Elara faces no resistance, reversal, or cost to her own options; Cora's transformation unfolds smoothly without a visible price paid by the protagonist. The closure reconfigures Cora's state with felt cost (dissolution), but the lack of protagonist agency-under-pressure keeps this at the 7.0 threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—healing requires laughter stitched into sorrow—emerges through image and action (distorted harp, badger story, Cora's brightening). The final image (Cora dissolving into "motes of gold") reweights prior regret with luminous release, avoiding overt statement. However, the closing paragraph edges toward moralizing: "true healing was not the absence of pain, but the courage to let laughter stitch itself into the fabric of sorrow" borders on Thematic Echo, articulating the thesis rather than trusting the image. This prevents the piece from reaching 7+, though the crocodile-dance anecdote and badger detail provide concrete particulars that resist pure abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Elara; focalization is clean with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present ("her purpose was not to banish shadows but to listen within them") and diction is controlled, though it leans toward elevated lyricism ("luminous ache," "sonic key turning in a long-locked door"). Dialogue is minimal but functional; Cora's lines carry subtext and advance plot. The prose modulates with emotional intensity (quiet at open, warm at closure). Minor register drift: "compassionate work" and "absolution" read slightly abstract for the visceral moment, and the final paragraph's thesis-statement cadence nudges voice toward essayistic summary rather than scene-rooted perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and imagery is vivid ("pale gold light bled softly," "spiderweb catching dawn light"). However, pervasive figurative density without pattern-teaching creates overwriting: nearly every sentence in the opening and climax carries metaphor or elevated diction, blurring momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: "spectral confessions" is named four times across beats without functional variation. Template cadence in the climax: "Her spectral confessions were not erased but cradled… 'I remember her laughter'… 'Thank you for weaving it back'…" stacks summary-tell over show. Filtering: "Elara listened," "Elara sat," "she felt" recur without voice necessity. These artifacts cluster in closure beats, triggering −0.8 and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The "healer uses unconventional art to release a ghost" premise is familiar; the misaligned harp and laughter-as-medicine provide a fresh angle, but the emotional arc (regret → confession → laughter → release) follows a template progression without surprising turns. The crocodile's grumpy-dance anecdote and badger tapestry detail offer specific, non-obvious textures. However, the story could function identically with a different instrument or talisman, indicating swappability. The "luminous ache" idiom recurs as a motif but feels self-consciously literary rather than inevitable. No bold structural risk; the two-character, single-scene frame is conventional for the length.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara (lost soul collector) is on-page throughout, drives the pursuit, and makes the key decision to shift from sorrow-anchoring to laughter-weaving, altering Cora's state. Present in setup, middle choice, and closure. However, her choice feels like smooth execution of her vocation rather than a difficult turn that narrows her own options; no visible cost to her path. Causal pressure is moderate—her method works as intended without friction. Early signal +0.7, two-beat involvement +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, but swappability (another healer could do the same) and lack of protagonist cost cap this at mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The crocodile's tooth appears in setup ("clutched in her palm") and is used to pluck a harp string mid-scene ("using the crocodile's tooth to pluck a single string"), then returns at closure ("pressed to her heart"). Three touches across beats. However, its function is largely symbolic; any talisman could serve the same role. The anecdote about the crocodile's dance provides texture but does not constrain Elara's choice or alter tactics. Early signal +0.7, two-beat involvement +0.9, closure mention +0.5, but swappability (−0.6) and ornamental use (−0.5) limit this to mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Spectral confessions" is the story's engine: Cora's confessions ("I unraveled her tapestry...") trigger the healing sequence and define the stake. The concept shapes tactics—Elara must shift from sorrow-listening to laughter-weaving in response to the confessions. Present in setup (framing), middle (Cora's whispered regrets), and closure (confessions "cradled within returning joy"). Early signal +0.8, two-beat involvement +0.9, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5. Minor swappability (ghost regrets are a known motif) and slight summary treatment (−0.3) keep this shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Modestly fearless" is labeled in setup ("not recklessness, but a deep-rooted calm") but does not constrain or enable a visible on-page action with cost. Elara moves through danger without hesitation or tradeoff; the trait exists as character description rather than a tactical lever. No middle development or closure participation. Setup mention +0.4, but label-only (−0.6), no beat involvement (0.0), no causal pressure (0.0), and missing closure gate cap this below 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Pursue" frames the story: Elara pursues Cora's essence, settles to play, and the sequence unfolds. The action is present in setup ("she would pursue the lingering essence") and drives the middle beats (playing, storytelling) to closure (Cora's release). However, "pursue" as an umbrella action is broad; the key turns trace more to the harp-playing and laughter-injection methods. Early signal +0.7, two-beat involvement +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure +0.8, but swappability (another action verb like "summon" or "heal" could substitute) (−0.5) limits this to 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The misaligned harp is signaled early ("strings were deliberately misaligned"), used in the pivotal middle beat ("distorted notes... fractured against canyon walls"), and its mechanics matter—the dissonance resonates with fractured spirits and shifts when Elara plucks with the tooth. The method shapes attempts and drives the tightening when she moves from sorrow to laughter. Early signal +0.8, two-beat involvement +0.9, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6. Minor swappability (another broken instrument could serve) (−0.4) keeps this at 8.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Echo Gorge is named and vividly described; its acoustics ("canyon walls," "gorge's acoustics") amplify the harp and enable the healing method. Present in setup, used in middle, and the sunrise charges the final image. However, the setting does not impose a constraint or resistance—it facilitates rather than pressures. Early signal +0.7, two-beat involvement +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, causal pressure (amplification, not constraint) +0.6, but lack of tactical friction (−0.4) and moderate swappability (another resonant space) (−0.3) yield mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"In the hush of a hidden sunrise" appears in the opening and the final image ("motes of gold... drifted toward the rising sun"), but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or track elapsed duration. The sunrise functions as atmospheric backdrop and lyric bookend, not a live clock. Setup mention +0.4, closure reprise +0.5, but no middle development (0.0), no causal pressure (0.0), and ornamental use (−0.5) cap this below 4.6 per the missing-development gate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—"to integrate laughter into healing"—is stated in setup, dramatized in the middle when she shifts to the badger story and crocodile anecdote, and fulfilled at closure when Cora's laughter triggers release. The motivation drives the key tactical choice (sorrow → joy) and shapes the ending. Early signal +0.8, two-beat involvement +0.9, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.5. However, the motivation faces no friction or cost to Elara herself; she executes her plan smoothly without internal conflict or visible sacrifice (−0.6), limiting this to low 7s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Luminous ache" is woven throughout: "luminous ache of remembrance," "luminous ache of healing witnessed," Cora's "light dimmed by decades of self-reproach" brightening to gold. The tone modulates with pressure—quiet opening, sorrowful middle, warm-but-bittersweet closure—and charges the final image (dissolution as both loss and release). Early signal +0.8, pervasive involvement (three+ beats) +1.4, closure linkage +1.8, specificity +0.6. Minor self-consciousness (the phrase "luminous ache" is repeated verbatim, risking overuse) (−0.3) keeps this at 7.8.</comment>
