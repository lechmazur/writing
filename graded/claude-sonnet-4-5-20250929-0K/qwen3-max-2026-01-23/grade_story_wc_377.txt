<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("preserve the color of wonder") is established, but her agency is passive—she performs a ritual cycle already designed, with no on-page choice that forecloses a path or reveals contradiction. Seasonal muteness is mentioned but never constrains a decision; it remains a label. The final peace and covenant lack dramatized cost; the piece tells us fulfillment rather than showing what she gives up or what competing impulse she overrides.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early. The story accumulates atmospheric density and reaches a crescendo, then closes on quiet satisfaction—a valid Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). However, cost is asserted ("purpose fulfilled," "profound peace") rather than made visible through a forfeited option or felt friction. The sculpture's cycle completes without dramatized resistance or trade-off, weakening closure legibility under pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The whispering bluff, kinetic sculpture, and iceberg fragment are rendered with vivid, purpose-driven detail. Spatial choreography is clear (vanes, bells, silver cradle, granite), and sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's attunement. The iceberg fragment's glisten and the bells' chimes charge the final image. Strong work; one notch below 8+ because the environment does not visibly constrain a choice—Elara adjusts without friction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving wonder's chromatic signature—is signaled early. The sculpture reaches crescendo, but no reversal or tightening narrows options; the process unfolds as designed. Elara's gentle push and the fragment's surrender read as inevitable ritual rather than a test of commitment. Cost is declared ("purpose fulfilled") but not dramatized through a visible trade-off or foreclosed alternative, limiting escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (truth resides in vibration and silence, wonder persists through dedication) emerges organically from the kinetic sculpture and Elara's seasonal muteness. The final image—"glisten of memory in ice, honest ring of bronze, steadfast heart"—offers non-literal resonance. However, the closing stanza edges toward thesis statement ("truth needed no translation") rather than letting the image carry full weight, and the piece risks sermonizing in the final lines.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, perceptual signature filtered through Elara's attunement to harmonics. Diction is elevated and lyric, fitting the post-verbal world. Weaknesses: some filter stacks ("She recalled," "She envisioned") in peak beats dull immediacy, and phrases like "color of wonder" and "symphonies of truth" repeat without variation. The prose occasionally slips into thesis mode ("deepest truths resonate in the chest, not the throat") rather than trusting image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is imagistically rich. Orientation is clear. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "glisten" is invoked five times with minimal variation; "truth" and "wonder" recur as abstract labels rather than concretely anchored. Template stems ("This was," "This glisten was," "This was preservation") and synonym churn ("quiet," "muted," "silence") reduce density. Peak beats ("As the solstice sun peaked…" through "The first bell chimed") carry stacked modifiers and elevated register that slow momentum. Apply −0.8 for loops and template cadence under the Non-closure Accumulation Cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The post-verbal world and kinetic sculpture offer a fresh frame. However, core elements—mute artist, ritual preservation, ancient ice—echo familiar templates (silent sage, seasonal cycle, fragile beauty). The ending's "quiet covenant" and "wonder quietly flourished" trend toward median safety rather than bold synthesis. Transformation is modest; swap "bell tuner" for "color keeper" and the arc holds largely unchanged. The piece commits to its premise but does not surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara adjusts bells, gives a push, and stands immersed—observation and ritual performance. No on-page choice alters tactics or forecloses a path. Her presence enables the sculpture but does not drive a turn. Functional but passive; swappable with "devoted artist." Present in setup, middle ritual, and closure satisfaction, meeting two gates, but lacks causal pressure or cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The iceberg fragment appears early (setup), is handled in the cradle (middle), spins and glistens at crescendo, and Elara touches it at closure when "dull" and "purpose fulfilled." It enables the light-casting mechanism and its chromatic signature is the story's visual anchor. Scores well for beat involvement and closure linkage, but cost is tied to the fragment's depletion rather than Elara's trade-off, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Symphonies of truth" is named early and frames the sculpture's purpose. The bells and light converge in a multisensory experience. However, the concept remains thematic rather than constraining—Elara does not navigate competing definitions of truth or adjust tactics when the symphony risks failure. It shapes the world-building but not the stakes on the page. Functional but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Seasonal muteness is described ("autumn and winter voice") and linked to her perceptual lens ("honed her perception"). It never constrains a choice or creates friction; she does not need to speak, fail to speak, or weigh silence against communication. Label-only; no visible trade-off. Present in setup, absent from middle and closure action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Glisten" is the chromatic signature that paints light and makes wonder visible. It appears in setup (iceberg's inner radiance), intensifies at crescendo (casting azure across granite), and marks closure (final brilliant glisten before slowing). The action enables the sculpture's effect and charges the ending image. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage; modest cost legibility (the fragment's light is "surrendered," not Elara's).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The kinetic sculpture is signaled early (setup), its mechanics detailed (wind-driven vanes, rotating arms, spinning fragment), and its crescendo drives the middle and closure beats. Removing it would collapse the story's logic. The method shapes all tactics and the final image. High integration: setup, development, and payoff present; causal pressure and specificity strong. One notch below 8.5 because Elara's adjustment is ritual rather than adaptive problem-solving.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The whispering bluff is named early, anchors the setting, and the wind's role in turning vanes is mentioned. It supplies atmospheric texture and a recurring motif ("whispering wind" at closure). However, the bluff does not pressure a choice or alter tactics—Elara works atop it without friction. Lyric reprise (first and last paragraphs) reweights slightly, lifting it into mid-band, but it remains postcard rather than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"After words become unnecessary" is stated in paragraph four and explains Elara's muteness and the world's reliance on vibration. It shapes world-building but does not tighten decisions—no clock, no urgency. The solstice sun peaks on schedule, not under pressure. The timeframe is backdrop, not driver. Present in setup, absent from middle and closure pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"To preserve the color of wonder" is stated early, recalled mid-story ("elders' signed plea"), and declared fulfilled at closure. It frames Elara's dedication and the sculpture's purpose. However, the desire is told rather than tested—no competing impulse, no moment where preserving wonder costs her something else she wants. Functional motivation without dramatized friction or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Muted vigor" is named twice and embodied in Elara's restrained strength and the sculpture's elegant inevitability. Tone is coherent and modulates from reverent precision to crescendo to quiet satisfaction. The final image ("quiet covenant," "quietly flourished") charges the tone. However, "muted" risks flattening rather than deepening pressure at peak beats. Solid integration; one step below 7.0 because tone does not intensify conflict or cost visibility.</comment>
