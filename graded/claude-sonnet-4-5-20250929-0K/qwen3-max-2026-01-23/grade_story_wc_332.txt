<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and sustained, grounded in the decade-long ache for the runaway dream. Her interiority remains concrete through embodied gestures—mineral-stained fingers, climbing stairs, cradling the palette—but the progression from longing to "recognition" and "quiet understanding" feels somewhat tell-heavy rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final shift to "keeper of inner light" reads as label rather than dramatized cost, and no genuine mistake or blind spot complicates her choices. The change occurs but lacks visible friction that would elevate it beyond competent execution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors early (Elara, library turret, pre-dawn vigil). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing hybrid): the photograph does not match the courtyard but reveals "the dream's emotional essence," reweighting her decade-long search as an internal state rather than external recovery. Cost is conceptual—she relinquishes the literal courtyard hunt—but the final image ("luminous absence transformed") makes this undeniable. One meaningful deepening occurs when the developed photograph contradicts expectation yet delivers thematic resolution, tightening her understanding of "home." The lens holds; escalation reads as density increase and cadence shift at the darkroom beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: wind-scoured cliffs, sea caves, the eastern turret, the whispering archipelago. The library's stone anchors spatial choreography (cool stone beneath palms, spiral stairs, oak workbench, red-lit darkroom). Sensory detail is selective—salt-laced breeze, scent of old paper, gold and amethyst light—and filtered through Elara's professional and emotional priorities. The watercolor palette and camera constrain her method; the turret's eastern vantage enables the sunrise shot. The archipelago's whispers shift from mystery to "joyful chorus," charging the final image with environmental reconfiguration. Micro-setting (palette, lens, darkroom bath) functions as setting and tool simultaneously, meeting the 9+ gate criterion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: capturing the dream's essence to end a decade of longing. Pressure tightens when Elara climbs the turret with her precise saffron-moonstone blend, frames the horizon, and confronts "luminous absence" before the shutter click. The photograph's unexpected result—arched window instead of courtyard—constitutes one meaningful reversal that narrows her understanding and transforms her goal from literal recovery to acceptance of internal peace. Agency is present (she blends, climbs, frames, presses the shutter), and the cost is felt: she forecloses the hunt for the external courtyard. However, the resolution leans on epiphany ("recognition," "quiet understanding") rather than a harder trade-off or renunciation with sharper on-page friction. Escalation under Accumulative lens is credible but gentle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: home as internal state, longing as cipher, light as medium of communion. The watercolor palette, sunrise ritual, and "luminous absence" recur with shifting meaning, and the final image—dream vitalized within—answers the central question without overt moral. Subtext operates in gesture (mineral-stained fingers, reverent cleaning of palette) and image (gold-amethyst tapestry, arched window glowing). Yet the ending tilts toward thematic statement: "home was a state of being she carried within," "the right light to bloom," "keeper of inner light." These phrases approach platitude and reduce resonance. The final line "a new story began to whisper" adds a meta-commentary frame that diffuses rather than concentrates the thematic charge. Strong particulars undermined by mild tell-drift at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV, stable and controlled. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—close during the turret sequence ("Heart steady"), wider for framing ("islanders called the hush of improbable beginnings"). Diction is consistent, lyric without excessive ornament, and character-particular (cipher, vitalize, communion). No head-hopping. The narrative voice carries a distinct texture: "luminous absence," "saffron for warmth, moonstone dust for clarity," "tears traced clean paths." Free indirect style is clean. However, some phrases drift toward generic poetic register ("whispering archipelago," "hush of improbable beginnings") that could belong to any lyric narrator rather than Elara's interior lexicon. Perceptual signature is present but not as idiosyncratic as the 8+ band requires. Rhythm varies naturally; no filter-verb stacks or template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is clear and rhythmically varied with strong visual specificity. However, several patterns reduce density: paraphrase loops ("the dream was vitalized" echoed by "vitalized, whole, and finally at home"), synonym churn around "luminous absence" (appears four times with minor variation), and template stems ("She closed her eyes...she held the filter...she pressed the shutter"). The final third stacks tell-phrases: "not as a ghost of the past, but as a living truth," "a quiet understanding settling deep in her bones," "no longer lost...waited within her all along." Figurative language in the closure beat ("testament to patience and hope," "palette for peace") edges toward stock metaphor. Information density is high in the turret sequence but thins in the descent and library return. No major grammatical errors; spatial choreography tracks cleanly. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase/template artifacts touching closure, −0.3 for stock metaphor in final beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise—painting with light via natural pigments to capture a dream—offers a fresh synthesis of photography, alchemy, and longing. The watercolor palette as filter is specific and purposeful. However, the emotional arc (external search → internal acceptance) is a familiar template, and the story does not transform it with lived friction or non-obvious moral calculus. The turret ritual and darkroom revelation feel inevitable in hindsight, but the ending's "home is within" resolution trends toward the safety middle. No close echoes of famous lines, yet the thematic turns (luminous absence, keeper of inner light, new story whispers) lean on abstraction rather than irreducible particulars. The whispering archipelago and odd-hour vigil add atmospheric specificity but do not complicate the protagonist's path. Competent execution of a lyric template without bold risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara appears early, frames the vigil, measures the blend, climbs the turret, operates the camera, and interprets the photograph. Her choices (precise saffron-moonstone ratio, framing between islands Kael and Lyra, pressing the shutter, cleaning the palette) drive the sequence. However, most choices are procedural rather than under pressure; no moment forces a trade-off between competing goods or risks. The descent and return are observation without decision. Present across beats, causally involved, shapes closure, but decisions do not alter tactics or foreclose paths with visible friction.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The palette appears in paragraph 5 (setup), is measured and cradled in paragraphs 10–11 (middle beat), held before the lens in paragraph 16 (climax), and cleaned with reverence in paragraph 23 (denouement). Its wells (saffron, moonstone, lavender) enable her unique method and constrain her ritual. The palette's material presence (sea-worn, silk pouch, mineral-stained fingers) grounds the photo shoot. Cleaning it post-revelation reweights it as "testament to patience and hope." Four distinct beats, causal pressure (filters the light), closure linkage (cleaning signals completion), specificity (crushed saffron, moonstone dust). Swappable with another ritual object only with significant edits. Strong integration; not quite indispensable because the story could function with a different light-filter mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The cipher is named early (paragraph 4: "crystallized into her personal cipher of longing, a code written in the angle of light on wet stone"). It recurs in paragraph 22 ("The cipher of longing was solved"). However, it functions primarily as thematic label rather than shaping on-page stakes. The concept does not constrain her choices or enable a tactic; it describes her longing without altering options. The "solving" is told, not dramatized through a choice that the cipher itself forced. Present, purposeful, lyric reprise at closure, but does not create causal pressure. Mid-band for thematic coherence and early–final frame.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Paints-with-light is signaled in paragraph 6 ("she could paint with light, sculpting dawn's rays through these natural filters") and enacted in paragraphs 15–17 (holding the filter, capturing the sun). The attribute enables the core action and constrains her method (must use natural pigments, must shoot at sunrise). The filter glows with "captured promise," and the photograph's gold-amethyst result demonstrates the attribute's effect. However, no visible trade-off or cost is tied to this trait; it works as designed without friction. Two beats (setup, climax), closure linkage, specificity, but no on-page price for using it. Functional and essential to the method, but lacks the cost connection for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Vitalize is named as intended action in paragraph 8 and achieved in paragraph 22 ("the dream was vitalized"). The turret ritual, photograph, and darkroom sequence all serve this goal. The photograph "vitalizes" by revealing the dream's essence rather than its literal image, redefining success. The action is not easily swappable; removing "vitalize" and substituting "capture" or "preserve" would flatten the thematic turn. However, the vitalization is primarily told ("not as a ghost of the past, but as a living truth") rather than demonstrated through a choice or behavior shift. Present, drives the arc, shapes closure, but the conceptual payoff is asserted more than enacted.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sunrise photography is signaled in paragraph 7 ("Her method was sunrise photography, performed daily from the library's eastern turret") and executed in paragraphs 12–17. The mechanics matter: framing the horizon, filtering the first light, timing the shutter click. The method constrains her to the eastern turret, pre-dawn hours, and the precise moment the sun clears the sea. The darkroom beat (paragraph 18) completes the method. Three beats (setup, climax, development), causal pressure (the method enables the dream-capture attempt), closure participation (the developed image delivers the revelation). Swappable with another photographic ritual only with significant rewrites. Essential across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The whispering archipelago is named early and recurs (paragraphs 2, 9, 26). It provides atmospheric texture (wind through sea caves, salt-laced breeze, islands Kael and Lyra as framing anchors) and shifts mood ("mystery to joyful chorus"). However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; Elara's plan would proceed identically in any coastal setting with a sunrise view. The setting enables the sunrise shot but does not pressure her decisions. Present, coherent, lyric reprise, but mostly postcard description. The turret and darkroom do more work as micro-settings. Mid-band for tonal coherence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The hush of improbable beginnings is introduced in paragraph 1 ("a sacred interval islanders called the hush of improbable beginnings") and reprised in the final line ("The hush of improbable beginnings held her too"). It denotes the pre-dawn vigil but does not tighten decisions or create urgency. No clock pressure; the sunrise arrives on schedule without complication. The timeframe is atmospheric rather than tactical. Early signal, closure reprise, but does not shape attempts or narrow options. Static poetic frame; replaceable with "dawn watch" without structural loss. Below mid-band for lack of causal work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The runaway dream is named in paragraph 3 and drives the entire arc. Elara's decade-long ache, the ritual preparation, the turret climb, and the photograph all pursue this motivation. The dream is embodied (marble fountain, jasmine scent, certainty of belonging) and tested in paragraph 14 ("a wave of luminous absence"). The final realization ("the dream was no longer lost...waited within her all along") resolves the motivation. However, the desire is told more than dramatized in conflicted choices; no on-page moment forces her to choose between the dream and another want. Present, coherent, drives action, charges closure, but lacks friction between competing desires. Solid integration without the cost trade-off for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Luminous absence is introduced in paragraph 14 ("A wave of luminous absence washed over her"), recurs in paragraph 24 ("The luminous absence transformed"), and anchors the final line ("And in that luminous absence, a new story began"). The tone is coherent: lyric, meditative, melancholic softening to acceptance. It modulates with pressure (absence → transformation → generative void) and charges the final image. However, the phrase is abstract and could describe many lyric closures; specificity is low. The tone does not shift sharply under peak stress (the photograph reveal is gentle surprise, not upheaval). Present, purposeful reprise, thematic coherence, but mid-band for generic application and static mood arc.</comment>
