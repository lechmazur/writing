<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear—seeking where lost time accumulates after her daughter's birth—but her internal arc flattens into abstraction. The opening establishes her cartomancer identity and ink-stained hands, yet no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene; she moves through ritual without friction. The epiphany ("lost time...accumulates in fractures") arrives through meditative vision rather than earned struggle, and the "willingly perplexed" stance functions as a label that insulates her from genuine dramatic tension. The tear on the saucer and thumb-press gesture supply embodied moments, but the resolution—warmth melting anxiety—reads as convenient emotional release without visible cost or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (onyx-ink cartomancer, midnight glade, post-birth timeframe). The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: density increases through layered imagery (cracked saucer, locket tracing, starlight-drinking ink) and the final paragraph attempts Resonant Reconfiguration by reweighting the crack as vessel rather than void. However, the closure lacks felt cost—Elara descends with "heart unfastened from fear" but no on-page forfeiture or trade-off that makes a before/after legible with pressure. The ritual structure (ascent, kneel, vision, descend) provides coherence, but causality is weak: the saucer crack "appeared...at the exact second of Lyra's first cry" as oracle rather than earned consequence, and the epiphany blooms from passive vision rather than a choice that narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The midnight glade is vividly rendered—mossy floor, luminous fungi, starlight on ancient stones, clouds below—and the "choking beauty" of thin air is embodied through breath as conscious effort. Spatial choreography is clean (stepping from vapor, kneeling at root-formed altar, descending through clouds). The cracked saucer and locket function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image when Elara presses her thumb to the crack, consecrating it. However, the environment does not constrain choice or supply resources that alter tactics; it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than active pressure, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding where lost time accumulates—is signaled early and sustained. Yet escalation is minimal: Elara's vigil proceeds without reversal or on-page tightening. The ritual unfastens the locket, places relics together, and triggers visions, but no decision narrows options or forces a trade-off. The "tear fell onto the saucer's crack" and thumb-press are gestures, not choices with visible cost. Understanding "blooms, gentle and sure" rather than emerging from agency under pressure. Coincidence (the saucer cracking at Lyra's cry) seeds the quest without dramatized consequence, and the resolution—descending with "heart unfastened from fear"—grants relief without forfeiting a live path or enduring credible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the cracked saucer, hand tracings on tablecloths, the locket's tracing of her mother's hand. The central question—where does lost time go?—is answered non-literally: "in the fractures...not voids but vessels." Subtext operates in the ritual's silent gestures and the repurposing of the crack from damage to consecration. However, the final paragraphs drift toward explicit moralizing: "Time was not lost; it was woven into love's very texture" and "in the willing perplexity of devotion, in repentance that releases despair" read as stated thesis rather than scene pressure. The thematic echo in the closing paragraph—"choking, beautiful truth held within a single, cherished crack"—articulates the premise in prompt-like language, triggering a −0.5 deduction for explicit theme summary replacing earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single POV, third-person limited, maintains stable distance and focalization through Elara's perceptions. Diction is elevated and lyrical ("onyx-ink cartomancer," "saline benediction," "seam of light") with purpose-driven texture. Perceptual signature reflects her cartomancer identity through metaphors of ink and signs. However, register occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing that feels authorial rather than character-bound: "choking beauty," "willingly perplexed," "cloudbound repentance" repeat as thematic labels rather than evolving through her lived thought. Psychic distance remains consistent, and the prose modulates appropriately (thin air, icy knot, warmth radiating), but the voice's specificity weakens under peak introspection when abstraction overtakes embodied perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and paragraph lengths create visual breaks. Sentence openings show variety. Information density is high in places (the locket containing her mother's hand-tracing is efficient), but the piece suffers from paraphrase loops and thematic restates. "Willingly perplexed" appears three times as identical label. "Choking beauty" recurs without evolution. The final third contains multiple synonym cycles: "lost time does not pool in vaults. It accumulates precisely in these fractures" is immediately restated as "These breaks are not voids but vessels" and again as "Time was not lost; it was woven into love's very texture." The closing paragraph summarizes the entire thematic arc ("in the willing perplexity of devotion, in repentance that releases despair...") rather than trusting the image. Template cadence appears in the vision sequence: "her mother's laughter...the sharp sound...Lyra's tiny hand..." Applying −0.8 for paraphrase loops and thematic restates across the final third, plus −0.3 for label repetition; total artifact penalty −1.1.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—seeking where lost time accumulates after childbirth—offers some freshness, and the image of the cracked saucer as oracle is specific. The hand-tracing custom and locket containing a mother's tracing provide tangible lineage markers. However, the "journey to mystical glade for insight" frame is conventional, and the resolution (finding meaning in fractures, consecrating damage) follows a familiar arc of transforming brokenness into wisdom. Emotional specificity weakens when abstraction ("willing perplexity," "cloudbound repentance") replaces lived contradiction. The transformation test suggests the plot and arc could function with different names and setting; the cartomancer identity and onyx ink are ornamental rather than integral to the choice structure. The piece commits to its premise but does not subvert or deepen it through non-obvious moral calculus or risk-taking that heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her choices—ascending the glade, kneeling, unfastening the locket, pressing her thumb to the crack—move the ritual forward. However, these actions are sequential gestures rather than decisions that create key turns or alter tactics under pressure. She observes and receives (visions bloom, understanding blooms) more than she decides with cost. The cartomancer identity is signaled early but does not constrain choices; her ink-drinking skin and oracle-reading are mentioned but not dramatized as methods that shape outcomes. Present in setup, middle ritual, and closure image, satisfying two gates, but causal pressure and cost connection are weak. Swappable with a similar seeker role with minor edits. Score band 4.0–5.0; frictions for passivity and ornamental profession lower to 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cracked saucer is handled in multiple beats: clutched in her palm during ascent, placed beside the locket at the altar, tear falling onto the crack, thumb pressed over it to consecrate. It appears in the final image as "cradled...its flaw transformed into a seam of light" and is promised display in future birthdays. The crack's origin (appearing at Lyra's first cry) seeds the quest and its meaning shifts from breach to vessel by the end, a purposeful reprise. However, the saucer does not constrain choice or narrow options under pressure; it is handled and reweighted but remains symbolic rather than tactically essential. Early signal +0.6, three-beat involvement +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, but low causal pressure and swappability with another cracked heirloom reduce to 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Cloudbound repentance" is introduced in paragraph 7 and repeated in paragraphs 16 and 22. It frames the vigil as penitential ascent and release of guilt, shaping the dominant stake. The concept appears in setup (paragraph 7), middle reflection (paragraph 16: "core of her cloudbound repentance—not punishment, but release"), and closure paragraph (final line: "in repentance that releases despair"). However, repentance is told more than dramatized; the guilt is named but no on-page sacrifice or foreclosed path makes the penance costly. The concept colors tone and motivation but does not change tactics or options under pressure. Present in three beats but largely as thematic label. Two-gate satisfaction (middle + closure mention) allows up to ~6.0, but low causal work and late thematic echo reduce to 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Willingly perplexed" appears in paragraphs 6, 15, and 21 as a trait label. Paragraph 6 defines it: "choosing to see not accident but oracle, her mind surrendering to the mystery without demanding easy answers." Paragraph 15: "She remained willingly perplexed, allowing memory and omen to swirl without resistance." Paragraph 21: "Repentance was the willingness to be perplexed by time's design." The trait is asserted but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with cost. It describes a stance (acceptance of mystery) rather than forcing a trade-off or decision. Present in setup, middle, and closure but purely as thematic gloss. Label-only use −0.6, swappability −0.5, summary-only −0.4; cap at 3.8 for lack of causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Unfasten" is the verb of the necessary action in paragraph 11: "she unfastened the silver clasp of the locket resting over her heart." This act releases the mother's hand-tracing and enables the ritual comparison of relics. Paragraph 28 closes the arc: "Elara fastened the locket closed, the tracing...now a living bridge." The unfastening is signaled, dramatized, and reversed at closure with thematic weight (opening to allow connection, then closing to carry it forward). The action is specific and its reversal charges the final image. However, it is one beat of many and could be replaced with "opened" or "removed" without breaking the plot; the latch mechanism does not constrain later choices. Early signal +0.6, two-beat involvement +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, but moderate swappability and lack of persistent causal pressure hold at 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The hand-tracing custom appears in paragraph 9 (tracing Lyra's fingers yesterday), paragraph 12 (locket contains mother's tracing from decades-old tablecloth), paragraph 29 (future tracings of growing hands), and closing paragraph (wisdom poured "into every traced line"). It is signaled early, supplies the locket's contents, and shapes the vision of continuity. The method provides the "tangible thread across generations" and the locket's tracing is the physical relic that anchors the ritual. However, the mechanics of tracing do not alter tactics or constrain the glade choice; the custom is backstory and thematic symbol rather than active method. Early signal +0.6, three-beat involvement +1.4, closure linkage +0.9, but low causal pressure and ornamental role in the ritual reduce to 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The midnight glade is established in paragraph 1 and sustained throughout: mossy floor, ancient stones, luminous fungi, clouds below, thin air, root-formed altar. It is the sole location and provides atmospheric pressure ("choking beauty; each breath was a conscious effort"). Paragraph 24 notes the air becoming "a cleansing breath" and paragraph 30 shows descent through parting clouds. The setting is vividly rendered and present in setup, middle, and closure. However, it does not constrain choice or supply resources that affect outcome; it is postcard backdrop for the internal ritual. Early signal +0.7, sustained presence across beats +0.9, but low causal pressure and lack of tactical constraint reduce to 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the birth of her daughter, Lyra" is anchored in paragraph 3 and elaborated in paragraph 4 ("thirty-six hours of labor, the fever-hazed dawn after"). Paragraph 9 specifies "just yesterday" for the hand-tracing ritual. The post-birth frame motivates the quest and the climax (paragraph 24) promises "future birthdays." However, time does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page; the glade vigil is untimed and reflective, and no live clock alters moves. Present in setup and closure but not tracked or pressuring during the middle ritual. Two-gate satisfaction allows mid-band, but lack of tactical urgency and vague elapsed time in the glade reduce to 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The motivation "to find where lost time accumulates" is stated in paragraph 3, restated in paragraph 18 ("The search was complete. She had found where lost time accumulates"), and resolved in the closure paragraph. It drives the ascent and ritual, and the answer reweights the crack and hand tracings. However, the desire is declared more than dramatized through conflicted choices. Elara's goal faces no on-page obstacle or friction between wants and costs; she ascends, performs, receives insight, and descends without trade-off. Early signal +0.7, closure linkage +1.0, but told-only dominance and lack of friction reduce to 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Choking beauty" is introduced in paragraph 8 and repeated in paragraph 24 ("The choking beauty of the glade softened") and the final paragraph ("choking, beautiful truth"). The tone is coherent—combining awe and struggle—and modulates slightly (the glade's atmosphere softens, the final truth is held rather than resisted). It appears in setup, middle transformation, and closure, charging the final image. However, the tone is somewhat static; the same phrase recurs without evolving through turns, and the "choking" element does not degrade perception or force mistakes under pressure. Early signal +0.6, three-beat involvement +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, but repetition without evolution and limited pressure modulation reduce to 6.3.</comment>
