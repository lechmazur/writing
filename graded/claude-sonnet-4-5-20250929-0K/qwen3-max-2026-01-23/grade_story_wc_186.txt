<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clearly signaled and her thirty-year commitment tracked through concrete detail (brass astrolabes, charcoal sketches). Her retrocognitive ability produces vivid micro-moments but her choices feel largely predetermined by the lore she follows rather than generated by internal contradiction. The peak action—angling the prism and placing the shard—reads as execution of instructions from Master Aris rather than a stake-raising decision under competing pressures. Embodied emotion appears intermittently (tears at the end) but much of the interiority relies on abstract "thistle-blown hope" and "unshakable certainty" rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is prompt (who, where, when established early). The piece follows a Causal lens: Elara's tracking leads to the alignment, which enables the rekindling. However, the decisive turn—Master Aris's vision providing the exact method—arrives via retrocognitive echo rather than protagonist agency, softening the causal spine. The closure is a Decisive Change (beacon rekindled, lights answer across the valley) with felt emotional cost (thirty years, tears) but the resolution depends on following inherited instructions rather than a choice that narrows options. Cost is legible but the protagonist's final moves execute a script rather than transform under pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The glass humming pavilion is vividly rendered with recurring sensory anchors (thrumming hum, etched constellations, obsidian dais) and the collapse-of-civilization timeframe supplies scarcity context. Spatial choreography is clear across the spiral ascent and apex arrangement. The "shard of hush" imposes silence and the prism fragments constrain the rekindling method, so objects and micro-setting do constrain the final action. Sensory detail is occasionally generic ("profound quiet," "deep indigo") but the pavilion's hum modulates with the alignment and the charged final image of valley lights answering meets the 9+ gate for environment charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving the alignment is deliberate signal—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens as twilight approaches and the alignment window narrows, providing one temporal squeeze. However, the escalation is largely atmospheric; the protagonist faces no on-page obstacle, competing choice, or reversal that tests her commitment. The survivor camps' dismissal is told rather than dramatized as friction. The final convergence of Vega and Deneb feels ordained rather than earned through protagonist struggle, and the vision from Master Aris removes uncertainty at the peak beat. Cost is visible (thirty years, isolation) but not dramatized as a trade-off in the ending moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—that coincidences are echoes of intention—emerges through particulars (star paths, hum, alignment) and the final image of answering lights offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing. The shard of hush shifting from silencing tool to "space where coincidence transformed into profound connection" is a purposeful thematic reprise. However, the final paragraph edges toward theme summary ("proving that for those who track the star paths with faith, every coincidence is a whisper of meaning") rather than trusting the image alone. The Master Aris echo ("coincidences are echoes of intention waiting to be heard") delivers the thesis aloud, reducing subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (retrocognitive echoes, reverently traced fractures) but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("thistle-blown hope," "profound stillness," "joyous chord cascading") that reads slightly detached from immediate perception under pressure. The vision sequence maintains clean focalization. Rhythmic control is steady but syntactic variety is limited in the buildup (multiple "she + past-tense verb" constructions). The prose modulates appropriately at the climax but the final line's meta-commentary ("proving that for those who track...") steps outside the character's moment into narrator summary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Clarity is generally high and information density adequate. However, paraphrase loops appear: "the pavilion's breath, a constant companion" immediately follows "a vibration woven into the very silica"; "profound stillness" and "absolute silence" redescribe the same effect within two beats. Stock phrases recur: "with the care of a priestess," "unshakable certainty warming her spirit," "tears traced clean paths." The final paragraph stacks multiple restatements of the theme without advancing the image. Figurative language is purposeful in most beats but "thistle-blown hope" is invoked twice without evolving. No major artifacts touch the closure beat directly, but template cadence and synonym churn lower density in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The post-apocalyptic beacon-keeper tracking celestial signs is a familiar frame; the retrocognitive blessing and "shard of hush" add specificity. The alignment-as-deliberate-covenant offers a fresh angle on faith-versus-evidence, and the answering lights provide an emotionally honest ending. However, the Master Aris vision delivering the exact method at the peak beat is a convenience that undercuts ingenuity—key knowledge arrives rather than being earned through protagonist experimentation. The transformation test is marginal: swap "glass pavilion" for "stone tower" and the emotional arc holds with minor edits. The premise reads competent but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara's thirty-year tracking, her decision to ascend at twilight, and her precise arrangement of prism fragments are on-page choices that drive beats. The rekindling depends on her execution. However, the Master Aris vision supplies the critical method, reducing her agency at the peak turn. She is present in setup, middle, and closure, with visible cost (isolation, tears), landing her in the 7.0–8.4 band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The broken prism is handled in multiple beats: traced with fingertips, arranged on the dais, angled precisely, and the shard nested into its fracture. Its fragmented state necessitates the method (converging beams through the largest piece). It appears early, drives the middle arrangement, and is causally active at closure when the beams strike and the beacon blooms. Irreplaceability is high; no generic crystal substitute works.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The shard of hush is introduced early, imposes silence in two beats (before the vision and during the rekindling), and grants "crystalline clarity" that enables Elara to see Master Aris and execute the method. It is nested into the prism fracture at the climax, making it causally indispensable. The final thematic line credits it with transforming "coincidence into profound connection." Setup, development, payoff all present; closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Retrocognitive blessing is signaled early and enables two on-page beats: the vision of Master Aris and the ambient echoes of engineers/astronomers. It provides the exact rekindling instructions, making it essential to the plot. However, the trait operates as a passive receipt of information rather than a constrained choice with visible cost. No trade-off or price is dramatized (e.g., exhaustion, disorientation). Present in setup, middle, and closure; functional but one-directional.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Rekindling the beacon is the protagonist's explicit goal from paragraph five, drives her thirty-year effort, structures the climax (angling prism, placing shard, beams converging, luminescence blooming), and delivers the closure image (answering lights across the valley). The action is irreplaceable; no other verb or goal would preserve the story's logic. Setup early, developed through tracking and vision, resolved on the page with cost and consequence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Star-path tracking is signaled early ("thirty years, meticulously tracked... using salvaged brass astrolabes and charcoal sketches"), frames her expertise, and the alignment of Lyra and Cygnus is the temporal constraint that enables the rekindling. The method shapes her preparation and the climactic timing. However, the mechanics are summarized rather than shown in beats; we see the result (alignment on the horizon) but not the mid-scene tracking adjustments. Present in setup and payoff; middle development is thin.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The pavilion's hum is a persistent sensory anchor that deepens during the alignment, its etched constellations guide arrangement, the obsidian dais holds the prism fragments, and the glass walls erupt in symphony at closure. The setting provides resources (dais, apex) and the hum charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear. It appears early, constrains middle action (spiral ascent, arrangement), and is causally active at the ending. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The collapse-of-civilization timeframe is mentioned early and provides scarcity context (salvaged tools, scattered camps, "dead symbols"). Elara's thirty-year effort dramatizes elapsed time. However, the timeframe functions as static backdrop rather than live pressure; no in-scene clock or tightening window driven by the collapse itself. The alignment provides temporal urgency, but that is Method (star paths) rather than the post-collapse setting. Setup present, payoff oblique; middle pressure absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The desire to prove coincidences have meaning is stated early, drives the thirty-year tracking, structures the thematic question, and is answered in the closure image (answering lights, sacred dialogue restored). Friction appears via the camps' dismissal, though told rather than dramatized. The Master Aris vision articulates the motivation aloud ("prove we were not forgotten"), which reduces subtext. Cost is visible (isolation, "thistle-blown hope" sustained across decades). Setup, development via choice, payoff with felt cost; lands in 7.0–8.4 band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Thistle-blown hope is introduced as a metaphor in the first third, recurs once mid-story, and charges the final image of answering lights—fragile tenacity vindicated. Tone modulates from quiet determination through visionary intensity to joyous resolution, coherent across turns. However, "thistle-blown" reads slightly ornamental and the final paragraph's summary of meaning ("whisper of meaning in the vast, humming silence") drifts toward tell. Tone is present and purposeful but the reprise lacks sharp specificity at closure.</comment>
