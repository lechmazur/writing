<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kael's internal life is delivered almost entirely through abstract labels ("supernatural gentleness," "fragile attribute," "deep peace") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The wilt is described but not felt: we're told it drains color and slackens posture, yet during the climactic turn the prose offers "tears of strain" and "knuckles white"—generic physical markers that could attach to any crisis. His motivation ("to reclaim the light") is declared but never tested by a competing want or fear that would create authentic tension. The final "exhausted yet filled with abiding peace" reads like emotional summary rather than a lived internal shift with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The Orientation Test fails: by ~120 words we have only "beneath the sleeping city" and "the resonance chamber"—no anchored who/where/when until Kael is named at line three, and "thirty nights" of backstory precedes any present action. The closure—light returns along the tether—occurs on the page, but the causal chain is opaque: the philosopher's stone chip "glowed with verdigris luminescence" and the tether "held," yet we never see what specific choice or renunciation Kael made that changed the outcome versus what would have happened if he'd simply turned the key without the wilt or the song. The escalation is told ("the wilt seized him") rather than dramatized through a narrowing of options. Apply Orientation penalty −0.4 and lens ambiguity −0.3; the piece hovers between Accumulative (song-as-texture) and Causal (tether-as-mechanism) without committing, and closure cost is asserted ("restored cycle") not felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The resonance chamber is introduced with vivid detail ("perfect sphere hewn from singing granite") but functions only as backdrop: the granite hums in response to the note, yet this property never constrains a choice or alters Kael's tactics. The music box and philosopher's stone chip are handled on the page, but spatial choreography is vague—where is the arched window in relation to the workbench, and how does the tether "pierce the granite wall like mist" when the chamber is a sealed sphere? The covenant of rust and the verdigris glow anchor the thematic palette, but setting qua environment does not pressure the protagonist's moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("reclaim the light stolen by midnight") is declared early but never gains concrete shape or cost: what happens to the world or to Kael if he fails? The wilt is presented as obstacle, yet it resolves instantly when the light returns—no visible trade-off or foreclosed path. Midnight is described as "a sentient shadow" that will "willingly surrender the light each morning," but this negotiated détente is told in summary rather than dramatized as a choice that narrows options. Under any lens, escalation is asserted ("crushing weight," "knees buckled") but not built through a decision that changes the tactical picture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The covenant of rust is the thematic spine, yet it is articulated in near-prompt language: "the paradoxical art of mending what isn't torn," "profound beauty in rust rather than deceitful permanence," "honoring existence's rhythm." These are philosophical statements rather than emergent truths earned through Kael's specific struggle. The final reflection ("True mending was never force or denial...using song to remind the cosmos of its rust-honoring integrity") reads as a theme summary rather than a resonant image. The verdigris luminescence and the music box's "joyful symphony" are lovely particulars, but they serve illustration rather than reweighting prior material with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited is stable, but the prose frequently drifts into elevated register that exceeds Kael's focalizer lexicon: "paradoxical art," "amplifying pure sonic intention," "radical acceptance," "verdigris luminescence," "unwavering integrity." During peak stress the syntax remains ornate ("With a sound like the universe sighing relief") rather than compressing to match urgency. Filter verbs ("he perceived," "he reflected") are sparse, but the voice reads more like external narration about a mystic than the interior texture of a craftsman under pressure. No dialogue is present to test character distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "He sang of balance, shadow giving meaning to light, all things having their honest season" immediately after "a song of radical acceptance...leaves releasing branches without regret, rivers flowing to the sea." Stock metaphors saturate the climax: "river of dawn," "rushing back along the song-path," "universe sighing relief." Template cadence runs appear in the middle third: "He sang...He sang...The tether..." Figurative density ("liquid gold," "verdigris luminescence," "molten gold") clusters without pattern-teaching or payoff, and the final paragraph stacks summary: "exhausted yet filled with abiding peace...honored, and the world turned once more with grace." Apply loop/scaffold penalty −1.0 and figurative muddle −0.5; artifacts touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The core premise—music box repairman uses philosopher's stone chip to restore stolen dawn via song—synthesizes familiar tropes (craftsman-hero, cosmic repair, light-vs.-dark) without transforming them through lived particulars. The covenant of rust is an intriguing concept, yet it remains abstract; the verdigris glow is the sole concrete inflection. The turn (light returns, shadow accepts its place) is told rather than earned in hindsight through prior character choice. The prose leans on stock fantasy vocabulary ("sentient shadow," "sacred vow," "cosmos") and the emotional arc could transfer unchanged to a blacksmith forging a key or a gardener planting a seed.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Kael is present throughout and makes the final turn (placing the chip, turning the key, singing), but his choices do not narrow options or create visible cost—he simply executes the plan. Setup and closure gates are met; middle development is weak (he does not adapt tactics under pressure). The wilt is described but does not force a trade-off. Score at functional-but-replaceable band; a more proactive character with a dilemma would lift this.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The philosopher's stone chip appears early (workbench description), is used at the climax (placed in the music box's heart), and glows with verdigris luminescence to affirm the covenant. Three touches across setup/middle/closure, but the chip's specific properties (why verdigris? why "truth" not "gold"?) are told rather than shown through a constraint or choice. Mid-band for presence across beats without irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The covenant of rust is named early and recurs in the verdigris glow and final reflection, but it never shapes an on-page choice. It functions as theme label rather than a rule or constraint that alters Kael's tactics. Setup and closure mentions earn minimal credit; missing middle development caps at 3.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The wilt is introduced early, dramatized at the climax ("crushing weight," "knees buckled," "tears of strain"), and vanishes when the light returns. Three gates met. However, the wilt does not force a visible trade-off—Kael's hand "never ceased turning the key," so the attribute adds color but not constraint. Score at lower end of essential-across-beats band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tether is signaled early ("forging the tether"), built at the climax (song creates the filament), and completes the turn (light rushes back along it). All three gates met with causal involvement. The tether's mechanics are told ("a bridge of flawless sound") rather than shown through a choice it enables or forecloses, preventing higher score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The method is declared in exposition ("mending what isn't torn") and referenced at the climax ("This was mending what isn't torn: healing the intangible wound"), but we never see Kael apply it through a specific on-page choice. The music box is "pristine, gears polished"—nothing is demonstrated as broken in the present scene. Setup and closure mentions without middle development; functional but abstract.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The resonance chamber is introduced early ("perfect sphere hewn from singing granite"), amplifies the note at the climax (walls hum, note blooms), and holds the ritual's echo at closure. All three gates met. The chamber's acoustic properties enable the tether but do not constrain Kael's choice—he could have sung elsewhere. Mid-band for presence across beats without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The timeframe is signaled ("thirty nights," "the world hanging in the balance") and the city clock tolls midnight at the climax, but elapsed time within the scene is untracksed and the "precise moment of theft" does not tighten Kael's tactics—he simply turns the key. Setup and closure presence without middle pressure; functional but not urgent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The motivation ("to reclaim the light") is stated early, drives the action (he places the chip, sings, pours will into the tether), and is satisfied at closure (light returns). All three gates met. However, the desire is never tested by a competing want or visible cost—Kael endures discomfort but does not forfeit anything or face a dilemma. Mid-band for presence without friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Tone is consistently elevated and archaic ("sacred vow," "high priest," "covenant," "tinkersong wonder" recurs in the final paragraph) but does not modulate with pressure—the climax maintains the same ornate diction as the opening. Setup and closure presence; missing middle modulation. Functional static mood, mid-low band.</comment>
