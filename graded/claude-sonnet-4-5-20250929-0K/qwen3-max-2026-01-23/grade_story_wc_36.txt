<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's interior regret and motivation are established clearly, but embodied emotion remains largely abstract—"weight of regret," "frantic echoes of self-recrimination"—rather than physically grounded. The insight at closure ("deafness to the world's quiet language") lands as an epiphany but feels stated rather than earned through micro-choices under pressure. Internal conflict is present but alternates between reflection and ritual action rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty applied: who, where, and when are anchored by ~120 words, but the lens remains ambiguous—accumulative/textural and causal both compete without a taught pattern. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (insight harvested, peace achieved), but the cost is asserted rather than felt on the page: Kael leaves lighter, with "purpose renewed," yet no path is visibly foreclosed. The before/after is legible, but the price remains conceptual and diffuse.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The canyon setting and the driftwood markers provide concrete spatial anchors and charge the ritual frame. The gilded flute as micro-setting object shapes the closure image directly. Sensory detail ("sun-warmed sandstone," "canyon dust") is selective and purposeful, though the "avalanchingly quiet" descriptor is repeated without evolving sensory texture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—harvesting insight from failure—is signaled early and drives the ritual sequence. Pressure accumulates through the flute's sustained note and the vision of past error, but the escalation is textural rather than causal; no live option is narrowed or foreclosed with visible cost. The insight crystallizes, but Kael's path forward is expanded, not constrained, at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (yielding as strength, listening versus control) emerges from the ritual and vision, but the final lines state the lesson explicitly: "to listen deeply, to weave with humility." The driftwood markers and flute motifs recur with reweighted meaning, yet the ending's thematic answer is articulated rather than resonant through image alone. Subtext operates in the ritual mechanics but is overtaken by direct declaration in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and the narrative stance is consistent, but the diction repeatedly drifts into elevated register that clashes with immediate perception—"avalanchingly quiet," "sonic architecture of resonance," "tapestry of light." Perceptual signature is present but abstracted. No dialogue to assess. Psychic distance stays controlled, but the prose does not modulate under peak pressure; the register remains uniformly lyric throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Multiple artifact clusters reduce momentum: "avalanchingly quiet" (repeated 3×), paraphrase loops ("the silence," "the hush," "the quiet"), and stacked filter constructions ("seemed to lean," "felt the Thunder-echo Range"). Template cadence appears in the final third ("He lowered… He left… Rising, Kael felt… He walked…"). Figurative language is dense without pattern-teaching or payoff—"sonic architecture," "tapestry of light," "tide of acceptance"—and mixed metaphors ("weave he had guarded, then the jagged tear") obscure rather than clarify. Information density is moderate; many lines restate emotional state without advancing causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The ritual structure and the flute as sonic key offer specificity, but the core arc—protagonist returns to site of failure, performs ceremony, achieves insight and peace—follows a familiar template without transformation through lived detail or moral calculus. The "weaving between worlds" concept is named but remains abstract; no fresh inflection or non-obvious synthesis emerges. The final image (walking toward canyon mouth with "quiet ember") is poetic but does not surprise or reweight prior material in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael's choices (kneeling, arranging markers, playing the flute) drive the ritual sequence and the vision, shaping two distinct beats. However, his agency at closure is receptive rather than decisive—he harvests insight and walks forward, but no path is foreclosed with visible cost. Early signal and beat involvement present; causal pressure and cost connection remain diffuse.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The gilded flute appears in setup (uncasing), middle (playing the sustained note), and closure (recasing with "reverent care"). It enables the vision and charges the final image. However, its use is largely static—Kael exhales one note and sustains it—without evolving mechanics or visible trade-off. The flute's "sonic architecture" is asserted but not demonstrated through changing tactics or cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Weaving between worlds" is named as the "core concept" and the flute is described as its key, but the weaving itself occurs off-stage in the vision. The concept shapes theme and atmosphere but does not constrain on-page tactics or alter options with cost. Present and thematically resonant, but not causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Avalanchingly quiet" is mentioned three times as atmospheric descriptor but does not constrain or enable a specific action with cost. The quiet "pressed upon stone and spirit," becomes "a comforting embrace," and holds "all answers," but these are label-only claims. The attribute is ornamental rather than operant.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Uncase" (line 7) initiates the ritual sequence and is reprised at closure ("recased"). The action frames the entire arc and is specific to this moment; removing it would collapse the ritual structure. Early signal, beat involvement, and closure linkage are strong. The uncasing itself is not dramatized as a choice under pressure, but it anchors causality across the piece.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Arranging driftwood as directional markers is described in the opening third and mentioned again as "undisturbed" at closure. The markers "glowed amber" during the vision, but their mechanics do not shape Kael's choices or alter tactics. Functional and thematically resonant, but swappable with another ritual preparation without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Thunder-echo Range and Serpent's Throat canyon provide spatial anchors and charge the ritual frame. The canyon "leaned inward" and became "a steadfast companion," but the setting does not constrain choice or supply resources that alter outcome. Early signal and closure participation present; causal pressure remains low.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>"After the guardianship" (ended "three moons prior") anchors the opening and motivates Kael's return, but time does not tighten decisions or shape tactics on the page. The ritual unfolds in an untracked present. Timeframe is functional for setup but does not escalate pressure or alter closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To harvest insights from failure" is stated explicitly in line 2 and drives the ritual sequence and vision. The motivation shapes two beats (arranging markers, playing the flute) and the closure realization. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses; no friction between wants and costs appears on the page. Early signal and closure linkage are strong; embodied struggle is weak.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Canyon hush" and "avalanchingly quiet" establish tone early and recur at closure ("deeper layer of the avalanchingly quiet hush, now imbued with peace"). The tone is coherent and modulates from oppressive stillness to "comforting embrace," charging the final image. However, the tone descriptor is repeated without evolving texture, and the modulation is asserted rather than demonstrated through rhythm or diction shift.</comment>
