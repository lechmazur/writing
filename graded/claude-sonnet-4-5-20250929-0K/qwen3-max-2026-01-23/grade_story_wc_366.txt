<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias is warmly characterized through his observational skills and silent grief, with embodied emotion ("warmth bloomed in his chest—a luminescent ache"). The motivation to protect the lighthouse legacy is clear and drives the stacking ritual. However, his choices are largely contemplative and ceremonial rather than under pressure; the piece lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final act feels inevitable but not earned through internal conflict or a difficult foreclosure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elias renounces solitary silence by constructing the Phoenix Stack, entrusting the legacy to Elara with visible ritual cost. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through memory, stone placement, and the sea glass motif. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the first paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs as Elias moves from grief to active guardianship. The cost is felt in his "luminescent ache" and the physical act of kneeling and stacking, though the emotional price could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lantern room is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (cold brass, extinguished wick, moonlight through the Fresnel lens, spectral rainbows). The setting pressures Elias's choices by providing the cairn, the sea glass, and the legacy space that demands continuation. Spatial choreography is clear (windowsill, iron grating, door). The micro-setting of the stone stack constrains the ritual and charges the final image, qualifying for high-band entry under the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—protecting the lighthouse legacy through the anonymous letter chain—is signaled early and drives the ritual. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias dismantles the old stack and builds the Phoenix Stack, narrowing options from passive grief to active guardianship. The piece operates under Accumulative pressure rather than causal reversals; the cost is legible in the physical ritual and emotional ache. However, the tightening is gentle and lacks a visceral trade-off or loss that would elevate escalation into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from stone, memory, and the continuity of care—"proof that care outlasts absence." The sea glass and Phoenix Stack avoid overt symbolism by being woven into action. However, phrases like "bottled the feeling of safety" and "quiet rebellion against isolation" edge toward theme statements rather than pure dramatization. The final image offers resonance but stops short of a non-literal answer that reweights the premise without stating it. The thematic work is solid but not exceptional.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature ("warmly observant," "reading subtle shifts"). Diction is controlled and fits Elias's voice (rope, oilskin, tide metaphors). However, elevated register appears frequently ("reticent," "spectral rainbows," "luminescent ache," "fierce need to bottle the feeling") and drifts above a taciturn skipper's lexicon, especially in peak beats. Free indirect style is clean, but the poetic overlay occasionally feels authored rather than character-generated, reducing immediacy under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, figurative language saturates nearly every sentence ("moonlight bled," "spectral rainbows," "luminescent ache," "warmth bloomed," "gentle, persistent glow") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalties (−0.5). Template cadence appears in adjacent descriptive stems ("the profound absence," "the dust motes," "the western windowsill"). Paraphrase loops occur ("bottled the feeling" recurs without added pressure). Line-level clarity is strong, but density of ornament and repeated stems lower the score. No artifacts touch the closure beat directly, so cap at −0.8 total.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise—silent stone messages as an anonymous letter chain—offers a fresh angle on lighthouse keeper succession. The Phoenix Stack ritual and sea glass signature are specific and memorable. However, the emotional arc (grief → guardianship → legacy transfer) follows a familiar template, and the piece does not transform it through non-obvious moral calculus or lived conflict. The synthesis is competent and intentional but not surprising in hindsight. Risk-taking is present in the lyric, reflection-heavy mode, but the payoff is contemplative rather than transformative.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and frames the piece, but his choices are ceremonial (dismantling, stacking) rather than high-stakes decisions that alter tactics. Observation dominates action. His reticence is consistent but does not constrain a key turn with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sea glass appears in three beats: initial discovery, dismantling, and pinnacle placement. It serves as Hemlock's signature and charges the Phoenix Stack's meaning. Removal would weaken the legacy chain and the final image. Strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The anonymous letter chain is introduced early, shapes Elias's motivation, and frames the Phoenix Stack as continuation of the chain. It constrains the ritual (must be silent, stone-based) and appears in the ending via Elara's anticipated recognition. Functional across setup, middle, and closure, but does not drive a high-pressure turn.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Warmly observant" is demonstrated (dust motes, teacup, cairn details) but does not constrain a choice with cost. It enriches characterization but remains largely label-only without tactical friction or tradeoff on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Protect" drives the entire ritual and Elias's motivation. It shapes the middle beat (dismantling, stacking) and the ending (ensuring Elara receives the message). However, the action is gentle and ceremonial; it could be swapped for "honor" or "continue" with minor edits. Cost is present but not sharpened by the verb itself.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stone-stacking is introduced early with Hemlock's code ("tall pillar: peace holds"), shapes the middle ritual (Phoenix Stack assembly), and appears in the ending as the message to Elara. Mechanics matter: choice of stones, alignment, sea glass placement. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The haunted lantern room is established early, provides the cairn and sea glass, and frames the ritual space. It pressures Elias by embodying absence and legacy. The cold iron grating and windowsill are tactile and alter the stacking action. Solid micro-setting integration, but does not force a tactical choice under duress.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The lamp's extinction is mentioned in the opening and provides urgency ("forty minutes prior"), but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page. Elias's ritual proceeds at contemplative pace without a live clock constraining moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"To bottle the feeling of safety" is stated early and drives the ritual. It appears in the middle ("bottled the feeling of safety not in glass, but in this fragile architecture") and charges the ending. However, it is told more than dramatized; friction between want and cost is implied but not sharply on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Luminescent ache" is coherent across beats, modulates with the ritual (sorrow → solace), and charges the final image ("gentle, persistent glow in the hollow of his ribs"). The tone supports pressure and closure but is applied via consistent descriptors rather than deepening through action. Solid lyric reprise without sharp tonal escalation.</comment>
