<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's sensitively perceptive nature is established early and drives her search, but the interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction ("souls' echo demanding guardianship") rather than embodied contradiction. Her motivation to discover what walls dream about remains consistent but never faces a genuine test that forces her to renounce or alter her quest—she simply succeeds and deepens her commitment. The final covenant feels declared rather than earned through a choice that forecloses a live alternative. Embodiment is present in sensory details (fingers on stone, tears welling) but emotional progression stays on a single upward arc without credible friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara moves through discovery beats (passage → fireplace → diaries → film negative) that layer meaning toward a thematic reconfiguration at the end. Orientation anchors who and where by the opening lines; when is signaled ("after the climate shifts") but remains atmospheric rather than a live constraint. The closure offers a Conceptual Repricing—legacy shifts from sorrow alone to honoring both joy and grief—but the cost remains conceptual and oblique; no on-page action or renunciation makes the weight tangible in the final image. One meaningful deepening occurs when the film negative reweights the diaries' despair, satisfying minimal escalation for this length and lens, but the felt price is asserted ("heart heavier yet clearer") rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage and fireplace alcove anchor setting early and concretely. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—"damp flagstones," "black mouth of ash," "ivy thinned" sunlit patch—and filtered through Elara's professional and emotional lens. The film negative's reweighting in the sunlit patch charges the final image by contrasting enclosed stone with remembered open garden, and the recurring ivy brackets the story with a closing rustle that mirrors her burden. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves; the environment subtly mirrors internal states (encroaching ivy vs. preserved sunlight) without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering what walls dream about—is signaled in the opening beats and sustained through investigation. One meaningful deepening occurs when the film negative reveals preserved joy against the diaries' despair, reweighting the quest from curiosity to covenant. However, no on-page reversal tests Elara's commitment; the discovery always rewards rather than threatens her, and no live choice forces her to trade one value for another. The "legacy's burden" remains abstract; no visible cost (time, stamina, social credit, or physical tool) alters her tactics on the page. Agency is present but operates only as accumulation toward affirmation, not renunciation or endurance with felt sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the concrete particulars of half-burned diaries, the film negative, and the ivy-veiled passage: memory's duality of grief and joy, preservation against erasure. The ending offers a resonant reconfiguration—legacy becomes "a thread connecting past joy to future remembrance" rather than weight alone—without stating a moral. However, several lines veer into thematic echo: "legacy's burden was not sorrow alone, but the sacred duty to honor joy and grief equally" articulates the thesis rather than letting the film negative and Elara's tears do the work. The final image (walls dreaming beside her, film negative as beacon) reweights prior material but is diluted by the explain-everything final paragraphs that mechanically resolve ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Voice carries a consistent lyric-poetic register with purposeful compression ("corridor echo cartographer," "symphonies of human experience") that reads as character-particular rather than generic. Perceptual signature is present—Elara notices vibrations, textures, and layered time—but diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("sacred duty," "covenant") that feels authorial rather than filtered through a woman kneeling on damp flagstones. Psychic distance modulates intentionally between close embodiment (trembling hands, tears) and reflective contemplation. Filter verbs ("understood," "knew," "felt") appear frequently but remain voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. No dialogue; N/A for that bullet.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies across sentences and paragraphs; opening lines and closing cadence create visual and sonic texture. However, pervasive paraphrase loops and thematic restatements reduce propulsion: "legacy's burden" appears eight times with minor variation, "sensitively perceptive" recurs as a label without new action, and multiple lines restate the same commitment to remembering ("I carry your dreams," "faithful witness," "chart the dreams so they would never fade"). Template cadence appears in repetitive stems: "She [verb]" openings across multiple beats. Stock metaphors ("black mouth of ash," "symphonies of human experience") and elevated diction ("covenant," "weave through stone") occasionally drift from the POV's immediate sensory experience. Apply −1.0 cumulative for loops and scaffold under the Non-closure Accumulation Cap; the final image avoids direct artifact contamination but earlier beats carry the weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core premise—an echo cartographer discovering what walls dream—offers a fresh occupational angle, and the half-burned diaries + film negative combination is specific. However, the emotional arc (curiosity → discovery → covenant to remember) follows a predictable template without significant transformation or resistance; Elara's journey rewards rather than challenges her initial impulse. The climate-shift setting and ivy-veiled ruin are vivid but risk proximity to widely used post-apocalyptic/decay templates. The thematic pivot from despair to preserving joy is earned by the film negative but articulated in near-platitude final lines ("legacy was not a weight to crush, but a thread connecting past joy to future remembrance"). The story commits fully to its premise without retreat, satisfying conceptual integrity, but the resolution's safety and tidy symmetry avoid bold risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara as corridor echo cartographer frames the opening, drives the investigation across three beats (passage entry, fireplace discovery, film-negative examination), and her professional lens filters sensory detail and motivation throughout. Her choice to seal the fragments and whisper covenant at closure links her role to the ending's charge. However, the cartographer function itself—mapping echoes—remains mostly metaphorical; she does not make a map on the page or face a professional constraint that alters tactics. The role shapes perception and stakes but does not force a renunciation or tradeoff. Present in setup, middle, and payoff; causally active in two beats; closure linkage clear but role-specific cost absent.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Film negative strip first appears at midpoint (word ~78), is held to light and deciphered in two distinct beats (revelation and sealing), and directly shapes the ending image ("beacon," "safe against her chest"). Its specific properties—preserving visual joy versus written despair—enable the thematic pivot and reweight the diaries' sorrow. However, it arrives after the first third, missing early setup, and resolves a problem (understanding legacy's dual nature) it did not help create. Swappability is low; a photograph would lack the celluloid-as-preservation resonance. Present in middle development and payoff; causal pressure and closure linkage strong; late arrival and convenience factor prevent higher score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Legacy's burden" is named early (word ~26), recurs eight times, drives Elara's motivation ("weight of every uncovered story"), and the ending repositions it from crushing weight to connecting thread. It shapes the dominant stake—honoring memory—and the final covenant. However, the concept mostly operates as theme rather than on-page constraint; no scene shows Elara forced to choose between preserving one memory over another due to burden's cost (time, capacity, emotional toll). The final transformation is asserted in reflection rather than demonstrated through a choice that forecloses a path. Present in setup, development (as motive), and payoff; causal pressure moderate; cost conceptual but not dramatized with visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Sensitively perceptive nature" is introduced early (word ~14), recurs three times as a label, and enables her to feel vibrations and weave laughter through stone. However, the trait never constrains a choice or imposes a visible cost—she does not suffer overload, distraction, or misread a signal due to heightened sensitivity. It remains a descriptor of her professional skill without tradeoff. Present in setup and mentioned at closure but purely enabling; no friction or price on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Glimpse" (word ~137) names the action when Elara holds the negative to light and sees the sun-drenched garden; this moment delivers the revelation that reweights despair with preserved joy and triggers her tears. The action is signaled ("the action she sought"), occurs on the page in a distinct beat, and directly shapes the thematic turn. However, it is somewhat swappable—"examined," "viewed," or "studied" could replace it with minor edits—and the mechanics (holding to light) are simple rather than constraining. Present in middle development and shaping payoff; causal role clear but specificity moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Half-burned diaries found in a fireplace are discovered at word ~52, deciphered across two beats (scorched words, charred edges), and their content (burning to forget vs. hiding the film) directly enables the thematic contrast at closure. The method is signaled early in the investigation, its mechanics (brush away decay, separate brittle pages) matter on the page, and it shapes multiple attempts. The fireplace setting recurs in the alcove and ties to the burned-versus-preserved motif. Present in setup (fireplace at word ~52), development (deciphering), and payoff (thematic hinge); causal pressure and specificity high.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Ivy-veiled passage is named in the opening line, brackets the story (opening entry, closing sigh of gratitude), and provides the enclosure/preservation motif that mirrors Elara's role. The passage "hummed with urgent resonance" to pull her toward the alcove, offering mild causal pressure. However, it functions mostly as atmospheric container; no choice is constrained by the passage's structure, and spatial choreography (passage → alcove → sunlit patch) is straightforward without tactical friction. Present in setup and payoff; lyric reprise reweights slightly; micro-setting test not fully met as it does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the climate shifts" anchors the timeframe in the opening line and explains the ivy, softened stone, and "gray-green present" versus vibrant past. However, the timeframe remains vague backdrop; no live clock or temporal pressure tightens Elara's decisions, and the "endless rain" and lost snow mentioned in the diaries are historical context rather than present constraint. The past-versus-present contrast charges the thematic pivot but does not shape tactics. Present in setup as frame; does not constrain middle choices or urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To discover what walls dream about" is introduced at word ~36 as Elara's driving obsession, sustains her investigation across all beats, and the ending explicitly answers it ("walls still dreamed of sunlight"). The motivation is dramatized through her actions (kneeling, deciphering, carrying artifacts) and shapes the dominant stake. However, the desire faces no friction—no competing want, cost, or temptation to stop—and remains a singular upward arc. Told in reflection but enacted through search; conflict between want and cost absent; closure directly fulfills rather than complicates the motive.</comment>
