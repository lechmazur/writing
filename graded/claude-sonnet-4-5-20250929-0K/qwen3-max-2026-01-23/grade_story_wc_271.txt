<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is specific and sustained—pearl of stillness, somatic grounding—but her decision path is retrospective; we observe aftermath rather than witness fresh choice. The freeze-to-grounding sequence is dramatized, yet the emotional beats recycle therapeutic vocabulary ("somatic markers," "realism's unshakable bedrock") instead of embodied contradiction. The final smile and orchid-watering gesture feel performed rather than inevitable, softening the stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara carries her pearl forward, grief integrated. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—density increases through repeated somatic anchors and image reprises (photograph, lighthouse, pearl)—but the ending reconfigures nothing; it confirms what the opening already established. Cost is asserted ("realistic weight," "mosaic of loss and love") but not dramatized as a visible forfeiture or trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The arboretum and cliff setting anchor early and return throughout; the cypress bark and stone bench serve as concrete somatic tools. The lighthouse's reframing (vigilance withdrawn → resilience) is purposeful. Sensory detail is selective and consistent with Elara's botanical expertise, though the "pine-scented air" and "salt-tanged breeze" lean generic at the closure beat where specificity would charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—sustaining the pearl of stillness amid grief—is signaled early and threads the entire piece. Pressure is static; the gull's cry triggers the freeze-to-grounding sequence, but this is practice, not test. No on-page reversal or tightening forecloses a path; Elara performs her method without facing a cost that alters her options. The child's laughter at the end observes resilience rather than proving it through a difficult choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—integration of loss and hope, realism anchoring optimism—emerges through image (lighthouse, sea lavender in cracks, orchids) and action (grounding ritual, photograph handling). The pearl metaphor is purposeful but explicitly articulated ("she called her pearl of stillness") rather than discovered through dramatization. The final paragraph's declarations ("realistically anchored optimism," "defiant beauty") reduce theme to summary. The piece resists easy moralism yet the ending leans toward affirming closure rather than lingering ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable; Elara's perceptual signature—botanical detail, somatic specificity—distinguishes the voice. Diction occasionally drifts into therapeutic register ("somatic markers," "realistically anchored optimism") that feels prescriptive rather than character-native. No head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates appropriately between crisis and calm, though the final paragraph's rhythm flattens into declarative summary rather than sustaining the sensory texture that charged earlier beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops proliferate: "realism's unshakable bedrock" / "realistic weight"; "somatic markers" appears four times in near-identical function; "quietly talented" recycled three times without fresh embodiment. Template cadence dominates the final third: "She [verb]... She [verb]... She [verb]..." across six consecutive beats. Mixed metaphor: "pearl of stillness" as both object and inner glow strains coherence. Information density is moderate; many sentences restate theme rather than advance it. Artifacts touch closure (final paragraph), triggering the Q7 disallow-9+ rule and capping high-band entries at 8.8 globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The premise—trauma survivor using somatic grounding—is familiar; the arboretum and lighthouse setting offer fresh spatial anchors. The pearl-of-stillness metaphor is purposeful but the ending delivers validation rather than a non-obvious synthesis. The photograph's evolution from wound to testament follows a predictable arc. Emotional specificity (freeze-to-grounding ritual, botanical illustration as coping) adds texture, yet the final beats lean into affirmation without risk or surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her survivor identity frames stakes, but her choices on the page are retrospective demonstrations of an already-mastered method. The freeze-to-grounding sequence is enacted rather than tested; no on-page decision alters her tactics or forecloses a path. She appears in closure (watering orchids, smiling), but passively.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The photograph appears in three beats: jacket pocket (early), smoothed on the bench (midpoint turn), tucked away (closure). Its meaning shifts from "tangible weight" to "testament woven into her realistically anchored optimism," and it is physically handled. However, it does not constrain a choice or create cost; it is observed and reframed, not used to alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The pearl of stillness is named early and recurs throughout ("pearl glowed within," "she held the pearl"). It is explicitly defined as "luminous calm at her center" and "portable peace," but it functions as theme label rather than stake-shaping concept. It does not constrain options or enable a difficult trade-off; it is invoked, not tested.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Quietly talented appears three times, each as a descriptor: "quietly talented in botanical illustration," "quietly talented spirit made manifest," "quietly talented hands gentle on the soil." The trait is told, not shown in a choice with cost. Illustration and orchid propagation are mentioned but do not enable or constrain on-page action. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Freeze anchors the inciting beat (gull's cry → involuntary freeze) and recurs at closure ("initiated freeze now as reverence"). The action is specific to Elara's trauma history and her method; swapping it would require structural edits. It shapes two distinct beats and is reweighted at the end (panic → reverence). However, it does not narrow options or create cost; it is practiced, not fought.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Somatic markers are signaled early (bark, mist, breath) and the method is enacted in the freeze-to-grounding sequence. The mechanics are shown: focus inward, catalog sensations, weave threads. The method appears again at closure (sun-warmed bench, pine-scented air) and shapes two beats. However, the process is demonstration, not discovery; no choice depends on whether it succeeds or fails.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The arboretum and cliff are present from the opening and anchor all action. The setting supplies concrete resources (cypress bark, stone bench, greenhouse) used in the grounding ritual. The lighthouse below functions symbolically but is reframed on the page. The cliff's precariousness mirrors theme and the greenhouse orchids tie to closure. The setting shapes tactics (walking to bench, watering plants) and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the last lighthouse keeper departed" is mentioned once in reference to the abandoned lighthouse. It does not tighten decisions, create urgency, or alter tactics. The piece unfolds in a timeless present; no clock constrains Elara's movements or choices. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation—anchor optimism in realism—is explicitly articulated multiple times ("her motivation was to anchor optimism in realism," "realistically anchored optimism"). It frames the stakes and is threaded through imagery (sea lavender in cracks, lighthouse, photograph). However, it is declared rather than dramatized through conflicting wants; no on-page choice forces Elara to choose between optimism and realism or pay a cost for holding both. The motivation shapes framing but not friction.</comment>
