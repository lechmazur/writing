<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is stated early (to discover Albright's intentions), but her interior life remains thin. The "blithe spirit" and "tenderly organized" traits are label-only; they do not generate contradictory impulses or on-page tradeoffs under pressure. The final planting decision feels inevitable from the start rather than earned through visible cost or struggle. No secondary character applies live pressure; all conflict is solved through passive decoding.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (uncharted echoes accrue meaning through each thread). Orientation anchors who and where adequately, though "after the chess clock runs down" remains vague. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the spiral pattern, but cost is asserted ("the community's confusion now woven into a narrative") rather than dramatized with a visible forfeiture or stance shift on the page. The sequence is more illustrative than causal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The cobalt silo and tapestry are vivid anchors; the sovereign case tools (needle, lens) constrain Elara's method concretely. Sensory detail (scent of rain, burnt umber tension) is selective and purposeful. However, spatial choreography inside the silo remains static—kneeling, focusing, rising—without friction from the environment. The final spiral around Albright's stone charges the ending image modestly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering Albright's intention) is clear, but no on-page reversal or tightening narrows Elara's options. Each thread decodes smoothly without resistance; no thread contradicts her hypothesis or forces a reinterpretation. The ending reweights prior confusion into understanding, yet this shift lacks a felt price—no time pressure, no sacrifice, no foreclosed path. Escalation reads as accretion without cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme (teaching as love, growth through humility) emerges organically from the decoded threads and the spiral motif. The final truth—"True victory is measured in the growth of another"—borders on explicit moralizing but is embedded in Albright's voice rather than narrator summary. The forget-me-not spiral offers a non-literal answer. However, the resolution feels tidy; no counter-reading or moral ambiguity lingers.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction ("velveteen gloom," "tenderly organized") is consistent and attempts lyricism, but the perceptual signature is generic—Elara notices what the plot requires, not what a gardener's eye would prioritize. Filter verbs ("she believed," "she understood") dull immediacy in key beats. Register occasionally drifts elevated ("meticulously crafted lesson in humility") beyond the gardener's demonstrated idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Pervasive text-pattern artifacts: "tenderly organized" appears three times without functional variation; "velveteen gloom" recurs as a static label; paraphrase loops ("shape of intentions" / "shape of a beautiful intention"). Template cadence runs through the middle (each thread decoded → echo released → understanding accrued). Figurative language appears in most sentences of the tapestry sequence without escalation or cost. Final-paragraph moralizing ("intentions, like gardens, required tending") replaces scene pressure. Apply −1.4 for spread and −0.3 for closure-beat proximity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Core concept (emotional residues as "uncharted echoes" decoded via tapestry threads) is fresh in detail. However, the chess resignation mystery and mentorship-as-love arc follow template beats: misunderstood sacrifice → decoded lesson → understanding blooms. The gardener-as-memory-keeper synthesis is mildly original but underexplored; her cemetery work does not constrain or complicate the silo decoding. No bold risk or non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but makes no pressure-driven choices. She decodes threads in sequence without conflict; her "blithe spirit" is asserted, not tested. She appears in closure (planting the spiral) but that act is illustrative, not a decision that forecloses alternatives.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The sovereign case appears in setup (palm, opening), development (tools used to decode), and closure (closing the case). It enables the decoding method and recurs with modest reweighting ("her heart feeling tenderly organized"). However, it could be swapped for any artifact-with-tools without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Uncharted echoes shape the method (listening to residues) and provide content (Albright's voice, scent, tension). Present across beats but function as information delivery rather than constraint or cost. Removing "uncharted" and calling them "recorded" or "psychic" would change little.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Tenderly organized" appears as a label in setup, mid-story ("her work was always tenderly organized"), and closure ("her heart feeling tenderly organized"). It describes her cemetery style but does not enable or constrain a live choice with cost. Purely ornamental trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Untangle" is the central action: signaled early, performed across multiple beats (each thread separated), and directly shapes the closure (spiral revealed). The word and its cognates ("untangled," "decoded") recur purposefully. Removing this verb family would require rewriting the method and ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Decoding frayed threads is signaled in setup, executed across three beats (silver/green/umber threads), and produces the closure image (spiral pattern). The method is specific, irreplaceable, and causally essential. Early signal, beat involvement, and closure linkage all present.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The cobalt silo frames the scene, supplies the tapestry, and the open roof allows starlight that mirrors the ending spiral. Present in setup and closure. However, the space itself does not pressure choices—any quiet room with the tapestry would function identically. The stars add lyric resonance but do not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"After the chess clock runs down" anchors the story post-event but imposes no live time constraint. The timeframe is backdrop, not pressure. Elara decodes at her own pace; no ticking urgency shapes her method or choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The motivation (discover Albright's intention) is stated in setup, drives the decoding action, and resolves at closure. However, it is never conflicted—no competing desire, no cost to continuing. Friction between want and obstacle is absent; she pursues and succeeds without sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Velveteen gloom" recurs in setup, middle ("velveteen gloom no longer felt like an ending"), and closure framing. It establishes mood but remains static—no modulation under pressure. The tone does not charge the final image with additional weight; it is descriptive rather than integral to closure meaning.</comment>
