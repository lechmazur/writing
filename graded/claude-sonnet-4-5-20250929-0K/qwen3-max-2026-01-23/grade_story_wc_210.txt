<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's interior is heavily dominated by reflection and abstract conceptual language ("the disciplined architecture of her working memory," "conception was complete") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Her motivation is declared coherent and unwavering throughout; no competing impulses complicate the path. The final act of burying the bottle reads as symbolic ceremony rather than a choice with visible cost that forecloses an alternative. Emotional progression is tidy—solitude transforms into purpose without messy friction or real trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where within the opening lines; the ten-year gap and silence frame the situation clearly. The dominant lens reads Accumulative/Textural: sensory threads and conceptual layering build toward the blueprint and burial. However, the closure unit is a planted seed and symbolic vow—Charged Poise is claimed, but no on-page cost is legible; the story tells us the foundation is laid "within her" without a felt price or foreclosed path. The ending image of future lanterns and breathing Cove is declared rather than dramatized, diluting the closure effect under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and consistent: salt wind, tattered lanterns, pine resin scent, rice-paper thump. Old Woman Mei's laughter and Kael's net-mending are concrete anchors. The amber bottle and hemp paper appear in the final beats and charge the closure image, meeting the micro-setting test. Spatial choreography remains stable across quay, workshop steps, and central plaza. However, the Cove itself functions more as backdrop than constraint; no environmental feature narrows Elara's options or imposes a tactical cost on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reimagining civilization through craft—is signaled early and held. Pressure accumulates via remembered sensory threads and conceptual layering, fitting the Accumulative lens. However, escalation is primarily internal and conceptual; no external reversal or live opposition tests Elara's resolve. The final act of sketching and burying the bottle deepens commitment, but no visible trade-off or foreclosed alternative appears—she had no competing path to renounce. The story tells us "the foundation was laid" without showing a price paid or tactic altered.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—craft over magic, memory over nostalgia—emerges through concrete images: lantern-making, net-mending, communal ovens. The unopenable bottle is a clear motif anchoring the premise. However, the final third becomes overtly thematic: "We honor ancestors by embodying their wisdom, not repeating their magic" is direct thesis statement, and the closing litany ("human hands, human hope, human continuity") edges into moralizing. The thematic question is answered with a stated moral rather than a resonant image, reducing subtext at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Single third-person POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present: Elara notices resin scent, paper texture, stone surfaces. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, though elevated at times ("sediment of the past," "crucible," "manifest"). Free indirect style is clean. The whispered line to the wind feels slightly performative but remains within voice. No dialogue beyond the single whispered vow, so conversational naturalism is not tested. Psychic distance is consistent; POV modesty holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: "conception was complete, a living vision held firm in her mind's eye" is summary after abstract claim. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching: "anchors dragging her into despair," "mental crucible," "honest light," "cradle" in final lines. Paraphrase loops appear: "the conception was complete" echoes "clarity crystallized within her"; "embodying their wisdom, not repeating their magic" is restated across multiple beats. Template cadence is visible in the closing sequence: "Each future lantern... And in that promise... Paper-Lantern Cove would breathe..." Scaffold phrases dull momentum rather than propel. Apply −0.8 for density and loops touching closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The core premise—rejecting magic for craft-based revival—offers a fresh angle on ghost-town and post-magic settings. The unopenable bottle as paradox ("some truths require acceptance, not force") is a specific, grounded twist. However, the emotional arc and resolution follow a predictable template: lone visionary plants symbolic seed, declares new beginning. The final third recycles familiar post-apocalyptic/revival tropes without transformation: greenhouse design, library, ritual lighting. The ending's declarative optimism ("the Cove was already alive") lacks the earned ambiguity or cost that would distinguish it from median inspirational conclusions.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara appears throughout and her interior reflection dominates the text. However, her "choices" are primarily conceptual: she decides to sit, recall, sketch, bury the bottle. None of these decisions creates a meaningful reversal or tightening; the path from solitude to blueprint is smooth and unchallenged. The final burial is symbolic gesture rather than a choice with visible cost. She is present in setup, middle, and ending, but her role is more observer and vessel for thematic statement than agent whose decisions alter tactics or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The amber bottle appears in setup ("In her palm, she cradled..."), middle ("The unopenable bottle reinforced her resolve"), and ending ("she pressed the amber bottle deep into the soil"). Its unopenable nature is noted twice and tied to the lesson of acceptance. At closure it becomes the "first cornerstone," reweighted from teaching tool to foundation object. However, its role is primarily symbolic anchor; it does not constrain a tactic or narrow options in a pressured beat. The reprise elevates it, but swapping for another ritual object would require only minor edits to theme language.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Ghost town revival is the dominant stake from the opening ("deserted alchemist") through the final image ("the Cove would breathe again"). It shapes her tactics: recalling communal practices, sketching greenhouse, burying cornerstone. The concept drives the blueprint and ending ritual. However, the revival occurs conceptually within her mind rather than through dramatized external resistance or cost; the story tells us revival "had begun" via a planted seed, not through an on-page test or sacrifice. The concept is essential to closure but functions more as thematic backdrop than live obstacle.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Rejects false comfort" is explicitly stated in the opening: "She consciously rejected the false comfort of nostalgia or the fantasy of the magic's return." It recurs when she refuses to seek an opening in the bottle ("seeking an opening was false comfort"). The trait constrains her path—she will not wish for magic's return—but the constraint is conceptual, not dramatized through a tempting choice she visibly renounces. No moment shows her wavering or paying a felt price for this rejection. The attribute is present in setup and middle with thematic tie-in, but the cost remains implicit.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Conceive" appears explicitly: "To conceive this new world, she would rely solely on the disciplined architecture of her working memory" and later "the conception was complete." The action anchors the middle section: unlocking sensory threads, weaving them into a blueprint. The final acts (sketching, burying) flow from this conception. However, "conceive" could be swapped for "envision" or "design" without altering story logic; the specificity lies in label rather than irreplaceable mechanics. It is present in setup, drives the middle reflective block, and shapes the ending, meeting all three gates, but remains somewhat generic as a mental act.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Working memory" is named once in the setup ("she would rely solely on the disciplined architecture of her working memory") and again at the start of the middle block ("Her working memory unlocked sensory threads"). The mechanics shape the recall sequence: pine resin, rice paper, Mei's laughter, Kael's nets. However, "working memory" as a method is largely label-only; the text does not distinguish it from general recollection or mental review. Swapping for "memory" or "mind's eye" would not alter the sequence. It appears in setup and middle but does not impose a unique constraint or cost at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Paper-Lantern Cove is named and described throughout: skeletal remains, crimson lanterns, cobblestone quay, derelict workshop, central plaza, stone lantern post. It anchors spatial choreography and provides the thematic frame (lanterns = craft tradition). The setting's desertion is the inciting situation; its revival is the ending stake. However, the Cove does not constrain tactics or impose a physical obstacle; Elara moves freely without resistance. The setting is essential to premise and closure symbolism, meeting setup and ending gates, but it functions as thematic stage rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the last wish is granted" is stated in the opening: "Ten years had passed since the last wish... was granted." It establishes the Cove's desertion and the silence Elara endures. However, the ten-year gap is static context rather than a live clock; no ticking urgency or deadline shapes her choices. The story unfolds in a single continuous present (quay → steps → plaza) without time pressure. The timeframe anchors setup but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics in the middle or ending.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To reimagine an entire civilization" is explicitly stated: "Her motivation burned with quiet ferocity: not to resurrect the old Cove, but to reimagine an entire civilization rooted in tangible skill." It frames the blueprint she conceives and the sketch/burial at closure. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants; no friction between this grand ambition and a smaller, safer goal appears. The scale (entire civilization vs. one greenhouse) is declared but not tested. Present in setup, drives the middle conception, and shapes ending actions, but remains frictionless—no visible cost or competing desire.</comment>
