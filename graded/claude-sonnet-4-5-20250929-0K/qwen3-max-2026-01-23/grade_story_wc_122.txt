<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (defeating numbness) is clear and her transformation at closure is visible, but the journey feels overly smooth. The breakthrough arrives through passive reception rather than a choice under competing pressures—she sits, receives vibration, and numbness dissolves without internal friction or a visible price paid in the moment. Kael remains a wise facilitator without contradiction or a stake of his own. The ending forecloses numbness but the cost is conceptual rather than dramatized: no scene shows what she must now give up or endure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: sensory details and the drum's vibrations layer toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Elara moves from numbness to aliveness). Closure is on the page and the cost is felt emotionally, though the mechanics arrive late (phonograph method introduced past the 40% mark) and the final image leans heavily on assertion ("no longer defined by absence") rather than a concrete action or choice that forecloses a path. Orientation is clear early. One meaningful deepening occurs when vibration bypasses deafness, but the turn is delivered to her rather than earned through her agency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cavern is vividly rendered—stone walls, hanging hides, copper wires, stretched membrane—and the "audibly muted sanctuary" functions as both atmosphere and thematic container. The drum itself becomes micro-setting, placed in her lap and felt as tactile pressure. The final image ("drum against her chest") charges closure by returning the object as a living presence. Spatial choreography is clean and the setting subtly mirrors her internal state without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (defeat numbness, rediscover music's pulse) is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the drum's construction and the climactic vibration sequence, but escalation is largely external: Kael acts, Elara receives. The single meaningful tightening—vibration bypassing deafness—does reweight her options, yet the breakthrough arrives without a live cost or tradeoff on the page. No competing desire or fear creates friction; the resolution feels granted rather than hard-won.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme (silence as fertile ground, not void; connection through vibration) emerges organically from the drum-making process and Elara's tactile symphony. The broken needle's transformation from loss to legacy is purposeful and specific. However, the final paragraph edges toward thesis statement: "no longer defined by absence, but by connection" and "the needle that stitched her back" are near-literal articulations of theme. The ending offers resonance but leans on summary rather than a non-literal image alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and close to Elara; perceptual filtering (chalk dust, chinrest curve) is character-specific. Kael's signing is handled cleanly without head-hopping. Diction is generally controlled, though occasional elevated phrasing ("fertile ground," "vibrant, humming aliveness") strays toward lyric generality under peak emotion. No dialogue per se (signing substitutes), and the voice remains coherent. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the drum sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and rhythmically varied, with strong imagery (amber leaves, copper wires, ghostly cascade). However, the piece carries noticeable text artifacts: "emotional numbness" appears as a label in multiple beats without fresh embodiment; the final third stacks near-synonyms ("vibrant, humming aliveness," "tactile symphony," "fertile ground") and template-style reflection ("Memories flooded her—not as sounds, but as textures"). Paraphrase loops appear: "The numbness dissolved" is restated as "no longer defined by absence" within two paragraphs. These lower density and dull the closure image slightly. Apply baseline −0.6 for patterned artifacts; an additional −0.2 for paraphrase loop touching the ending.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The deaf-teacher-rediscovers-music premise is familiar, yet the backward-played phonograph and etched drumhead offer a fresh procedural angle. The transformation of the broken needle from grief relic to frame ornament is specific and purposeful. However, the emotional arc (numbness → breakthrough via wise mentor) follows a well-worn template without a non-obvious moral calculus or risky structural choice. The story commits fully to its premise but does not transform it through lived friction or ambiguity. Mid-band for competent execution of a derivative frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Deaf music teacher frames the story and her deafness necessitates the tactile drum method, shaping the middle turn when vibration bypasses hearing. She appears early, her occupation informs her memories (classroom sunbeam, student's smile), and her transformation at closure is legible. However, her key choice—sitting and receiving the drum—is passive; the turn is delivered by Kael rather than driven by her agency under competing pressures. Present in all three gates but causal pressure is modest. 5.8: shapes one key turn, present at closure, but swappable agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Broken phonograph needle appears in beat one (carried in her palm), beat two (offered as confession), middle (Kael uses it as chisel to etch the drumhead), and closure (returned set into the drum's frame as transformed symbol). It accumulates meaning across beats and its final reprise reweights loss as legacy, charging the ending image. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage. 7.2: essential across beats and ending, though its mechanics (etching) could plausibly be done with another tool.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Filament of hush" is named once in Kael's dialogue ("the delicate, spiraling grooves") and echoed in narration ("The audibly muted space became a vessel, amplifying the filament of hush"). It functions as thematic metaphor but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics on the page. Setup is present, payoff is thematic assertion, but middle development is absent. 4.1: functional label, replaceable with "silence's texture" or similar phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Audibly muted" describes the cavern early ("the world softened into an audibly muted sanctuary") and returns at closure ("The audibly muted space became a vessel"). It establishes atmosphere and subtly enables the tactile method by swallowing echoes, but does not visibly constrain a choice or impose a tradeoff. Present in setup and payoff, weak middle development. 5.9: shapes tone and setting, contributes to ending charge, but causal role is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Enthrall" appears twice: Kael signs "you will enthrall the silence" and later "She was utterly enthralled, captivated by this language." The verb frames the peak beat (Elara's captivation by vibration) and contributes to closure by naming her transformation. However, the action is passively received—she is enthralled by what Kael creates—rather than driving the turn herself. 6.3: purposeful early–final reprise that reweights the stake, but not irreplaceable (captivate, mesmerize could substitute).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Backward recorded songs appear in the middle beat: Kael plays a lullaby reversed, watches the membrane quiver, and uses the vibrations to etch the drumhead. The method is signaled, its mechanics matter to the drum's construction, and it enables the tactile climax. However, it arrives after the first third and does not appear at closure. 4.8: functional, constrains the middle beat, but absent from setup and payoff; swappable with other vibration-capture methods.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Drum maker's cavern is anchored early (gravel path, stone walls, hanging hides, Kael's bench), supplies the "audibly muted" atmosphere that enables the tactile method, and recurs at closure ("In the mirrored hush of the cavern"). The space constrains external noise and subtly pressures Elara to focus inward. 6.7: essential to tone and method, present across beats and ending, though the specific cavern could be replaced with another quiet workshop.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Faint rustle of turning seasons" appears in the opening line and closing paragraph ("now felt like a whispered conversation against her skin"). It frames the narrative as occurring during autumn but does not tighten decisions or impose a deadline. Time within the scene is vague (single visit, untracked duration). 3.2: functional atmospheric bookend, lyric reprise, but does not constrain tactics or escalate pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Emotional numbness (the motivation to defeat it) is stated early, drives Elara to seek Kael, and her breakthrough at closure—numbness fracturing, aliveness replacing void—demonstrates the stake's resolution. The desire is dramatized through her tears and bodily response to vibration. However, the motivation is more told than conflicted: no competing want (e.g., fear of vulnerability, reluctance to let go of grief) creates friction. 6.4: shapes the arc and closure, but lacks on-page friction between desire and cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Mirrored hush" appears mid-story ("In the mirrored hush of the cavern, her internal silence reflected back") and the tone—quiet, reverent, tactile—is coherent throughout. The prose modulates subtly: crisp and observational early, layered and sensory during the drum sequence, reflective at closure. The "hush" charges the final image by reweighting silence as presence. 6.6: tone is stable and purposeful, modulates with pressure, and contributes to ending resonance, though the phrase itself is somewhat ornamental.</comment>
