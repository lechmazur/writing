<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation—shame over emotionally shallow portraits—is clearly rooted and drives his descent. The physical action of untangling threads works as embodied choice under pressure. However, interiority leans heavily on diagnostic abstraction: "luminescent ache," "crestfallen thread," "self-compassion" read as label-speak rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The moment "he found his own crestfallen thread—a tight knot of shame—and gently teased apart its strands: fear, love for his craft, stifled hope" feels like therapeutic checklist rather than lived contradiction, costing credibility in the pivotal cellar beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Decisive Change: Kael untangles threads, the web stabilizes, walls firm, and he gains purpose to paint again—visible before/after with felt cost (acknowledging shame, embracing necessary darkness). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural with causal backbone: fractured reality → descent → redesign → restoration. Orientation anchors early (lighthouse library, twilight). One meaningful tightening occurs when walls press and threads pull him down. Minor cost-proof concern: the "luminescent ache of purpose" at closure feels asserted more than shown, but the physical restoration (walls firm, box whole) makes the change legible enough.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The library and cellar are vividly anchored: "salt-crusted glass," "slick stone steps," "glowing threads filled the cellar." The tarot box and threads function as micro-setting, constraining Kael's choice to descend and shaping the redesign action directly. Sensory detail is dense but occasionally ornamental ("weak diamonds," "liquid starlight") rather than filtered through urgency. The lighthouse setting pressures the choice (walls closing) and charges the final image (beam sweeps, box glows), meeting the 9+ gate for environment constraining choice and charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore reality's weave and his artistic purpose—is signaled early and tightens when walls press inward. One meaningful turn: Kael's decision to descend and untangle threads, driven by his own agency, narrows options and forecloses avoidance. The escalation is visible: fracture → pressure → descent → redesign → restoration. Cost is legible in the act of "acknowledging each" strand of shame and "embracing necessary darkness," though the resolution feels somewhat smooth. The rhetorical questions serve as a focusing device but occasionally substitute for direct pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme—art must honor darkness to carry luminescent ache—emerges from Kael's journey and the thread-work metaphor. However, the final insight is overtly stated: "the most truthful art descends willingly into necessary darkness to carry luminescent ache back into the light." This explicit articulation in the closing paragraph is a Thematic Echo that replaces scene pressure with prompt-like language, triggering the −0.6 penalty. The thread motif works (threads = emotional knots = artistic practice), but recurrence leans ornamental in places rather than constraining choice until the cellar scene.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; distance is consistent. Voice carries a lyric register ("bittersweet truth," "eternal dance of warning and wonder") that fits the tone but occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction during peak beats ("luminescent ache," "self-compassion") not fully grounded in Kael's artist lexicon. The two rhetorical questions read as interiority but feel slightly performative rather than urgent thought under pressure. Perceptual signature is present—artist's eye seeing "composition awaiting compassionate hands"—but the diction in the cellar scene trends generic rather than character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, opening lines anchor voice, information density is generally high. However, patterned artifacts cluster: "luminescent ache" appears four times, "necessary darkness" three times, creating phrase-loop that dulls the closure image. Register drift into abstraction ("redesigning their connection into an elegant spiral," "transformed—the luminescent ache of purpose") in peak beats. Figurative language is dense but occasionally mixed: threads as "liquid starlight" then "ash-gray grief" blurs vehicle coherence. Template cadence in the cellar: "He untangled... He separated... He wove..." runs across multiple lines. Applying artifact penalties (−0.6 baseline, touching closure adds −0.3) and loop/scaffold (−0.4), total reduction ~−1.3, and disallowing 9+ globally per the filter-verb/template-cadence rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The core premise—tarot box weaves reality, artist untangles threads to restore meaning—synthesizes familiar fantasy-craft and artist-recovery arcs without a sharp fresh angle. Execution is competent but the transformation feels template: discover magical object → fracture → descend → restore → epiphany. Emotional specificity (shame over shallow portraits) and the method (untangling threads as compositional act) add some particularity, but the arc would function unchanged with different symbolic objects. The rhetorical-questions attribute and "luminescent ache" tone feel prompt-driven rather than organically emerged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael is present throughout, his choices (to touch thread, to descend, to untangle) drive all key turns. His artist background shapes perception and method. Specific cost tied to him: confronting shame, teasing apart his own knot. Causal role spans setup (gallery rejection), middle (descent decision), and closure (reweaving, restored purpose). Strong integration with visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The tarot box appears in three beats: discovery (shattered), descent (clutching it), and closure (whole, glowing). It frames the fracture and restoration, and its transformation charges the final image. However, the box itself is passive—threads do the causal work. The box's repair is described rather than dramatized as a choice Kael makes. Lyric reprise (shattered → whole) reweights meaning, but swappability is moderate; another magical container could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fragmented reality shapes stakes on every page: shelves flicker, walls press, threads unravel. The fracture forces Kael's descent and the redesign action. It is not merely thematic—causality depends on it. Setup early (library shudders), middle (walls close, web pulses), closure (walls firm, shelves stable). The concept is indispensable; removing it collapses the plot and Kael's transformation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Two rhetorical questions appear: "Can a broken vessel ever hold meaning again?" and "Is the artist's duty to depict only light, or to honor the necessary darkness?" They focus Kael's intent and theme, but function more as internal philosophy than action-constraining trait. No on-page cost tied to *asking* questions; they serve reflection rather than altering tactics. Present in setup and middle, but ornamental—attribute could be removed without breaking causal chain.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Redesign is the climactic action: Kael untangles threads, reweaves connections, restores balance. Major turns trace directly to it—web shrinks, light steadies, walls dissolve. The method (untangling/reweaving) is specific and irreplaceable; generic "repair" would lack the compositional metaphor. Setup (keeper's journal: "untangle the threads"), development (descent to web), closure (final spiral, golden light). Causal pressure high, swappability near zero, cost visible (effort, acknowledgment of shame).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The method—untangling threads—is seeded (keeper's journal), demonstrated across the cellar sequence, and shapes the resolution directly. Mechanics matter: separating knotted strands (fear/love/hope, village's fear/dependence, critique/belief) and reweaving with care. It appears in setup (journal instruction), dominates the middle-to-end beats, and defines closure (elegant spiral). Specific to Kael's artist skill, not easily swapped. Strong causal role and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The lighthouse library and root cellar provide distinct pressure: isolation amplifies despair, walls press inward (timeframe overlap), and the cellar houses the fracture source. The setting supplies the tarot box resource and forces the descent. Spatial choreography is clear (library → hidden door → slick steps → vast web). Setup early, middle (walls close), closure (library restored, beam sweeps box). Environment alters tactics and charges the final image, though the postcard-gothic description occasionally trends ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "when the walls close in" is literalized: walls groan, lean inward, press cold against Kael's shoulders as twilight bleeds away. It triggers urgency and the descent decision. Setup (twilight, walls groan), middle (air grows thin, pressure mounts), closure (walls' pressure dissolves). However, the clock is metaphorical rather than a live countdown that visibly alters moves beat-by-beat. The phrase appears twice, reweighting physicality but not fully tracking elapsed time or racing a limit.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Kael's motivation—to descend into necessary darkness—is dramatized: he finds the iron door, descends into blackness, kneels before the web, and confronts his shame thread. The desire is conflicted (seeks numbness but chooses painful truth) and friction is visible (fear vs. purpose). Setup (fleeing despair), development (decision crystallizes: "descend into the necessary darkness below"), closure (embracing darkness to see light's meaning). Specific cost: acknowledging shame, stifled hope. Strong causal and thematic role.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Tone—luminescent ache—is signaled early (gallery's verdict, threads' "sorrowful luminescence") and recurs throughout. It modulates: despair → resonance → purpose. The phrase "luminescent ache" appears four times, charging setup, middle web, and closure ("luminescent ache of purpose"). However, overuse trends toward ornamental label rather than embodied texture. Tone is coherent and charges the final image, but the phrase-loop and abstraction prevent full integration. Lyric reprise reweights meaning, eligible mid-6s under the lyric allowance.</comment>
