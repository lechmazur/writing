<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and his vow to give rest a permanent address drives the arc. However, the "inadvertently stubborn" trait is labeled rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses—he simply acts on instinct with no visible internal tension. Embodiment is present ("fingers tightened," "breath caught") but leans toward stock gestures. The final transformation from weariness to triumph is asserted more than earned through a visible cost that forecloses a prior path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds pressure through density and pattern (shard placement) culminating in a final radiance that reweights the library's silence into earned peace. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Elias achieves his vow with the cost legible in decades spent and the fragile equilibrium now stabilized. Orientation anchors (underwater library, bioluminescent fungi, Elias) arrive early. One weakness: the mechanical crab delivery and the lens's arrival feel convenience-plotted rather than causally seeded, but the ending transformation holds under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The underwater library is vividly rendered (coral-crusted shelves, bioluminescent fungi, obsidian door) and constrains Elias's work—he uses whalebone tweezers and navigates water-damaged texts. The shards' impossible occupation of paper dimensions supplies a tool-as-micro-setting that charges the final image when the mosaic beacon glows. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elias's professional focus. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the tide cycle.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—giving rest to forgotten souls—is signaled early and tightens when the broken lens's distress signal reframes the library's purpose. The arc moves from passive preservation to active revitalization, with each shard placement narrowing the path back to mere cataloging. Cost is present but muted: decades of weariness are mentioned, but no specific forfeiture or trade-off emerges on the page during the lens work itself. The escalation reads as accumulative deepening rather than a confrontation with rising obstacles, fitting the inferred lens but lacking a sharp pressure point.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: brokenness repurposed into guidance, distress answered by testimony, forgetting countered by story. The final image—glass fractures mapping paths to rest—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates through the lens's transformation and the library's shift from mausoleum to living archive. One slip: "the fear of being forgotten" is named too directly in the penultimate paragraph, edging toward thematic echo, though the image work surrounding it recovers the resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and a meditative, slightly elevated register that fits Elias's decades-long vigil. Perceptual signature is present (he notices water-stained entries, fiber, memory dimensions). However, diction occasionally drifts into prompt-like phrasing ("chased stillness," "occupy impossible spaces," "revitalize") that reads more as imposed vocabulary than Elias's natural interior lexicon. No dialogue appears. The prose modulates appropriately from weariness to quiet triumph, but the voice lacks a truly distinct syntactic or imagistic fingerprint.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance image, action, or interiority. However, several scaffold patterns recur: "His [noun] was [abstract concept]" appears three times in the opening, and synonym loops ("rest a permanent address" / "rest its permanent address") create mild redundancy. The phrase "occupy impossible spaces" and "revitalize" feel like undigested prompt tokens. Figurative language is dense but coherent (fractures as captured stars, sediment metaphor). Clarity remains intact, but the cumulative line-level artifacts and template cadence in the opening lower the score and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—underwater librarian, broken lens as beacon—offers a fresh synthesis of elegiac SF and archival duty. The method of embedding glass in textual voids is imaginative and specific to this world. However, the core emotional arc (solitary caretaker finds purpose through a mysterious arrival) follows a familiar template, and the lens conveniently solves the exact problem Elias has been facing without prior resistance or complication. Risk is present in the lyric mode and the accumulative structure, but the tidy resolution and the lack of genuine obstruction keep the piece from higher originality bands.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his decision to embed the shards rather than log the lens as salvage is the story's inciting choice. His methodical work across the tide cycle and final step-back constitute on-page agency. However, the "weary undertaker" framing is more metaphorical than literal—he's a librarian/archivist—and his choices feel preordained rather than tested by conflicting options. Setup, development (shard placement), and payoff (final triumph) are all present, earning mid-band, but swappability and lack of visible cost during the work lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The broken lighthouse lens is introduced early (mysterious package), handled in multiple beats (examination, fragment placement, final mosaic), and its shattered state becomes the engine of the plot—fractures enable the embedding method. The lens's meaning evolves from distress signal to guide for lost memories to beacon of rest, charging the closure image. Irreplaceability is high; no other object could provide both the distress-signal concept and the physical shards. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff with clear causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distress signals are seeded early (lens purpose, etched fractures), shape Elias's interpretation and method (answering the cry), and reappear at closure when signals become "affirmations of existence." The concept alters tactics—he transforms each shard into testimony—and reweights the ending by resolving the "deepest distress signal of all." Present in setup, middle (guiding shard use), and payoff. The concept is enacted rather than merely thematic, but its mechanical application (place shard, text reforms) feels more procedural than high-stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Inadvertently stubborn" is mentioned once ("surfaced immediately") when Elias refuses to log the lens as salvage, but the trait is asserted rather than shown through conflicting impulses or visible cost. No evidence that this stubbornness constrains later choices or creates friction. The decision reads as singular instinct rather than a recurring character pattern. Setup is present, but development and payoff are absent. Late first use and label-only treatment cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Revitalize" is named explicitly ("revitalize the lens's purpose") and enacted through every beat: embedding shards, reforming text, restoring voices, creating the beacon. The action is irreplaceable—no synonym like "repair" fits the transformation logic. It drives setup (decision), development (shard work), and payoff (library glows, stories at home). The method's specificity and the thematic doubling (revitalizing text and souls) charge the closure. Minor deduction: the word "revitalize" itself feels prompt-derived rather than organic, slightly lowering irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Occupying impossible spaces" is introduced early as the method, specified concretely (shards in text gutters, dimensions between fiber and memory), and executed across multiple beats. The method enables the plot and is unique to this story's logic. However, the mechanics are asserted rather than constrained—no failure or difficulty tests the method's limits. Setup, development, and payoff are all present, but the lack of visible cost or obstacle tied specifically to the method keeps it from higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The forgotten underwater city library is anchored early with vivid, functional detail (coral shelves, obsidian door, bioluminescent glow) and supplies the archive that needs revitalizing. The setting constrains Elias's tools (whalebone tweezers, water-damaged texts) and the final mosaic transforms the space itself into a beacon. Setup, development (spatial work across shelves), and payoff (library glows) are all present. The setting is intrinsic to stakes and closure, though the underwater element is more atmospheric than mechanically decisive.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The timeframe begins clearly ("when the mysterious package arrived") and marks one development beat ("through the tide cycle"). However, the tide cycle is mentioned once and does not visibly tighten decisions or alter tactics. The frame bookends the piece (before package / after completion) but does not create urgency or pressure escalation. Setup and payoff are present; middle development is weak. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to give rest a permanent address" is introduced as a vow in the opening and drives every choice: cataloging, shard placement, and the final beacon. It is tested when the package offers a new method and fulfilled at closure when "he had finally given rest its permanent address." The desire is dramatized through action rather than merely told. Setup, development (every shard is an enactment), and payoff are all present with clear causal linkage and thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Chased stillness" is named twice (opening and penultimate paragraph), framing the arc from fragile equilibrium to earned peace. The tone modulates: the opening's threatened quiet, the package's disruption, the working hum of restored voices, and the final cherished stillness. The shift charges the ending image and reflects Elias's internal arc. However, the phrase itself feels externally imposed rather than emerging from scene texture, and the tonal progression is more asserted than accumulated through line-level rhythm changes.</comment>
