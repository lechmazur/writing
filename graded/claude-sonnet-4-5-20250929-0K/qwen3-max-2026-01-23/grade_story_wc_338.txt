<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's perceptual skills are well-established through concrete action (tracing ghost rivers, comparing footage frame-by-frame), and her "shielded openness" generates subtle internal tension. Her motivation—connection over conquest—shapes the discovery arc consistently. However, the final moment lacks visible cost or internal contradiction; she experiences kinship and approval rather than foreclosing a path or paying a price, which keeps this from reaching higher bands despite strong trait specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece coheres through density increase—layered sensory detail, historical accumulation, comparative evidence—culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when Elara grasps the henge-vault partnership and resolves to "pass the whisper forward." Orientation is clear early (who, where, when by ~100 words). Cost is conceptual and felt ("weight of understanding," stewardship over ownership) but remains somewhat abstract; pointing to a specific sentence where tactical options narrow or a social price is paid proves difficult, which prevents entry into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The rain-scoured vault is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (wet limestone, dripping water, dim glow) and constrains Elara's work by providing the eastern fresco that completes her alignment discovery. The henge, though off-page in present action, returns through video and shadow geometry to charge the closure image. Spatial choreography (table, window, fresco wall) remains clear and the environment directly enables the final interpretive leap, meeting the 9+ gate criterion of constraint shaping the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—interpreting the map's tear and the silence it represents—is signaled early and coheres throughout. The piece offers one meaningful deepening: frame-by-frame comparison reveals shadow divergence, which reweights the vault-henge relationship. Agency is attention and interpretation rather than overt decision; Elara's choice to publish "quietly" and frame discovery as stewardship carries conceptual cost but no visible tradeoff or foreclosed path on the page. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds through discovery density, but the lack of a live constraint or price that alters tactics keeps this in the mid-7s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—listening to silence, stewardship over conquest, honoring builder intention—emerges from concrete action (comparing footage, overlaying trajectories) and the recurring motif of the map's tear as "honest boundary." The final image of leaving the space unchanged and carrying "only the weight of understanding" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stated moral. However, phrases like "to interpret silence with empathy" and "frame mystery with respect" trend toward thematic echo, and the ending, while coherent, leans slightly toward summary rather than pure scene pressure. Strong thematic integration with minor summary intrusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature (tracing ghost rivers, reading erosion as language) and diction that reflects Elara's scholarly yet reverent stance. Psychic distance is controlled and purposeful. The prose modulates effectively under discovery pressure, and no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks appear. However, elevated register ("profound kinship across centuries," "whispered prayers echoing not in sound, but in enduring alignment") occasionally drifts from immediate perception into essayistic summary, especially in reflective passages. The voice remains coherent but does not fully compress under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with many sentences doing double duty (description + world-building). However, overwriting appears in multiple high-pressure beats: "a silence that felt less like absence and more like invitation," "the language of dripping water and shifting light," and stacked metaphors ("watercolor memories," "sentence in a language of erosion") without pattern-teaching or payoff. Register drift into elevated diction ("profound kinship," "calibrated observatory where earth and sky conversed") clashes with the POV's scholarly but grounded lexicon. Apply −0.6 for density and register drift in peak beats, preventing entry into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise—comparative silent video analysis to decode ancient alignment—is specific and fresh, avoiding template plots. The integration of surveyor's map, henge shadow geometry, and vault fresco into a single interpretive system feels earned and particular to this character and setting. The emotional arc (careful discovery, reverent stewardship) coheres with the conceptual frame. However, the core conflict—solving a historical puzzle—lacks moral calculus or personal risk, and the ending resolves into scholarly fulfillment without bold choice or visible tradeoff. Strong synthesis with modest transformation, no proximity to famous material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's perceptual skills (tracing ghost rivers, reading erosion) and methodical nature shape her approach throughout. Her choices—restoring footage, overlaying trajectories, deciding to publish quietly—are on-page and causally linked. However, the final "decision" to frame discovery as stewardship is more stance crystallization than a choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Present in setup, middle, and ending with two distinct beats (restoration, overlay analysis), but lacks the cost-tied decision that would push this into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The henge appears in setup (map tear at its coordinates), drives the middle analysis (shadow geometry from 1954/1989 footage), and charges the closure (vault-henge partnership revelation). Handled across three distinct beats with evolving function: catalyst, evidence source, and interpretive key. The henge's shadow divergence enables the final alignment discovery, meeting causal pressure and closure linkage criteria. Strong integration with irreplaceability; removing it would collapse the logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The whispered chapel frames the entire narrative space, shaping stakes (interpreting silence) and tactics (frame-by-frame comparison in reverent quiet). Present in setup (opening description), middle (working space), and closure (approval "in the language of dripping water"). The chapel's acoustic and spatial properties constrain Elara's interpretive method and charge the final image of leaving it unchanged. Indispensable to closure and logic; meets all three gates with strong causal pressure and cost connection (stewardship, not ownership).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Methodically curious" is demonstrated on-page (months of restoration, frame-by-frame notation) and shapes her approach to the discovery. However, it does not constrain a choice with visible cost; it enables her success without friction or tradeoff. Present in setup (trait description) and middle (restoration work), but absent from the closure beat as a live pressure. Functional use across two beats but replaceable with "meticulous" or "patient" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Reopen" is the story's central action: mending the tear in understanding by comparing footage and overlaying trajectories. Signaled early (map tear as "sealed dialogue"), drives the middle discovery (shadow divergence), and resolves in closure (publishing findings as invitation). Present across all three gates with causal pressure. However, the action's final form—publishing quietly—lacks a specific cost or tactical constraint that would make it indispensable to the exact closure image. Strong integration with moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The video comparison method is signaled in setup ("comparing silent video footage"), executed in the middle climax (frame-by-frame playback revealing shadow divergence at 4:18 PM), and its result shapes closure (vault-henge partnership). The method's specificity—1954 vs. 1989, identical solar moment, geological settling documented in field notes—is irreplaceable; no other means would yield this discovery. Present in all three gates with high causal pressure, closure linkage, and cost connection (months of restoration). Indispensable to logic and ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The vault supplies the working space, the eastern fresco (Orion's belt) that completes the alignment discovery, and the reverent atmosphere that charges the closure image. Present in setup (opening description), middle (fresco overlay), and closure (leaving unchanged, rain tracing new paths). The vault's physical features—curved walls, fresco chart, single window—constrain and enable Elara's interpretive leap. Removing the vault would break the logic and eliminate the closure's spatial anchor. Meets all three gates with indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "at the spot where a map tears" anchors the investigation's conceptual location but does not function as a live temporal constraint. The 1954/1989 comparison provides historical span, and "4:18 PM" offers specificity, but no clock pressures Elara's present-day work. Time does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page. Present in setup and middle as context, absent from closure as pressure. Functional but replaceable with "during the solstice window" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—interpreting silence with empathy—is dramatized through concrete choices (frame-by-frame attention, overlaying trajectories, framing discovery as stewardship rather than ownership). Stated early, it shapes middle tactics (patient restoration) and closure (publishing as invitation, carrying only understanding). Friction arises between scholarly rigor and heartfelt resonance ("shielded openness"), though the cost remains conceptual. Present in all three gates with causal pressure and closure participation, but the lack of a visible tradeoff or foreclosed path keeps this below the 8.5 threshold.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Shielded openness"—careful balance of rigor and resonance—is maintained consistently through the narrative voice and modulates subtly as discovery deepens (soft breath, profound kinship). The tone charges the final image of reverent departure and passing the whisper forward. However, the tone remains largely static; no sharp pressure shift or tonal break marks the discovery climax. Present across setup, middle, and ending with coherence, but lacks the intensification or cadence shift that would push this into higher bands. Solid integration without indispensability.</comment>
