<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's pacifist stance and daily knife ritual establish clear motivation, but internal contradiction never complicates a single on-page choice—she never wavers, doubts, or pays visible cost for her convictions within this scene. The "senselessly perceptive" trait remains label-only; detecting silver hue or hearing a petal unfurl doesn't constrain or enable a consequential action. Embodied emotion is present (cool glass, rough sandbag scrap) but the interiority leans toward poetic summary rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece patterns rising meditative density through recurrent motifs (knife/sheathe, sandbag scrap, engraved quiet, tranquil blaze) and converges on a final image of continuity weaving. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final touch and tomorrow's vow crystallize her stance with felt resolve, though the cost remains oblique—no live option is visibly foreclosed on the page, only her father's legacy symbolically buried again. Orientation is clean by ~46 words. The accumulative pattern holds, but the ending reweights existing material more than it narrows options or changes knowledge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The glass dome and desert roses provide vivid, selective anchors (teardrop shape, crystalline blooms, cool glass, molten sunset glow). The sandbag scrap becomes micro-setting, handled twice to tie stems and charge the final image with repurposed-violence metaphor. Sensory detail (silver hue, petal chime, rough patch on tunic) is filtered through Elara's perceptual priorities. The dome's physical enclosure and the contrast with howling desert winds outside subtly guide her sanctuary logic and charge the closure image of stillness versus chaos.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—transforming violence into sanctuary—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening occurs: the knife ritual (draw, feel history, sheathe with vow) performed each dawn, which the text presents as a daily foreclosure of violence. However, that ritual is recounted rather than dramatized with live temptation or counterpressure in this scene; no reversal or on-page tightening forces a trade-off or narrows options within the window. The piece accumulates texture but lacks an event that tests commitment with visible cost scaled to the present moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—continuity through chaos, nonviolence anchoring sanctuary—emerges from image and ritual rather than statement. The sandbag scrap and knife serve as concrete motifs that shift meaning (weapon remnant becomes stem support; blade's cold history is daily refused). The final image of saved stem and tomorrow's vow offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. However, the thematic question is stated rather than left ambiguous ("weave continuity through chaos" appears verbatim three times), reducing the reader's inferential work and flattening resonance at the edges.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with clean focalization on Elara. Perceptual signature is present (noticing silver hue, petal chime) but remains generic rather than idiosyncratically biased. Diction is controlled and purposeful, though elevated lyricism ("tranquil blaze," "engraved quiet") repeats without evolving meaning. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance is consistent. Minor register drift: "senselessly perceptive" and "profound engraved quiet" edge toward abstract rather than the focalizer's lived lexicon under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Template-cadence runs in the final third: six consecutive paragraphs open with "She" or "Elara" or "The [noun]," flattening rhythm during the closure approach. Paraphrase loops recur: "weave continuity through chaos" appears identically three times (lines 58, 240, 252); "tranquil blaze" four times without evolving connotation; "engraved quiet" twice. Information density is moderate—many lines do double duty with motif and action—but figurative language crowds most sentences in the final third without pattern-taught payoff, dulling propulsion. Proofreading is clean; no grammar or continuity breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The glass-dome sanctuary and pacifist-daughter premise echo familiar post-apocalyptic pastoral templates without a transformative angle. The knife-sheathing ritual and repurposed sandbag scrap offer specific local texture, but the emotional arc—daughter renounces father's violence, chooses gentler path—follows a well-worn trajectory with median execution. "Tranquil blaze" as oxymoron and "engraved quiet" as concept feel coined rather than earned from lived particulars. No bold risk-taking or non-obvious synthesis evident; removing names and resetting would leave the arc intact.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and named early. Her choices—daily knife ritual, tying stems with sandbag scrap, whispering to plants—are shown but none create a key turn or reversal within this scene window. The pacifist stance is static; no on-page friction tests it. She observes, remembers, and reaffirms rather than deciding under pressure. Functional setup and thematic closure presence, but no middle beat where her agency narrows options or alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The airship ballast sandbag scrap is introduced at ~114 words, handled at the wreck site (line 126) and again in the present to tie a stem (line 186, 240, 340). It reweights at closure as a tangible metaphor for repurposing violence. Two distinct beats plus closure presence. However, its mechanics are static—always a fabric scrap for tying—and swappable with any relic cloth without altering story logic. No visible cost tied specifically to this object's use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Engraved quiet" appears twice (lines 102, 196, 274) as atmospheric descriptor and is felt at closure. However, it never constrains a choice or alters tactics—it remains a mood label without causal pressure. The concept is ornamental, echoing theme rather than shaping stakes. Present in setup and closure but absent from middle development; no cost connected to it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Senselessly perceptive" is named at line 84 and again at 206. The trait enables noticing silver hue and hearing a petal chime, but neither observation forces a consequential action or tradeoff. It's a label without on-page cost or friction. Functional mention, closure cameo (smile at petal chime), but no middle beat where perception constrains or enables a high-stakes choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Sheathe" anchors the daily ritual (lines 152, 164, 174, 296) and frames the closure vow for tomorrow (line 354). The action shapes her nonviolence commitment across beats and charges the final image with recurring symbolic weight. It defines her core choice—burying violence—and the ritual is irreplaceable (drawing/sheathing the father's blade specifically). No major plot turn hinges on it within this window, but it drives thematic closure with visible ritual cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Inculcating plants with values" is signaled at line 72 and dramatized at line 186 when she whispers to a stem. The method is shown in use, not merely asserted. However, it appears in only two beats without visible consequence—the plants don't respond or fail in ways that alter her tactics. Present in setup and middle, minimal closure participation beyond thematic echo. Functional but replaceable with generic gardening without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The desert rose farm in glass dome is anchored early (line 1, "glass dome rose from endless sands"; line 32, "inside this fragile sanctuary"). The enclosure pressures choices: it shelters against desert chaos, supplies the roses central to her work, and the cool glass she touches at closure (line 274) charges the final image. The setting recurs across setup, middle beats (tending stems inside), and closure (palm on glass, dwelling within). It's essential to the sanctuary logic and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After the tower falls" is established at line 140 (tower's fall, father's airship crash). The timeframe provides backstory context and anchors her current work as post-catastrophe recovery. However, elapsed time within the present scene is not tracked, and no urgency or deadline tightens decisions. The past event enables present motivation but doesn't constrain tactics on the page. Setup and thematic closure presence, but no middle pressure from time itself.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Weave continuity through chaos" is named at line 58 and repeated verbatim at 240, 252. The desire drives her gardening work, ritual choices, and the closure vow. It's dramatized in the knife ritual and stem-tying actions. However, the motivation is never conflicted—no friction between wanting continuity and other costs on the page. Present across all three gates but lacks visible tradeoff or friction that tests the desire under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" is introduced at line 218, repeated at 230, 274, and anchors the closure reflection (line 328, "keeper of the tranquil blaze"). The tone—calm surface masking fierce purpose—coheres across the meditative beats and charges the final stance. However, it appears late (past 60% mark), and the tone remains static rather than modulating with scene pressure. Purposeful reprise at closure lifts it into lyric-resonance range, but late introduction and ornamental middle use cap it mid-band.</comment>
