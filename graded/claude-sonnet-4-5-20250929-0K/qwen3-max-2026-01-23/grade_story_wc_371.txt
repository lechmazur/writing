<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and character-particular ("quiet compass," soil-work as method), and her choices show agency (kneeling, planting, receiving the bread). However, the emotional arc is somewhat smooth—the tear at line 169 and the subsequent absolution feel preordained rather than contradictory or costly in the moment. The piece avoids therapy-speak, but the final progression from loss to resilience reads more like a staged emotional checklist than a lived struggle with messy irrationality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the palace courtyard intro. The closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (tenuous absolution via the planted seeds and shared bread), with felt cost embedded in the phrase "tenuous as clover shoots" and the transformation of the pocket crust from relic to compass. One meaningful deepening occurs when Madame Lin reveals the bread, reweighting memory and possibility. Cost is visible but somewhat diffuse—the absolution remains abstract rather than forecloses a concrete path with sharp on-page price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The overgrown palace courtyard is vividly rendered (marble statues, wild clematis, dry fountain with sparrows) and constrains Elara's action—she must uncloak ivy to reach soil. The body-as-micro-setting (kneeling, fingers in earth) charges the planting ritual. Spatial choreography is clear across the courtyard and tea-house interior, and the mossy bench serves as a functional stage for the bread's revelation. The setting directly shapes the guerrilla-gardening method and the final image of green defiance behind the ivy curtain.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: finding sacred absolution in ordinary acts of care. One meaningful deepening occurs when Madame Lin presents the bread, transforming memory into present communion and narrowing Elara's path from passive grief to active resilience. However, the escalation feels more like a cumulative layering than a tightening with trade-offs—no live option is foreclosed on-page, and the cost remains largely internal and anticipated (future seasons) rather than immediate. The piece coheres under Accumulative logic but lacks sharp on-page pressure that forces a sacrificial choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the ritual of planting and the shared bread: the sacred lives in tending the overlooked, and absolution is a living, tenuous thing rooted in care. The final image ("absolution blooms where care is planted") avoids overt moralizing by anchoring in the concrete seeds and straw-covered patch. Subtext operates in Madame Lin's silent welcome and the cloth-wrapped loaf as both memory and promise. The bread's shift from relic to compass offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without stating a thesis, though the language occasionally edges toward thematic echo ("the sacred unveiled itself").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; psychic distance is controlled. Voice is consistent and lyric, with purposeful compression ("creeping normality noticer," "heuristically gentle precision"). However, perceptual signature is only moderately distinct—Elara's noticing could belong to any contemplative observer. Madame Lin's brief dialogue carries subtext and goal (offering comfort, honoring ritual), but the two characters' internal textures are not sharply differentiated. Under peak emotional moments (tear falling, bread breaking), diction remains elevated and somewhat uniform rather than degrading or sharpening with stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled and sentences vary in structure. Information density is solid—most lines advance image, ritual, or emotional charge. However, minor paraphrase loops appear: lines 148 and 261 echo "tenuous absolution" without meaningful reweighting between them; lines 223 and 235 both affirm the transformation of the crust. Figurative language is purposeful but occasionally stacks ("steam like a blessing," "baptism of sorrow and hope") in adjacent beats without clear pattern-teaching. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence runs, but the lyricism occasionally prioritizes cadence over propulsion, slightly dulling momentum in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The combination of guerrilla gardening, lost bakery, and tea-house sanctuary offers a specific synthesis, and "creeping normality noticer" is a fresh characterization frame. However, the emotional arc (loss → ritual → absolution) follows a familiar template, and the resolution feels preordained rather than inevitable-in-hindsight. The bread's resurrection via Madame Lin is a warm turn but lacks the non-obvious inflection that would lift the piece into higher originality bands. Specificity in detail (crimson clover, lemon balm, forget-me-not) enriches texture without transforming the underlying emotional or thematic territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara as "creeping normality noticer" frames her perception throughout (vanishing bakery, dimming streetlamps, ivy-cloaked soil). The trait shapes her motivation and method but does not constrain a pivotal on-page choice—her decision to plant is consistent with her established observational gentleness rather than a turn forced by the noticing itself. Present in setup, development (uncloaking ivy), and closure (witnessing green defiance), but causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The bread crust appears in three beats: pocket anchor (line 80), tear-baptism reflection (line 161), and transformation to compass (line 235). Madame Lin's warm loaf at line 194 echoes and reweights the original crust, making the pocket relic's shift legible. The bread enables the communion beat and charges the final absolution image. Strong closure linkage and specificity; the object is irreplaceable within the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Tenuous absolution" is named early (line 70) and recurs at lines 148, 223, and 261, shaping Elara's dominant stake and the ending's emotional charge. However, it functions more as thematic frame than on-page constraint—no scene choice hinges on the tenuousness versus certainty of absolution. The concept is felt in the ritual and shared bread but does not narrow options or impose visible cost that alters tactics. Moderate causal pressure; closure participation via the final image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Heuristically gentle" is named at line 108 and dramatized in Elara's planting method ("never forcing, always adapting"). The trait enables her guerrilla gardening but does not constrain a choice with visible cost—no moment where harshness would solve a problem faster but she refuses. Present in setup and development; absent from closure image. Functional but replaceable with "careful" or "intuitive" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Uncloak" appears at line 129 (uncloaking hidden soil) and line 252 (uncloaking as part of her work's meaning). The action drives the planting beat and is causally necessary for the seeds to be placed. However, it is one step in a larger ritual rather than a singular turn that redefines the story's options. Present in development and thematic closure; moderate causal necessity. Swappable with "reveal" or "peel back" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Guerrilla gardening" is named at line 108 and executed across lines 118–138 (kneeling, uncloaking, planting seeds). The method shapes Elara's tactic and differentiates her from passive mourning. It appears in the final image ("guerrilla gardening's quiet revolution," line 308) and charges the closure by framing future green defiance. Signaled early, drives one extended beat, and participates in closure. Moderate irreplaceability—another form of care work could serve similar thematic ends.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The secret tea house in the overgrown palace courtyard is introduced at line 45, anchors spatial action (eastern wall, mossy bench, inside/outside moves), and supplies both the ivy Elara must uncloak and the setting for Madame Lin's bread revelation. The courtyard's neglect motivates the planting and its future bloom frames the ending image. Present in setup, development (constrains planting location), and closure. Strong causal pressure and specificity; removing the palace courtyard would require fundamental rework.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the birds fly south and autumn's chill settled deep" (line 45) anchors the season and implies dormancy before spring. The timeframe motivates Elara's planting for future bloom ("after winter's sleep," line 280) but does not tighten on-page decisions—no urgency or deadline alters her tactics. Present in setup and thematic closure; no middle development constraint. The seasonal cycle enriches theme but is replaceable with any post-loss moment.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation "to find the sacred in the ordinary" is stated at line 70 and dramatized across the planting ritual, the steam-and-bread communion, and the final realization at line 252. The desire drives her choice to garden and accept Madame Lin's bread, and it shapes the thematic closure. Friction appears in the tension between loss (vanished bakery) and hope (planted seeds). Strong setup, development, and closure participation; causal pressure is solid though the motivation itself is not deeply conflicted on the page.</comment>
