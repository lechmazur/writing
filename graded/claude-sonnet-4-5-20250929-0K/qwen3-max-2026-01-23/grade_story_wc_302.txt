<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to find the library is declared but her interior remains abstract—"whispered legends and aching voids" reads generic. The apology she carries for twenty years appears only in summary late in the piece, denying the reader access to contradictory impulses in scene. The final choice to speak aloud feels asserted rather than earned by prior dramatized struggle; no visible cost forecloses a path on the page. Embodied emotion is scarce; tears and trembling hands are stock gestures that do not particularize her state under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who Elara is, where she stands, and what immediate stake she faces remain vague past the 120-word mark, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The dominant stake—to document ephemeral words—is signaled but never tested by a reversal that narrows options. The piece accumulates atmosphere without a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration; the final line "spoke her first word aloud, and the silence answered" asserts closure but no felt or visible cost lands on the page. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, yet no pattern break or cadence shift reweights the stake with cost. The two letters framing the timeframe are mentioned but do not constrain any on-page choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The glowing library is vividly anchored—crystalline spires, mist, shelves stretching into infinity—and sensory detail is selective. The confidence man's watch constrains Elara's documentation by serving as a metronome, meeting the 9+ quick test requirement that an object or tool constrains a choice. However, spatial choreography inside the library remains abstract; we do not see her move between shelves or handle volumes beyond the single blue-leather book, and the micro-setting does not visibly alter tactics at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—to document the library's ephemeral script—is signaled early but never tightens or deepens through a reversal. No on-page choice narrows options or forces a trade-off; Elara documents without friction, and the library "responds" passively to her apology. The resolution—speaking her first word aloud—is not earned by prior agency; the watch chimes and the library glows brighter, but no visible price is paid. Coincidence (the library's glow, the watch's synchronization) facilitates rather than complicates, violating the lens rule that coincidence may complicate but not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The theme of unspoken words and silence is declared rather than dramatized; the library "responds" and coalesces into "Speak, and the silence will answer," a direct thematic statement that replaces scene pressure. The apology Elara carries for twenty years is told in summary, denying the reader access to the concrete particulars that would charge the final image. The ending offers a stated moral ("no longer a burden; they were a bridge") instead of a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The confidence man's wink and the cyclically reversed watch are motifs mentioned but do not constrain choice or accumulate pressure toward closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The voice is consistent—elevated, lyrical—and the perceptual signature ("cautious exuberance," "gossamer veil," "breath-held pause") is character-specific. However, diction remains uniform under pressure; no syntactic or rhythmic modulation reflects urgency when Elara begins to write her apology. Filter verbs ("understood," "saw," "felt") cluster in high-stakes lines without voice motivation, dulling immediacy. The narrator's interiority reads as exposition ("the true motivation had always been deeper") rather than dramatized perception. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not scored.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Information density is low; adjacent sentences restate without added pressure: "She had come seeking the library, but the true motivation had always been deeper—to confront the silence within herself" is a paraphrase loop (−0.2). Template cadence runs appear: "The first letter… The second letter…" and "She documented it all, understanding the library processed…" echoes scaffold phrasing. Figurative language appears in most sentences without pattern-teaching: "veiled dreamer," "crystalline spires," "latent syllables," "symphony of human experience," "melody of regret and hope"—register drift into abstract elevation that clashes with the urgency of peak beats (−0.5). Stock metaphors ("bridge she was building," "silence answered with understanding") reduce specificity. Cumulative artifact penalty: −1.0 in Q7, plus the elevated diction in peak beats disallows 9+ globally per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core premise—a library of unspoken words where text shifts cyclically—is imaginative but resembles template quest-fantasy structures: protagonist seeks magical location, gains access via talismanic object, achieves emotional closure. The cyclically reversed watch and propagation delays are fresh details, yet they do not transform the arc; the story would function unchanged if the watch ran forward and the words appeared instantly. The emotional beat (speaking an apology carried for twenty years) is told rather than dramatized, reducing specificity. The final image ("the silence answered with understanding") is abstract and echoes the prompt's "unspoken words" label without a non-obvious synthesis. No bold structural risk heightens stakes; the piece follows a linear discover-document-resolve path.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her goal (to find the library) frames the opening, but her choices do not create key turns. She steps across the threshold, opens a volume, documents patterns, and writes an apology—actions that unfold sequentially without reversal or contested decision. The final choice to speak aloud is asserted rather than dramatized as a difficult turn with visible cost. The character is functional but swappable; another seeker could follow the same path with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The confidence man's watch appears in three beats: clutched in her palm at the opening, serving as a metronome during documentation, and chiming once near the end. Its cyclically reversed hands synchronize with the library's temporal rhythm, enabling Elara to anticipate shifts—this constrains her method and charges the closure image. However, the watch does not visibly alter a contested choice or pay off with reweighted meaning at the final line; it chimes "though its hands pointed to a time that had not yet passed," a lyric reprise without causal pressure. Scores in the 5.0–6.9 band for shaping one key turn (documentation) and appearing at closure, but lacks the cost connection required for ≥7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The unfolding cipher is present across beats: words appear on pages through propagation delays, rearrange themselves, and Elara documents the patterns. The concept shapes her immediate method—she must transcribe before text vanishes—and the library's "temporal rhythm" constrains her actions. At closure, the cipher coalesces into "Speak, and the silence will answer," a thematic statement that reweights the premise. However, the cipher does not force a contested choice or alter tactics under pressure; Elara documents without friction. Meets two gates (setup, closure participation) and shapes one key turn, scoring mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The cyclically reversed attribute is introduced early (the watch's hands move counterclockwise) and reappears when the library's glow pulses "in time with the watch's inverted tick." The trait enables Elara to synchronize with the library's shifts, a functional constraint. However, no visible cost or tradeoff arises from the reversal; it is described as a "lens, refracting time to reveal hidden layers," a thematic claim without on-page pressure. The attribute is present and functional but replaceable—a watch that ran forward could serve the same role with minor edits. Caps at 4.6 due to missing middle development (no contested choice tied to the reversal) and swappability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Document is the central action: Elara documents patterns in her journal, transcribes each transient permutation, and later documents a passage about lost love. The action frames multiple beats and culminates when she begins to write her own apology, a pivot toward closure. However, the documentation itself is frictionless; no major turn or reversal traces to the act of recording. The ending ("she spoke her first word aloud") shifts from documenting to speaking, suggesting the prior action was preparatory rather than decisive. Scores in the 5.0–6.9 band for shaping the middle and priming closure, but lacks the irreplaceability or cost connection required for ≥7.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Propagation delays are signaled early: "Words appeared on pages only through propagation delays, flickering into existence after a breath-held pause." The method shapes Elara's documentation—she must wait three heartbeats for text to bloom and vanish, then anticipate the next shift. It appears in the middle beat ("The library processed unspoken words through these propagation delays") and is implied at closure when the library's shelves glow and text coalesces. However, the method does not constrain a contested choice or alter tactics under pressure; Elara adapts without friction. Meets two gates (setup, development) and scores mid-band for functional use, but lacks causal pressure or closure linkage required for ≥7.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The glowing library in mist is vividly anchored from the opening line and provides the spatial frame for all action. The environment supplies resources (the books, the shelves) and its glow pulses in sync with the watch, enabling Elara's work. At closure, the library "responds" by glowing brighter and the mist stills, a lyric reprise that charges the final image. However, the setting does not pressure a contested choice or alter tactics; Elara moves through it without friction. Meets all three gates (setup, development, closure participation) and the lyric reprise reweights the stake, scoring in the 5.5–6.3 band per the Lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "between two fateful letters" is introduced mid-piece: the first letter guided Elara to the library, and the second will arrive at dawn with news. The frame is mentioned again near the end ("dawn tinged the perpetual mist with gold"), but the letters do not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page. No ticking clock forces choices; Elara documents at her own pace, and the second letter's arrival is anticipated but does not constrain her actions. The timeframe is ornamental, providing thematic weight (a "sacred pause") without causal pressure. Caps at 3.4 due to missing middle development and swappability.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the library of unspoken words" frames the opening ("Her lifelong motivation—to find the library of unspoken words—had driven her across continents") and recurs when Elara realizes "the true motivation had always been deeper—to confront the silence within herself." The desire shapes her goal and culminates when she writes her apology and speaks aloud. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized in contested choices; no friction between wants and costs appears on the page. The shift from external quest to internal confrontation is asserted, not earned through visible struggle. Meets all three gates and scores in the 5.0–6.9 band for shaping one key turn, but lacks the friction required for ≥7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Cautious exuberance is signaled early ("she poured her cautious exuberance into the work—the joy of discovery tempered by the weight of impending choice") and recurs when exuberance "crystalliz[es] into quiet resolve." The tone modulates from breathless anticipation at the opening to reverence and resolve at the close. However, the tone is declared rather than embodied in syntax or rhythm; sentences remain uniformly elevated and lyrical under pressure, without cadence shift. The final image ("the silence answered with understanding") is static, not charged by tonal modulation. Meets two gates (setup, closure participation) and scores mid-band for coherent presence, but lacks the rhythmic control required for ≥7.0.</comment>
