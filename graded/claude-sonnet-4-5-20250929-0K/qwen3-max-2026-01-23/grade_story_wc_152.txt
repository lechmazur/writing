<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is established early and her "disguises wisdom as foolishness" trait is visible in the placid smile / sharp intelligence contrast. Internal contradiction appears (dread vs. steady hands at line 180), though the patron-dismissal beat lacks embodied emotion—we're told she feels concern but don't see hesitation or physical tells. The ending renunciation (delivering truth via proxy rather than confrontation) forecloses the direct-action path with implied cost, meeting the Earned Stasis threshold, but the choice feels predetermined by trait rather than emerging from on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by line 50; the Drive Lens reads Causal (discovery of Vega misplacement → thread divination → corrected chart → delivery to captain). One meaningful tightening occurs when the thread reveals the conspiracy's full scope (lines 139–172), narrowing Elara's options from "raise alarm" to "silent correction." Closure lands as Charged Poise: she steps into the mist carrying truth toward justice, the cost felt in her solitary risk and the observatory's sigh of relief. The candle's final dip provides resonance. No causality breaks, though the midnight-to-dawn compression elides the captain-delivery beat, leaving closure one step before full consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory is anchored early with cerulean halls, wind-scoured ridge, and celestial machinery. Autumn leaves and mist frame entry and exit. The eternal candle and Elara's alcove provide micro-setting that constrains her method (proximity to flame required). Spatial choreography is clean through the halls-to-doors sequence. However, the "echoed silence" and "cobalt" recur as atmospheric labels without altering a key choice; the setting supports mood but does not force a tactical trade-off at closure, capping the 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prevent the coup-by-misdirection) is signaled by line 103 and sharpened at 148. One clear tightening: Valerius dismisses her, forcing the covert-correction path. The corrected chart and decision to bypass Valerius for Captain Idris constitute agency that forecloses direct confrontation. Cost is visible in her solitary risk and the "fragile hope" she carries. No secondary reversals, but the single escalation is motivated and the closure choice alters tactics under the inferred Causal lens. The pre-dawn timeframe imposes urgency without a ticking-clock scene, keeping pressure steady rather than ratcheting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of quiet wisdom vs. institutional blindness emerges through Elara's method and Valerius's dismissal. The final image—truth carried through mist, candle dipping in farewell, observatory sighing—offers non-literal resonance. Yet the ending also delivers a thematic summary ("wisdom disguised as foolishness… the sharpest tool in the arsenal of truth" at line 277) that tilts toward statement rather than purely dramatized answer. The starlight-finds-a-voice line (294) and cobalt-walls-holding-memory (308) add lyric charge but risk overstating the moral. Core question is answered, though with less ambiguity than the 9-band requires.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited focalization is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature shows Elara's star-chart embroiderer lens ("threads of starlight silver," "midnight velvet"). Psychic distance is consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated register unsuited to urgent action: "synchronizing breath, intent, and thread vibration" (line 131), "manufactured disaster" (172), "arsenal of truth" (277). These phrases read as authorial rather than character-particular. Sentence stems repeat ("She [verb]" at lines 188, 198, 214, 226, 252, 268) across the long night sequence, flattening rhythm under pressure. No dialogue to test voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is high; grammar and pronoun references are clean. Information density is good in the divination sequence (lines 123–148). Yet paraphrase loops appear: lines 72 and 81 both assert "disguises wisdom as foolishness"; lines 180 and 188 reiterate steady hands and night-long work. Template cadence runs: "She [verb]" stems across lines 188, 198, 214, 226, 252, 260, 268 create drumbeat monotony in the climactic final third. Stock metaphors ("embers" for leaves, "tapestry of lies") and elevated abstractions ("synchronizing the final thread—a filament of captured dawn light" at 198) layer figurative language densely without pattern-teaching, triggering overwriting penalties. Artifacts touch the closure sequence, disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The galaxy-chart embroiderer protagonist and thread-divination method offer specific angles. The eternal-candle object and "adjacent possibilities" mechanics are non-obvious. Yet the core plot—lone truth-teller uncovers palace conspiracy and delivers corrected intel to bypass corrupt official—closely matches the "hidden corruption / lone insider / eleventh-hour warning" template. Transformation is partial: the thread-weaving particulars personalize execution, but the emotional arc (humble guardian foils coup via quiet skill) does not challenge familiar beats. Proximity check: "echoed silence" appears seven times, risking self-echo rather than fresh recurrence. Risk-taking is modest; the story executes its premise cleanly but does not surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara is present by line 50, drives the discovery beat (103), performs the divination (123–148), stitches corrections (188–198), and makes the closure choice to deliver truth to Captain Idris (226–245). Her decision alters tactics (bypassing Valerius) with visible cost (solitary risk, "fragile hope" at 268). Three distinct beats: discovery, divination, delivery-choice. Causal pressure throughout. She is indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The eternal candle appears at line 62, is used in the divination beat (113–131: "holding a silver thread near the flame's heat," "shadows danced"), and returns at closure (294: "dipped once in silent farewell"). Two functional beats plus charged reprise. However, its mechanics—heat currents representing possibilities—are asserted rather than constrained; the candle could be swapped for a scrying pool or crystal with minor edits. Reweighted meaning at the end ("promise that starlight always finds a voice") adds resonance but does not impose on-page cost tied to the candle itself.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Unraveling conspiracies" is seeded at line 93 ("truths buried in official records"), concretized when Vega's misplacement screams betrayal (103), and fully dramatized in the divination sequence (139–172: falsified charts, midnight meetings, coup plot). The conspiracy stakes shape Elara's entire tactic: covert correction instead of direct accusation. It is the engine of the dominant conflict and inseparable from the closure choice. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Disguises wisdom as foolishness" is stated at lines 72 and 81 ("placid smile," "harmless eccentric"). It enables her to "move unseen through treacherous currents" and informs her closure choice to avoid confrontation (260: "vacant smile… mask for resolve"). However, the trait is twice told rather than shown in a specific on-page action where the disguise prevents detection or grants access. The cost (solitude, underestimation) is implied but not dramatized in a distinct beat. Present across setup and payoff; missing middle development constrains the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Synchronize" appears at line 103 (synchronizing embroidery with master charts reveals the error), line 131 (synchronizing breath/intent/thread for divination), and line 198 ("synchronizing the final thread" to complete corrections). It drives discovery, method, and resolution. The term is specific to Elara's craft and irreplaceable in the divination mechanics. However, the method's internal logic—what synchronization permits—is asserted more than demonstrated with visible constraint or cost; the action succeeds smoothly, limiting tension.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Adjacent possibilities" is named at line 123 ("holding a silver thread near the flame's heat to feel currents representing adjacent possibilities"). It shapes the divination beat's mechanics (exploring branching paths to witness Valerius's plot). However, the method is introduced late (past the 40% mark) and its rules are told rather than tested; we don't see Elara navigate wrong paths or pay a price for accessing hidden choices. Swappable with "visions" or "foresight" without structural impact. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory is anchored early (28, 38) and frames entry/exit (214, 284, 308). Autumn setting appears at open (leaves like embers) and close (crisp autumn mist). The environment provides atmospheric coherence and the alcove supplies proximity to the eternal candle. However, the observatory does not constrain Elara's choices; she could perform the same actions in any secure workspace. The "echoed silence" motif recurs but does not alter tactics. Present across setup and payoff; limited causal pressure in the middle.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Before the coup" timeframe is signaled at line 172 ("coup at dawn") and paced through "long autumn night" (188) to "Dawn bled into the cobalt dome" (214). Time tightens the window for intervention and motivates the covert-correction path. However, the clock is summarized rather than tracked beat-by-beat; we don't feel minutes slipping away during the stitching or see a near-miss. The timeframe shapes urgency but does not force a mid-scene trade-off or constrain a tactical choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To listen for unheard stories" is stated at line 93 ("whispers in starlight, regrets in dying suns, truths buried in official records") and drives her attention to Vega's misplacement (103). It motivates the divination and corrective action. The ending image—"starlight always finds a voice" (294)—directly reprises the motivation. However, the motivation is told as sacred mission rather than dramatized through conflicting desires; we don't see her wrestle with risk vs. calling. Present in setup, middle discovery, and payoff; strong thematic integration but limited internal friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Echoed silence" appears seven times (38, 72, 93, 252, 294, 308) and is coherent throughout. It modulates slightly under pressure: "strained" at 103, shifts to "complicit" at 252, resolves to the observatory's sigh at 308. The tone charges the final image and supports the quiet-wisdom theme. However, the phrase risks becoming a stock label; its repetition does not escalate or break pattern to reweight meaning. Coherent and purposeful, but not transformative at closure.</comment>
