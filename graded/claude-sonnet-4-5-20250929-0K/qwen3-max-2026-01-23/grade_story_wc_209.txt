<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her final understanding feels earned through the glass revelation. However, the character remains largely contemplative rather than conflicted; her "quietly driven" patience never faces a meaningful counterpressure or cost that would test her commitment. The grandmother exists only in memory and marginalia, limiting relational crucible work. Interiority relies heavily on abstract phrases ("umbral tenderness," "dawning hush") rather than embodied contradiction under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates sensory detail and thematic weight toward a final resonant reconfiguration where night-blooming flowers are reframed as acts of courage rather than hiding. Orientation anchors clearly by the first 120 words. However, the closure lacks visible cost—Elara gains insight without forfeiting anything on the page; tears and gratitude do not constitute a foreclosed path or altered tactic. The revelation feels granted rather than earned through a choice that narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The amber pavilion and the etched glass window fragment are vividly rendered and constrain the revelation to a specific dawn moment. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's artist perception. The glass itself charges the final image by revealing hidden layers. Minor issue: the pavilion's "perpetual, nostalgic glow of autumn" is told rather than shown through light behavior on objects or skin.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding nocturnal bloom—is signaled early and pursued consistently. The glass revelation provides one meaningful deepening that reweights the question. However, no live opposition or resource constraint tests Elara's commitment; she waits, the sun rises, the answer appears. The tightening is conceptual rather than tactical, and no visible price is paid for the insight—she does not surrender a prior belief or opportunity on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the glass layers and nocturnal bloom metaphor: vulnerability requires gentler light, and some truths need shadow to be seen. The piece avoids explicit moralizing; the final image of night-blooming flowers painted under starlight answers the central question without stating a thesis. "Umbral tenderness" as grief/gratitude/connection woven together feels slightly abstract but is anchored in the grandmother's legacy and the flowers' courage.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in third-limited with a consistent lyric register. Perceptual signature—artist's eye for pigment, glass, light—is character-specific. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("sacred threshold," "profound humility," "quietly driven woman who found divinity") that feels authorial rather than Elara's lived lexicon under pressure. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. The prose modulates appropriately from observation to revelation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, multiple passages lean into decorative phrasing: "honey-tinted glass walls cast the interior in a perpetual, nostalgic glow," "the sky bled from indigo to rose," "her wool shawl whispering against stone." Several adjacent sentences in the revelation beat paraphrase the same insight (flowers honor moon's cool luminescence / covenant of trust with compassionate dark / lesson in valuing tender phases). Template stems recur: "She [verb]" opens five sentences in the final third. Figurative language in most lines of the climax without clear pattern-teaching: −0.5 for density and −0.3 for paraphrase loops = −0.8 total within Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The core synthesis—night bloom as courage rather than secrecy, revelation requiring specific light—is thematically coherent but not structurally novel; contemplative artist receives epiphany through patient observation is a familiar template. The etched glass layers and dawn timing add specificity, yet the emotional arc (question → patient waiting → granted answer → tears of gratitude) follows a well-worn path. No meaningful risk or subversion; the piece executes its lyric mode competently without a non-obvious turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara frames the story and her artist identity shapes her perception of light and layers. She makes one key choice: to press her palm to the glass at dawn. However, the revelation is delivered to her rather than earned through a series of constrained decisions. Present in setup, middle observation, and closure image, but her agency is largely receptive. Two-gate participation (setup, payoff) with moderate causal pressure: base 5.0 + early signal +0.5 + closure linkage +0.7 − passive reception −0.4 = 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The postcards appear in the opening beat as cherished objects and are explicitly returned to their box in the closing beat, creating a purposeful frame. One postcard delivers the cryptic clue that drives Elara's quest. However, they are described and boxed, not handled or examined across multiple beats; their "imbued with the morning's revelation" status is told, not shown through changed interaction. Two-gate (setup, payoff) with thin middle development: base 5.0 + early signal +0.5 + lyric reprise +0.4 − ornamental close −0.7 − swappable (any heirloom note would work) −0.5 = 4.7, round to 4.2 per missing middle-beat constraint.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Dawning hush" is named and defined early as "that sacred threshold between night and day when the world holds its breath." It shapes the timing of Elara's approach to the glass and is explicitly present in the revelation beat ("In that deepening dawning hush, she began to reckon"). The concept charges the closure by reframing nocturnal bloom as requiring gentler light. Three-gate participation: base 5.0 + early signal +0.6 + two beats +0.9 + closure linkage +0.9 − partial label-only use (stated more than enacted) −0.3 − moderate swappability (any liminal threshold concept would serve similarly) −0.5 = 6.6, round to 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Quietly driven" is applied as a label to both Elara and her grandmother but never visibly constrains a choice or creates friction. The text tells us Elara's patience mirrors the earth's thaw, yet no scene shows her resisting impatience or sacrificing an alternative for this slow approach. Label-only, no on-page cost: base 3.0 + mentioned in two contexts +0.4 − no causal pressure −0.3 = 3.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Reckon" appears twice: in the cryptic postcard note and in the revelation beat ("she began to reckon with the truth"). It names the cognitive action Elara must perform and links the clue to the climax. However, the act of reckoning itself is abstract—Elara's breath stills, she sees hidden carvings, tears trace paths—rather than a specific dramatized struggle. Two-beat participation with thematic linkage but thin mechanics: base 5.0 + early signal +0.5 + closure participation +0.7 − summary-only (reckoning told, not shown as process) −0.5 = 5.7, round to 5.9 per moderate thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The etched glass window fragment is introduced early, embedded in the pavilion's eastern wall. Its hidden layers are the method by which revelation occurs: dawn light strikes, carvings of night-blooming flowers emerge. The mechanics matter—only "dawn's honest light" reveals the design—and this specificity shapes the timing and outcome. Three-gate participation with strong causal work: base 5.0 + early signal +0.7 + two beats (mention, use) +0.9 + causal pressure +1.2 + closure linkage +1.5 + irreplaceability (unique optical property) +0.6 − swappable substrate (any encoded art form could serve) −0.4 = 9.5, but the glass does not impose cost or narrow options, only delivers information; cap at high-7s for revelation-without-trade-off, final 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The amber pavilion frames the entire story, providing warmth and autumn glow that contrasts winter's melt outside. It houses the glass fragment and creates a sanctuary mood. However, it does not pressure Elara's choices or supply resources that alter tactics; it is setting-as-container rather than setting-as-constraint. Three-gate presence (setup, middle description, closure frame) but low causal work: base 5.0 + early signal +0.5 + closure mention +0.4 − postcard description (mood over mechanics) −0.6 = 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "across the melting of winter's last snow" is signaled early and bookended at closure when "the last snow vanished, and a crocus pushed through." It provides seasonal metaphor and marks passage. However, it does not create urgency or tighten Elara's decisions; she waits "for weeks" with no visible deadline or cost for delay. Two-gate (setup, payoff) with weak causal pressure: base 5.0 + early signal +0.5 + lyric reprise +0.4 − vague tracking (no live clock) −0.6 − no tactical constraint −0.5 = 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elara's desire to understand nocturnal bloom is named early as motivation and drives her patient investigation. The final revelation directly answers this question, reframing night-blooming as courage. However, the motivation is never conflicted on the page—no competing want or fear tests her commitment, and the insight arrives without requiring her to surrender a cherished belief. Three-gate participation with thin friction: base 5.0 + early signal +0.7 + two beats (stated, answered) +0.9 + closure linkage +1.0 − told more than dramatized −0.5 − no want/cost friction −0.5 = 6.6, adjusted to 6.1 for summary-dominant presentation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Umbral tenderness" is defined late in the revelation beat as "shadowed warmth that was grief, gratitude, and connection woven into one" and returns in the final paragraph to describe the amber pavilion's mood. The tone—gentle, reverent, shadowed—coheres throughout and charges the final image. However, the phrase itself is introduced past midpoint and leans abstract. Two-gate (middle coinage, payoff) with strong mood work: base 5.0 + mid-story signal +0.3 + closure charge +1.2 + tone modulation (calm to tears to peace) +0.8 − late coinage −0.3 − label-heavy phrasing −0.2 = 6.8.</comment>
