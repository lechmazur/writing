<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "discover what trees witness" is established early but remains largely abstract; the piece tells us she's obsessed without dramatizing internal conflict or showing her struggle under pressure. Her agency at closure—lifting the sextant and seeing the tableaus—feels passive, a witnessing rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The final paragraph's claim that "her role had evolved" is asserted rather than earned through on-page micro-choices that reveal contradictory impulses. Interiority leans heavily on elevated, therapeutic diction ("profound connection," "shared humanity") rather than embodied, character-specific perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates through three seasons of dream-mapping toward a moonlight activation, but the closure beat—sextant healing and revealing tree memories—arrives through coincidence (pin drop, cloud gap) rather than Elara's agency or a pattern break that reweights her stake with cost. The Orientation Test is satisfied (Elara, tower corridor, storm night established early). Closure form reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (her role "evolved"), yet the cost is conceptual and stated rather than felt on the page: no live option is foreclosed, no visible sacrifice made. The piece teaches its lens adequately but the final image does not tighten or deepen pressure—it opens into wisdom without dramatized trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The stormlit tower, leaded glass, moonlight column, and labyrinth below are vividly rendered and provide atmospheric coherence. The sextant as recurring object charges the final image when it becomes the conduit for tree memories. However, the environment does not constrain Elara's choices—she waits passively for moonlight—and the pin's fall, while specific, is coincidental rather than a tactical use of setting. Spatial choreography (corridor, window, labyrinth below) remains clear. The setting supports tone and concept but does not force a decision or alter tactics, capping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—accessing tree wisdom via the sextant—is signaled early, but pressure does not escalate through Elara's agency or meaningful tightening. The three seasons of dream-mapping occur off-page; on-page action is static waiting until coincidence (pin, moonlight) triggers the sextant's healing. No reversal or deepening changes Elara's options or knowledge in a way that costs her something visible. The moonlight activation itself is a gift of circumstance, not a choice under pressure. The resolution—trees as "compassionate archivists"—arrives without Elara paying a dramatized price or making a trade-off that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—transformation of sorrow through care and mapping—emerges from the sextant's healing and Elara's dream-work, avoiding overt thesis statements until the final paragraphs. However, the ending leans heavily on abstraction: "quantified sorrow alchemized into shared humanity," "sorrow...transforms into wisdom" read as thematic summaries rather than images that let the reader infer meaning. The trees-as-archivists conceit is fresh, but the final image does not reweight prior material with a non-literal answer—it states the answer. The piece resists false binaries and embraces complexity in the sextant's integration of grief, yet closure is more asserted than earned through scene particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Elara throughout; no head-hopping. Voice carries consistent elevated diction ("profound connection," "liquid silver," "luminous tapestry") that fits a literary register but occasionally drifts into abstraction under pressure ("quantified sorrow," "shared humanity") rather than embodied perception. Psychic distance remains controlled. The prose has distinct texture—lyric, formal—but the narrator's perceptual signature is more poetic than character-specific; Elara's way of noticing reads generic rather than filtered through her maintenance-worker lens. No dialogue present. Filter verbs ("watched," "felt") are acceptable and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and the prose is largely clean, but several patterns recur: "the x of y" constructions ("weight of grief," "column of pure moonlight," "story of its healing"), polysyndeton in lists ("root and memory," "joy...regret...melodies"), and elevated abstractions in peak beats ("quantified sorrow," "profound connection," "shared humanity") that tell rather than embody. Information density is uneven—long atmospheric sentences front-load description while key actions (dream-mapping, sextant activation) compress into summary. The pin's fall is vivid and specific, a strong anchoring detail. No major loops or scaffolding, but "quantified sorrow" appears five times as a label rather than evolving through imagery. Clarity remains high; momentum sags in reflective passages.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—repairing a grief-shattered sextant via mapped dreams to access tree memories—is inventive and non-obvious. "Quantified sorrow" as embodied in fractured brass offers a fresh angle on grief. However, the piece leans on established tropes: the mystical artifact, the wise trees, the moonlight miracle. Emotional truth is present but abstracted through labels rather than lived-in specificity. The sextant's dual function (astronomer's tool, tree-memory conduit) is conceptually rich but under-dramatized; we're told it "heals in moonlight" without exploring the cost or mechanics on the page. The transformation of prompt elements feels more assembled than inevitable—remove "scattered dreams" or "pin in corridor" and substitute similar mystical devices without major loss.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her three-season dream-mapping work is recounted, but on the page she waits passively—no decision alters tactics or creates a turn. At closure she lifts the sextant and witnesses tree memories, an act of observation without agency cost. Introduced early (setup ✓), mentioned across beats (development ~), but does not drive closure choices (payoff ✗). Cap at 4.6 per missing closure participation; swappability and passivity lower further to mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sextant appears in Elara's hands (opening), is described with its grief-embedded attribute and dream-map alignment (middle), heals in moonlight, and becomes the conduit for tree memories at closure—present in all three gates. It constrains the plot (must wait for moonlight) and charges the final image (reveals tableaus). Strong beat involvement and closure linkage. However, its mechanics (how dream-maps heal grief-fractures) remain abstract, and the element could be replaced with another mystical healing artifact without breaking story logic, capping irreplaceability. No felt cost tied specifically to the sextant's use at closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Quantified sorrow" is introduced as the sextant's attribute (embedded grief that shattered it) and recurs as a label five times, framing the thematic claim at closure ("quantified sorrow alchemized into shared humanity"). It shapes the conceptual stakes—Elara believes mapping dreams can counterweight the astronomer's loss—but does not constrain on-page choices or tactics; Elara does not wrestle with how to quantify or measure sorrow in scene. Present in setup and payoff; minimal middle development. Functions as theme more than plot driver, landing mid-band per the lyric-resonance allowance but lacking causal pressure or visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Heals in moonlight" is introduced as tower lore, becomes the mechanism for the climactic activation when moonlight floods the sextant, and enables the tree-memory revelation. Present in all three gates. It constrains timing (Elara must wait for clouds to part) and enables the closure beat with visible sensory payoff (glowing cracks, chime). However, the cost is passive—Elara does nothing to summon moonlight; coincidence (pin, cloud gap) triggers the attribute. Strong closure linkage but agency-lite, capping in mid-7s rather than higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Deconstruct" is named as the method—Elara believes the labyrinth's dreams can deconstruct the sextant's embedded sorrow—and the closure paragraph states "This was the deconstruction: quantified sorrow transformed...by mapped dreams." However, the action itself is summary-only; we do not see Elara actively deconstructing anything on the page. The sextant heals through moonlight activation, not through a dramatized deconstructive process. Introduced late (midpoint), present at closure as a label, but easily swappable with "heal," "mend," or "transform." Cap at 4.9 per summary-only use and swappability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Mapping scattered dreams" is established early (three seasons of collecting dream-fragments and charting them) and aligned with the sextant's fractures in the middle section, then invoked at closure ("mapped dreams—a child's hope mending despair"). Present in all three gates. However, the mechanics are told rather than shown—no on-page scene of Elara collecting or mapping a single dream. The method's payoff at closure is asserted ("dreams...softened" the grief) without dramatizing how the maps interface with moonlight or the sextant. Lyric reprise present but causal pressure weak; lands mid-5s per summary-only development.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "stormlit tower by moonlight" is vividly rendered (rain, lightning, leaded glass, moonlight column) and frames the entire piece. The storm subsides and moonlight floods at the key moment, enabling the sextant's healing. Present in all three gates. The setting provides atmosphere and the moonlight is essential to the closure beat, but it does not constrain Elara's choices—she waits passively rather than using the tower's features tactically. Strong sensory detail and closure linkage, but the environment does not pressure decisions, capping in mid-6s per the micro-setting allowance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"The moment a pin is heard in a silent corridor" is dramatized on the page as the precise instant when moonlight arrives, synchronizing sound and light. It appears in the closure sequence (middle-to-end) and charges the final turn with specificity. However, the pin's fall is coincidental—Elara does not drop it intentionally to mark time or summon moonlight. The timeframe does not tighten decisions or tactics; it is a poetic marker rather than a live clock that alters moves. Present in setup (silence established) and payoff (pin, moonlight); minimal middle development. Lyric reprise with some closure charge, landing mid-5s per coincidence and lack of tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"To discover what trees witness" is introduced as Elara's "quiet obsession" in the opening paragraphs and recurs at closure when the sextant reveals tree memories. Present in setup and payoff. However, the motivation is told ("she believed") rather than dramatized through on-page friction—no scene where Elara's desire to know tree wisdom conflicts with a cost or competing want. At closure, the desire is satisfied without visible sacrifice; she gains access to the tableaus with a tear of "profound connection" but no foreclosed path. Swappable with other mystical knowledge-quests. Lands mid-5s per summary-only and lack of on-page conflict tied to the want.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Mundane miracles" is embodied throughout: a pin's fall, moonlight through clouds, brass breathing, dreams mending grief. The tone is consistent—lyric, reverent, quietly numinous—and modulates appropriately (storm tension, silent waiting, moonlit revelation). The final image ("mundane miracle...complete") names the tone explicitly but the piece has already enacted it through accumulated small wonders. Tone charges the closure image and coheres across beats, avoiding static mood. However, the explicit naming in the final third risks over-articulation. Present in all three gates with strong coherence and closure linkage, landing in low-7s.</comment>
