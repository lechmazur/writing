<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and his guilt is embodied through physical action (tracing carvings, clutching the watch hand). Internal conflict exists but operates through alternating reflection rather than simultaneous contradictory impulses in scene. The final choice to confess is prepared by prior causality, but the decision itself occurs off-page ("At dawn, he would…"), with the cost deferred rather than made visible in the closure moment. Embodied emotion is present but occasionally veers toward abstraction ("hollow ache," "storm of regret").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the shore ritual and watch-hand discovery deepen the stake through density and image. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. Closure achieves Charged Poise—the vow to speak truth and the resolved stance are legible—but the cost remains prospective ("heavier, holier weight of honesty") rather than paid on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when the carving surfaces and reframes the guilt, satisfying the length requirement, though the final beat summarizes intention rather than enacting decisive change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace and forgotten shore are vivid and purposeful, with sensory detail filtered through Elias's guilt (tiles "drank the fading light," moss-slicked steps). The watch hand carving constrains the final choice, grounding the vow in a tactile object whose "splinters biting his palm" charges the closure image. Spatial choreography (terrace → shore → return) is clean and the setting evolution mirrors internal shift. The shore functions as micro-setting that pressures the protagonist's stance, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—relieving guilt by confronting withheld truth—is signaled early and deepens when the watch hand surfaces. The discovery tightens options by crystallizing his responsibility, and the vow forecloses evasion with felt regret. However, the escalation is internal and retrospective; no external opposition tests the choice on the page, and the cost ("heavier, holier weight") is declared rather than paid in action. Agency is present in the vow but deferred to dawn, leaving the closure moment poised rather than decisively changed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—truth versus comforting lies, and the necessity of bearing painful reality—emerges organically from Elias's craft and the shore ritual. The sieved hush operates as both concept and thematic vessel, filtering excuses to reveal essential truth. The final image of the carving and the terrace as "threshold to atonement" offers resonance without moralizing. However, lines like "redemption lay not in forgetting the past, but in facing it with clear eyes" and "some truths, though painful, are necessary to hold" veer toward thematic echo, restating the premise rather than letting the image speak (-0.3 in Q5).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Diction is often elevated and poetic ("dusk bled into the horizon," "tempered regret, cool and sharp"), fitting the reflective tone but occasionally clashing with urgent internal stakes. Perceptual signature is present (Elias notices carvings, watch hands, grooves) but not deeply character-particular. No dialogue appears. Register holds, though phrases like "holier weight of honesty" and "clear eyes" feel slightly generic. The voice is coherent and controlled but lacks a singular rhythmic fingerprint under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Rhythm is sonorous but often repetitive in structure: many paragraphs open with "He," "The," or "As," creating template cadence (-0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "weight of unspoken words" recurs without added pressure, and the closure restates earlier ideas ("no longer...but" constructions proliferate in the final third). Figurative language is dense ("dusk bled," "tiles drank," "stars as pinpricks") and occasionally strained ("sieved hush...crystallized"). Information density is moderate; several lines restate Elias's guilt and vow without advancing situation. These artifacts touch the closure third, triggering the 9+ disallowance and high-band cap at 8.8 globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The guilt-ridden memory-manipulator facing his own deception is a solid premise, but the emotional arc—regret leading to vow of confession—follows a familiar template without a non-obvious turn. The "sieved hush" as filtering silence is vivid yet remains more poetic than causally essential. The driftwood ritual and watch-hand discovery are specific, but the resolution (deciding to confess at dawn) is anticipated rather than freshly angled. No risk-taking in structure or perspective elevates the execution; the piece plays its premise straight and competently but does not transform it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's role as black market genealogist frames his guilt and the withheld document, appearing in the opening and shaping the backstory that triggers his vow. His decision to confess arises directly from his professional sin—manufacturing false memories—making the trait essential to the conflict. Present in setup, middle reflection, and closure vow. Two beats of causal pressure; closure linkage strong; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The watch hand carving appears at the shore discovery and in the final climb, physically handled ("thumb snagged," "splinters biting his palm"). It mirrors the brass hand used in Elara's deception, serving as both proof and talisman. Drives the recognition beat and anchors the vow in the closure image. Two distinct beats, early signal, closure participation, and high irreplaceability earn the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The sieved hush is named and explained ("filtered silence where essential truth could finally be heard") and recurs at the shore and in the final reflection. It functions more as thematic label and atmospheric motif than as a constraint that alters tactics. The concept is present and coherent but does not shape on-page choices—Elias would trace carvings and make his vow without naming the silence. Setup present, payoff present, but middle development weak; swappable with "clarity" or "stillness."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elias's attribute—manufacturing false memories—is central to his guilt and the withheld document. It appears in setup exposition and drives the middle recognition that he "stole her right to mourn." The cost (guilt, sleepless nights, moral reckoning) is visible. However, the trait is recounted rather than enacted on the page; we see its aftermath, not the choice itself. Setup, middle, and closure all reference it; essential but not dramatized in present action, capping the score in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Quell" appears three times: quelling the storm of regret (ritual descent), quelling anxiety (driftwood method), and quelling the legacy of deceit (vow). The action verbs the protagonist's attempts to manage guilt but is generic—"confront," "ease," or "silence" could substitute with minor edits. It coheres with the tone but does not impose unique mechanics or cost. Present across beats and closure, functional but replaceable, capping the score near 6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Sifting through driftwood carvings is Elias's established ritual, signaled early and executed at the shore where he discovers the watch hand. The method directly yields the key object and structures the middle beat. It is specific and irreplaceable—removing the shore and carvings would break the discovery mechanism. Setup, middle enactment, and indirect closure participation (carving as talisman) all present; causal pressure moderate; earns low-7 band eligibility with solid integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace opens and closes the story, framing Elias's stance shift from "monument to failure" to "threshold to atonement." Dusk lighting and blue tiles are vivid and mood-setting. The setting does not impose a physical constraint or resource test, but its symbolic reweighting at closure charges the final image with earned meaning. Setup strong, middle absent (action occurs at the shore), closure reprise purposeful. Lyric resonance and closure linkage lift the score into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "under the weight of unspoken words" is metaphorical rather than a live clock. Dusk-to-dawn progression provides temporal structure but does not tighten decisions—Elias could take hours or minutes at the shore without altering the outcome. The weight is thematic pressure, not a deadline. Setup present as framing device, but no middle or closure urgency tied to elapsed time. Swappable with any introspective window; functional but not essential.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elias's motivation—to discover the weight of withheld truth—is stated in the opening and dramatized through the shore ritual and carving discovery. The friction between easing burdens and the cost of deception drives his vow. The desire is conflicted (he sought solace but found accountability) and tested on the page. Setup, middle beat (recognition via carving), and closure vow all trace to this motivation. Causal pressure strong; irreplaceability high; cost visible.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Tempered regret—cool, resolved sorrow rather than fiery shame—is established early and sustained through diction ("settled over him," "heavier, holier weight"). The tone modulates appropriately: guilt at opening, deepening recognition at the shore, crystallized resolve at closure. It coheres across structural turns and charges the final image without tipping into sentimentality. Setup strong, development consistent, closure participation clear. The tone is indispensable to the story's emotional register and thematic effect.</comment>
