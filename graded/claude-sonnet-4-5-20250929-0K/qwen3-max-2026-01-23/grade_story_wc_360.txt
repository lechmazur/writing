<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("to understand the mathematics of emotion") is asserted early but her "transposed empathy" reads as a described attribute rather than embodied contradiction. The final shift—recognizing "the mathematics was the dance itself"—arrives as epiphany-by-declaration rather than earned through micro-choices that foreclose a path. The philosopher's grief and poet's joy collide mid-piece, yet the resolution to "harmonize" them within her feels clean and unearned, lacking visible cost at the closure moment. Embodiment is intermittent: "hollow chest," "quickened pulse" are vivid, but much of the interiority leans on abstract labels ("visceral resonance," "transposed empathy") rather than action under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece signals Accumulative/Textural intent (starlight captured in topaz walls, the halo fragment's indigo-to-gold shift), but the core escalation is asserted rather than causally built: Elara's panic and the collision of borrowed emotions are told as summary, then resolved by intellectual insight ("the equation required the ambiguity"). The closure unit reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—she returns to the press with "lucid peace"—but the felt cost is unclear; the shift from disorientation to calm happens off-stage between paragraphs. Orientation is clean (who, where, when by the first paragraph). The Before (seeking "elegant calculus") and After (embracing "the dance itself") are legible, yet the moment of change lacks on-page friction or visible foreclosure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The topaz workshop, brass lever, velvet cushion, and crystalline dome are vivid and selective, establishing tone and anchoring the single-scene frame. The halo fragment functions as a tool (lens to perceive emotional residue) that recurs, though its physical handling is minimal after the initial paragraphs. The "vanishing stars" and "Between" timeframe are atmospheric but do not alter tactics or constrain a choice; they remain descriptive backdrop. The final image (single new star pricking the darkness, halo fragment glowing gold) charges the ending thematically but does not reshape options or pressure on the page, missing the higher band's gate for micro-setting that constrains choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to understand the mathematics of emotion"—is clear early, but escalation is vague: the collision of grief and joy triggers "panic" and "disorientation," yet the text does not dramatize a narrowing of options or a trade-off. The tightening moment ("Clutching the halo fragment, she sought anchor in constants: press pressure, ink ratios") is gestural; the resolution ("the mathematics was not a cage… It was the dynamic interplay itself") is insight-by-epiphany rather than a decision that forecloses a path. No visible price is paid; Elara moves from turbulence to "lucid peace" without on-page cost. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is sufficient, but the text lacks the visceral reweighting or foreclosure that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme—emotion as irreducible, dynamic interplay rather than fixed equation—emerges from the halo fragment's color shifts and Elara's movement from seeking "elegant calculus" to embracing "turbulence." However, key thematic language ("transposed empathy," "deliberate ambiguity," "lucid turbulence") is repeated as prompt labels rather than dramatized through action; the final paragraph edges into thesis statement ("The mathematics was the dance itself, elegant in its chaos"). The resonance is stronger in the image of the new star and the warm halo fragment than in the declarations. The quiet ending is appropriate, yet the thematic answer feels stated rather than embodied in a final choice or renunciation with cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable; perceptual signature is present in "scent of iron and ink," "topaz facets swam," "shadows deepened into chasms." Register is elevated and consistent ("visceral resonance," "the elegant calculus hidden in cadence and glyph"), fitting a literate artisan focalizer. Purposeful compression in the escalation paragraphs ("Topaz facets swam… collided… frayed") supports pressure. However, the voice occasionally drifts into meta-commentary that feels authorial rather than character-bound ("This was designed to disorient the reader"), and the final paragraphs lean on prompt terms ("transposed empathy," "deliberate ambiguity," "lucid turbulence") rather than idiom rooted in Elara's craft. No dialogue present. Psychic distance remains close throughout with no unmotivated leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift. Information density is moderate: many lines do double work (image + interiority), but paragraphs 10–17 form a paraphrase loop restating the collision and resolution without adding pressure. Template cadence: "The halo fragment glowed… amplified… shifted… pulsed" across multiple beats without variation. Stock metaphors appear ("winter frost," "velvet blackness") and prompt labels recur without fresh angle ("transposed empathy" × 3, "deliberate ambiguity" × 3, "lucid" × 3). No grammar errors. The final image ("workshop ablaze with gentle radiance," "printed not words, but wisdom") edges into purple abstraction. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loop and template stems; −0.3 for stock phrasing and label churn. Total moderate line-level debt.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—a letterpress operator who absorbs authors' emotions and seeks to mathematize feeling—offers a fresh synthesis of craft and concept. Execution, however, leans on genre furniture: the liminal "Between," vanishing stars, a mystical fragment, and the epiphany that "the mathematics is the dance" feels familiar from countless mage-scholar narratives. The transformation test suggests moderate swappability: change "letterpress" to another artisan trade and the arc holds. Prompt terms ("transposed empathy," "deliberate ambiguity," "lucid turbulence") function as thematic shorthand rather than lived detail that resists abstraction. The topaz workshop and halo fragment are vivid, yet the story does not take bold structural or perspectival risks; it executes a known template (artisan crisis → insight → peace) at competent level without subversion or non-obvious angle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara adjusts the brass lever (paragraph 1), sets type (paragraph 9), holds the halo fragment over type (paragraph 8), clutches it during panic (paragraph 18), places it back (paragraph 24), and returns to the press (paragraph 30). Her occupation frames every beat and her final return to the press is the closure action. However, her decisions are thin: the text tells us she "set a pivotal word slightly askew" (paragraph 12) but does not show the choice or its cost; the resolution is insight-by-epiphany rather than a forked decision that forecloses a path. Setup present; middle beats descriptive; closure participation solid but passive. Moderate causal pressure; no sharp tradeoff. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, cost connection weak +0.2, late insight −0.3, summary-only key choice −0.5. Band ~5.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The halo fragment appears in paragraph 7 (resting on velvet), paragraph 8 (held as lens to witness emotional residue), paragraph 11 (glows indigo, amplifying empathy), paragraph 18 (clutched for anchor), paragraph 24 (warmed, light shifting to gold), paragraph 29 (pulsed, catching dawn-light), and is implied in the final return to work. Two distinct physical uses (lens in para 8; anchor in para 18) plus color-shift reprise at closure. The gold glow charges the final image as testament to integrated understanding. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (amplifies empathy, then reflects shift) +0.8, closure linkage (warm gold light, settled) +1.2, specificity (solidified light, indigo-to-gold) +0.5. No major frictions. Band ~6.8, rounds to 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Transposed empathy" is named in paragraph 5 as definition ("not mimicry but transfer"), appears again in paragraph 11 (amplified by halo fragment), and paragraph 22 (realization that it is part of the mathematics). It shapes the premise but does not force a choice: Elara's borrowing of the philosopher's grief and poet's joy is described, not dramatized as an action with cost. The concept remains thematic assertion rather than tactical constraint. Setup present (para 5), middle mention (para 11), closure mention (para 22). No beat where the concept changes options on the page. Early signal +0.4, closure mention (thematic, not causal) +0.4, ornamental use −0.7, label-only −0.4, summary-only −0.5. Band ~4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The attribute "habitually borrows personalities" is stated in paragraph 4 ("slipping into the emotional skins of authors") and enacted in paragraph 10 ("she surrendered completely, borrowing his weary posture, his fractured breath") and paragraph 16 (collision of philosopher's grief and poet's joy). The trait drives the escalation (disorientation from borrowed voices) but the cost—"panic rose"—is told rather than shown through a choice that forecloses a path. The resolution harmonizes the borrowed personalities (paragraph 32) without visible trade-off. Setup present (para 4), middle enactment (para 10, 16), closure (para 32 harmony). Causal involvement moderate; cost asserted, not dramatized. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.6, closure linkage +0.5, cost connection (told) +0.2, summary-only −0.5, ornamental resolution −0.4. Band ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Disorient" is the escalation's hinge: paragraph 13 states "designed to disorient the reader," paragraph 14 "disorientation turned inward," paragraphs 15–17 detail the turbulence, paragraph 19 "Through the deliberate ambiguity of her swirling mind," and paragraph 23 "The disorientation ceased." The action names the crisis and its resolution, appearing in five beats. However, the disorientation is described rather than enacted through dramatized confusion that alters tactics; the reader is told Elara is disoriented, then told she found clarity. Setup (para 13), middle escalation (paras 14–19), closure (para 23 cessation). Moderate causal pressure; no sharp tactical shift. Early signal +0.6, four beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.7, closure linkage +0.9, swappability (could use "confusion" or "chaos") −0.6, summary-only −0.5, label-only −0.3. Band ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Deliberate ambiguity" is stated in paragraph 12 ("Her method demanded deliberate ambiguity: she set a pivotal word slightly askew"), paragraph 13 ("designed to disorient"), paragraph 19 ("Through the deliberate ambiguity of her swirling mind"), paragraph 20 ("the equation required the ambiguity"), and paragraph 34 ("The deliberate ambiguity in the print would stand"). The method is asserted as craft principle but not shown: we do not see the word choice, the font's dual nature, or how ambiguity forces a reader encounter. It functions as thematic label rather than dramatized means. Setup present (para 12), middle mention (para 19), closure mention (para 34). No beat where the method alters tactics. Early signal +0.5, three mentions +1.4, causal pressure weak +0.3, closure linkage (thematic) +0.4, ornamental use −0.7, label-only −0.6, summary-only −0.6. Band ~4.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The topaz workshop is established in paragraph 1 ("topaz walls… humming with captured starlight"), paragraph 15 ("Topaz facets swam"), paragraph 29 ("topaz walls" catching new star's light), and paragraph 36 ("In the topaz workshop"). The crystalline dome (para 2), brass lever (para 1, 30), velvet (para 7), and press (para 30) anchor space. The setting provides atmosphere and frames the entire piece but does not pressure a choice: Elara could resolve her crisis elsewhere. The workshop charges the final image (topaz walls "ablaze with gentle radiance") but does not constrain her tactics. Setup present (para 1), middle reprise (para 15), closure reprise (para 29, 36). Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage (atmospheric) +0.7, micro-setting (body/tool: halo fragment scored separately) +0.4, no causal pressure −0.8, ornamental use −0.5. Band ~5.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "the Between" is named in paragraph 2 ("This liminal timeframe, the Between, was when the old cosmos bled into the new") and bookended by "vanishing stars" (para 1) and "a single new star" (para 29). The final star's appearance coincides with Elara's resolution, charging the ending image, but time does not tighten decisions: no clock, no urgency tied to the stars' disappearance. The Between is atmospheric backdrop. Setup present (para 2), closure reprise (para 29). No middle development. Early signal +0.6, closure linkage (thematic) +0.5, no middle beats −0.5, no tactical pressure −0.8, ornamental use −0.6. Two gates met (setup, payoff); cap ~6.0 before frictions. Band ~3.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation "to understand the mathematics of emotion" is stated in paragraph 6, restated in paragraphs 20 ("the equation required the ambiguity") and 21 ("the mathematics was not a cage"), and resolved in paragraph 35 ("The mathematics was the dance itself"). It frames her quest and drives the escalation (panic when the equations fail), then reweights at closure (acceptance of turbulence). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through a choice between competing wants: we do not see her choose to stop seeking the equation or pay a price to embrace ambiguity. Setup present (para 6), middle crisis (paras 18–20), closure realization (paras 21, 35). Causal involvement moderate; cost implied, not visible. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.7, closure linkage +1.0, told-only friction −0.7, no visible tradeoff −0.5. Band ~6.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Lucid turbulence" is the piece's tonal signature: paragraph 23 names it directly ("Lucid turbulence: a clear pattern born from necessary chaos"), and the prose modulates from measured craft-language (paras 1–9) to escalating fragmentation (paras 14–17: "Topaz facets swam… shadows deepened… frayed… Panic rose") then back to serene closure (paras 24–37: "deep calm," "genuine curve," "humming with lucid peace"). The tone charges the final image and supports the thematic arc. However, the label "lucid turbulence" is stated rather than emergent; the turbulence paragraphs rely on abstract summary rather than embodied perception. Setup implicit (para 1 onward), middle escalation (paras 14–17), closure calm (para 37). Modulation present; coherence solid; label-driven friction. Early signal +0.5, three-phase modulation +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, coherence +0.6, label-only in para 23 −0.5, summary turbulence −0.6. Band ~5.1.</comment>
