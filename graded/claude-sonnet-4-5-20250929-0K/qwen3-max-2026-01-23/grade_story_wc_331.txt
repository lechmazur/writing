<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her interior life is specific (the scarf as anchor, the geometry obsession), but her journey is largely contemplative without meaningful internal contradiction. The climactic memory sequence at lines 128–176 offers embodied emotion and a concrete micro-choice (aligning the scarf), yet the final "carry the library of folds within her" reads as label-only insight rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The grandmother functions well as a remembered pressure point, but Elara's present-tense agency remains thin—observation and realization dominate over difficult trade-offs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (density increases through memory layering; closure reweights the scarf and geometry motifs). Orientation anchors are clear by line 19. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing variant): Elara shifts from seeking an external location to recognizing the "resonant dimension born between teller and listener" (line 208). The cost is conceptual—the abandonment of her search for a tangible place—and is legible in the final image (lines 251, 259). One meaningful deepening occurs when the memory fuses with present understanding (line 181), reweighting the hyperbolic diagram from metaphor to literal map. However, the cost could be more viscerally felt; the shift is cerebral and the story does not dramatize what Elara sacrifices or what new constraint this understanding imposes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The library setting is vivid and specific ("Calculus of Longing," "Photosynthetic Haikus," hyperbolic crochet model), and the Contemplation Nook with its green lamp provides spatial grounding for the key beat. The scarf functions as micro-setting, constraining Elara's tactile focus (line 109) and charging the final image. The grandmother's study (lines 128–135) is sensorially rich (beeswax, chamomile, rain) and the firelight detail returns purposefully when the scarf's folds catch it (line 157). Spatial choreography is clean throughout, and the library's atmosphere of "hushed pocket" and "gentle currents" supports the observed-solitude tone without becoming static postcard description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: to locate where stories truly live. The tightening occurs when Elara moves from broad search to the specific method (hyperbolic geometry + scarf alignment, lines 92–109), and the deepening arrives when the memory fuses present understanding with the grandmother's teaching (line 181). This reweights the diagram from metaphor to map, narrowing Elara's search to an internal answer. However, the escalation is cerebral; no on-page reversal forces a trade-off or raises external cost. The story delivers one meaningful pressure point under the Accumulative lens, but the final choice—to "carry the library within"—feels more like acceptance than a decision that forecloses a live alternative with felt sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from image and action: stories live in "the resonant dimension born between teller and listener" (line 208), mapped by "love's infinite geometry" (line 259). The scarf's folds (lines 157, 169) and hyperbolic tessellations (lines 92, 189) build the theme concretely, avoiding platitude. The grandmother's teaching is embodied in gesture ("creating intricate pleats," line 157) rather than abstracted. The final image—"analog warmth of memory" (line 259)—resonates without moralizing, and the turn from seeking an external archive to recognizing an internal, relational dimension is earned by prior particulars. Minor slip: "vibrant presence of every story ever shared" (line 229) edges toward thematic summary rather than pure implication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with clean focalization on Elara. The prose carries a distinct, slightly elevated register ("sanely eccentric," "rational poetry of order") that fits the librarian's scholarly milieu and remains consistent under pressure. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the scarf-alignment beat (lines 109–114), intimate during the memory immersion (lines 128–176). The grandmother's dialogue at lines 151–169 and 176 reads voice-distinct (formal, instructive cadence) and advances theme through metaphor. Minor friction: a few filter verbs ("observed," "focused") in peak moments (lines 29, 109) slightly dull immediacy, and the final paragraph's diction ("living atlas of connection") tilts toward thematic label rather than embodied perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several beats show template cadence and paraphrase loops. Lines 61 and 70 restate Elara's motivation with synonym churn ("locate the tangible place" vs. "soul of narrative resided in the felt"); lines 181 and 189 loop the hyperbolic-diagram insight. The phrase "tattered silk scarf" recurs seven times, often in identical construction, creating textural monotony. The metaphor "vibrant presence" (line 229) and "living atlas of connection" (line 251) are stock formulations that reduce specificity. Minor register drift: "sanely eccentric" and "rational poetry of order" read as elevated abstractions slightly outside a naturalistic interior voice. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull momentum in non-closure beats. Applying −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template stems, plus −0.3 for stock metaphor strings, totaling −1.1 before band adjustment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The premise—librarian uses hyperbolic geometry to access stored memories—offers a fresh synthesis of the conceptual (non-Euclidean space) and the tactile (scarf, grandmother's folds). The turn from external search to internal recognition is earned in hindsight by the scarf-and-geometry setup. However, the core arc (seeking meaning in the analog vs. digital) is a familiar template, and the story does not transform it through unexpected moral calculus or lived cost; the resolution affirms rather than complicates the premise. The hyperbolic-geometry method is specific but remains more metaphorical ornament than a constraint that shapes hard choices. Within-band adjustment: +0.2 for the geometry-as-literal-map turn, offset by −0.4 for the derivative analog-vs.-digital frame, landing mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her observation frames the story, but her key choices are largely contemplative. She decides to enter the Contemplation Nook (line 86), align the scarf (lines 99–109), and accept the internal answer (lines 251–259). These beats constrain tactics (the alignment is method-specific) and the final acceptance forecloses the external search, meeting two gates (setup, closure participation) and touching three beats. However, the choices do not face high-stakes opposition or visible tradeoff; the story unfolds as discovery rather than conflict-driven decision. Early signal (+0.5), three beats (+1.4), closure linkage (+0.9), moderate causal pressure (+0.7), minus ornamental observation bias (−0.4) and low visible cost (−0.3), yields mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The scarf appears in lines 43–53 (setup/anchor), 99–109 (alignment action), 139 (memory scene), 151–157 (grandmother's folding demonstration), 221 (post-closure folding), and 242 (final carry). It drives the alignment beat, anchors the memory immersion, and charges the final image with reweighted meaning (from grief artifact to map of connection). Three gates satisfied (setup, development, closure). Early signal (+0.6), four distinct beats (+1.4), strong causal pressure (the texture and edge are focal points for the method, +1.2), closure linkage (+1.3), high specificity (frayed emerald threads, lavender scent, +0.6). Minor deduction for the phrase "tattered silk scarf" recurring identically seven times, creating slight template monotony (−0.3). Sum places it solidly in the 7s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Analog memories" shapes stakes (lines 61, 70: Elara seeks stories in "the felt, the remembered, the analog") and is dramatized through the scarf's sensory details (lines 43–53, 109) and the grandmother's tactile teaching (lines 151–169). The concept opposes digital archives (line 70) and drives the final answer: stories live in "analog warmth of memory" (line 259). Three gates met (setup, middle embodiment via scarf texture, closure). Early signal (+0.5), two beats (scarf handling, memory immersion, +0.9), moderate causal pressure (the analog nature enables the hyperbolic method, +0.8), closure linkage (+1.0). Deduction for thematic labeling in final paragraph ("analog warmth," line 259, feels slightly告知 rather than purely embodied, −0.4), and the concept is more atmosphere than a hard constraint on choice (−0.4). Lands mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Sanely eccentric" is mentioned once (line 29) and illustrated by the hyperbolic crochet model, but it does not constrain an on-page action with cost. The trait flavors Elara's character and supports the setting's quirky tone, yet her choices (entering the nook, aligning the scarf, accepting the insight) do not hinge on being eccentric versus conventional. Setup gate met (line 29), but no middle development or closure participation. Ornamental description (−0.6), swappable (any quirky detail could replace it, −0.5), late single mention (−0.3). Lands low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Reawaken" (line 121) marks the transition into the memory sequence (lines 128–176), which supplies the key insight (grandmother's teaching about folds and space). This beat enables the final understanding and reweights the hyperbolic diagram. Two gates: development (the memory is the story's pivotal turn) and closure linkage (the insight directly shapes lines 181, 189, 208). Early setup is implicit (the scarf primes it). One major beat involvement (+0.4), strong causal pressure (without the memory, Elara has no answer, +1.3), closure linkage (+1.2), moderate irreplaceability (a different trigger could deliver similar insight, −0.5). The action is more passive reception than hard choice (−0.3). Mid-to-upper 6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Hyperbolic geometry" is introduced at line 78, elaborated at lines 92–99 (vellum chart, tessellations, asymptotic curve), and reappears at lines 181–196 (diagram as literal map of folded space). The method enables the scarf-alignment tactic and provides the conceptual scaffolding for closure ("diverging lines," "central fold," lines 196, 189). Three gates met (setup line 78, middle use lines 92–99, closure lines 189–196). Early signal (+0.6), two beats (+0.9), moderate causal pressure (the geometry is the means, not a hard constraint that could fail, +0.9), closure linkage (+0.9), specificity (asymptotic curve, tessellations, +0.5). Deduction for the geometry remaining more metaphorical ornament than a mechanical constraint with failure stakes (−0.6), and slight late emphasis (the "literal map" reveal at line 189 feels like a tell rather than a demonstrated discovery, −0.3). Upper 5s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The Scientific Poetry Library frames the story and provides the Contemplation Nook (line 86) as the site of the key action. Specific details ("Calculus of Longing," "Photosynthetic Haikus," hyperbolic crochet model, green lamp) create vivid atmosphere and support the observed-solitude tone. Three gates: setup (lines 1–35), middle (nook as action site, line 86), closure (Elara locks the door and carries the library within, lines 235–251). Early signal (+0.7), two beats (entry to nook, closing ritual, +0.9), moderate setting pressure (the nook enables privacy for the method, +0.6), closure linkage (the library is internalized, reweighting its role, +0.8). Deduction for the library being more stage than active constraint—no resource scarcity, access issue, or patron interruption forces a hard choice (−0.7). Lands in low-to-mid 6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"While patrons browse" is mentioned at lines 19, 86, 211, 217, establishing a quiet, low-urgency frame. The timeframe does not tighten decisions or create a live clock; patrons depart at closing (line 211) without interrupting or complicating Elara's work. Two gates: setup (line 19) and closure bracket (lines 211, 217). The element provides context but is functionally inert. Early signal (+0.4), closure mention (+0.3), no causal pressure (−0.5), no beat involvement (−0.5), highly swappable (any quiet period would serve, −0.6). Low-to-mid 4s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara's desire "to locate the tangible place where stories truly live" (lines 61, 70) drives her method (hyperbolic geometry, scarf alignment) and is resolved at closure when she recognizes the answer is internal and relational (lines 208, 251, 259). Three gates: setup (line 61), middle dramatization (lines 92–114, the scarf-alignment beat enacts the search), closure (lines 208, 251). Early signal (+0.7), three beats (stated motivation, alignment action, final realization, +1.4), strong causal pressure (the question shapes every tactic, +1.4), closure linkage (+1.4), moderate cost (the shift from external to internal forecloses the tangible-place search, +0.4). Minor deduction for the motivation being told more than shown in friction or competing want (−0.6), and the final answer feeling cerebral rather than viscerally costly (−0.4). Solid 7s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Observed solitude" is established early ("quiet ballet," "reverent solitude," lines 19, 86) and modulates through the memory immersion (intimate, lines 128–176) before returning in the final frame ("observed solitude was now filled with profound companionship," line 229). The tone charges the closure image by reconfiguring loneliness as connection. Three gates: setup (lines 19, 29), middle (the Contemplation Nook's "warm pool of light" and introspective focus, line 86), closure (lines 229, 242). Early signal (+0.7), three beats (library atmosphere, nook privacy, final walk, +1.4), strong closure linkage (the tone shift from solitude to companionship is the emotional closure, +1.5), coherence under pressure (+0.5). Minor deduction for "observed solitude" being slightly label-only in line 229 rather than fully embodied (−0.4), and the phrasing "vibrant presence" tilting toward abstraction (−0.3). Upper 7s.</comment>
