<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's core choice lands with clear motivation—preservation versus revelation—and her conflict is embodied through physical action (transmitting the letter). However, interiority leans toward overwritten abstraction: "bravely conflicted," "redemption—to provoke an unspoken conversation," and "conscience roared louder" read as imposed labels rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice feels determined by the prompt rather than earned through on-page struggle; Kael's arrival accelerates the clock but doesn't deepen the trade-off or force a harder renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Situational (pressure crystallizes stance under the constraint of discovery). Closure is Charged Poise—Elara transmits, lies to Kael, and the final image reconfigures her role from passive keeper to active catalyst with conceptual cost ("no longer merely a keeper of frozen pasts"). Orientation anchors quickly (archivist, cryogenic library, solstice watch). The cost is conceptual and relational (lying to Kael, weaponizing truth) rather than physically dramatized, and the reversal (Kael's footsteps) arrives conveniently to force the act rather than through prior causality. One meaningful tightening present; closure lands under the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glacial library is vividly realized with selective, purposeful detail: "blue-tinged corridors," "ice shelves," "crystalline filaments pulsing with latent energy." The hidden panel and dormant networks constrain her method and charge the climax. Spatial choreography is clean (oldest wing → cartography → panel seam). The snow above operates as conceptual pressure more than physical constraint, but the micro-setting (panel, slate, filaments) shapes the decisive action and the ending image of "snow-locked stillness" anchors the transformation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: truth versus complicity. One clear tightening: Kael's footsteps force the transmission. However, the reversal feels coincidental rather than driven by Elara's prior choices, and the cost is abstract ("no longer merely a keeper") rather than a visible forfeiture. "Bravely conflicted" is asserted but the on-page moment compresses decision into a single thumb-press without layering want versus fear. The ending reconfigures her stance with conceptual weight, but the physical act (transmit, seal panel, lie) happens too smoothly without tactical struggle or visible price paid in the moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—truth versus institutional silence—emerges from concrete action (transmitting the letter) and the final image ("no longer a tomb of secrets, but a cradle for a difficult dawn") reweights the library's symbolic function without overt moralizing. The letter's content (Harbor Fire, framed rival) grounds the theme in specific historical corruption. However, phrases like "to provoke an unspoken conversation" and "weaponized truth" drift toward thesis-statement language, and "contraband truths" recurs as a prompt label rather than evolving through image. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer (catalyst for thaw) rooted in prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Distance is consistent, but diction elevates into abstraction at key beats: "the human imperative to shatter a silence," "the fragile thread of hope," "the profound, dizzying quiet." These phrases read as imposed literary register rather than Elara's perceptual signature under stress. Dialogue with Kael is functional and voice-distinct ("Sensors detected activity. Report" versus Elara's calm deflection). The prose modulates with urgency (short bursts when Kael arrives) but loses specificity in reflective stretches. Free indirect style is clean; no filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sentence openings show range, but figurative density inflates the opening and reflective beats: "cathedral of frozen memory," "the dangerous liaison letter," "contraband truths in its purest, most corrosive form." These stack without pattern-teaching or payoff. Paraphrase loops present: "bravely conflicted, torn between" restates the same tension without adding pressure. Template cadence in the middle third: "Her motivation was not rebellion, but redemption—to provoke…" and "Her method was born of years…" open consecutive moves with parallel exposition. Clarity remains high and no mixed metaphors, but density and scaffold slow momentum before the climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The cryogenic archive under snow is a fresh synthesis of library-as-tomb and glacial preservation, and the dormant networks offer a specific, non-obvious method. However, the core plot—archivist discovers hidden document, must decide whether to expose—is a widely used template, and the moral calculus (bury versus release) resolves predictably toward revelation without a harder counter-pressure or surprising renunciation. The letter's content (chancellor's confession, harbor fire) adds historical specificity, but the emotional arc (conflicted → transmit → transformed) follows the expected path. Transformation is present but modest; the frame feels inevitably aimed at the prompt rather than organically discovered.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara appears in setup, drives the transmission choice in the middle, and anchors the final image. Her decision (transmit) creates the key reversal and her lie to Kael closes the scene. The role (cryogenic archivist) supplies method (access to dormant networks) and motive (sacred duty versus human imperative). Cost is conceptual (lying, crossing the Board) rather than physically dramatized, but her agency is clear and on-page across three beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The letter is discovered early (setup), handled when Elara scans it (middle), and its transmission is the climactic act (ending). It returns with reweighted meaning: from historical artifact to "weaponized truth." The letter's specific content (Chancellor Valerius, Harbor Fire, Theron) grounds its stakes. Removing this exact letter would break the story's logic and closure. High integration; slight swappability (any hidden document of comparable weight could function similarly with edits).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Contraband truths" is named repeatedly and shapes the dominant stake (preserve versus release). It constrains Elara's choice (protocol versus conscience) and the ending explicitly reconfigures her role around it ("catalyst for thaw"). However, the concept is asserted more than dramatized—it functions as a thematic label rather than a live tactical problem with specific mechanics or visible cost tied to the "contraband" quality itself. The letter's content does the causal work; "contraband truths" colors it without altering the decision tree.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Bravely conflicted" appears as a label in exposition ("she was bravely conflicted, torn between") but is not enacted through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice (transmit) happens quickly once Kael arrives, without visible on-page wrestling or a dramatized cost tied to the conflict itself. The trait is present and thematically consistent, but it does not constrain the climactic action or shape tactics; the footsteps do.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Scandalize" is the story's declared goal and payoff: "By dawn, the dangerous liaison letter would scandalize the city." The transmission is the major turn and redefines Elara's role. However, the scandal itself occurs off-page; we see only the act of sending and her anticipation. The action is irreplaceable (the climax), but the emotional and social cost of the scandal are asserted rather than witnessed. Strong integration; not indispensable because the ending leans on Elara's internal transformation rather than the city's reaction.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dormant networks are seeded early ("the forgotten bones," "ghost river of fiber-optic threads she had secretly restored"), shape her method (bypassing censors), and enable the climactic transmission. The mechanics matter: "connecting her slate," "crystalline filaments pulsing," "packet's launch." Removing this exact method would break the story's tactical logic; the networks are irreplaceable. The element appears in setup, middle (she navigates to the panel), and climax (transmission). High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The library is present throughout (setup, all beats, ending) and constrains Elara's tactics: she must navigate to the oldest wing, find the hidden panel, and avoid detection. The "ice shelves," "false panel," and "fractured slate" supply tactile resources. Kael's arrival is cued by sensor activity, grounding his appearance in the setting's logic. The ending image ("snow-locked stillness," "echoing silence") charges the final reconfiguration. The setting is essential to method and tone; strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Within the blink that follows surprise" is named once in the middle third when Kael arrives, and the compression ("Time fractured, stretching the moment into an agonizing eternity") narrows the decision window. However, the timeframe is not tracked before or after this beat, and the "blink" does not alter tactics or escalate cost—Elara completes the transmission, seals the panel, and deflects Kael with ease. The element is ornamental; a longer or vaguer window would not change the outcome.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To provoke an unspoken conversation" is stated explicitly in exposition and restated in the ending ("to force Aethelburg to confront the blood on its founding stones"). The motivation drives the transmission, but it is told rather than dramatized through friction between wants and costs. Elara's internal conflict (archivist duty versus conscience) is present, but the "unspoken conversation" functions as thematic overlay rather than a live, embodied desire that shapes micro-choices under pressure. Present in setup and ending; weak middle development.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Dizzying quiet" recurs across the story ("the dizzying quiet of the library," "the profound, dizzying quiet") and modulates with pressure: oppressive silence gives way to "a soft chime" and then Kael's "heavy and deliberate" footsteps. The tone charges the final image ("snow-locked stillness") and reflects Elara's transformation. However, the phrase is repeated identically without evolving meaning, and the tone is asserted ("usually a balm, now amplified the frantic rhythm") rather than built through rhythmic control. Coherent but static; the reprise adds modest weight.</comment>
