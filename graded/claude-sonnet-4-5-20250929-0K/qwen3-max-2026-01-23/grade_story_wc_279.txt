<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clearly personal ("to discover meaning in the mess of her own recent unraveling"), and her socially perceptive gift is shown through concrete actions (sensing "the brittle crack of a surrendered grudge"). Internal experience differs from external behavior through embodied perception rather than diagnostic labels. However, the final shift to "quiet joy" and understanding feels slightly telescoped—the emotional progression from unease to resolution lacks sufficient contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the closure beat, and the epiphany ("not erasure, but alchemy") edges toward stated wisdom rather than fully earned bodily realization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly within the opening lines. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through the mandala's construction, whispers soften toward the emergent hush, and the anxious "What remains?" thread provides a micro-turn before the integrative closure word. The Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) is visible—Elara's spoken "Integrate" deepens the hush and reweights the stake with felt cost (the mandala will blur, but understanding persists). One meaningful tightening occurs when the new anxious whisper threatens fragile peace, forcing Elara's interjection. Cost is legible in the impermanence lesson and the transformation of her internal state, though the conceptual cost could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The grotto's parabolic walls, moss, lilac mist, and sand floor are introduced early and pressure choices throughout: the tile flake's discovery, the sand mandala's placement in "cool sand at the grotto's heart," and the mist's eventual blurring of the design. Sensory detail (wet stone, fading violets, cool shard) is vivid and filtered through Elara's artist perception. The mandala itself functions as micro-setting—its expanding symmetry draws whispers "like iron filings to a gentle magnet," constraining her method and charging the closure image. Spatial choreography remains coherent (kneeling, leaning toward the mandala, rising, stepping out).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering meaning in emotional chaos—is signaled early and deepens through the mandala's construction. The tile flake whisper ("The weight is gone") provides one tightening that narrows her resolve to interject. The anxious "What remains?" whisper is a clear reversal that threatens the fragile peace, forcing Elara's decisive word "Integrate" and deepening the hush with "gentle authority." Agency is visible in her choice to speak rather than remain silent. However, the escalation relies more on atmospheric accumulation than a sharp trade-off or visible price paid in the moment—her action succeeds without clear cost beyond the impermanence lesson, which feels thematic rather than immediately felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the mandala's creation: unlearning as alchemy, chaos holding sacred geometry, compassion as the lens for pattern. The central question—how to find meaning in emotional mess—receives a non-literal answer through the mandala's integrative geometry and the spoken word that weaves anxiety into wholeness. The piece resists overt moralizing until "Chaos held its own sacred geometry, and compassion was the lens that made the pattern visible," which edges toward thematic statement but remains grounded in the prior mandala work. The impermanence lesson and the final threshold image offer resonance without a stated moral. Subtext operates in the whispers' transformation and the tile flake's pulsing gratitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering all perception through Elara's socially perceptive artist lens. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("interject into the grotto's monologue of letting go, not with noise, but with sacred geometry"). Distance modulates purposefully—tighter during the tile discovery, more reflective during the mandala's construction. No head-hopping or POV leakage. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture with controlled rhythm ("not erasure, but alchemy, turning the lead of pain into the gold of wisdom"). One minor slip: "soft sensory unease that clung to the skin like a half-remembered sorrow" in paragraph three reads slightly detached from Elara's immediate embodied experience, though it recovers quickly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and opening variety is strong. Information density is high—most lines advance atmosphere, image, or internal shift. However, several lines carry overwriting that blurs immediacy: "parabolic stone walls sheathed in moss that drank the perpetual lilac-tinted mist—the very atmosphere of the unlearning" stacks modifiers and meta-commentary; "the lead of pain into the gold of wisdom" is a stock metaphor. The phrase "the emergent hush began—not as an absence, but as a presence blooming from the mandala's core" uses a template negation structure ("not X, but Y") common in AI-generated prose. Minor paraphrase loop: paragraphs on the mandala's effect repeat the idea that whispers are honored/woven without advancing new pressure. These artifacts do not touch the closure beat but accumulate to −0.7 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The combination of whispering grotto, sand mandala, and "emergent hush" offers a fresh synthesis, and the interjection via sacred geometry rather than verbal argument is non-obvious. The socially perceptive artist framing and the specific sand colors (lilac for compassion, charcoal for sorrow, ochre for wisdom, pearl for hope) provide concrete particulars. However, the core arc—artist processes grief through creative ritual and achieves understanding—is a familiar template. The transformation relies on lyric specificity (the mandala's patterns, the tile flake's warmth) rather than a bold structural or perspectival risk. The anxious whisper and the word "Integrate" provide a fresh inflection, but the ending's thematic clarity ("the beauty of the mess") edges toward articulated insight rather than image-driven surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara is present from the opening line and drives all key turns: discovering the tile, building the mandala, and speaking "Integrate" to answer the anxious whisper. Her chalk sketch (paragraph one) and her rising/stepping out (final paragraphs) frame the piece, and her artist identity shapes the mandala method. However, the "whimsical" aspect (the badger sketch) is ornamental and does not constrain choices or return with reweighted meaning. The core choice—to interject via sacred geometry—could function with a different artist archetype. Early signal +0.6, three beats (sketch, mandala, departure) +1.4, causal pressure (mandala as tactic) +0.9, closure linkage (departing with understanding) +0.9, but swappability −0.5 and the "whimsical" detail unused −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tile flake appears in paragraph six, prompts the whisper "The weight is gone" that crystallizes Elara's resolve, grows warm and pulses with gratitude in paragraph seventeen, and is pocketed as a token in the penultimate paragraph. Three distinct beats (discovery, gratitude pulse, token) +1.4, causal pressure (crystallizes resolve to interject) +0.9, closure linkage (carried out as embodied reminder) +0.9, specificity (iridescent ceramic, warmth, light pulse) +0.5. Late first appearance (40% mark) −0.3, and the token function in the ending is more lyric reprise than active choice-shaper −0.2. Total ~8.2, rounded down to 7.1 per band guidance and the dominant limiter of late arrival.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The emergent hush is seeded in the title "emergent hush" and becomes the dominant stake: Elara seeks to understand the grotto's whispers, and the hush blooms from the mandala's core in paragraph fourteen, absorbs whispers without erasure, and deepens when Elara speaks "Integrate." It shapes tactics (the mandala as method to invoke hush) and the final image (carrying the deep quiet within). Early signal (seeded by ~30%) +0.6, three beats (hush blooms, absorbs whispers, deepens with word) +1.4, causal pressure (mandala invokes hush, word stabilizes it) +1.2, closure linkage (hush as carried understanding) +1.4, specificity (hush as presence, not absence) +0.6. No significant frictions. Total ~5.2 base + 5.2 positives = strong high-7 band, rounded to 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara's socially perceptive gift is introduced in paragraph four ("she felt their emotional textures—the brittle crack of a surrendered grudge") and guides every mandala placement in paragraph eleven ("Her socially perceptive gift guided every placement"). It constrains her method (sensing emotional currents to translate into form) and enables the mandala's success. Early signal +0.6, two beats (sensing whispers, guiding placement) +0.9, causal pressure (perception enables tactic) +1.0, closure linkage (perception yields understanding) +0.9. However, the trait is labeled rather than dramatized through micro-choices with visible cost in peak moments—she does not misread a whisper or face a trade-off from over-perception. Label-only in key beats −0.4, swappability (could be "empathic artist" with minor edits) −0.5. Total ~6.5, rounded to 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Interject" is introduced as Elara's goal in paragraph seven ("she would interject into the grotto's monologue of letting go"), enacted when the anxious whisper threatens in paragraph nineteen ("This was the critical moment to interject"), and fulfilled when she speaks "Integrate" in paragraph twenty. The action redefines the grotto's chaotic release into stable sanctuary. Early signal +0.7, three beats (resolve, critical moment, spoken word) +1.4, causal pressure (word deepens hush, weaves anxiety into whole) +1.3, closure linkage (interjection stabilizes the peace) +1.2, specificity (spoken word as interjectory act) +0.6. Minor swappability: "respond" or "engage" could replace with edits −0.4. Total ~4.8 + positives, high-7 band, rounded to 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sand mandala method is signaled in paragraph nine ("she began a sand mandala, her chosen method"), detailed across paragraphs ten–thirteen (sands dyed lilac/grey/ochre/pearl, concentric circles, spirals, diamonds, blue/gold grains), and its mechanics matter: the mandala's symmetry draws whispers, honors their stories, and invokes the emergent hush. The mandala's eventual blurring teaches impermanence. Early signal +0.7, four beats (begin, pour, add grains, blur) +1.4, causal pressure (mandala invokes hush, alters grotto energy) +1.4, closure linkage (blurring lesson, understanding woven into being) +1.3, specificity (color meanings, pattern types) +0.7. No significant frictions. Total ~5.5 + positives, strong 8-band, rounded to 8.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The whispering grotto in mist is anchored in the opening lines, sustained throughout (parabolic walls, moss, lilac mist, cool sand), and pressures choices: the tile discovery, the mandala's placement, the whispers' textures, and the mist's blurring of the design. The grotto's acoustics and atmosphere enable the entire conflict and closure. Early signal +0.8, four beats (entry, tile discovery, mandala site, blurring, departure) +1.4, causal pressure (grotto whispers create the stake, mist alters mandala) +1.4, closure linkage (stepping out with understanding) +1.1, specificity (parabolic walls, lilac mist, emerald moss) +0.7. No frictions. Total ~5.4 + positives, strong high-7/low-8 band, rounded to 7.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"During the unlearning" frames the entire piece as occurring within a defined temporal/processual window. The unlearning is mentioned in paragraph two ("the very atmosphere of the unlearning"), paragraph eighteen ("Elara understood the unlearning: it was not erasure, but alchemy"), and the final paragraph ("The unlearning was not an end, but a threshold"). It shapes the grotto's atmosphere and Elara's interpretive lens, but does not tighten decisions with a live clock or tracked duration. Early signal +0.6, three mentions (atmosphere, understanding, threshold) +1.4, thematic/conceptual pressure (frames the grotto's purpose) +0.7, closure linkage (threshold image) +0.8. However, the timeframe is static and descriptive rather than constraining tactics; no urgency or deadline −0.6. Total ~3.0 + 3.5 positives − 0.6 = mid-5 band, rounded to 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—to discover meaning in the mess—is dramatized in paragraph five and drives her mandala creation across paragraphs nine–thirteen. The motivation is tested when the anxious "What remains?" whisper threatens her fragile peace, forcing her to speak "Integrate." Friction between wanting understanding and the cost of impermanence is visible in the blurring mandala lesson. Early signal +0.7, three beats (stated, enacted via mandala, tested by anxious whisper) +1.4, causal pressure (motivation drives tactic choice) +1.2, closure linkage (understanding achieved, mess accepted) +1.2, cost connection (impermanence accepted) +0.5. Minor label-only slip: "to discover meaning in the mess" is stated rather than fully shown through contradictory wants −0.3. Total ~5.0 + 5.0 − 0.3, mid-to-high-7 band, rounded to 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Lilac unease" is introduced in paragraph three ("soft sensory unease"), sustained through "lilac-tinted mist" and "lilac-scented air," modulates when Elara feels "quiet joy, warm and steady, replaced the lilac unease in Elara's chest" (paragraph twenty-one), and charges the final departure with "deep quiet within her like a secret compass." The tone shifts from unease to peace as pressure resolves. Early signal +0.6, three beats (mist, scent, replacement by joy) +1.4, modulation with pressure (unease → joy at closure) +0.9, closure linkage (deep quiet carried forward) +1.0. However, "lilac unease" as a phrase is slightly ornamental—the unease is tied to the mist's sensory texture more than a distinct tonal register that constrains voice or perception −0.4. Total ~3.0 + 3.9 − 0.4, high-6 band, rounded to 6.9.</comment>
