<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (restore lost faith) is clear and her actions follow logically, but her interior life relies heavily on elevated abstractions ("the weight of interrupted journeys," "cautious enchantment") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final transformation from exile to willing participant reads as asserted through repeated metaphors rather than earned through a specific on-page cost that forecloses a prior path. Embodied emotion is sparse; the tear at noon is the sole physical marker in a narrative dominated by lyric summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered images (roots/bones, sundial fragments, shadow alignment) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration at noon when the shadow touches the tomb door. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first 120 words. The closure—Elara's acceptance and her decision to tend the orchard—lands on the page with felt cost (exile transformed into return, broken ritual made whole), though the cost is more asserted through metaphor than dramatized through a specific forfeited option.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vividly rendered with specific, purposeful detail: roots cradling bones, moss-covered epitaphs, apple blossoms mixing with damp earth. The setting directly constrains Elara's choices—she selects a branch from a sapling "growing defiantly near the tomb" and uses moss on the oldest stone for alignment. The sundial base and the tomb threshold function as micro-setting that charges the final image when the shadow completes its journey.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring lost faith through ritual reconnection—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Elara discovers the sundial base and commits to rebuilding its function. The noon alignment provides a clear pressure point where her action (placing the new gnomon) narrows options and transforms her exile into willing participation. However, the escalation operates primarily through accumulative metaphor rather than a trade-off with visible cost; no live option is foreclosed on the page, only reframed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (interrupted journeys, continuity, faith as conscious choice) emerges organically from concrete particulars: the sundial's broken function, roots weaving through bones, the exile's return. The final image—"living shadow" as a "quiet promise"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The piece avoids overt thesis statements, instead allowing the sundial's restoration and the orchard's embrace to carry thematic weight. Minor deduction for the final two paragraphs, which lean toward summary ("her journey was no longer interrupted") rather than leaving the resonance implicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent lyric register with purposeful compression and elevated diction ("gossamer," "loamy," "woven into the orchard's eternal breath"). POV distance is stable throughout, and the perceptual signature—filtering the orchard through metaphors of reunion and continuity—is character-specific. However, the diction often drifts into abstract territory ("cautious enchantment," "interrupted journeys") that feels more authorial than rooted in Elara's immediate sensory experience under pressure, and the repeated stems ("she learned," "she gathered," "she would") create a template cadence in the final third.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prose is generally clear and rhythmically controlled, with strong image-making ("roots cradling bones like tender guardians," "the veil between worlds thin to gossamer"). However, multiple text artifacts accumulate: paraphrase loops ("interrupted journeys" appears four times with minimal reweighting), repeated sentence stems ("Each scoop... each uncovered..."; "She learned... Wandering taught..."), and elevated metaphors cluster densely in high-pressure beats without breathing room. The final two paragraphs summarize rather than dramatize, and stock phrases ("coming home," "eternal breath") dull closure momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard premise is visually striking and the synthesis of diaspora return + ritual archaeology + living memorial offers a fresh angle. The transformation of the sundial from absence to living shadow provides a non-obvious resolution. However, the emotional arc—exile seeking reconnection through ancestral ritual—follows a familiar template, and the piece does not fully transform it through unexpected moral calculus or a risky structural choice. The lyric mode is executed competently but safely; no bold gamble heightens stakes beyond the expected trajectory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara (diaspora returnee) drives all key turns: she accepts the excavation charge, discovers the sundial base, decides to rebuild it, and commits to tending the orchard. Her choices alter tactics (from excavation to restoration) and the final image hinges on her decision to stay and teach. Present from the opening, involved in at least three distinct beats, and causally active at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sundial base is discovered in beat three, handled physically (brushing away soil, aligning the gnomon), and its restored function produces the noon shadow that charges the closure. It appears in at least three beats (discovery, shaping the gnomon, the alignment), and the story's logic would collapse without it. The object's properties (carved hour lines, empty socket) matter specifically. Minor deduction for late first appearance (after the 30% mark).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Interrupted journeys shapes stakes throughout: Elara's exile, her grandmother's unfinished songs, the broken sundial ritual. The concept constrains her method (she must restore continuity) and the closure explicitly reframes her journey as "no longer interrupted, but woven." It appears in the opening, recurs in the sundial discovery, and is reweighted at the ending. Strong integration, though the final paragraphs lean toward overt articulation rather than letting the image carry the work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Warmly curious is mentioned once ("With warmly curious eyes") and her wandering behavior (tracing root-laced paths, letting curiosity guide her) illustrates the trait. However, the trait does not constrain a choice with visible cost; her curiosity enables discovery but never conflicts with another impulse. Functional but not indispensable; removing "warmly curious" would not break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rebuild drives the second half: Elara shifts from excavation to restoration, selects a branch, shapes it into a gnomon, and aligns it. The action produces the noon shadow that completes the ritual and charges the closure. Present in at least three beats, causally linked to the ending, and swapping it (e.g., for "repair" or "honor") would require structural changes. Strong integration with one meaningful cost (she commits her future to tending).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Purposeful wandering is named and illustrated: Elara traces root-laced paths during rest, lets curiosity guide her, and learns the orchard's language through movement. The method enables her discovery of the sundial's meaning and informs her final stance. Present in the middle third and paid off at closure ("rebuilt through purposeful wandering"). However, the mechanics are more thematic than tactical; removing the label would not collapse the plot.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is present from the opening line, supplies concrete resources (moss for alignment, a sapling branch for the gnomon, the sundial base itself), and its spatial logic (roots weaving through bones, tomb entrance alignment) directly shapes Elara's restoration method. The setting charges the final image (blossoms reaching for sky, roots honoring earth). Indispensable to closure and involved in every major beat.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe (across excavating a tomb) is signaled early and structured in beats: "Each scoop," "On the third morning," "As noon approached." The three-day span tightens Elara's method and the noon deadline creates urgency for the sundial alignment. However, the time pressure is more ritualistic than tactical; the story does not dramatize what would be lost if noon passed without alignment. Functional but not deeply integrated into escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>To restore lost faith is stated in paragraph four and dramatized through Elara's choices: she accepts the charge, excavates with "whispered apology," rebuilds the sundial, and feels faith "reborn not as blind certainty, but as conscious choice." The motivation drives every beat and is reweighted at closure. Minor deduction for overt articulation in the final paragraphs ("Her lost faith was not found waiting, but rebuilt") rather than trusting the image alone.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Cautious enchantment is named early ("a cautious enchantment that softened the sharp edges of her doubt") and modulates with pressure: the orchard "hummed," the land "held its breath," the veil thinned to "gossamer." The tone charges the noon alignment and the final acceptance. Coherent throughout and integrated into the closure image. Minor deduction for relying on the label itself rather than pure tonal execution in description and rhythm.</comment>
