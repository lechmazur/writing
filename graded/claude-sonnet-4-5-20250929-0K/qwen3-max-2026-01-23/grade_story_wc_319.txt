<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The guardian's interior life is rendered through concrete, embodied detail—ink-stained claws, pendant clutched against sternum—and the motivational arc from desperate hope to conscious purpose reads as earned. The climactic choice to release the pendant carries visible cost and contradictory impulses (the sob, the magnetic desperation versus the stillness). However, the interiority occasionally tilts toward therapeutic self-diagnosis ("make friends with uncertainty," "befriend the unknown path") that no one formulates mid-crisis, and the final paragraphs summarize the emotional resolution rather than dramatizing it through micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early; the piece establishes a situational lens where pressure accumulates through the rift's appearance and the guardian's vigil. Closure lands on-page as Earned Stasis—the guardian releases the pendant and refuses the return—with felt cost (the ache transformed, the path foreclosed). The cost is legible in "consciously loosened its grip" and "reject the deep friendship forged," though the final two paragraphs abstract the outcome rather than leaving the image to resonate, slightly diluting the charge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The frozen garden is rendered with specific, purposeful detail—frost-ferns, ice-sheathed willows, skeletal branches—that charges the guardian's interiority and the practice of interiorizing exteriors. The pendant and the rift's golden light supply micro-setting pressure that constrains the climactic choice. Spatial choreography (mist recoils, vertical rift, pendant at sternum) remains clear throughout, and the sensory hierarchy reflects the guardian's professional focus on light and boundaries.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to cross the threshold and end exile—is signaled early and tightens when the rift opens. The guardian's agency manifests in the choice to release the pendant, foreclosing the return with on-page cost (the friendship betrayed, the vigil abandoned). Escalation is driven by protagonist choice under the situational lens, and the price is visible in the gesture and the interiority. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, though the extended post-choice reflection risks diluting the peak pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the particular practice of interiorizing exteriors and the tension between home and exile, crystallizing in the choice to honor uncertainty over certainty. The final image of the guardian settling against the oak, "exactly where it was meant to be," offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without overt moralizing. The pendant's transformation from key to token of commitment charges the closure. Minor deduction for the penultimate paragraph's thematic summary ("true guardianship was not defending physical walls but tending the delicate, sacred space") that explicates rather than trusts the dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature—"sharp as tearing vellum," "like the gentle closing of a cherished book"—that reflects the library guardian's idiom. Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the climax. However, elevated diction occasionally drifts into exposition ("the very boundaries of light the guardian observed with reverent attention," "a liminal state where time dissolved") that feels more authorial than character-bound, and the final paragraphs' declarative certainty ("It understood true guardianship") flattens the earned ambiguity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sentence-level imagery is vivid and purposeful ("mist curled like smoke from a dying candle," "a sob catch in its throat sharp as tearing vellum"), and rhythm varies naturally. Information density is high in the opening third. However, the piece exhibits paraphrase loops in the final quarter: "The ache of dimensional homesickness remained but had transformed" is immediately restated as "no longer a key to escape but a token of commitment," and the closing three paragraphs recycle the core insight with synonym churn ("tending the delicate, sacred space," "willing, compassionate companion to the unknown," "exactly where it was meant to be"). Apply −0.6 for template cadence and redundancy touching the closure zone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise—a guardian exiled from an infinite library dimension practicing meditative attunement in a frozen garden—offers a fresh synthesis of fantasy exile and contemplative discipline. The choice to refuse return transforms the exile-and-homecoming trope through the specific practice of interiorizing exteriors. However, the emotional arc (exile → longing → acceptance → peace) follows a familiar template, and the final paragraphs retreat into abstraction ("the beautiful unfolding mystery of simply being present") rather than sustaining the particularity of the opening.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The feral library guardian is present throughout, frames the opening, drives the middle choice (to study the frost-fern, to clutch the pendant), and executes the climactic decision to release the pendant. The character's agency forecloses the return with visible cost. All three gates satisfied; strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cultist's pendant appears in the opening ("clutched perpetually against its sternum"), is handled at the climax ("clawed hand tightening," "consciously loosened its grip"), and is reweighted in the denouement ("no longer a key to escape but a token of commitment"). Three distinct beats; causal role in the climactic choice; charged reprise. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The boundaries of light are signaled early ("ephemeral borders where illumination met shadow") and manifested in the rift ("vertical rift of pure golden light—a perfect manifestation of the boundaries of light"). The concept shapes the guardian's observation practice and charges the climactic moment. Present in setup, middle reflection, and closure participation, but the tactical constraint is light—the concept remains more thematic than action-driving.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dimensional homesickness is introduced early ("profound dimensional homesickness echoed in its chest"), drives the visceral reaction to the rift ("every fiber screamed to leap forward"), and shapes the cost of refusal ("The ache of dimensional homesickness remained but had transformed"). The attribute constrains the climactic choice with visible emotional cost. All three gates; strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Wait" is the guardian's crystallized action ("Its entire existence had crystallized into a single, sustained action: to wait"), structures the vigil, and defines the choice to remain ("It would wait again tomorrow"). The action is indispensable—removing "wait" would collapse the story's central stance and closure logic. All three gates; high irreplaceability; closure-essential.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interiorizing exteriors is introduced early ("the sacred method of interiorizing exteriors"), demonstrated in the daily practice ("each dawn, it selected a single frost-fern"), and recalled at the climax ("the frozen rose studied that morning, how ice crystals fractured dawn light into rainbows—a beauty interiorized into its soul"). Present across three beats; shapes the guardian's motivation and charges the refusal. Solid integration, though the mechanics could press harder on tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The frozen garden in mist is established in the opening, supplies the objects of study (frost-fern, ice-sheathed willows, skeletal branch), and frames the final image ("settling against the ice-sheathed trunk of an ancient oak"). The setting constrains the guardian's practice and charges the closure choice—to embrace the garden over the library. All three gates; meaningful pressure on the final stance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Through the veil of sleep" appears as descriptor of the vigil's liminal state ("an active, breathing meditation conducted through the veil of sleep") and recurs in the final beat ("Through the veil of sleep, it felt profound connection"). Present in setup and closure, but the timeframe remains abstract—it does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. Lyric reprise without tactical constraint; mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To make friends with uncertainty" is introduced as evolved motivation ("to make friends with uncertainty, to befriend the unknown path"), tested when the rift offers certain return, and affirmed in the choice to release the pendant ("choosing the beautiful uncertainty of the garden over the certain comfort"). The motivation is dramatized through the conflicted reaction and the visible cost of refusal. All three gates; strong friction and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Foggy lucidity" is signaled in the final third ("a foggy lucidity that felt like deepest truth") and aligns with the piece's dreamlike, contemplative register. The tone is coherent and modulates subtly at the climax (from yearning to stillness). However, it arrives late and functions more as label than shaping force—the tone does not constrain earlier choices. Closure participation weak; lyric consistency moderate.</comment>
