<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation shifts from escape to "purpose in the pauses" to transformation, but the contradictory impulses never act simultaneously in scene—they alternate as clean epiphanies. The ledger decision arrives through declarative realization ("She would not destroy... She would transform") rather than micro-choices under pressure. Embodied emotion appears in "bruised back," "scraped raw," but interiority leans heavily on elevated abstractions ("drifting resonance," "annealed") that flatten particularity. The final stance feels authored rather than earned through visible struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land by the second paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (decision to encase rather than destroy), but the cost is asserted conceptually—no on-page forfeit, social price, or tactical narrowing dramatized in the canyon scene itself. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (frost → memory → resolution), yet the final transformation is told as intention rather than shown as a constraining act. One tightening occurs (from flight to decision), meeting minimal length requirements, but visible cost at closure remains absent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The canyon and frost patterns constrain the reflection beat and charge the final image through their "delicate cartography." Sensory detail is selective (cold sandstone, smoke taste, violet dawn, frost filaments) and filtered through crisis urgency. Spatial choreography is clean within the single location. The recurring frost motif links early signal to closure, though the body and ledger strip function more actively as micro-setting than the canyon itself in forcing choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake (survival/meaning from the ledger) is signaled early. One tightening occurs when Elara moves from holding the ledger to deciding its future use, but no on-page cost accompanies the choice—no social risk, tactical loss, or immediate consequence dramatized. The frost offers method, not opposition. Agency at closure is declaration of intent, not a decision that forecloses a live path with felt price. No reversal or escalation tests her commitment under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme (resilience through adaptation, light through ash) emerges from frost/glass/charcoal motifs and accumulates across the reflection. The final image of encasing the ledger within glass offers a non-literal answer, yet the thematic payoff is stated overtly: "purpose was not in the grand gesture, but in the intentional pause where clarity is forged." The ledger's symbolic journey is clear, but the ending moralizes rather than letting the image resonate without summary. Subtext is sparse; most meaning is declared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable. Psychic distance is controlled, but diction drifts into elevated register ("annealed," "drifting resonance," "luminous testament") incongruent with a character in acute physical distress. Voice texture is ornate and uniform across beats, lacking modulation under pressure. Filter verbs appear but are not intrusive. The prose reads more like authorial narration than Elara's perceptual signature. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "scorched testament" recurs five times without functional variation; "drifting resonance" appears thrice as decorative refrain. Template cadence dominates the final third: "She would not destroy... She would transform... She would encase... She would build... She would dedicate." Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching: "canyon's deep silence," "vessel of transformed truth," "gentle beacon." Stock metaphors ("stars that held their breath," "spirit annealed") dull closure. Artifacts touch the ending, triggering the disallow-9+ cap globally and −1.2 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The premise (artist fleeing violence, discovering purpose in trauma) follows a familiar template without fresh inflection. Frost-as-memory-trigger and glass-as-transformation metaphors are legible but well-worn. The ledger's shift from evidence to art object is conceptually tidy, lacking the friction or ambiguity that would complicate the arc. Specificity (charcoal smuggler, glass orb commission) adds texture but does not transform the underlying structure. Proximity check: "spirit annealed" echoes craft-memoir idiom without distinct voice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and makes the final transformation decision, meeting setup, development, and payoff gates. However, her choices (holding the ledger, recalling Kael, deciding to encase) are contemplative rather than tactically constraining. The final decision to transform rather than destroy shifts her stance but occurs as declaration, not a choice under live opposition that narrows options with visible cost. Two gates plus closure participation allow mid-band, but causal pressure and irreplaceability are modest.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ledger strip appears in beat one (pressed into her palm by Kael), beat two (grabbed during flight), and the ending (decision to encase). It meets all three gates and drives the final transformation. However, its physical handling is summarized in retrospect; on-page interaction is limited to "holding" and conceptual reweighting. Swappability is low (the charcoal/smuggling link matters), but causal pressure is mild—it does not narrow her tactical options in the canyon scene, only her thematic stance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Scorched testament" frames the ledger's symbolic weight but remains a thematic label rather than a stake-shaping force. It is mentioned four times, always as descriptive flourish, never as a tactical constraint or choice-driver. The concept echoes at closure (encase to "honor" scars), but this is told philosophy, not dramatized cost. Setup and payoff gates are met; middle development is absent. The phrase could be replaced with "burned evidence" without altering plot logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Steadily adaptive resilience" is introduced in paragraph five as narrator summary, mentioned again in the final paragraph ("adaptive grace"), but never shown through a specific on-page action where the trait constrains or enables a choice with visible cost. It remains label-only. The trait does not shape her handling of the frost, the ledger, or the decision to transform. Setup gate is met; development and closure participation are absent. Swappability is high.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Retrace" appears early ("began to retrace the chain of events") and structures the middle reflection beat, where frost patterns guide her memory of Kael, the commission, and the flight. The action enables the thematic turn by linking past to present and charges the decision to encase (preserving the ledger's story rather than destroying it). Present in all three gates; drives one major beat and informs closure. Causal pressure is moderate—her physical retracing is conceptual rather than spatial, limiting irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Frost patterns are signaled early (paragraph eight), used in the middle beat to trigger memory ("crystalline veins... mirrored the coded routes"), and referenced at closure ("frost's patterns etched in her mind"). The method teaches her that "meaning resides in adaptation," directly motivating the encasement decision. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. However, the mechanics are metaphorical rather than tactical—frost does not constrain her physical choices, only her interpretive frame. One strong causal link to closure keeps it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The canyon is present throughout, providing the "stone embrace" and spatial anchor. It supplies the frost (method) and the "profound silence" (condition for reflection), meeting setup and development. At closure, the canyon is invoked as witness ("this canyon, these stars"), participating in the final thematic charge. However, the setting does not pressure her tactically—she could reflect anywhere. Micro-setting elements (ledger, body) constrain more actively. Lyric reprise reweights but does not drive action.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after surviving the attempt" anchors the opening and frames causality (she fled, now she reflects). Time advances from night to dawn, and the closing of night ("stars fading") marks her resolve. Setup and payoff gates are met, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions—no clock pressures her choice to encase versus destroy. Development gate is absent; the middle reflection is timeless. The dawn's arrival coincides with her decision but does not cause it.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"To discover purpose in the pauses" is named explicitly in paragraph six and restated at closure ("purpose was not in the grand gesture, but in the intentional pause"). Setup and payoff are met. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices—no friction between escape and meaning, only a smooth progression from survival to epiphany. The ledger decision illustrates the motivation but does not test it with cost. Label-only in middle beats; thematic echo in final paragraph.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Drifting resonance" appears three times as a repeated phrase marking tone shifts (canyon silence, night's lesson, peace at closure). The tone is coherent and modulates from terror to stillness to resolve, meeting setup and payoff. However, the phrase itself is ornamental—removing it would not alter tonal arc. The tone supports the thematic turn but does not constrain choices or charge the final image through rhythm or cadence shift; it remains a descriptive label. Lyric reprise without functional pressure.</comment>
