<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and consistent—skin-absorption, the ring's warmth, grief as a navigational problem—but emotional progression remains too smooth and diagnostic. "Grief and love are intertwined notes of one chord" reads as therapeutic insight rather than embodied contradiction. The final shift from sharp edges to enduring strength lacks visible struggle or renunciation cost; acceptance arrives without on-page friction. Motivation is clear and drives the journey, but internal conflict never complicates the path in a way that forces a costly micro-choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: fragments of the musical trail converge into a chord of peace, reweighting grief through density and cadence. Orientation is immediate (who, where, when by line 1); two shards (journey in, stillpoint revelation) with a clean transition at "Suddenly, all vibration dissolved." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (acceptance that love transforms but persists), though cost remains implied rather than sharply legible—no visible forfeiture or renunciation that forecloses a living option. The lens holds, but the final image lacks the undeniable pressure or felt price that would lift this into the 8+ range.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest is vivid and consistent: high-frequency hum, dewdrop *ping* on quartz, subterranean river *thrum*. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elara's priorities (touch and vibration over sight), and spatial choreography is clean. The forest constrains her method (musical notes guide the path) and charges the final stillpoint image. Minor: the constellations' pause is asserted repeatedly but never shapes a tactical choice or tightens a deadline; it remains atmospheric rather than a live constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and signaled early: navigate grief to find inner peace. One meaningful deepening occurs at the stillpoint when Elara accepts love's transformation. Agency is present (she walks, touches, absorbs) but external obstacles are absent—no reversal or complication forces a trade-off. The journey is a pilgrimage of acceptance rather than a contested choice under pressure. Cost is conceptual (accepting transformation) but not viscerally felt on the page; no live option is foreclosed with visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—grief and love as intertwined, transformation rather than loss—emerges from particulars: the platinum ring, musical trail, absorbed forest stories. The final chord image reweights prior fragments without stating a moral. Minor slip: "grief and love are intertwined notes of one chord" crosses into thematic echo (near-prompt language) in a climactic beat, though it is immediately grounded in bodily vibration. The piece resists tidy closure and invites reflection; no sermonizing intrudes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable, third-limited with Elara's perceptual signature (skin-absorption, touch-first sensing). Diction is controlled and lyric, though occasional elevated phrasing ("poignant chord woven into the evolving trail") drifts slightly above the established tactile register. No head-hopping. Purposeful compression and fragment use ("Elara halted, breath caught. She had arrived.") fits the quiet, accumulative design. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance modulates appropriately with emotional beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; the read-aloud test passes. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The ring pulsed warmer" / "The ring's heat became a steady quiet blaze" restate the same content across three beats without added pressure. Template cadence: "Her skin absorbed…" / "She absorbed…" / "This absorption…" recurs six times, flattening rhythm. Stock metaphor "quiet blaze" is reused four times without evolving meaning. Artifacts do not obscure closure but accumulate to −0.8 under the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of blindness, tactile cartography, ultrasonic forest, and musical-note navigation is specific and non-generic. Execution is competent but cautious: no reversals, no resistance, no cost that sharpens stakes. The pilgrimage unfolds as expected from the premise without a non-obvious turn or inflection. Emotional specificity (grief for a mentor, love transformed) avoids templates, but the arc remains predictable. Transformation test: swap "mapmaker" for "healer" and the emotional journey holds unchanged, signaling insufficient freshness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's choices drive the journey: she times entry, dowses with the ring, touches trees to absorb memory, kneels at the stillpoint. Two gates met (setup, closure participation). However, choices are sequential confirmations rather than contested turns; no decision narrows live options or imposes visible cost. Mid-band: functional across beats but swappable with another questing protagonist.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The platinum compass ring appears in five beats: setup (line 1), dowsing (line 67), warming guidance (line 76, 159, 195), and cooling at closure (line 248). It constrains method (aligns with emotional truth, not magnetic north) and signals proximity. Charged reprise at the end ("cool and silent, rested as testament") reweights its function. Essential across beats; just shy of indispensable because the same guidance could be supplied by another heirloom object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The hidden stillpoint frames the journey (line 48), shapes the destination, and delivers the closure beat (line 213). All three gates met. It enables the final acceptance (grief/love intertwined) and forecloses return to the old map. However, its properties (pocket of calm, potential replacing motion) remain abstract; no specific constraint or tactical cost tied to stillpoint mechanics appears on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Skin-absorption is signaled early (line 26) and used in six beats: reading the forest hum (line 98), touching the pine (line 126), absorbing stories (line 183), kneeling at stillpoint (line 223), and farewell (line 317). It constrains method (must touch to navigate) and enables the cartography metaphor. Cost is implicit (vulnerability, openness to sorrow) but not dramatized as a tradeoff. Strong beat involvement; just under essential because a similar sensory gift could substitute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dowsing (line 67) launches the journey and defines method (extending the ring-hand). Setup and middle development met. However, dowsing does not reappear at closure or drive a second distinct beat; the musical trail and absorption take over. The action is present but replaceable—"sensing," "following," or "attuning" could substitute with minor edits. Mid-band: functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The musical-note trail is seeded early (line 87), developed through four beats (dewdrop ping, river thrum, converging lullaby, final chord at line 234), and shapes tactics (she follows notes to the stillpoint). All three gates met. The method is specific (notes as map) and irreplaceable. Just under 7.0 because the mechanics remain metaphorical; no cost or tradeoff tied to decoding or missing a note appears on the page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The ultrasonic forest is established immediately (line 1), supplies sensory pressure (high-frequency hum, vibration language, thorns with dissonant caution at line 159), and frames the closure stillpoint. Setup, middle, and closure gates met. The forest constrains method (requires absorption) and provides the notes she follows. Just under 7.0 because the forest does not impose a visible cost or tactic-altering obstacle; it remains cooperative throughout.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The constellations' pause is introduced at line 58, mentioned twice more (line 152, 242, 292), and provides atmospheric framing. Setup and closure mention met, but no middle development. The timeframe does not tighten decisions, impose a deadline, or alter tactics; Elara's pilgrimage proceeds at her chosen pace. Present and thematically consonant but functionally replaceable—removing it would not break story logic.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's desire to navigate grief is signaled at line 38, reinforced by her mentor's memory (line 136), tested at the stillpoint (line 223), and resolved at closure (line 261, 301). All three gates met. The motivation drives every beat and shapes the final acceptance. Friction appears (tears, frayed edges) but remains brief; the journey lacks sustained resistance or a moment where grief pulls her away from the path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Quiet blaze" is introduced at line 38, repeated four times (line 195, 255, 326), and modulates from motivation ("burned with quiet blaze") to revelation ("quiet blaze revelation") to peace ("quiet blaze of peace"). Setup and closure met; tone is coherent and charges the final image. Just under 7.0 because the phrase recurs without evolving meaning—each use restates intensity rather than reweighting it under pressure.</comment>
