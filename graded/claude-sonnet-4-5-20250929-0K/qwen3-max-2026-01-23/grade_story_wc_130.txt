<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and specific (understand the mathematics of emotion), and her method is character-particular (gentle alignment vs. force). However, interiority leans heavily abstract—"the mathematics of emotion" recurs as label rather than embodied contradiction. The final tear "carried no bitterness—only the weight of understanding" reads as summary emotion rather than lived conflict. Her renunciation of active searching is earned, but the arc lacks genuine struggle or mistake that compounds before resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land clearly by the opening paragraph. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elara accepts Kael's integration into the orchard rather than pursuing further conjuring, and the drop's return signals continuity. Cost is visible—she relinquishes the search for discrete answers and accepts transformation over retrieval. One deduction: the vision sequence summarizes Kael's choice rather than dramatizing a present discovery that narrows Elara's options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cavern orchard is vividly particular: mineral-drip sustenance, stalactite ceiling, mosaic stepping stone with crushed abalone and lapis. The mosaic constrains Elara's method (she must kneel, place the eyes in chip-formed sockets) and the final drop charges closure by breaking the silence. Sensory detail is purposeful and POV-filtered. Minor slip: the "invisible threads binding stone to tree, past to present" drifts toward declarative metaphor rather than concrete perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: understanding Kael's disappearance and the orchard's silence. Escalation under Accumulative lens occurs via the ritual deepening (eyes placed, warmth, vision unfolds, silence reweighted). The tightening is meaningful—Elara's understanding forecloses active searching. Cost is legible: she must accept Kael's transformation rather than his return. Deduction: the vision is granted rather than earned through a choice or reversal that tests her commitment; the ritual succeeds without friction or failed attempt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme (love transforms rather than vanishes) emerges from particulars: the mosaic's worn chips, the glass eyes as conduit, the returning drop. The final image (drop striking mosaic) offers a resonant answer without overt moral. However, "the mathematics of emotion was not a problem to solve, but a mystery to live" is explicit theme summary in the penultimate paragraph, and "buried optimism...that love does not vanish with loss, but transforms" directly states the premise. These declarations replace scene pressure at closure. Apply −0.6 for final-paragraph moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited distance with strong perceptual filtering ("comforting percussion," "question posed to the stone"). Diction is elevated but consistent. Minor register drift: "dovetail his essence with the orchard's rhythm" and "invisible threads binding stone to tree" lean abstract in peak beats, weakening immediacy. No head-hopping. Elara's perceptual signature (alignment-seeking, gentle interpretation) is distinct and holds under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, information density is high, and figurative language is purposeful in most beats. Paraphrase loop detected: "The silence was not absence; it was a different mode of presence, a deep and abiding fullness" restates the prior vision's conclusion without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence: "she had always carried but never named," "it was speaking in a language of water and memory," "not a problem to solve, but a mystery to live" repeat the X-not-Y-but-Z frame across closure beats without variation (−0.4). No filter-verb stacks or major clarity breaks. Closure remains legible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The conjurer-seeking-lost-person frame is widely used; specificity (mosaic stepping stone, glass eyes as ritual tool, orchard silence as absence-vs.-transformation) elevates execution. The final turn—Kael chose integration, silence is presence—feels earned in hindsight. However, the core emotional arc (grief → acceptance via ritual revelation) follows a familiar template without bold risk. The mathematics-of-emotion conceit remains abstract rather than dramatized through a non-obvious moral calculus. Transformation is partial.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Secretive conjurer: signaled early, shapes the ritual method (alignment not force), and her choice to accept Kael's transformation closes the arc. Present across beats (walking the path, placing the eyes, interpreting the vision). Causal pressure is moderate—her conjuring enables the vision, but the vision is granted rather than wrestled from failed attempts. Closure linkage is strong. Swappability: a non-conjurer seeker with ritual knowledge could perform similar moves with edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Glass eye pair: introduced in paragraph 5 with backstory context (Kael's gift, "true sight beyond the veil"), used in the ritual (placed in mosaic sockets, channel the vision), and return at the end with "faint, persistent warmth" as echo. Three distinct beats. Cost connection: the eyes enable understanding but also finalize Elara's acceptance (she tucks them away, no longer needing to use them). Specificity is high—taxidermist's craft and hazel detail matter. Early signal present.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ambiguous loss: shapes the entire stake (Kael's vanishing, unanswered questions) and tactics (Elara seeks to "dovetail two fragile threads"). The vision transforms ambiguity into clarity—Kael chose integration, not departure. This reweights prior material and drives closure: Elara's tear and acceptance are direct responses to disambiguated loss. The concept is the engine of pressure and resolution. Present early, developed in the middle ritual, and resolved with visible emotional cost at the end.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Gently inventive: stated explicitly ("Her methods were always gently inventive"), demonstrated in her approach (alignment not force, trusting "truth bloomed in the spaces between things"), and contrasted implicitly with forceful conjuring. It enables the ritual's success—she poses a question rather than commanding. However, no on-page cost or tradeoff is shown; the gentle method succeeds without friction or a moment where force might have been faster but ethically wrong. Present across beats but lacks visible constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dovetail: recurs as verb and metaphor (dovetail threads, Kael dovetails his essence, grief interlocks with renewal, loss and love dovetail into meaning). It structures the thematic question and the vision's answer. The action itself—Elara's attempt to align Kael's resonance with the stone's memory—drives the middle beat. Closure hinges on the dovetail metaphor made literal. Swappability: "weave" or "integrate" could replace most uses with minor edits; the carpentry specificity of "dovetail" is not irreplaceable to the logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Chipped mosaic patterns: introduced early (paragraph 9), described with specificity (swirling mandala, abalone, lapis, river stones), and their mechanics matter—the chips form sockets for the glass eyes, and the patterns "shimmer with internal luminescence" to channel the vision. The method is signaled, used, and pays off at closure (the final drop strikes the mosaic). Three gates met. The mosaic is causally active and irreplaceable—without the chip-sockets, the ritual cannot proceed as designed.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Cavern orchard: present from the opening line, supplies the silence (drip-stopped) that creates the mystery, nourishes via stalactite drip (the ecosystem matters), and the stalactite's renewed drop at closure breaks the silence with "a note of continuity." The setting pressures the plot (silence = Kael's disappearance signal) and the final drop reweights the entire stake. Early signal, middle constraint (the orchard's mechanics shape Elara's interpretation), and closure charge. The drip-fed ecosystem is specific and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Timeframe (after silence, beneath the moon): anchors the scene and establishes urgency (the silence is new, prompting tonight's ritual). The moon filters light through the fissure, adding atmosphere. However, time does not tighten decisions—Elara's ritual proceeds without a clock or competing pressure. The "tonight" frame sets mood but does not alter tactics. Present in setup, minimal middle pressure, moderate closure linkage (the drop falls "at that precise instant" but no countdown forced the timing).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mathematics of emotion: introduced early as Elara's decades-long quest, sharpened by Kael's loss, and resolved in the vision ("the mathematics made manifest—joyful spiral dovetailing with protective curve"). The motivation drives her choice to attempt the ritual and shapes her interpretation of the vision. Closure explicitly names the answer: "not cold calculation...the gentle geometry of connection." Friction between want and cost is present (she must accept transformation over retrieval). Deduction: the resolution is told rather than shown through a hard choice between competing emotional calculi.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Buried optimism: named explicitly in paragraph 19 ("the buried optimism she had always carried") and demonstrated in Elara's interpretive lens (chips as punctuation not flaws, silence as presence). The tone modulates—grief and quiet fire at the start, warmth and understanding at closure. The final smile and "small sure thing" embody the tone shift. Coherent across turns. Deduction: the tone is declared rather than inferred, and "buried optimism" as a label appears only near the end rather than subtly charging earlier beats.</comment>
