<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared ("to lure the possibility of her unfinished duet") but her choices feel predetermined rather than tested under contradictory impulses. The synesthetic interiority relies heavily on label-speak ("silver thread," "amber strand," "liquid sapphire") without embodied sensation or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Julian's appearance as "vibrant essence" arrives as reward rather than through dramatized struggle, and the final dissolution reads as closure-by-label ("profound, peaceful acceptance") rather than earned renunciation with visible cost. No genuine flaws complicate her path; she executes her plan without friction, mistake, or trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—who Elara is, where she stands, and what specific barrier she faces emerge slowly through atmospheric description rather than anchored early. The dominant lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (echoes gathering into a bridge), but causality is weak: Elara hums, draws strands, braids them, and Julian coalesces without obstacle or reversal. The "fractured timeline" functions as atmosphere rather than a constraint that narrows options. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: she dissolves after fulfilling purpose), but the cost is asserted ("her form growing lighter, her purpose fulfilled") rather than shown as a forfeiture that alters present stakes. No meaningful tightening occurs; the orchard "responds" to her will without resistance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The orchard is vividly rendered with synesthetic detail (wind tasting of lemon zest, firefly glows as warm kisses), and the tarot coin at the apple tree's roots provides a charged final image. Spatial choreography is clear within the single setting, and the hedge maze frame anchors early. However, the environment does not constrain choice—Elara moves through it without friction, and the "fractured timeline" affects perception but not tactics. The coin's transformation (lovers now clasping hands) reconfigures the closure image, lifting this category into mid-6s despite the setting's passive role in escalation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving the duet's possibility—is signaled early, but no reversal or tightening forces a trade-off. Elara executes her method (producing echoes, braiding them) without setback, adaptation, or cost that alters tactics. The "brink of despair" is a declared threat never dramatized; Julian's light coalesces because she wills it, not through a choice that forecloses another path. The closing dissolution is framed as fulfillment rather than sacrifice with felt price. Pressure remains static; coincidence (the orchard "responds") enables rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme—memory and devotion transcending fractured time—emerges through image and motif rather than statement, and the tarot coin's transformation offers a resonant non-literal answer. However, the final paragraph edges toward moralizing: "even fractured timelines hold profound beauty when we choose to intertwine our echoes with unwavering love" reads as thematic summary rather than earned implication. The "encore was never in the applause" line risks explicating the subtext. Particulars (the coin, the apple tree, the luminous cord) support theme, but the closing lines lean toward assertion over emergence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person close on Elara with consistent synesthetic filter, but the voice converges toward elevated diction ("profound hush," "labyrinthine," "coalesced") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Perceptual signature is vivid (threads, tastes, textures) yet formulaic across beats—each echo described via color/sense pairing without variation under pressure. No dialogue appears. Distance control is clean, but the prose reads as poeticized narration rather than Elara's lived idiom. Filter verbs ("she watched," "she felt") are sparse and acceptable. Psychic distance remains stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and coherent within the synesthetic frame, but template cadence pervades key beats: "This echo intertwined with… / She drew… / Each echo was a strand…" recycles parallel stems. Paraphrase loops appear: "Her motivation burned with quiet urgency" followed by restating the goal two lines later, and "the fractured timeline responded" is echoed by "the cord… stretched… pulling disparate moments into alignment." Stock phrasing ("profound hush," "relentless march," "liquid light") and elevated register ("coalesced," "translucent palm") dilute immediacy. Information density is moderate; many lines describe rather than advance. Artifacts in the closure third (template stems, synonym churn on "echo"/"strand"/"thread") disallow 9+ globally and pull this category below 5.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The premise—ghost weaving temporal echoes via synesthesia—synthesizes familiar tropes (unfinished duet, haunted orchard, time distortion) without a non-obvious angle. Emotional arc and plot function unchanged if synesthesia becomes another supernatural sense or the orchard becomes another liminal space. The tarot coin and apple tree offer specific anchors, but the beats follow a predictable gather-resolve-ascend pattern. No bold risk heightens stakes; the story chooses median safety (ghost finds peace, love endures) over friction or irony. Transformation is cosmetic rather than structural.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her ghostly nature frames the story, but her choices do not create reversals. She decides to hum, braid echoes, and press the coin—actions that succeed without friction. The "stage ghost" label is ornamental; her theatrical past flavors backstory but does not constrain present tactics. Setup and closure participation are clear; development is passive execution.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The coin appears early (Elara clutches it), is used mid-story (she presses her thumb, whispering "Remember us"), and returns transformed at closure (lovers clasping hands, placed at the tree's roots). Three beats with evolving function and a charged final image. However, the coin enables rather than constrains; removing it would require only minor rewrites to anchor her focus elsewhere. Specificity and closure linkage elevate it into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The fractured timeline is described extensively (1920s rehearsal bleeds into 2003 festival, blossoms fall upward) but functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than shaping stakes or tactics. Elara perceives it synesthetically yet moves through it without navigating constraints or paying a cost tied to its fractures. Setup is vivid; development and payoff treat it as theme rather than mechanical pressure. Present but largely ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Synesthesia is signaled early and used in most beats (threads taste, sparks feel, smoke tastes). It provides the method for gathering echoes—without it, her approach collapses. However, no on-page cost or constraint is tied to the trait; it is pure enabler. One key beat (braiding the luminous cord) depends on synesthetic vision. Functional across multiple beats but no visible trade-off lowers ceiling.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Intertwine" is the core mechanic: Elara intertwines echoes into a cord, fragments into a tapestry, and her echoes with Julian's. The action structures the middle escalation and shapes the closure image (intertwined echoes as permanent song). Swapping to "weave" or "bind" would require rewriting beats but not reframing logic. Present in setup, development (braiding silver/amber/emerald/bronze), and payoff (orchard keeps the echo). Essential but not fully irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's method—producing echoes by humming, drawing audience gasps, and gathering sensory strands—is introduced early and drives the middle sequence. The mechanics matter: she gathers, braids, and stretches the cord to pull Julian from oblivion. Two distinct beats (gathering echoes, stretching the cord) and closure linkage (orchard keeps the echo). The method could be replaced by another summoning ritual with moderate edits, capping below 7.0, but causal involvement across beats is solid.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The orchard is anchored early ("deep within the labyrinthine hedge maze"), described richly, and houses the closure image (coin at tree's roots). However, it does not pressure choices—Elara encounters no locked gate, rival ghost, or temporal barrier within it. The setting enables atmosphere but does not alter tactics. Setup and payoff present; middle development passive. Functional but replaceable with another liminal garden.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After the final curtain call, after the last patron vanished" frames the opening, and "dawn's blush touched the hedge maze's highest leaves" closes the window. The timeframe provides atmosphere (night of solitude) but does not tighten decisions—no countdown, no interruption risk. Elara works at her own pace. Present in setup and closure as ambient detail; does not shape middle tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—"to lure the possibility of her unfinished duet from the brink of despair"—is stated early and her actions pursue it throughout. The motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses, and no on-page friction tests her commitment (she succeeds without setback). Setup and closure clear; middle development shows execution rather than want-versus-cost struggle. Functional but lacks embodied conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rising nostalgia is coherent from opening ("profound hush," "sorrowful grace") through climax ("tears of liquid light," "decades of devotion") to closure ("peaceful acceptance"). Tone modulates from longing to fulfillment, charging the final image. However, the arc is smooth rather than tensioned—nostalgia swells without irony or cost. Present across all three gates and supports closure, but the single static emotional vector (devotion → peace) trends mid-band.</comment>
