<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The historian's "sensitively perceptive" attribute is mostly label-driven; we're told he "felt the faint resonance" and his fingers trace "the writer's trembling hope," but these remain asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied cost. The final "smile faintly" gesture and the decision to inscribe Elara's words are present, but they don't foreclose a live option or reveal internal contradiction acting in scene. Motivation is consistent but never tested by competing goods; he simply continues his established work without friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers memory fragments (laughter, argument, Elara's diary) and the tapestry to deepen the resonance of the silo's archive. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "the displaced axis had shifted the world, but stories, like dragons, could mend the sky in memory" crystallizes the stakes and reweights the archive's purpose with conceptual cost (the dream-space must be tended against oblivion). However, the cost is more asserted than viscerally legible on the page—no forfeited path or visible price paid in the final beat. Orientation is clear early (who, where, when by line 3).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The silo is anchored early and returns with purpose: "curved walls," "east wall," "rusted ladder," "stone fireplace," and the final "cool metal wall" create spatial coherence. The tapestry fragment and half-burned diaries function as micro-setting that constrains the historian's probe and charges the closure image ("dragons watched, eternal"). The bronze light modulates from "aged bronze" to "gilding the tapestry fragment" at the end, subtly mirroring the thematic shift from emptiness to layered memory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving stories against oblivion—is signaled early and remains coherent. The piece deepens through Elara's diary revelation: her decision to cut the dragon's eye "before the flames took it all" and her final dream add emotional weight. However, the historian himself faces no on-page tightening or trade-off; he simply receives and records. The cost is Elara's (burning books, the last dream), not the protagonist's. Under the Accumulative lens one meaningful intensification is sufficient, but the historian's own agency doesn't narrow options or alter tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the displaced axis as both planetary tilt and loss of inner compass, the tapestry as "vessel for resilience," and the closing image "stories, like dragons, could mend the sky in memory" offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Elara's line "beauty must not die first" and the final seed metaphor avoid platitude through grounded detail. One minor slip: "displaced axis was dual: the planet's physical tilt and the shattering of humanity's inner compass" edges toward explicit articulation, though it remains anchored in Elara's lived experience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, filtered through the historian's perceptual signature ("sensitively perceptive…attuning him to the whispers"). Diction is consistent and elevated ("profound stillness," "bronze quiet"), fitting the meditative register. However, voice occasionally slips into thematic summarizing rather than embodied perception: "He understood the displaced axis was dual" reads more like narrator interpretation than character thought. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates appropriately from the opening's patient pacing to the diary's urgency, then back to quiet closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Clarity is high; information density is good (most lines advance story or atmosphere). However, several paraphrase loops and template-cadence runs appear: "He felt…," "He understood…," "He was…," "He listened…," "He smiled…" cluster in the final third, creating a monotonous syntactic pattern. "The displaced axis was dual" is followed immediately by restating the same idea. "Bronze quiet" recurs without evolving pressure (lines 2, 27, and implicitly at the end). One stock phrase: "a gentle disturbance in the profound stillness." These artifacts dull momentum in the closure beats, triggering baseline Q7 penalties and disqualifying 9+ globally per the artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The premise—post-apocalyptic archivist in a reclaimed silo—is recognizable but rendered with specificity: half-burned diaries in the fireplace, the tapestry fragment as Elara's "foolish mercy," and the displaced axis grounding the collapse in visceral detail. The emotional truth of preserving beauty against oblivion avoids sentimentality through Elara's particular struggle. However, the core emotional arc (lone keeper of memory in a silent world) follows a familiar template without a sharp transformative turn; the historian's final gesture (inscribing, smiling) is predictable rather than surprising in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The odd historian is present throughout and his occupation frames the premise. He performs actions (moving, smoothing fragments, inscribing, listening), but none of these choices create a turn—he continues his established vow without complication or cost. His decision to seal the story and inscribe Elara's words is consistent but not pivotal; the arc would be unchanged if another archivist performed the same steps. Setup and closure participation are present; middle development (a choice that alters tactics) is absent. Swappable without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tapestry fragment appears early ("oak desk," line 8), is handled in the diary revelation ("I cut the dragon's eye from the tapestry"), and returns charged in the final image ("the tapestry fragment where the dragons watched, eternal"). Its specific property—beauty preserved against flame—directly encodes Elara's resilience and shapes the thematic closure ("stories, like dragons, could mend the sky"). The element is irreplaceable; no generic artifact would carry the same dragon/fire/dream symbolism. Strong setup, middle reprise through Elara's voice, and payoff in the gilded closing beat.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The displaced axis is defined early through Elara's diary: "the sun rose wrong; rivers forgot their paths; the very ground felt unmoored." It provides the existential stakes (the world's unraveling) and is explicitly reprised at closure: "the displaced axis had shifted the world, but stories…could mend the sky in memory." However, it does not constrain the historian's on-page tactics or force a choice; it functions more as thematic backdrop than active story pressure. Setup and payoff are strong; middle development as a tactical constraint is absent.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The attribute "sensitively perceptive" is named in line 4 and asserted repeatedly: "his sensitively perceptive fingers tracing," "sensitively perceptive to the new resonance." However, it never enables or constrains a specific choice with visible cost. The historian perceives echoes, but perception alone doesn't create a turn or trade-off; he could perform the same archival work without this exact trait. Label-only use; functionally replaceable with "careful" or "attentive." No middle choice or closure cost tied to the attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The action "probe" appears explicitly in line 10 ("probing through half-burned diaries") and is reprised metaphorically at the end ("a gentle probe against the dark"). It frames the method of investigation and returns in the closure gesture. However, the historian's probing doesn't create a turn; he successfully reads the diaries and inscribes the result without complication. Swappable with "examine" or "study" without altering the arc. Setup and closure reprise are present; middle causality (a choice altered by probing) is absent.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The method (half-burned diaries in the fireplace) is signaled in line 10, provides the primary evidence for Elara's story (middle development: her words about burning books and cutting the dragon's eye), and is sealed in the preservation case at closure, directly feeding the inscribing action. The burning detail matters: it encodes the resource scarcity and Elara's final choices. Removing this exact method would require a different artifact with different thematic weight. Strong setup, middle function, and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The reclaimed silo library is anchored in line 1, provides spatial choreography (curved walls, east wall, rusted ladder, stone fireplace, oak desk, metal wall), and returns in the closure image: "The silo, once a container for grain, now held the harvest of human spirit." The transformation from grain storage to story archive directly supports the theme. However, the setting does not pressure the historian's choices or supply a resource he must work around; it functions as atmospheric container rather than active constraint. Setup and payoff are strong; middle tactical pressure is minimal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the last human dream is dreamt" is named in line 7 and echoed in Elara's diary ("Last night, I dreamed…the last dream anyone will ever have") and the closure seed metaphor. It establishes existential stakes and charges the preservation work with urgency (no more dreams means no more meaning-making). However, it doesn't function as a live clock that tightens the historian's decisions on the page; he works without deadline or consequence. Strong thematic presence; weak tactical pressure. Setup and closure participation present; middle development absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to collect the stories walls have heard" is stated explicitly in line 6 ("His motivation was a sacred vow") and dramatized through the historian's actions (smoothing fragments, listening to walls, inscribing). It returns at closure: "In collecting the stories walls have heard, he ensured the dream lived on." However, the vow is never conflicted or tested; he pursues it without friction, cost, or competing desire. The motivation shapes all beats and the ending but lacks internal resistance. Strong setup and payoff; no middle friction between want and obstacle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tone "bronze quiet" is established early ("dust motes…the color of aged bronze," "profound stillness") and modulates purposefully: the diary's urgency ("edges blackened by flame, script bleeding into ash") breaks the stillness, then the tone re-stabilizes with deeper resonance ("bronze quiet…no longer empty; it was layered"). The final image ("bronze light deepened toward twilight, gilding the tapestry") charges the closure by shifting bronze from emptiness to warmth. Coherent through turns, modulates under pressure, and directly supports the final reconfiguration.</comment>
