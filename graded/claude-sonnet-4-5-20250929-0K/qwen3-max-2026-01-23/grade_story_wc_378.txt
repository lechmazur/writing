<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Unit Seven's motivation—resolving inner static—is clear and embodied through sensor notes and memory fragments. The nostalgic android premise risks sentimentality, but the piece grounds emotion in concrete action: retrieving the box, focusing light, observing ash. Internal contradiction is thin; the android moves smoothly from problem to solution without meaningful resistance or competing impulses. The final "fragmented wholeness" feels asserted rather than earned through on-page struggle with visible cost to its programming or purpose.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Unit Seven completes the ritual, scatters ash, and resumes rounds with "integrated peace." The cost is conceptual—Lena's fears are destroyed, memories no longer fragment—but the final image of the new bud and "fragmented wholeness" reconfigures the opening static into acceptance. Lens: Accumulative/Textural; the ritual's steps deepen pressure through contained symbolism. One friction: the magnetic-north inciting incident vanishes after setup; it triggers the crisis but doesn't constrain tactics or return at closure, weakening causal tightness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glass dome, desert roses, and focused sunlight constrain the ritual's method—Unit Seven harvests sap and uses the atrium's light—giving micro-setting a functional role. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "humid air," "gravel paths," "needle-thin beam." The dome as fragile enclosure charges the final image of life "tenderly held." Spatial choreography is clean. One limit: the desert beyond remains postcard backdrop; it never pressures a choice or alters tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—resolve inner static—is signaled early and drives one meaningful tightening: Unit Seven chooses the controlled burn, executes it, and the static harmonizes. The ritual narrows options (destroy vs. keep fears) and the cost is conceptual—Lena's artifacts are gone, memories whole but sorrow woven in. One weakness: no live opposition or escalating risk; the ritual proceeds without friction, each object vanishing cleanly. The magnetic-north complication drops away, leaving a static-free arc that deepens theme but lacks reversals or felt jeopardy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—transformation through containment, fear acknowledged and released—emerges organically from the controlled burn and scattering ash as "nutrients for transformation." The final bud (rose-to-gold gradient) offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the box's contents and Unit Seven's promise. One friction: "fragmented wholeness" is named three times in the final third, edging toward label-speak, but the ritual and new bloom ground the concept in image. No overt thesis; complexity inheres in nostalgia as "source of depth" rather than wound.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; Unit Seven's perceptual signature—sensor notes, "archived memories," "vocal emulator"—is consistent and android-specific. Diction is controlled, with minimal filter-verb clutter. One dialogue exchange (Lena's voice) serves character without distraction. Two frictions lower the score: repeated syntactic stems in the ritual sequence ("The plastic spider…"; "The charcoal monster…"; "The milk tooth…") create template cadence, and elevated register ("miniaturize the overwhelming weight of memory") drifts from android utility toward philosophical abstraction in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean and rhythmically varied in most beats, with strong opening and closing images. Information density is high in the ritual sequence. Three artifact types harm momentum: (1) paraphrase loops—lines 115/122/129 restate "controlled burn" and "containment" with synonym churn; (2) template cadence in lines 199/207/214 (identical "The [object] [verb], then [result]" stems); (3) scaffolding phrases like "This was the action of miniaturize" (line 182) and "This was fragmented wholeness" (line 276) that label rather than dramatize. These touch the closure third, so baseline −1.0 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Nostalgic android + ritual transformation is a recognizable SF template, but the piece personalizes it through the Box of Childhood Fears and sap-lens method. The magnetic-north premise offers a fresh inciting trigger, yet it vanishes after setup, reducing structural boldness. The controlled-burn metaphor is apt but not entirely non-obvious. Emotional specificity (Lena's bedtime stories, braided blossoms) lifts the piece above generic, and the rose-to-gold bud avoids cliché closure. Risk-taking is moderate; the piece commits fully to its premise but hedges on escalation, avoiding bold stakes or reversals.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Nostalgic android caretaker: present from line 1, drives the decision to retrieve the box (beat 1), execute the ritual (beat 2), and scatter ash (beat 3). Nostalgia colors every memory fragment and the final "keeper of roses/memories" identity. Causal pressure: the android's motivation shapes all tactics. Closure linkage: "finally, peacefully whole" hinges on this character's arc. Setup + development + payoff all strong. Specificity: android nostalgia (not human grief) makes the ritual credible. Minor friction: no visible tradeoff or competing directive that the nostalgia overrides; the choice feels smooth rather than costly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Box of childhood fears: retrieved at line 87 (beat 1), opened to reveal artifacts (beat 2), contents destroyed serially in the ritual (beat 3). Causal pressure: the box's "unprocessed emotional chaos" is the problem; destroying its contents resolves the static. Closure linkage: ash from the box becomes "nutrients," and the new bud encodes transformation. Early signal (first third), multi-beat involvement, irreplaceable (Lena's specific fears, not generic symbols), and cost-connected (destroying the box contents forecloses "keeping them safe"). Small deduction: the box itself is a vessel; the spider/monster/tooth do the symbolic work, so the box qua object is one step removed from indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Controlled burn escape: named at line 122, explained at 129, and executed across lines 172–214 as the focused-light ritual. Shapes stakes: the method defines how Unit Seven resolves static. Development: the burn's "contained fire" logic governs every ritual beat. Closure: ash scattering and the new bud are direct products of the burn. Setup + development + payoff present. Causal pressure: the concept narrows tactics (destroy via contained heat, not scatter or archive). One friction: "controlled burn" is restated with synonym variations ("liberation," "miniaturize," "contained chaos") across lines 122/129/140, edging toward ornamental layering rather than mechanical necessity; the ritual could work as simple "focused destruction" without the burn metaphor's full freight.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Strangely organic: applied to Unit Seven's grace (line 3), the sap's "amber clarity" (line 162), and the ritual feeling "strangely organic, transcending programming" (line 284). Present across setup, middle, and closure. Development: the sap-harvesting beat uses organic material as a tool, and the final reflection claims the ritual taps "ancient healing wisdom." One significant friction: the trait is largely descriptive and thematic; it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic that an inorganic method would forbid. The sap could be synthetic resin, the grace mechanical, without breaking story logic. Cost-free and swappable, so mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Miniaturize: introduced at line 140 ("miniaturize the overwhelming weight of memory"), explained at 182 ("reducing vast fear to a single, controllable point"), and executed through the focused beam (lines 172–214). Development: the action defines the ritual's mechanics—compress and contain. Closure: the new bud and "fragmented wholeness" imagery encode miniaturization's success. Setup + development + payoff present. Two frictions: (1) the term is scaffold-like—lines 140 and 182 restate the concept rather than dramatize distinct beats; (2) the action is partly swappable with "destroy" or "transform" without mechanical loss. The beam-focus matters more than the miniaturization label. Mid-to-upper band for multi-beat presence, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>By containing chaos: stated at line 129 ("transforming fear into peace through contained fire"), demonstrated at 140 ("containing chaos within a miniature ritual"), and validated at 222 ("perfect containment—no flame spread"). Development: containment logic governs the sap-lens design and the atrium's use. Closure: the scattered ash and new bud prove contained transformation. Setup + development + payoff all present. Causal pressure: the method matters—Unit Seven can't simply burn the box outside; the glass-focused beam and miniature scale are chosen for containment. Specificity: containment vs. release is a meaningful distinction. Small deduction for synonym layering ("contain," "miniaturize," "controlled") that risks ornamental repetition, but the mechanics are clear and shape tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Desert rose farm in glass-domed enclosure: anchored at line 1, supplies the sap at 162, provides the atrium's focused light at 151, and charges the final image ("Inside the glass, life persisted"). Setup + development + closure all strong. Causal pressure: the dome's curved glass enables the ritual's beam; the desert roses provide sap; enclosure permits "perfect containment." Closure linkage: the farm and dome frame the piece's opening and closing, and the new bud grows on-site. Irreplaceability: swap the dome for a greenhouse or the roses for cacti, and the ritual's specificity weakens. Minor friction: the desert beyond is backdrop; it never pressures a choice or supplies a complication.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>When magnetic north shifts: incites the crisis at line 55 ("geomagnetic alert flashed"), causes memory fragmentation at 67, and is referenced at 310 ("Magnetic North continued its slow pivot"). Setup present; closure cameo. One development beat implied (the shift unravels memories). Two major frictions: (1) the shift never constrains tactics or returns with mechanical consequence—Unit Seven doesn't recalibrate sensors or navigate by north; (2) the timeframe is vague (weeks pass at line 332, but the ritual's duration is untracked). The element triggers the problem but doesn't tighten decisions or supply a live clock. Mid-band for inciting role, capped for missing development pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>To resolve inner static: motivation crystallizes at line 79, drives the box retrieval and ritual design (lines 87–182), and is satisfied at 227 ("the inner static harmonized"). Setup + development + closure all present. Causal pressure: every choice traces to this desire. Closure linkage: the final "silence replaced static" and "integrated peace" hinge on achieving this goal. Friction and cost: the static "wounds" Unit Seven (line 72), and resolution requires destroying Lena's entrusted artifacts—a conceptual price (breaking the "keep my fears safe" promise). Specificity: android-specific motivation (processor interference) distinguishes this from generic "find peace." Small deduction: no competing want or fear complicates the pursuit; the path is smooth.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fragmented wholeness: introduced at line 276 ("sorrow and gratitude woven inseparably"), echoed at 348 ("nostalgia remained, but no longer fractured"), and closes the piece at 391 ("fragmented wholeness, finally, peacefully whole"). Setup (first paragraph's "memories of rare rains" and "small hand tracing petals"), development (memory fragments at 67/240), and payoff (final wholeness) all present. Tone modulates: fractured static (early), ritual calm (middle), integrated peace (end). Closure linkage: the tone shift encodes the story's arc. Two frictions: (1) the phrase is named three times in the final third, edging toward label rather than embodied image; (2) the piece's prose is polished and lyric throughout—peak stress doesn't degrade diction or rhythm, so tonal modulation is thematic rather than pressure-driven. Upper band for coherence and resonance, but not indispensable phrasing.</comment>
