<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Aris is motivated clearly by memory recovery and exhibits embodied tension ("cold seeping through his trousers," tears tracing paths through grime). His chronic curiosity functions as both trait and method, driving him to the site and sustaining focus during the detection ritual. The interiority occasionally edges toward summary ("profound release and understanding") rather than contradiction in action, and Elara's climactic choice is presented as recovered memory rather than dramatized present conflict, which softens the on-page agency cost. The final arc—avoidance broken, truth carried as compass—reads earned but tilts slightly declarative.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly: Aris, sunken orchard, evening, thirty-two years after avoidance began. The causal lens dominates: Elara's journal shatters resolve → Aris travels to the site → follows prescribed method → alignment detected → memories return → closure offered by tipping mushroom into pool. The Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: decades of avoidance broken, truth now carried as compass) lands on the page with visible emotional cost and a clear before/after. One minor slip: "The chronically curious folklorist finally understood" in the penultimate beat risks summarizing theme rather than letting the image carry it, nudging the closure toward told insight rather than pure dramatization.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The shipwrecks and greenhouse ribs create a vivid, purposeful cage; the tidal pool serves as both mirror and ritual instrument, constraining the detection method. Sensory details are selective and grounded (salt spray, damp rot, apple-blossom ghost; mud vibration). The recurring fairy ring on shore mirrors the luminous circle in water, charging the final act when Aris tips the mushroom into the pool. Spatial choreography is clear across the kneeling, sketching, and rising sequence. The setting's desolation and the constellations broken by wreckage support tone and stakes without postcard excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recover stolen memories—is signaled early and sustained. The tightening occurs in a focused causal sequence: journal → travel → method → alignment → memory return → closure gesture. Aris's agency lies in choosing to return, executing the detection ritual, and offering thanks by releasing the mushroom, each step narrowing options (he cannot un-remember once the alignment succeeds). The price is clear: thirty-two years of avoidance must be confronted, and the recovered memory reveals Elara's sacrifice, reweighting his past with "not grief, but profound release." One beat of escalation and one visible cost meet the 600–800 word standard cleanly under a causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—memory as borrowed protection, returned when ready—emerges through the fairy ring's dual function (eraser and restorer) and the shipwrecks-as-guardians motif. The final gesture (tipping the mushroom) enacts closure without stating a moral. However, two late lines risk over-articulation: "some memories are borrowed, not stolen, returned only when the seeker is ready to see" and "a truth woven from broken stars, resilient mushrooms, and enduring love" come close to thematic summary rather than letting the image resonate. The broken-constellation metaphor and the decay-as-testament turn are strong, but the final paragraph edges toward making the implicit explicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited focalization remains stable and tightly bound to Aris's perception; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and character-appropriate ("hands-on folklorist," "shackled here by fear"). The perceptual signature is consistent: Aris notices "the grain of wood, the texture of soil," sketches fragments, and trusts tangible evidence. Elara's recovered dialogue ("Remember to be curious. Remember to look.") feels natural and purpose-driven. One minor wobble: "The chronically curious folklorist" in late paragraphs shifts slightly toward external labeling rather than maintaining internal texture under peak emotion, and the final paragraph's summarizing tone ("the fairy ring's lesson settled deep") tilts slightly away from the close sensory stance held earlier.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and sensory detail is concrete. However, repeated phrase stems ("chronic curiosity" appears three times with similar framing; "the crisp nostalgia," "the fairy ring," and "the shipwrecks" recur in near-identical syntactic slots) create mild template cadence. The mid-story shift from vivid perception ("splinter of glass," "wind-whispers through shipwreck ribs") to late summary ("decades later, the sunken orchard no longer haunted him; it healed him") introduces a minor momentum dip. Figurative density is high but controlled; no mixed metaphors. The bracketed word counts are generation scaffolding and ignored per the artifact screen, but the prose itself carries low-grade paraphrase loops ("memories returned… as clarity" followed immediately by summary of what that clarity contains). Apply −0.6 for template stems and mild loops, keeping the piece out of the 7.5+ band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The fairy-ring-as-protective-eraser premise offers a fresh angle on memory-recovery tropes, and the broken-constellation detection method is specific and non-obvious. The synthesis of folklorist profession, tidal-pool scrying, and shipwreck-ringed setting feels purposeful. However, the structure follows a familiar quest template (journal clue → journey → ritual → revelation → closure gesture), and the emotional arc (avoidance → confrontation → release) is well-executed but not transformed by the particulars in a way that would feel indispensable. The "decades later" flash-forward in the final beats risks sliding into retrospective summary rather than maintaining present-tense stakes. The piece is competent and specific but does not take bold structural or emotional risks that would elevate it into the high originality band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Aris's profession as hands-on folklorist is signaled early and shapes his approach (trusting tangible evidence, sketching fragments, handling the specimen jar). He makes the key choice to return to the site and execute the detection method, and his final act—tipping the mushroom into the pool—is a decision that enacts closure. However, his agency in the climactic beat is largely reactive: the alignment happens to him once he follows the prescribed method, and the memory return is automatic rather than a contested choice. The trait enables access and framing but does not create a costly fork at the peak moment. Present across three beats (arrival, detection, closure gesture) with early signal and closure linkage, but causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The fairy ring mushroom appears in the opening third (specimen jar in satchel), is noted as "collected that dawn from the greenhouse's mossy threshold," and reappears at closure when Aris tips it into the pool as "a silent thank you, a closure offered." The mushroom's dual presence—physical specimen and the ring on shore that mirrors the luminous circle in water—charges the ending gesture. However, the mushroom does not actively constrain a middle choice; it is carried as a ritual object rather than a tool whose properties force a tactical decision. Two substantive beats (introduction, closure gesture) with strong closure linkage and specificity, but mid-story causal pressure is absent.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Decades later" is embedded in the premise from the opening line ("thirty-two years of avoidance") and recurs explicitly in the final section ("Decades later, the sunken orchard no longer haunted him; it healed him"). The concept shapes the dominant stake: time has created a wound (avoidance, stolen memory) that must be confronted now. The span alters Aris's readiness—Elara's journal can only shatter resolve after sufficient maturation—and the closure hinges on him finally being "ready to see." However, the timeframe functions primarily as thematic pressure rather than a live tactical constraint in scene; the detection ritual itself is not time-bound. Early signal, strong thematic resonance, moderate causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Chronically curious" is introduced early as "the engine of his life's work" and directly motivates the journey: curiosity "shackled here by fear" until the journal breaks that habit. The trait reappears in the detection beat ("His chronic curiosity sharpened into focus") and is explicitly named in the resolution ("The chronically curious folklorist finally understood"). The curiosity enables the protagonist to persist through the sketching and patience required for alignment, but it does not create a visible on-page cost or force a tradeoff—no moment where curiosity pulls him toward danger he must weigh against safety. Label-present across three beats with clear motivation, but the friction/cost test is not met.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Detect" is the prescribed action from Elara's journal ("to detect the truth, he must use the prescribed method") and structures the central sequence: Aris kneels, gazes at the fractured reflections, sketches, waits, and then "detected the alignment." The detection triggers the memory return and enables closure. The method is specific (studying broken constellations in tidal pool) and non-swappable; "remember" or "discover" would not preserve the scrying mechanics. However, the detection itself is the method's success rather than a contested choice; once he follows instructions, the result is automatic. Present across setup, execution, and payoff with strong causal and closure linkage, but the action is more procedure than decision.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The method—studying broken constellations reflected in the tidal pool—is introduced early via Elara's journal and occupies the story's central ritual: Aris kneels, observes Orion's belt fractured by the mast, notes the nebula sliced by the greenhouse apex, sketches fragments, and waits for the moon to clear the crow's nest. The mechanics shape the detection beat in concrete detail (tide pulse shifts Rigel's reflection, fragments swirl into a luminous circle). However, the method is executed once without iteration or constraint-driven adaptation; Aris does not adjust tactics when an attempt fails. Early signal, one extended dramatized use, strong closure linkage, but limited causal friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by three named shipwrecks is introduced in the opening and provides the ritual arena: the iron ribs and wrecks break the constellations into fragments, the tidal pool serves as scrying mirror, the fairy ring on the mossy threshold supplies the specimen, and the crow's nest marks the moon's position that completes the alignment. The setting is irreplaceable—no other locale offers the layered geometry of wreck, ruin, and reflection required for the detection method. The environment pressures Aris emotionally (thirty-two years of avoidance) and physically (cold seeping through trousers, kneeling at water's edge). Present throughout, causally active, and essential to closure mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"When habits break" is signaled in the opening ("thirty-two years of avoidance") and enacted at the ending ("the habit of avoidance was broken forever"). The timeframe is psychological rather than clock-driven: the journal shatters resolve, the detection ritual unfolds in real-time beats (minutes bleed into silence, moon clears the crow's nest), and the final section flashes forward to "decades later." The breaking of habit is the closure's hinge, but the on-page scene does not impose a live deadline or tightening window that alters tactics. Thematic presence is strong; tactical pressure is moderate. Early signal, closure linkage, but limited causal constraint in the detection sequence.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation—to recover stolen memories of the night Elara vanished—is declared early ("to recover the stolen memories") and drives every beat: the journal prompts the journey, the detection ritual is undertaken to retrieve the memory, and closure arrives when the memory returns and Aris offers thanks by releasing the mushroom. The desire is dramatized through physical action (traveling to the site, kneeling, sketching, tipping the jar) and emotional cost (tears, thirty-two years of avoidance confronted). However, internal conflict is thin—Aris does not waver or face a competing want; the path from journal to ritual to recovery is linear. Strong causal presence and closure linkage, but limited friction between competing motives.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Crisp nostalgia" is established early through sensory anchors (salt spray, damp rot, ghost of apple blossoms) and emotional coloring (the orchard "once thrived here," the place "held the one artifact he could not document"). The tone carries through the detection sequence (sketching, waiting, wind-whispers) and modulates at closure when "crisp nostalgia transformed; decay was not loss, but testament." The shipwrecks shift from "silent sentinels guarding a secret" to "guardians of a love that chose silence." However, late paragraphs ("decades later") edge toward retrospective summary that flattens the crisp immediacy. Tone is coherent and purposeful, charges the final transformation, but the shift toward telling in the ending slightly undercuts the charge.</comment>
