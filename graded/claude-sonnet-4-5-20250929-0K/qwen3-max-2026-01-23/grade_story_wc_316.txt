<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kaela's motivation is clear but her interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("void," "silence after the storm," "numbness") rather than embodied contradictions. The union with the duplicate happens through statement and metaphor without micro-choices that reveal competing impulses in scene. The ending warmth ("grief for her journey, joy for this creation") reads as emotional arithmetic—tidy resolution rather than layered irrationality. No meaningful internal conflict acts simultaneously on the page; the protagonist moves smoothly from numbness to wholeness without visible struggle or tradeoff cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (void + memory archive → vivification). Orientation anchors arrive early. The vivification itself (fluid glows gold, pathways ignite) offers a visual change, but the "new consciousness" appears without on-page cost or foreclosed path—Kaela simply gains warmth and the custody battle "dissolves into irrelevance." No visible price is paid; the closure reads as reward without sacrifice. The ending reconfigures meaning thematically but lacks the felt or opportunity cost required for RR or CR at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo is anchored early with vivid particulars (worn planks, abyss below, moss-carved altar, open arches). Mountains flickering into oceans and treaties vanishing provide atmospheric texture. However, the environment does not constrain a tactical choice or materially charge the final image—the dojo functions as backdrop rather than pressure. The brain jar rests on the altar throughout without movement or spatial interaction that alters outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is defeating numbness; secondary is the custody battle (quickly dismissed). Kaela's placement of palms on glass and her spoken acceptance constitute the sole visible escalation beat—but this move meets no resistance and triggers immediate success (fluid glows, warmth floods). No on-page reversal narrows options or raises cost. The resolution arrives through declaration and metaphor rather than a choice that forecloses a path with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The complementary-opposites theme (void/memory, silence/storm, release/remembrance) is woven through the piece and returns in the final image ("two complementary truths held fast"). The ending offers a non-literal answer to "how to defeat numbness" by welcoming it as partner. However, the insight arrives via assertion rather than earned struggle—"she had not defeated numbness by force, but by welcoming it" is stated rather than dramatized through costly micro-choices. Thematic clarity is strong but lacks the on-page friction required for top-band resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Single POV with stable third-limited distance. Perceptual signature leans abstract ("hard-won clarity," "spacious awareness unburdened by past selves") rather than character-particular. Diction often elevates into essay register ("authentic vivification," "compassionate integration," "midwife life from loss") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated. The spoken line "I am the silence after the storm" reads as thematic statement rather than goal-driven dialogue. No head-hopping, but the prose lacks embodied texture under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "defeat numbness" / "shattering numbness" / "numbness was gone"; "custody battle dissolved" / "custody battle was forgotten"; "complementary opposites" recurs five times without evolving function. Template cadence runs through the final third ("History would keep rewriting… but on the floating rock"; "She had arrived… and found instead"; "In granting freedom, Kaela had reclaimed"). The closure paragraph stacks abstractions ("release and remembrance, silence and song," "compassionate integration," "authentic vivification") that dull the final image. Baseline −1.0 for loops and scaffold, escalated to −1.4 because artifacts touch closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The ego-death survivor using complementary opposites to vivify a duplicate brain offers conceptual promise, but the execution follows a predictable arc: isolated protagonist + symbolic ritual + immediate success + warmth replaces numbness. The custody battle frame is introduced then dismissed without transformation. "Slices through pretense" and "vivify" function as prompt labels rather than irreplaceable story engines. No bold risk elevates the material; the piece hedges toward abstraction and thematic summary instead of specific, lived-in transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kaela makes one visible choice (placing palms on the jar and speaking acceptance) that triggers vivification. She is present throughout and her post-ego-death void is the stated catalyst. However, most of her arc is conveyed through reflection and summary rather than a sequence of pressured decisions. Setup is clear, middle choice exists, and she is causally linked to closure—but the action is singular and decorative rather than multi-beat agency. Fits two gates (setup, closure); swappable frictions lower the score within the 5.0–6.9 band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The brain jar appears early on the altar, Kaela places palms on it mid-scene, and the fluid glows gold at vivification. Three touches across setup, middle, and closure. The jar's "DUPLICATE" label primes the custody-battle frame but the object itself does not constrain tactics—Kaela's interaction is gestural and the jar's state change (cerulean → gold) is passive result rather than active tool use. Fits all three gates but remains more symbol than causal lever; caps below 7.0 due to lack of specific cost tied to the object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Clone custody battle is named in paragraph two and invoked as backdrop ("raging across star systems," "no court could adjudicate this sacred symbiosis") but never dramatizes on-page pressure—no representative appears, no legal constraint alters Kaela's tactics, no competing claim tests her resolve. The concept frames thematic stakes (ownership vs. sacred creation) but does not shape scene choices. Present and thematically consistent but functionally ornamental; fits setup only, missing middle and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Slices through pretense" is declared twice as Kaela's attribute ("dojo-honed attribute slicing cleanly," "words slicing through nostalgia's pretense") but the trait is asserted rather than demonstrated—no on-page moment shows her cutting through a false claim or evasion with visible cost or tactical advantage. The final summary ("sliced through every pretense") retrospectively claims the work without showing the blade. Label-only use without embodied action or tradeoff; ornamental band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Vivification is the story's destination: Kaela's acceptance gesture triggers neural ignition, a new consciousness blooms, and her numbness shatters. The action appears in setup (stated goal), middle (the gesture and fluid transformation), and closure (warmth floods, new being emerges). However, the vivification itself is passive spectacle—light and glow—rather than a choice with on-page cost or tactical constraint. The action is indispensable to plot but arrives through declaration and metaphor rather than dramatized struggle. Fits all three gates and drives closure; specificity and cost connection are weak, holding the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Complementary opposites (void + archive, silence + storm, release + remembrance) is named early, governs Kaela's spoken acceptance, and structures the thematic resolution. The method is signaled in paragraph six ("ancient method demanded complementary opposites"), demonstrated in the acceptance beat, and reprised in the final image. However, the mechanics remain abstract—no specific ritual steps, no tactical tradeoff between opposition types, no cost paid for imbalance. The method frames the thematic answer but does not constrain scene choices or enable a tactic that another approach could not. Fits all three gates but replaceable in mechanics; mid 5.0–6.9 band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Floating rock dojo is anchored early with vivid particulars (planks, abyss, altar, open arches) and returns in the final image ("floating rock drifted serenely"). The setting provides atmosphere and thematic resonance (sanctuary → cradle of integrated being) but does not constrain Kaela's choices—no edge forces a retreat, no spatial feature alters her access to the jar or her acceptance gesture. Fits setup and closure (lyric reprise) but missing middle development; ornamental use with thematic echo reaches upper 4.0s under the lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>History rewriting itself is invoked four times as backdrop ("mountains flickered into oceans," "archives dissolved and reformed," "continents and conflicts below") but the phenomenon never imposes a deadline, alters Kaela's tactics, or threatens her work. Time is vague—no clock, no urgency signal. The rewriting serves thematic contrast (change outside vs. stillness within) but does not tighten decisions. Present in setup and reprised at closure but missing causal middle role; swappable with any static contrast device.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Defeating emotional numbness is Kaela's stated goal from paragraph four, dramatized through her acceptance gesture, and resolved when warmth floods her chest and numbness shatters. The motivation is coherent and drives the closure turn. However, the desire is told more than shown—Kaela's numbness is asserted ("frozen her since dissolution," "void no memory could fill") without embodied scenes of failed attempts or competing fears that would create friction. The motivation fits all three gates and is causally central, but the lack of conflicted micro-choices and visible tradeoff cost holds the score in the 6.0s.</comment>
