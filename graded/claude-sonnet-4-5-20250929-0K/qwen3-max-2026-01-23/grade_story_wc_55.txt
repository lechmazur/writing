<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is richly textured with embodied emotion (tear on cheek, trembling fingers), and the final shift from "haunted" to "harmonized" is motivated by the resonance experience. However, the epiphany relies heavily on abstract meditation ("not a betrayal of music, but its quiet cousin") rather than contradiction-in-action. The twenty-year gap and teenage tears are told rather than tested against present micro-choices that would reveal her hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elara accepts the transplanted dream by leaving the fork, forecloses the path of regret, and walks toward a reweighted future. Cost is visible (abandoning the original symphony, twenty years of sorrow) and the lens reads Accumulative/Textural—petrichor, crystal whispers, glacial hush all deepen until the final cadence shift. One minor causality stretch: the crystal "recognizing" her unwritten symphony feels convenient, though anchored in the fork's resonance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt is vividly realized through selective sensory detail (quartz facets, droplets, embedded crystals) and directly charges the closure when the tuning fork activates the resonance. Petrichor weaves scent into memory and healing. The monastery gardens, moss-eaten archway, and rain-drenched stone anchor orientation early. The tuning fork as micro-object constrains Elara's final choice (leaving it in the crevice) and operates as setting-as-tool, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (make peace with the abandoned dream) is signaled in paragraph five and tested at the climax when she presses the fork to the crystal. The resonance moment tightens options—she can no longer deny the continuity between her music and her clockwork. However, the escalation is largely internal and reflective; no external opposition or second character complicates the choice, and the cost (leaving the fork) feels more symbolic than materially consequential within this single visit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the crystal/fork/clock triad: creation persists in unexpected forms, regret softens through recognition rather than erasure. The final image (crystals whispering farewell, she carries "a quiet melody") reweights the opening burden without stating a moral. "Excruciatingly gentle integration of every fractured note" risks overt articulation but stays rooted in the fork's vibration traveling up her arm—embodied enough to avoid sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, anchored in Elara's perceptual signature (clock-oil stains, "introverted clock scribe"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the climax. However, diction drifts into elevated register under pressure ("benediction of acceptance," "liquid gold," "harmonized") that risks sounding authorial rather than character-particular for a working scribe. No dialogue to test; interior voice is lyric but occasionally generic ("warm, embracing silence").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Density is high and most lines do double duty (scent + memory, crystal + choice). Figurative language pervades: "glacial hush," "petrichor nostalgia," "excruciatingly gentle" appear in most high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching, risking decorative layering (−0.5). Paraphrase loops surface: "glacial hush" recurs four times, "excruciatingly gentle/gently" three times, "soundless sanctuary" bookends without functional evolution (−0.4 template cadence). "Petrichor" appears thrice in close succession. These artifacts cluster but do not obscure causality at closure, so deduction remains in Q7 only.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The clock-scribe-as-musician premise offers a non-obvious synthesis, and the crystal amplifying a latent frequency is a fresh inflection. However, the solitary pilgrimage to confront past regret is a familiar template, and the resolution (artistic path was valid all along) lacks the friction of competing goods or unavoidable harm. The story commits fully to its lyric vision but plays safely within the "closure as acceptance" median.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara chooses to kneel, press the fork, and leave it—three on-page decisions across beats. The final walk away alters her stance from "haunted" to "harmonized." However, most beats are observational or reflective; her agency is reactive rather than driving reversals.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt is seeded early (paragraph seven), handled at mid-story (she kneels, presses fork to crystal), returns with reweighted meaning at closure (whispering farewell), and its resonance property directly enables the climactic turn. Essential across beats and ending; near-indispensable but the droplet chorus remains somewhat passive backdrop.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Glacial hush" appears in the opening, recurs at mid-story to frame her bearing of memory, and transforms in the final third from "cold emptiness" to "warm, embracing silence." It shapes her stance by naming the emotional texture she must inhabit and reweights at closure, meeting setup/development/payoff gates.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Excruciatingly gentle" constrains her movement ("each step a reverence"), her handling of the fork, and the final integration metaphor. It enables the tone but does not foreclose a path or create visible cost; she could be "careful" or "tender" with minor edits. Present across beats but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Bear" drives the climax: she kneels to "bear the memory" (rejection, shame), then "bears" the truth that her work is music's cousin. The verb recurs with evolving stakes and directly articulates the closure shift from burden to integration. Essential to the arc but slightly abstract; a more physical enactment would cement indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The "soundless sanctuary" frames the opening and closing, provides the spatial container (monastery, archway, forecourt), and its silence/whisper paradox charges the tuning-fork resonance. The setting enables the climactic choice (crystal as amplifier) and reappears in the final line to hold her secret. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Hidden sunrise" anchors time early, the warming sun triggers droplet falls mid-story, and the sunrise "clearing the wall" gilds the crystals at closure. Time progression is legible and tightens the window of her visit, though it does not create urgency or alter her tactics—she could complete this ritual at any hour.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The desire to "make peace with an abandoned dream" is stated in paragraph five, tested when she presses the fork and hears the opening tone, and resolved when she leaves the fork and walks lighter. The friction between her regret and her scribe-work creates internal conflict across beats. Slightly told-heavy but causally active.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Petrichor nostalgia" is concretely embodied (scent of rain, earth, "unlocking summers"), recurs when a tear mixes with petrichor on her cheek, and transforms to "smell of healing, closure" at the end. Tone modulates from sorrow to acceptance and charges the final image. Coherent through turns and essential to the emotional arc.</comment>
