<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's scholarly patience and meticulous nature are established through concrete action (sitting for hours with corrupted runes, precise chalk work). Her motivation is clear and her agency drives the closure—inserting the key, correcting the rune—with visible cost in three seasons of study consumed. However, interiority remains somewhat generic ("profound peace," "tears tracing clean paths") and her internal contradictions are minimal; she proceeds with competent certainty rather than wrestling with doubt or risk in the moment of execution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The causal chain is clean: corrupted runes → relearned symbols → corrected glyph → orrery completion → sealed awakening revealed. Orientation anchors (Elara, observatory, post-Spoon-Bending) arrive early. The closure—a Resonant Reconfiguration where shadows are revealed as sheltered rather than destroyed—lands on the page with conceptual cost (three seasons consumed, a "frayed thread" mended). One weakness: the orrery's resistance is telegraphed ("She had anticipated this resistance") rather than dramatized as a live surprise, slightly flattening the peak turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The nocturnal observatory on a floating isle is vividly rendered (brass telescopes, moonlight on star charts, stone chamber echoes) and the orrery's mechanics—crystal planets on brass rails, the amber sun-globe—constrain Elara's method. The corrected rune on the control panel and the shimmering veil are charged details that support the closure image. However, the floating isle itself and the "nebula-strewn void below" function primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than applying direct pressure to her choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding where shadows go at noon—is signaled early and tightens when the orrery shudders at zenith, forcing Elara to apply the relearned rune under pressure. The cost is visible: three seasons of study, the need to relearn foundational symbols, and the final corrective act that closes the loop. Agency is clear throughout; Elara's decisions (key insertion, rune correction) drive the resolution. Minor issue: the resistance beat ("gears grinding") resolves quickly without sustained escalation or a secondary complication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the sealed awakening as shelter rather than destruction, loops that must be closed to mend reality, knowledge requiring patient relearning. The final image—shadows returning at simulated sunset—reweights the mystery without moralizing. However, the closing lines veer toward thematic summary ("the first of many sealed awakenings awaiting those willing to relearn the world's new grammar") rather than trusting the image alone, and "profound peace" abstracts the emotional payoff.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third, and Elara's perceptual signature—ink-stained fingers, meticulous focus on runes—is distinct. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("quietly deliberate," "corrupted instructions"). Weakness: some phrases slip into elevated abstraction ("eyes reflecting starlight," "tears tracing clean paths through dust") that feel decorative rather than character-specific, and the prose occasionally favors poetic distance over embodied immediacy under peak pressure (the rune-correction beat is cleanly executed but lacks visceral stakes).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high; the orrery mechanics and rune-correction sequence advance clearly. Minor loops appear: "quietly deliberate" recurs three times, "The celestial loop was closed" immediately followed by "In that instant of perfect completion" paraphrases the same closure moment, and "shadowed… sheltered… conserving" in the sanctuary description stacks near-synonyms. The parenthetical word counts at line ends are generation artifacts but do not obscure meaning. Overall clarity is strong, but the loops and a few stock phrases ("tears tracing clean paths") prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—post-spoon-bending reality where shadows vanish at noon, accessed via clockwork ritual—is specific and fresh. The sealed-awakening concept (shadows sheltered in a pocket dimension) transforms the mystery into a conservation rather than loss, which feels earned. However, the scholarly-protagonist-solves-magical-mystery-via-ancient-mechanism follows a familiar template, and the resolution lacks a bold risk or non-obvious complication; Elara anticipated the resistance and her corrective action succeeds on first attempt without moral calculus or surprising cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's choices—inserting the key, turning it twice, redrawing the corrected rune—create the key turns and drive the closure. Her scholarly patience enables the relearning and precise execution. Present in setup, middle action, and closure participation with clear causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The clockwork automaton key appears in two beats: Elara holds it ("felt cool and purposeful"), then inserts and turns it to engage the orrery. It enables the mechanical closure and returns at the end ("felt warm against her palm"), reweighted by success. Solid integration, though the key's unique properties (star-metal, interlocking gears) are described but not functionally differentiated from a generic key.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sealed awakenings frame Elara's hypothesis, shape her method (completing a perfect cycle to trigger the awakening), and deliver the closure revelation (the shadow sanctuary). The concept alters options throughout and is indispensable to the story's logic and final image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Quietly deliberate" is invoked three times and constrains Elara's approach (sitting for hours, careful rune correction). It enables her success under pressure but the trait is told more than shown in costly tradeoff; the story asserts her patience without dramatizing a moment where haste would tempt her or where deliberation exacts visible opportunity cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Relearn" drives the major turns: the Great Spoon-Bending forced scholars to relearn foundational languages, Elara's relearning of the solar runes provides the corrected zenith glyph, and that correction enables the orrery's completion. The action is signaled early, recurs in the critical beat, and is irreplaceable; removing it breaks the closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closing loops is the method from hypothesis through execution: the orrery's mechanical gears, the sun's daily journey, the conceptual loop. It shapes Elara's tactics (inserting the key, correcting the rune to close the cycle) and is explicitly named at closure ("The celestial loop was closed"). The mechanics matter and the method is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The nocturnal observatory on a floating isle provides vivid atmosphere (brass telescopes, star charts, stone chamber) and houses the orrery, which is essential. However, the floating-isle aspect and the "nebula-strewn void" do not constrain Elara's choices or alter her tactics; the setting functions primarily as backdrop. The orrery itself—part of the setting—charges the closure, lifting the score into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The post-spoon-bending timeframe establishes the world's altered rules (shadows vanishing at noon, runes shifting meaning) and fuels Elara's motivation. It shapes the premise and the relearning requirement, appearing in setup and middle exposition. Less visible at closure, where the timeframe's ongoing pressure is implied but not actively dramatized in the final image.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Finding where shadows go at noon is Elara's stated motivation, frames her three-season study, and drives the hypothesis and execution. The closure directly answers the question (shadows sheltered in a pocket dimension). The desire is clear and causal, though the motivation is told rather than shown through conflicted internal friction or competing wants during the attempt.</comment>
