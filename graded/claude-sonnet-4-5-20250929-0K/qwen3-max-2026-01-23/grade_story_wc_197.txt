<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's core motivation (holding the line against indifference) is clear and shapes her final stance, but interiority remains largely declarative rather than embodied—"quiet, fierce vow" and "spirit unbroken" label states without contradictory impulses acting in scene. The decision to stand and face enforcers reads more as thematic posture than a choice with visible internal cost or foreclosed alternatives. Backstory dominates the first third without anchoring in present micro-choices that alter tactics, flattening pressure until the lagoon sequence begins.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (archival truth reappearing through light and water). Closure lands as Charged Poise: Elara stands firm, truth broadcast, enforcers arriving—options crystallized, cost felt in her refusal to flee. However, the cost remains asserted ("unshakable peace") rather than dramatized through a specific forfeiture or bodily consequence, and the because/therefore links in the middle third (hoofprint → willow alignment → ironwood grove) feel mechanically sequential rather than pressure-driven.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The auric lagoon's mineral properties enable the broadcast, directly constraining tactics and charging the final image—environment shapes the climactic choice. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful (damp earth, cobwebbed booth, dust motes), and spatial choreography remains clear throughout. However, the "vast tapestry of stars" and "golden screen" veer toward postcard lyricism in places, and the ironwood grove materializes without prior spatial priming.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake (broadcasting suppressed census records before capture) is clear and tightens once when enforcers close in. The puddle-map, key, and projector sequence provides a meaningful escalation under the Accumulative lens, but Elara's agency reads passive—she follows pre-established steps (whispered legends, hidden booth, coded signal) rather than making a difficult trade-off that narrows live options. The enforcers' arrival supplies external pressure but no on-page cost that alters her tactics or stance; she simply stands and smiles.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme (memory vs. erasure, light countering indifference) emerges organically from the archival action and auric broadcast without overt thesis statements. The phone-booth key and auric waters accumulate symbolic weight across beats. However, the final paragraph's "light always finds a surface" and "unshakable peace" drift toward moralizing abstraction, and "coded freedom" and "tyranny of indifference" repeat as prompt labels rather than evolving through scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and specific to an archivist's perceptual filter (ledgers, microfilm, census records), and psychic distance modulates purposefully at key beats. Weakness: elevated register ("defiantly restored," "unignorable counter-narrative," "spirit unbroken, alight with the quiet fire") in peak moments pulls away from embodied immediacy, and sentence stems recur ("Her motivation was," "Her hands steady," "She had chosen," "She had used").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in the lagoon sequence; no major grammatical errors or continuity breaks. However, paraphrase loops and thematic restatements accumulate: "hold the line" / "the line was held," "revised histories" appears six times, "tyranny of indifference" twice in identical phrasing, and "truth" / "reappear" / "coded freedom" cycle without added pressure. Template cadence in the final third ("She had chosen… She had used… She took… She turned") and filter-verb stacks ("she studied," "she followed," "she carried," "she felt") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats. Applying −0.8 total for loops and stems touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The auric-lagoon broadcast mechanism offers a fresh synthesis of archival resistance and natural optics, and the phone-booth relic is a specific, non-obvious choice. However, the underestimated-rebel-exposing-state-lies premise closely tracks a widely used template, and the emotional arc (lone archivist → defiant guardian) follows a familiar trajectory without transformation through lived cost or moral ambiguity. The piece commits fully to its concept but does not take structural or perspectival risks that heighten stakes beyond the expected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and identified as "underestimated rebel" and "archivist." Her choices drive the sequence (following the map, unlocking the booth, aiming the projector, standing firm), satisfying setup, development, and payoff gates. However, these are pre-plotted steps from "whispered legends" rather than decisions that narrow live options under pressure—she executes a plan without visible trade-offs or improvisation, trending mid-band for functional but replaceable agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The phone booth key appears early ("cold, tarnished object"), unlocks the hidden booth at midpoint (causal pressure: no key, no records), and is held warm in her palm at closure, symbolically reweighted ("no longer a relic but a symbol: some doors, once opened, stay open"). Three-gate integration with closure linkage and specificity (stamped logo, gritty resistance, decisive click). Cost connection is implied but not dramatized—she uses it without forfeiture—capping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Revised histories" shapes the dominant stake (restoring erased census records vs. state narratives), appears in early motivation, drives the microfilm discovery, and reappears in the final image ("revised histories now faced an unignorable counter-narrative"). Three gates met with causal pressure and closure participation. However, it functions more as framing context than a mechanic that alters Elara's tactics on the page—she broadcasts truth regardless—limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Carefully resourceful" is asserted early ("Moving with careful resourcefulness") and implied in her measured steps and satchel preparation, but the trait is never tested with a visible trade-off or constraint—she has the key, projector, and time without scarcity forcing improvisation. Present in setup but absent from a choice with cost, missing development and payoff gates. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Reappear" structures the premise (silenced communities reappear via broadcast), drives the climactic projector sequence ("Names flickered to life… defiantly restored," "truth was already traveling, beginning to reappear"), and charges the final turn ("The truth had reappeared"). Three gates met with strong causal role and closure linkage. However, the action could be substituted with "reveal" or "broadcast" with minor edits, slightly reducing irreplaceability and capping below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The puddle-reflection map is signaled early ("method passed through whispered legends"), enacted at dusk (hoofprint mirror, willow branch aligns with Venus, ripples etch path), and referenced at closure ("puddle at her feet… reflection showed… her own calm eyes"). Three gates with specificity (dusk timing, willow/Venus alignment) and lyric reprise. However, the mechanics feel ornamental—Elara could reach the grove by conventional navigation—and the map does not constrain a mid-scene choice, limiting causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The auric lagoon's mineral properties are essential: they amplify the signal, transform water into a "golden screen," and enable the satellite broadcast—without this exact setting, the climax fails. Present in the opening frame, causally active at the projector beat, and charged in the final image ("auric lagoon would forever bear witness"). Three gates with high irreplaceability, causal pressure, and closure linkage. Minor reduction: early mention is atmospheric rather than immediately stake-linked, and cost (capture risk) ties to the act, not the lagoon's unique constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"When plans unravel" frames the inciting incident (network compromised at dusk, Elara sole keeper), drives urgency throughout (she must broadcast before capture), and the enforcers' arrival at closure makes the timeframe's cost unmistakable. Three gates with causal pressure and closure participation. However, the ticking clock remains abstract—no on-page moment where elapsed time forces a tactical choice or sacrifice—preventing the element from reaching indispensable territory.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To hold the line against the tyranny of indifference" is stated early, drives her decision to broadcast despite risk, and reappears at closure ("The line was held"). Three gates met with thematic coherence. However, the motivation is declared rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or a visible internal cost—she never hesitates, considers flight, or sacrifices a competing value—trending functional but not irreplaceable. Removing this exact phrasing and substituting "restore truth" would not break story logic.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Coded freedom" appears as a tonal anchor ("This broadcast was coded freedom itself") and reprises in the final lines ("quiet fire of coded freedom"). Tone is coherent and modulates from archival solemnity to defiant resolve. However, the phrase functions more as thematic label than enacted atmosphere—tone would hold with "resistance" or "liberation"—and the story does not teach what "coded" means through scene mechanics. Present in middle and closure but swappable, trending mid-band for lyric consistency without irreplaceability.</comment>
