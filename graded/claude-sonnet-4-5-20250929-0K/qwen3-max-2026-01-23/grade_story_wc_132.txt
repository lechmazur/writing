<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's shift from control to acceptance is dramatized through concrete micro-choices (returning the linden leaf, leaving bent branches, planting hostas), and her interiority shows embodied emotion ("tear traced soil on her cheek"). However, the emotional progression leans toward summary in places ("felt both sacred and solitary"), and the epiphany arrives too cleanly without genuine struggle or visible cost that forecloses a prior path. The "circuitously sincere" trait is claimed but not demonstrated through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening beat; the piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) as Elara shifts from "commander to companion." The closure lands on-page with a felt cost (releasing control, awaiting storms with curiosity rather than dread), and the final image reweights the opening mossy trellis. One meaningful deepening occurs through the linden-leaf insight that alters her tactics (leaving damage, planting with change). The lens holds, though the cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mossy trellis is grounded early with vivid, selective detail ("emerald velvet," "moss-thickened trellis") and returns at closure, constraining Elara's final choice to plant hostas and touch the wood. The setting shifts subtly (storm-damaged areas, bent willow, stone bench) and these micro-settings alter her tactics. Sensory hierarchy reflects her professional lens (clover seeding, moss thriving), and spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elara's need to control versus nature's autonomy—is signaled early and tightens through the linden-leaf insight that narrows her options (stop repairing, plant with change). One meaningful deepening occurs when memory of the bent oak reframes her method, and the final stance crystallization (awaiting storms with curiosity) forecloses her prior ritual with felt cost. However, the escalation operates more through reflection than concrete pressure forcing a trade-off; the cost is legible but not viscerally tested on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (control versus collaboration with change) emerges from the linden leaf, moss, and bent oak particulars, and the final image (palm on trellis, "graceful, enduring flow") offers a non-literal answer. Yet the piece edges toward overt statement in places ("The method for true reconstruction was not force, but releasing control") and the closing lines risk moralizing ("sustained not by resistance, but by graceful, enduring flow"). The willow story in dialogue with Mrs. Higgins reads as thematic echo, slightly undercutting earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third with a distinct perceptual signature (professional nursery owner noticing moss, violets, clover) and rhythmic control under pressure. The brief dialogue with Mrs. Higgins feels natural and advances theme without exposition. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("circuitously sincere," "sustaining transformation") that clashes with the grounded voice, and the closing lines compress multiple abstract concepts in quick succession, softening immediacy at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is clear and sentence openings vary, with strong information density in places (linden leaf imagery, oak memory). However, pervasive scaffold appears: "metamorphosis" / "transformation" / "reconstruct" recur as synonym churn across adjacent lines and paragraphs (lines 44, 57, 119, 126, 137, 187, 245, 274), and template cadence runs through multiple "she [verb]" openers in the middle third. The final paragraph stacks abstract nouns ("reluctant metamorphosis," "graceful, enduring flow") where a concrete image would sharpen closure. Aggregate artifact penalty applies; these loops dull the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The core premise—nursery owner learning to accept rather than control nature—follows a familiar template (nature-as-teacher epiphany) without a non-obvious angle. The linden leaf and mossy trellis particulars add texture, but the emotional arc (control → release) and the catalyst (seeing beauty in change) do not transform the template through specific lived conflict or moral calculus. The piece commits to its premise but does not offer a fresh inflection that would make the synthesis feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara's choices create the key turn (returning the linden leaf, walking away without repair, planting hostas, touching the trellis at closure). Present across setup, middle, and ending with causal pressure that narrows options. Scores in the mid-6s for beat involvement and closure linkage, constrained by some summary-only passages.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The linden leaf is handled in three distinct beats (lifting, examining its veins, returning it to the moss) and its properties (edges tinged gold, veins mapping surrender) shape Elara's insight that alters her tactics. Returns at closure via implication (sustaining transformation). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; irreplaceable particulars elevate the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Reluctant metamorphosis is present in Elara's shift from control to acceptance and shapes the dominant stake. The concept is named explicitly multiple times (lines 44, 187, 274) but mostly echoed as theme rather than constraining on-page choices with visible cost. Functions more as thematic frame than tactical driver; mid-band for concept-to-choice integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Circuitously sincere is claimed in the opening ("words were circuitously sincere") and again in dialogue context (line 197), but no on-page action demonstrates the trait constraining or enabling a choice with cost. Remains label-only without embodied tradeoff; ornamental mention caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Reconstruct anchors the inciting ritual (staking, pruning, covering roots), the insight ("method for true reconstruction"), and the ending shift (no repair planned, planting with change). Present across three beats with causal pressure; the word's meaning evolves from physical repair to philosophical stance. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage; swappability reduced by the specific ritual details.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Releasing control is seeded early ("tightened with control," line 57), dramatized at the turn ("release," line 119), and enacted in the ending (leaving damage, open hands at dusk). The method shapes her final tactics (planting hostas, awaiting storms) and charges the closure image. Present in setup, middle choice, and ending; causal and closure linkage solid; slight swappability keeps it from higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mossy trellis appears in the opening frame, mid-story as Elara reframes it ("collaboration, drinking rain, shielding wood"), and at closure (palm on trellis, feeling earth's pulse). The moss constrains her choice to plant hostas "beneath the moss-thickened trellis" and charges the final tactile image. Strong across all three gates with causal and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Storm season frames the opening ("drenched the valley for weeks") and the ending ("no longer dreaded the next storm"), providing temporal context and stakes. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or alter tactics beat-to-beat; it functions more as backdrop than pressure mechanism. Present in setup and ending with thematic reweighting but minimal causal development in the middle.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The motivation to study plant behaviors is stated in the opening ("motivation—to study plant behaviors under duress") and enacted through observation beats (storm-damaged areas, bent willow, violets). Yet the desire remains largely told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices; her shift is more philosophical than driven by friction between study-as-control and study-as-collaboration. Functional but mostly ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Sustaining transformation is coherent throughout: gentle shifts (returning leaf, planting hostas), persistent imagery (moss, violets), and the closing "graceful, enduring flow." Tone modulates subtly from anxious inventories to wonder-filled notes and charges the final image. The tone is apt and stable, though the closing lines risk over-articulation ("sustaining transformation," "graceful, enduring flow") that slightly flattens the tonal charge.</comment>
