<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's face blindness motivates her method (reading souls not faces), but the trait functions mostly as backstory explanation rather than constraining present choices at the quarry. Her discovery sequence shows methodical observation, yet the internal contradiction between seeking to "awaken empathy in others" and her own "guarded solitude" is told rather than enacted through competing impulses in scene. The final tears and ignited empathy arrive as assertion—"Clara's courage had ignited it within her first"—without prior dramatized resistance or cost that would make the shift credible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the quarry investigation layers sensory details and objects (moss, flint, carving, journal) toward a final reconfiguration where Elara reframes Clara's disappearance as "freedom" rather than loss. Closure arrives on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—the ribbon fragment placed against carved stone, vow sealed, dormant empathy "now breathed"—but the cost is abstract and told ("she would stir the dormant empathy") rather than a visible forfeiture or changed option. Orientation anchors who/where/when promptly; the structure is a single continuous scene in one location, fitting 600–800 scope defaults.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The quarry's physical particulars—limestone cliffs, mist, rusted machinery, moss-slick stones, submerged ledge—constrain Elara's search and supply the hidden niche that reveals the journal. The flint shard ("honed by time and river") functions as a micro-setting tool that enables the lance action. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("mist clung to limestone cliffs like breath held too long," "furrowed hush broken only by dripping water"), and the setting charges the final image when sunlight burns through mist to gild the walls, transforming "tomb of secrets" into "cradle of hard-won peace."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—remembering Clara beyond a faded photograph—is signaled early. The discovery tightens when the hairline seam reveals the journal, but the shift from "cold case" to "freedom from a gilded cage" is Clara's choice, not Elara's, so escalation lacks protagonist agency at the turn. The resolution rests on Elara's realization and vow to return with the unified story, which is a stance crystallization (fits Accumulative lens) but carries only abstract future cost ("promise carried forward") rather than a present price paid or option foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme of unifying opposites—"delicate and brutal, hidden and exposed," silk and stone, concealment and truth—emerges through action and image rather than statement. The crimson fragment beside the carved mask delivers the resonance without moralizing. However, the epiphany ("Clara's courage had ignited it within her first") and the assertion that "Empathy, once dormant, now breathed" feel stated rather than earned by specific struggle, and the final lines risk sermonizing ("resilience etched in stone, love woven into silk") when the prior image already carried that weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Elara with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature shows her tactile focus ("fingers, trained to read texture over expression") and method. Diction remains controlled except for one slip into elevated register—"lance the moss away—a precise, piercing motion to unveil what time had buried"—where "unveil what time had buried" reads more authorial than character-particular. The prose reflects her methodical mind, and interior voice stays coherent under pressure, though some phrases ("her core motivation crystallize") feel slightly outside her lived lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and density is generally high, but several passages loop or restate without added pressure: "silence pressed against Elara's ears" immediately follows "furrowed hush broken only by dripping water"; "She ignored the vast emptiness, focusing on minute disruptions" then lists three near-synonyms (scuff, displaced pebble, thread of intention). The template stem "The [noun] was [state]" recurs four times in the final third ("quarry walls," "quarry was no longer," "weight was not," "steps were lighter"), creating mild cadence monotony. Mixed metaphor: mist "clung...like breath held too long" anthropomorphizes mist, then "furrowed hush" personifies silence without coherent vehicle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Face-blind portrait artist pursuing cold cases offers a fresh synthesis, and the unifying-opposites frame shapes the investigation. However, the emotional arc—guarded investigator finds empathy through victim's courage—follows a familiar template, and the resolution (journal revealing voluntary disappearance, investigator vows to share the story) does not transform the premise in an unexpected way. The quarry carving as Clara's "true portrait" is a graceful turn but anticipated once the dual-worlds theme is stated early.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Present by opening paragraph (setup); her methodical observation drives the moss-excavation beat (development); she appears in the ending vow and departure (payoff gate met). Her face blindness shapes her interpretive lens ("painted souls, not faces") but does not constrain a key choice—she would follow the same investigative steps with or without prosopagnosia. The trait colors backstory and voice but remains ornamental to on-page causality.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Introduced early as "tiny, frayed fragment...torn during a final embrace" (setup); Elara holds it to crystallize motivation and later matches it to the carved ribbon (development across two beats); placed against the carved stone mask in the ending vow (closure participation). The fragment enables the match that confirms the carving's authorship, so it carries causal weight. Swappable with another token keepsake (locket, letter) with minor edits; specificity (crimson silk) adds texture but not irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Present in opening context ("cold cases, where forgotten victims deserved remembrance") and ending reflection ("Clara was not a cold case file"). The concept frames Elara's general mission but does not alter on-page tactics at the quarry—her investigation proceeds as character study and physical search, not procedural cold-case work. No evidence-review beats, witness interviews, or investigative protocols that would make "cold case" essential rather than thematic backdrop.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Stated early ("her methodical nature turning limitation into profound insight") and demonstrated in the moss-excavation sequence: "ignored the vast emptiness, focusing on minute disruptions," "traced moss-slick stones," "surgical reverence." The trait enables her to find the hidden groove and niche. However, the cost/constraint test is weak—being methodical here is purely advantageous with no visible tradeoff (e.g., missing a time-sensitive clue, alienating a companion). Functional in one beat but lacks friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: flint shard retrieved from satchel; development: "lance the moss away—a precise, piercing motion," "flint parted the damp veil slowly, each slice a quiet act"; payoff: the lancing reveals the carving and seam, unlocking the journal. The action is causally essential—without it the niche remains hidden—and the verb "lance" (surgical, piercing) unifies with the physical act and metaphor of piercing oblivion. The mechanics are specific and the exactness matters; "cut" or "scrape" would dilute the image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Announced in opening reflection ("unify opposites—the delicate and the brutal") and echoed in the ending realization ("the solution lay in unifying opposites...stone and silk"). The method is told as philosophy but not enacted as a problem-solving tactic on the page—Elara does not face a choice where she must reconcile two conflicting approaches to advance. The unification occurs in interpretation (reading Clara's dual worlds) rather than shaping investigative mechanics. Present and thematic but does not constrain attempts.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: "Blackwater Quarry, where mist clung to limestone cliffs"; development: the submerged ledge, moss, and hidden niche are quarry-specific resources that enable discovery; payoff: sunlight burns through mist, gilding walls, transforming the quarry from tomb to cradle. The mist and water pressure the search (visibility, slick surfaces) and the verticality (cliffs, ledge) supplies the hiding place. Could the carving be hidden elsewhere? Yes, but the quarry's stone-carving context and concealment logic make it purposeful rather than arbitrary.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Mentioned once in the setup ("sole physical clue...had vanished from evidence storage six months ago") but does not tighten on-page decisions or tactics. Elara does not race a deadline, face interference from the theft, or adapt her approach because the evidence is missing—she has the fragment from Clara's sister and proceeds to the quarry. The timeframe is backstory rather than a live clock shaping moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stated early ("to awaken dormant empathy in a town that had sealed its grief away") and returns in the ending claim ("she would stir the dormant empathy"). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized—no on-page beat shows Elara wrestling with how to reach the town, facing their resistance, or sacrificing a safer path to honor Clara's memory. The shift ("she had sought to awaken empathy in others, but Clara's courage had ignited it within her first") is asserted without friction or visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Introduced in the first quarry paragraph ("furrowed hush broken only by dripping water," "silence pressed against Elara's ears") and sustained through discovery beats ("quiet act of defiance," "choked breath"). The tone modulates at closure when "the furrowed hush now humming with quiet resolution" and sun burns through mist, gilding the scene. The shift from oppressive to peaceful hush charges the final image and supports the RR. Coherent across beats and legible in the ending turn.</comment>
