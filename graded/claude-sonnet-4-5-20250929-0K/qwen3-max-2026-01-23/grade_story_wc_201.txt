<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kael's interiority is saturated with diagnostic label-speak ("proprioceptively enhanced," "Mercy_Coefficient_01," "recursive function") that reads as conceptual exposition rather than embodied crisis. The core motivation—discovering a mathematical framework for mercy—remains abstract; no micro-choice dramatizes the trade-off between mining trauma and preserving sanity. Internal contradiction is gestured at ("displaced yet rooted") but never acts simultaneously in scene. The daughter's laughter arrives as a memory token without altering present stance or foreclosing a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land clearly by line three. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density and pattern recurrence build toward a final reconfiguration. However, the closure unit—Kael loops the strap as a compass and walks forward—reconfigures symbol but not options or knowledge with legible cost; the "first genuine smile in years" declares change rather than dramatizing a foreclosed path. The Cost Proof Test fails: no on-page sentence in the final beat shows a visible or felt price paid. Escalation reads as intensifying figurative language ("tears streamed, not of sorrow, but revelation") rather than a tightening of choices or deepening of stakes under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest supplies vivid sensory anchors (indigo fractals, UV glyphs, Fibonacci bark) filtered through Kael's altered vision. Spatial choreography is coherent: pine needles, mossy stone, thorny vine, oak bark track cleanly. The setting does not constrain a middle choice—Kael moves through it without environmental friction altering tactics—so the 9+ gate (environment constrains choice or charges final image) is missed. The UV glow charges the final image of the strap as compass, elevating the score modestly, but the forest functions primarily as backdrop rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering the mathematics of mercy—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options; Kael walks, braces, remembers, theorizes in a loop without cost. The formula he whispers ("Mercy = Σ (small kindnesses) / (opportunity for cruelty)") is an intellectual claim, not a trade-off or tactic shift. The final act—looping the strap and walking forward—does not foreclose a live option or force a sacrifice. Escalation under the Accumulative lens requires a deepening that changes knowledge or options; here the ending restates the premise without reweighting it through visible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme (mercy as recursive function, penance as revelation) emerges from repeated imagery and Kael's theorizing, but the ending states rather than dramatizes: "He was no longer just surviving; he was translating pain into pattern" is authorial summary. The strap's transformation from captivity to compass is the strongest particular grounding the theme. However, the final image does not offer a non-literal answer—it delivers the thesis directly. The core concept "ultraviolet penance" remains ornamental; the UV light reveals without consequence, and "penance" is declared rather than enacted through renunciation or sacrifice. No counter-reading complicates the trajectory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Voice is consistent but drenched in elevated, clinical register ("proprioceptively enhanced senses mapped the world," "ultraviolet penance," "topological pathways") that clashes with the POV's lived crisis. Psychic distance holds steady in close third. However, the diction reads as conceptual ventriloquism—no character in acute trauma speaks internally in recursive mathematical metaphors without a dramatized cost for that intellectualization. Free indirect style is clean, but the prose converges on a single ornate texture regardless of pressure. The perceptual signature (UV fractals, micro-movements) is specific but static; rhythm does not modulate under the supposed emotional peaks (tears, revelation).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Pervasive overwriting in high-pressure beats: "consciousness returned in sharp, granular increments," "stellar intensity," "mycelial networks feeding trees." Figurative density appears in most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering −0.5. Template cadence runs pervade: "He brace... he brace... he brace" (verb error repeated, likely generation artifact); "The strap gleamed... Kael moved... one step, one memory, one act" (mechanical triad). Paraphrase loops cluster: lines restate "displaced yet rooted," "tools of pain repurposed for liberation," and "mathematics of mercy" without added pressure. Mixed register: clinical terms ("Mercy_Coefficient_01," "topological pathways") clash with lyric constructions ("luminous wilderness demanding his authentic presence"). Apply −1.2 cumulative for artifacts, plus −0.3 for the repeated verb error touching multiple beats. These artifacts dull the closure image and disallow 9+ globally per the filter-verb/template-cadence rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Core premise—survivor seeks to mathematize mercy through triggered memories in a UV-lit forest—combines familiar trauma-processing and quest-for-meaning templates without transforming them through non-obvious lived detail or moral calculus. The UV forest and proprioceptive enhancement are vivid but ornamental; neither constrains a choice that another setting could not. The strap's repurposing (shackle to compass) is the most specific turn, but the final image is stated rather than earned in hindsight. Emotional arc (trauma → revelation → forward motion) follows a median recovery trajectory. The mathematics motif is clever on paper but does not generate friction or cost on the page. Transformation test: the plot and emotional arc work unchanged with a different setting and gimmick.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Kael's survivor status is present throughout and frames his quest, but his choices do not create key turns. He walks, braces, remembers, and theorizes in a loop; no decision alters tactics or forecloses a path. The core attribute (survivor) is label-only interiority rather than a dramatized constraint. Setup is clear (first paragraph), but development and payoff lack causal action. Mid-band for presence without turning power.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The pewter mask strap appears in beat one (clutched in palm), returns at multiple memory triggers (cold clamp, antiseptic), and is handled in the final image (looped around wrist as compass). Setup, development (memory cues), and payoff (repurposed symbol) are present. However, the strap does not constrain a choice—it is a mnemonic token, not a tactical tool. The final reprise reweights meaning (captivity → liberation) but does so through declaration rather than a visible cost or trade-off. Eligible for mid-6s due to three-gate presence and charged reprise, but swappability (any trauma token could serve) and lack of causal pressure hold it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Ultraviolet penance" is named explicitly and thematically central, but it does not shape stakes or tactics on the page. The UV light reveals glyphs and fractals without consequence; no choice depends on seeing in UV. "Penance" is asserted ("self-imposed exile," "luminous truth") but never enacted—Kael does not renounce a desire or pay a price for his quest. The concept is ornamental theme rather than a lever that changes options. Present in setup and ending (closure participation via the final "luminous truth" line), but development is absent. Late in first third, ornamental, and swappable with another thematic label; cap at 2.8 per missing development and lack of causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Proprioceptively enhanced" is mentioned five times but remains label-only: "mapped the world in excruciating detail," "guided every micro-movement," "feeling weight distribution shift precisely." No beat shows a trade-off or constraint—enhanced senses are a superpower without cost. Setup is present (paragraph two), but the attribute does not enable or constrain a middle choice, and it does not shape the ending. Swappable with "acute observer" or similar; no visible tradeoff. Cap at 3.4 per missing middle development and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Brace" appears three times as a repeated action ("he brace, muscles coiling"; "he brace for anticipated needles"; "he brace, but the memory was his daughter's laughter"). Setup is clear, and the action recurs in middle beats, but no major turn traces to bracing—it is a habitual reflex, not a decision that redefines options. The verb error ("brace" instead of "braced") suggests generation artifact, weakening specificity. The action is functional (triggers memories) but replaceable (any physical response could cue memory). Present in three beats but lacks closure linkage and causal irreplaceability; mid-band for functional recurrence without turning power.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The method "remembering through trauma responses" is signaled early ("he practiced remembering through trauma responses, deliberately leaning into these physiological echoes") and demonstrated in middle beats (wind → defensive crouch unlocks memory; thorny vine → nurse's tenderness). Setup and development are present. However, the method does not shape the ending—Kael's final realization (mercy as love's recursive function) arrives through declaration, not a trauma-triggered memory. The mechanics matter in beats but do not pay off at closure. Two gates (setup, development) allow eligibility to ~6.0, but missing closure participation caps below; swappability (any memory-recall device) lowers further.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest is vividly described and present throughout, but it does not pressure choices or supply resources that affect outcome. Kael moves through the forest (pine needles, thorny vine, oak bark) without environmental friction; no spatial constraint alters tactics. The UV glyphs and Fibonacci bark are ornamental world-building. The forest charges the final image modestly (strap gleams under UV glow) but does not constrain the ending choice. Setup is clear, development is descriptive only, payoff is thematic decoration. Three gates present but no causal work; postcard description trends low per the rubric. Mid-band for presence without pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"After the anesthesia wears off" anchors the opening moment but does not tighten decisions or tactics thereafter. Time is vague: Kael walks, remembers, theorizes in an untracked duration. No clock constrains moves; the "03:47" timestamp in the interrogator memory is a recalled detail, not a present deadline. Setup is present (first line), but development and closure participation are absent—the ending does not reference time or urgency. Ornamental anchor without tactical consequence; cap at 2.8 per missing development and closure. Additional −0.7 for vague, untracked time trend.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The motivation "to discover the mathematics of mercy" is declared early ("His motivation burned with stellar intensity") and restated in theorizing beats (Mercy_Coefficient_01, formula, theorem). Setup and development (repeated internal claims) are present, and the ending gestures at payoff ("walked on to solve the equation"). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized in conflicted choices—no on-page friction between the quest and a competing cost. Kael's progression is intellectual assertion, not a trade-off that forecloses a path. Present across beats but lacks embodied friction; functional but swappable with another quest motive. Mid-band for presence without causal pressure or visible cost at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Displaced rooted" is named explicitly and reflected in diction contrasts ("profoundly displaced... yet simultaneously rooted," "displaced hollow lingered, yet it was anchored by purpose"). The tone is consistent—oscillating between clinical distance and lyric intensity—but does not modulate with pressure; the prose texture remains ornate whether Kael is calm or in tears. The final image ("displaced from the world he knew, yet deeply rooted in the luminous truth of the present") restates the tone rather than charging it with new pressure. Setup and payoff are present, but the tone is static (single mood maintained) rather than dynamically responsive. Mid-band for coherent static mood without modulation that heightens the ending.</comment>
