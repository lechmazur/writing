<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Leo's "resiliently positive spirit" is asserted repeatedly but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or genuine struggle—he remains serenely competent throughout the anomaly without embodied fear, doubt, or cost. The interior is often abstract ("his motivation crystallized with starlit clarity") rather than character-particular. The hourglass gesture and humming feel like external choreography without visceral stakes or a hierarchy of values under pressure. No meaningful change or renunciation occurs; he simply succeeds and smiles "deeper and wiser" without forfeiting a live option.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (ferry deckhand, twilight crossing). The piece reads as Hybrid leaning Accumulative/Textural: spectral imagery and pattern-language build density, but the ending relies on a causal solve (broadcast harmonic frequency, turn hourglass → timelines merge). The closure unit—docking safely, hourglass in hand—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: "permanent transient" etched in his soul), yet the conceptual cost is asserted rather than felt on the page; no prior option is visibly foreclosed, and the "collective intent" of other selves arrives without prior setup. The solution (harmonic broadcast via shanty and hourglass flip) lands abruptly in the grotto without prior cause-and-effect linkage to establish why this exact method would work.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The spectral grotto and starlight patterns are vividly rendered and purposeful: constellations map fractured timelines, the empty hourglass anchors the solve, and the setting directly shapes Leo's tactical choice (study patterns, broadcast harmonic). Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric. The "clocks run sideways" image is evocative but functions more as flavor than spatial constraint. Overall the grotto charges the closure image and constrains the method, meeting the 9+ gate test for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—merge timelines, restore passengers to safety—is signaled early and drives Leo's actions. However, escalation is minimal: Leo encounters the anomaly, enters the grotto, intuits the solution, and succeeds without setback, trade-off, or a narrowing of options. The radio's temporal echoes and clock's sideways spin complicate atmosphere but do not force a choice or reversal. The ending delivers a solve rather than a cost-laden tightening; passengers remain "unaware," so relational or social consequence is absent. One meaningful tightening (anomaly forces solve) is present but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—threshold guardian, fleeting cosmic moment as permanent mark—emerges through imagery (hourglass, starlight mandala, "permanent transient") rather than direct statement. The "interconnected patterns" motif recurs and shifts meaning at closure (spectral map → unified mandala → residual potential in the hourglass). However, the final paragraph risks thematic summary ("a bridge between worlds," "guardian of thresholds") that edges toward explanation rather than resonant image. The piece invites reflection on liminality and collective intent, but the ease of resolution undercuts thematic complexity; no moral ambiguity or counter-reading is offered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Leo; no head-hopping. Distance is controlled, and diction is elevated but consistent (though "resiliently positive" and "starlit clarity" read slightly generic). Perceptual signature is present in Leo's maritime idiom ("fender," "hull," "sea shanty") and calm focus. The prose modulates with scene pressure (short bursts during anomaly, longer reflection in grotto). However, filter verbs cluster in high-pressure beats ("watched," "understood," "saw"), and emotional interiority leans abstract ("motivation crystallized," "focused resolve") rather than embodied contradiction. No dialogue appears; the lone "Mayday" call is functional but does not carry subtext or advance character.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the grotto sequence. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "resiliently positive spirit" recurs three times with synonym drift ("not diminished but forged"), and the closure paragraph restates theme mechanically ("permanent transient," "bridge between worlds," "guardian of thresholds"). Figurative language is dense but occasionally strained: "motivation crystallized with starlit clarity" mixes registers, and "patterns fused into a single, brilliant mandala" is stock mystical imagery. Template cadence in the grotto: "He studied... He would broadcast... He poured..." No major line-level opacity, but cumulative minor artifacts and -0.4 for paraphrase loops in the final third lower the score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Vanishing commuter ferry" and "timelines merge via harmonic frequency/hourglass ritual" are familiar speculative templates. The grotto, starlight-as-map, and "clocks run sideways" offer atmospheric specificity, but the solve—humble deckhand intuits cosmic fix, turns empty hourglass, unity restores normalcy—follows a well-worn Chosen One pattern without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The "permanent transient" paradox is evocative but remains abstract. Leo's serene competence and the frictionless success lack the bold risk or synthesis that distinguish originality in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Leo (ardent ferry deckhand) is present throughout and makes the key turn: broadcast harmonic via radio, flip hourglass. Early setup (first paragraph), middle choice (grotto solve), and closure participation (docking, hourglass in hand) satisfy all three gates. However, "ardent" is label-only; his occupation shapes idiom and setting familiarity but the solve itself (humming, turning hourglass) is not uniquely deckhand-specific. Causal pressure is moderate; the role anchors voice and stakes but does not constrain the method with irreplaceable cost. Two distinct beats (anomaly response, grotto ritual) and closure linkage push into mid-6s, but swappability (another humble worker could perform the same gestures) and lack of visible trade-off cap below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Empty hourglass appears in grotto (mid-story) and returns at closure ("warm in his palm, humming with residual potential"). Two beats: first as focal point/declaration of renewal, second as charged keepsake. The element drives the solve (turning it triggers unity pulse) and charges the final image, contributing to closure. Early signal is absent (not mentioned until grotto), applying −0.3. Causal pressure is strong (gesture triggers climax), closure linkage undeniable, and specificity high (empty yet pulsing with potential is a distinct paradox). However, late first appearance and moderate irreplaceability (another ritual object could substitute with edits) keep it in upper-7s rather than 8+.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Vanishing commuter ferry shapes the inciting incident (ferry phases, railing flickers) and frames the dominant stake (restore passengers to safety). Setup is early (paragraph 3–4), development shown through sensory anomaly (deck insubstantial, radio temporal echoes), and closure participates (ferry docks safely, passengers unaware). The concept drives Leo's goal and the grotto's existence. However, the "vanishing" itself is passive backdrop after the initial shimmer; once in the grotto, the ferry is static and passengers are frozen in "mundane perception." The solve (harmonic broadcast) does not uniquely depend on ferry mechanics—any dimensional rift could substitute. Two gates (setup, closure) plus one middle complication (insubstantial deck) yield ~6.0 baseline; causal role in stakes and ending lift into mid-6s, but swappability and ornamental middle use prevent higher.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Resiliently positive" is asserted four times ("resiliently positive spirit," "not as denial, but as focused resolve," "not diminished but forged in starlight") but never constrains a choice or imposes visible cost. Setup is early (paragraph 1), but middle development is label-only (Leo remains calm without trade-off), and at closure the trait is simply declared "deeper and wiser." No on-page action shows the attribute enabling success *because* of positivity or forcing a cost (e.g., ignoring danger, delaying fear-response). The trait reads as character flavor rather than causal lever. One gate (setup) and ornamental use trigger caps; lack of dramatized friction or cost keeps score in low-4s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Radio is used twice with distinct function: Mayday call (paragraph 10) that reveals temporal fracture via echoes, and harmonic broadcast (grotto) that merges timelines. Early signal (radio cabin, paragraph 9), middle complication (temporal echoes replace static, revealing fracture scope), and closure causation (broadcast triggers unity pulse). The action is irreplaceable to the solve and specific (maritime radio → harmonic frequency). Causal pressure is strong (broadcast is the mechanism of resolution), and cost connection is moderate (Leo "poured his will" but no visible forfeit). Two beats, closure linkage, and high specificity elevate into mid-7s. Slight swappability (another transmitter could substitute) and modest visible cost prevent 8+.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Interconnected patterns" appear mid-story (grotto walls, starlight constellations mapping timelines) and shape the solve method (broadcast harmonic tuned to patterns, patterns flow to hourglass, fuse into mandala). Setup is late (grotto, past 40% mark), applying −0.3 cap to 4.6 per late-introduction rule, but the method drives two beats (study patterns, broadcast harmonic) and participates decisively at closure (mandala fusion, unity pulse). Causal pressure is high (the method is the solve), closure linkage strong, and specificity notable (patterns as dynamic map). The lyric reprise (interconnected patterns → unified mandala) reweights prior fracture imagery. Late arrival and modest irreplaceability (another cosmic diagram could substitute) constrain the score, but causal role and closure charge push into low-6s under lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Spectral grotto appears mid-story (paragraph 15) and supplies the solve resources: starlight patterns as timeline map, empty hourglass as focal point, still water as stage. Setup is late but the setting drives two beats (pattern study, hourglass ritual) and charges closure (grotto dissolves, ferry docks). Causal pressure is very high (grotto contains the tools and logic for resolution), closure linkage strong (transition from grotto to harbor marks success), and specificity undeniable (ancient stone, unseen constellations, black water create unique atmosphere). Late first appearance applies −0.3, but causal work across beats, closure transformation, and irreplaceable micro-setting (the grotto *is* the solve space) elevate into mid-7s. Swappability is low; removing the grotto breaks the method.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Clocks run sideways" appears once (paragraph 14, bridge clock with horizontal loops) as atmospheric marker of temporal anomaly. Setup is mid-story, development is flavor-only (no tactical pressure from time distortion), and closure ignores the timeframe (clocks not mentioned after grotto entry). One gate (middle mention) caps eligibility ~3.4 per missing-closure rule, but the image is vivid and specific, adding slight lyric charge. The timeframe does not constrain Leo's choices or tighten the solve window; he works "calmly" without urgency. Ornamental use and missing closure participation apply significant friction. Specificity and atmospheric contribution lift slightly above cap floor into mid-5s under lyric allowance, but lack of causal work or ending reprise prevents higher.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Motivation "to merge parallel timelines and restore them all to safety" is stated early (paragraph 8) and drives all subsequent action: radio call, grotto solve, hourglass gesture. Setup clear, middle development shown through Leo's study and broadcast, closure achieved (timelines merged, passengers safe). The desire is central and causal. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through contradictory wants or visible cost; Leo never wavers, doubts, or sacrifices a competing value. No friction between fear and duty, self and others, or method and morality. Two gates (setup, development, closure) and strong causal role yield ~6.0 baseline; specificity (merge timelines vs. generic "save people") adds +0.3, but lack of on-page conflict or trade-off (told-only desire) prevents higher band. Mid-6s reflects solid integration with missing dramatic tension.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Permanent transient" appears as closing image (final two paragraphs: "fleeting cosmic moment now etched permanently into his soul, a bridge between worlds"). Setup and middle development are absent; the paradox is articulated only at closure. One gate (closure mention) caps ~2.8 per missing-setup rule, but the tone attempts thematic charge (liminal guardian, threshold figure) that reweights Leo's role. However, the phrase reads as authorial summary rather than embodied image, and the tone shift from calm action to mystical reflection is abrupt rather than modulated. Lyric-resonance allowance and closure participation lift above cap floor into low-5s, but late first appearance, lack of mid-story modulation, and告-only final assertion (no image to embody the paradox) apply heavy friction. The tone does not cohere through pressure or charge the final image via prior particulars.</comment>
