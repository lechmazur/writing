<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's monthly molt creates embodied tension ("chest tonight") and the final seed-planting choice feels earned by prior causality. However, interiority often defaults to abstract poeticism ("alchemy: to forge enduring beauty") rather than character-particular thought under pressure. The molt's mechanics—sharp edges softening like frost—are told more than dramatized through micro-choices that test commitment. Kael's consistent warm presence anchors the relationship, but his role tilts toward supportive witness rather than applying immediate counterpressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered images (rusted library, prison flashback, courtyard stones, seed) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara accepts transformation as method rather than betrayal. Closure lands on-page with felt cost—the dissolution of Silas and embrace of perpetual change. The prison-library flashback anchors present stakes cleanly. One tightening occurs when Kael's "luminous fracture" metaphor reweights Elara's fear into acceptance, narrowing her stance with visible emotional cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The rusted library setting is vivid and purposeful: skeletal ribs, rust-eaten beams, cracked concrete ground the rebuild action. Moonlight through the beam creates "luminous fracture," directly charging the final image and Kael's metaphor. The courtyard earth constrains the seed-planting choice—they must kneel and dig. The coffee tin's false bottom functions as micro-setting, enabling the seed's retrieval. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves from library interior to courtyard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving the rebuild through Elara's monthly molt—is signaled early and tightens when she voices fear of abandoning "stone and mortar." Kael's "luminous fracture" reframe narrows her options, forcing acceptance of transformation with on-page emotional cost. The seed-planting functions as Earned Stasis: she surrenders control, forecloses resistance to change, and commits to the community project beyond any single persona. Agency is renunciation of fixity, and the price—loss of Silas's granite resolve—is legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of transformation-as-resistance emerges through concrete images (molt, seed, rusted beam) rather than assertion. The final seed image answers the thematic question without moralizing. However, lines like "beauty was forged not despite the anarchy, but through the collective, compassionate effort" edge into explicit thesis statement. Kael's "surrender to become root, stem, flower" treads close to wisdom-delivery rather than embodied discovery. The prison-library friendship grounds the theme in specific experience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Elara with consistent perceptual filter (raw honesty, structural metaphors). Dialogue feels natural and advances stakes. However, register drifts upward during peak beats: "confluence of selves," "testament that broken ground cultivates," "luminous fracture" read as elevated diction outside the focalizer's lived voice under stress. Kael's speech ("The break lets the light in. Your molting isn't betrayal—it's the rhythm of this place") is articulate and thematically on-point but lacks the rough edges of spontaneous speech.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "skeletal ribs," "psychic tremor," "persona of granite resolve," "alchemy," "crucible," "luminous fracture." At closure, stacked metaphors ("confluence of selves," "testament," "cultivates the deepest hope") compete without clear propulsion. Paraphrase loop appears: "beauty was forged not despite the anarchy" (line 290) restates the motivation from line 94. Template cadence visible in summary sentences ("The blooming resistance was this seed, this act, this rising sanctuary"). Some filter-verb stacks ("felt the familiar," "knew the rebuild would endure") dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The vagrant-poet-with-shifting-personas premise offers a fresh angle, and the prison-library origin adds specificity. However, the alchemy/beauty-from-anarchy framing tracks closely to transformation-of-broken-spaces templates. The molt mechanism is inventive but underutilized—it constrains one emotional beat without altering tactics across the rebuild action. The luminous-fracture metaphor feels earned in hindsight. Risk-taking in lyric compression is present but does not fundamentally elevate stakes or complicate the moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Vagrant penny poet Elara is present throughout and makes the final seed-planting decision. Setup occurs early (line 28). Development: her voiced fear ("What if she abandons stone and mortar?") at line 184 creates a turn. Payoff: she plants the seed at closure, accepting transformation. Causal pressure is moderate—the choice feels thematic more than tactically constrained. Two beats (voicing fear, planting seed) with closure linkage, but swappability is moderate; another wandering artist could serve similar function with edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Coffee tin appears early (line 42) guarding blueprints, violet, and seeds. Second beat: Kael "took the tin, pried the false bottom, and placed a sunflower seed in her palm" (line 218), enabling the final planting. The false bottom's secrecy matters—it protects resources and delivers the seed at the climactic moment. Setup, development (seed retrieval), and payoff (seed planted) are all present. Causal role is solid: without the tin, the seed planting cannot occur. Specificity is high; the dented, faded label adds texture.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Blooming resistance is named as concept (line 106) and recurs in final paragraph (line 318). It frames the rebuild stakes early and the community's contributions are described as "unfolding petals." However, on-page action centers on Elara's molt acceptance and seed planting; "blooming resistance" functions more as thematic echo than a pressure that changes tactics. Setup present, weak development (no middle choice explicitly constrained by resistance mechanics), payoff is metaphorical only. Replaceable with similar collective-action language.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Monthly molt is introduced early (line 54) as "familiar psychic tremor." It constrains Elara's emotional state, generating the central fear that Silas's voice will dissolve (line 84, 184). Payoff: the molt occurs on-page—"Silas's sharp edges softened, dissolving like frost" (line 240)—with visible cost (loss of granite resolve) and enables acceptance. Setup, development (voiced fear), and payoff all present. The trait's mechanics shape one key turn. Swappability is low; removing the molt removes the story's emotional engine.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rebuild action is signaled early (line 106, "neighbors clearing rubble, mending chairs") and Kael reports progress mid-scene ("courtyard stones are set," line 172). The seed planting at closure is a rebuild act with symbolic and literal stakes. Setup, development (courtyard completion), and payoff (planting future growth) are all present. Causal pressure: the rebuild frames the molt's stakes—will the new persona continue it? Two beats, closure linkage, moderate irreplaceability; another collective project could substitute with structural edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prison library friendship is introduced via flashback (line 120) and provides the origin of the rebuild dream. It establishes Kael's trust and shared purpose, which enable his reframe at the climactic moment. Setup (flashback), development (Kael's presence and courtyard report), and payoff (joint seed planting) are present. The friendship shapes Elara's acceptance—she trusts Kael enough to release fear. Causal role is moderate; a generic ally could deliver the metaphor, but the prison bond adds earned intimacy. Lyric reprise without mid-scene mechanics use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rusted library is introduced immediately (line 28) and remains the spatial anchor. The rust-eaten beam at line 194 supplies the "luminous fracture" image that reframes the molt, directly shaping Elara's acceptance. The courtyard earth (line 257) constrains the seed-planting action—they must dig. Setup, development (beam as metaphor source), and payoff (courtyard planting) all present. Three beats, strong causal pressure at closure, high specificity. Removing the library removes the visual metaphor that enables the turn.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Moon's ascent is signaled early (line 54, "slender moon began its ascent") and linked to the molt trigger. Mid-scene: "As the moon cleared the last rooftop" (line 278) marks the molt's completion and floods the library with light. Setup and payoff present; weak development—no middle choice is explicitly clocked by moon position. The timeframe tightens the molt window moderately. Two beats with closure linkage. Swappable with another celestial or temporal marker; the moon itself does not supply unique causal mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Motivation "to forge beauty from anarchy" is stated early (line 94) and recurs at closure (line 290, "beauty was forged"). It drives Elara's commitment to the rebuild and frames her fear that the molt will break continuity. Setup, development (fear of abandoning the project), and payoff (acceptance that transformation serves the goal) are present. The motivation shapes stakes but is told more than dramatized—choices follow from it but are not visibly friction-laden. Two beats, closure linkage, moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Luminous fracture as tone/image is coined mid-scene (line 194) by Kael and becomes the reframe device. It describes the rust-eaten beam casting mosaic light and reappears at line 278 ("In that luminous fracture, Elara understood"). The tone is elegiac and hopeful, coherent across beats. Setup weak (not present in opening), strong development (supplies the metaphor that shifts Elara's stance), strong payoff (charges the final realization). High specificity and causal pressure at closure. The exact phrase reweights the molt from loss to renewal.</comment>
