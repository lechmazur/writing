<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and rooted in legacy, but interiority leans heavily on abstract metaphor ("thread this stone labyrinth with his own story") rather than embodied contradiction. The micro-choice—pressing the lattice to the scuffs—is purposeful, but Kael's emotional progression remains smooth and didactic; no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in the peak beat. Elias's shift from skepticism to belief is motivated but arrives without visible struggle or cost beyond a single tear.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (lighthouse prison, Kael, present moment) land within the first ~100 words. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: copperlight imagery, scuff-lattice motif, and the son-of-wolf legacy build density toward the final reconfiguration. However, closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (trust restored, barrier fallen) but the felt cost—what Kael forfeits or endures on the page—remains abstract; "the real barrier had already fallen" is asserted rather than shown through a legible trade-off or forfeiture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison, jagged reef, copperlight beam, and narrow door with scuffs are vivid and purposeful. The lattice salvaged from the confessional constrains the reveal method and charges the final image. Spatial choreography (iron stairs, beam rotation, moth hovering) remains clear. Minor slip: the prison's occupation and daily operations remain vague, reducing grounding during the standoff.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving truth despite legacy—is signaled early. The lattice-over-scuffs beat narrows options (Elias must look), and Elias's belief shift tightens the outcome. However, the escalation is thin: Kael's method succeeds on first attempt without complication or cost beyond past dismissals. No trade-off or visible price paid in this scene; the "hush" Kael chases is conceptual rather than a felt forfeiture that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme—truth witnessed versus legacy of lies—emerges from the lattice reveal and Elias's shift. The confessional lattice repurposed for secular proof is a resonant choice. However, the final paragraph cycles through thematic restatements ("truth's keeper," "silence where understanding begins," "hope") that replace scene pressure with summary. The ending image (moth as tiny star, Kael "cradling" hush) gestures at resonance but the cost remains told rather than charged by a specific forfeiture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable. Dialogue is functional and goal-driven ("I chase no wolf. I offer sight"). However, the narrative voice drifts into elevated register ("copperlight repose," "the profound quiet of a truth finally witnessed") that clashes with the physical urgency of revealing hidden bodies. Perceptual signature is generic; Kael's way of noticing reads indistinct from the narrator's thematic commentary. Elias's speech carries slight distinction but not enough to avoid convergence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Heavy overwriting in peak beats: "copperlight repose," "secular revelation," "impossibility the prison sustained," "thread this stone labyrinth" stack figurative language without pattern-teaching or payoff. Paraphrase loops appear in the final third: "Kael had not shouted. He had simply held the lattice…" / "He had chased the hush not to escape noise…" / "He was no longer chasing hush. He was cradling it." Template cadence runs across multiple paragraphs ("The door had hung…," "Behind it lay…," "From his coat, Kael withdrew…"). These artifacts dull momentum and obscure the closure image. Deduction baseline: −1.2 for density + loops + register drift; escalated to −1.4 because artifacts pervade the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—son of the boy who cried wolf using a confessional lattice to prove hidden bodies—is specific and non-obvious. The lighthouse prison setting and copperlight motif are purposeful. However, the thematic arc (legacy redeemed through patient truth) resolves tidily without moral ambiguity or bold risk. The lattice method, while fresh, is introduced and succeeds without complication, reducing ingenuity in execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Kael (son of the boy who cried wolf) is present throughout and his legacy shapes the dominant stake. His choice to press the lattice over the scuffs drives the reveal beat. However, the legacy functions more as backdrop than active constraint; no prior dismissal complicates this attempt on the page. Development beat is thin. Closure participation is clear (trust restored), but his agency in that beat is passive observation rather than a second decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lattice salvaged from the chapel confessional is handled in three distinct beats: withdrawal from coat, placement over scuffs, and Elias looking through it. Its properties (carved saints, aperture function) are specific and irreplaceable. It drives the reveal and charges the final image ("copperlight washed over the lattice"). Cost connection is present (secular proof vs. penance), though the price is conceptual rather than physical.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Chasing hush" is mentioned multiple times and frames Kael's motivation, but it operates as thematic label rather than shaping on-page tactics. The concept does not narrow options or create a visible trade-off; Kael pursues the reveal directly without navigating competing noise or silence. Late restatements ("He was no longer chasing hush. He was cradling it") summarize rather than dramatize a shift.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Sustains impossibilities" is attributed to the prison twice: the candle-flame-on-reef paradox and the hidden bodies. However, the attribute is descriptive rather than constraining; it does not enable or limit a choice Kael makes. The trait could be replaced with "remote" or "isolated" without altering the plot. No cost tied to this specific impossibility.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Hover" recurs (moth hovering, world hovering on edge of breath, hush hovering into view) and supports the tone of suspended revelation. The moth's hovering in the beam charges the final image. However, the action is ornamental in most mentions; removing "hover" would not break a turn. Middle development is weak; the hovering does not constrain a choice or alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Through the scuffs on a narrow door left ajar for decades" is the reveal method. The scuffs are seeded early, the lattice placement over them is the key beat, and Elias looks through the combined aperture to see the bodies. Mechanics are clear and specific. However, the method succeeds on first attempt without complication; no alternative is tested or foreclosed. Closure linkage is strong but causal pressure is thin.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison off a jagged reef supplies isolation, the copperlight beam rhythm, the iron stairs for Elias's entrance, and the narrow door as the reveal site. Setting is present in all three gates and constrains the standoff (no escape, no interference). The reef's impossibility and the prison's sustained bodies are causally tied to the dominant stake. Minor slip: the prison's interior layout and daily operations remain vague, reducing micro-setting pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Before they find the bodies" / "Before dawn, we bring them to light" frames urgency. However, the timeframe does not tighten tactics on the page; Kael's method proceeds without time pressure or interruption. The clock is mentioned but not tracked or tested. Development beat is absent; closure participation is present but the time element does not charge the final image or alter the choice.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To thread a labyrinth with your own story" is Kael's stated motivation and shapes his method (the lattice as thread). The desire is present early and drives the reveal beat. However, the motivation is mostly told ("His motivation was sacred") rather than conflicted through a choice between competing wants. No visible friction between Kael's goal and a cost he must pay to achieve it on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Copperlight repose" recurs throughout (sunset, beam rotation, tears, final stillness) and establishes a consistent atmospheric note. However, tone does not modulate with pressure; the copperlight imagery remains static even during the reveal beat. The tone charges the final paragraph but does not shift or deepen in response to escalation. Late appearance as explicit phrase; early seeding is indirect.</comment>
