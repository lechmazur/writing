<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael's role as "culture shock absorber" is asserted more than enacted through contradictory choices. His interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("orderly intuitive," "dual allegiance") rather than embodied contradiction in high-pressure moments. The graffiti work shows some micro-choices, but the foundation stone chip functions primarily as a comfort object rather than constraining decisions. Elara and the community respond predictably without status friction or misalignment that would test Kael's mediator role.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the graffiti network builds density through the night, culminating in community adoption at dawn. Closure arrives as Charged Poise—Kael's balance of dual allegiance and the community's encoded resistance before OmniCorp's noon arrival—with felt cost (fragile hope, vigilance demanded). Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph. The cost is present but somewhat muted; "fragile hope" and "weary yet certain" soften what should land as undeniable pressure at the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The carnival raft setting is vivid and distinct: gondolas, fire-eaters, rope bridges, calliope music, salt-bleached wood. Spatial choreography is clean as Kael moves between rafts, Ferris wheel, spice market, clock tower. The graffiti—nautilus shell as archive map, seven-star dolphin marking safe houses—uses micro-setting (walls, surfaces) to constrain and enable the encoding method. The foundation stone chip and charcoal pouch function as tools that charge the final stance, pushing this into the upper 6-band under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<option>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is cultural preservation versus corporate erasure, signaled early. One meaningful deepening occurs: Kael's solitary night work sparks Elara's alliance, then spreads to fisherman, baker, children—transforming graffiti into a "living nervous system." Agency is present (encode, organize) but largely uncontested; no on-page antagonist tests the network before dawn. The tightening is real but the cost remains atmospheric ("fragile hope") rather than a visible trade-off or forfeited path, capping escalation in the mid-6s under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme of resilient memory versus erasure emerges organically through the graffiti encoding and foundation stone motif. The final image—carnival lights, music as "resilient anthem," encoded hearts and walls—offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. However, phrases like "not victims but archivists" and "soul of the raft city sailed on" edge toward thematic summary rather than letting the image alone carry resonance. The foundation stone's shift from relic to encoded symbol works but feels slightly over-explained in Kael's reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable. Voice carries carnival-specific texture: "salt-tinged wind," "perpetual carnival afloat," "calliope music." Diction stays consistent, though some abstract phrasing ("anarchic soul," "invisible bridges of memory") drifts toward elevated register during reflection. Perceptual signature is present—Kael notices geometric precision and artistic flourishes—but the interiority occasionally explains rather than enacts ("his orderly mind placed symbols"). No dialogue on the page to evaluate. Psychic distance is controlled with purposeful modulation at dawn when community response is shown.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Opening anchors voice and stakes effectively. Information density is generally high, but several lines loop or paraphrase: "dual allegiance that strained his spirit" is restated across paragraphs, and "fragile hope" / "hopeful desperation" recur without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the graffiti-work sequence: "Near the silent Ferris wheel, he reorganized... Above the spice market's fragrant stalls, he added..." Filter verbs ("watched," "felt," "thought") cluster in reflection without always advancing immediacy. Figurative language ("invisible bridges," "nervous system") is coherent but elevated in a few high-pressure beats. No severe artifacts, but cumulative loop and scaffold issues prevent entry to the 7-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The carnival raft city and graffiti-encoding method offer vivid, specific particulars. However, the "community uses secret messages to resist corporate takeover" premise is a familiar template; transformation hinges on the carnival setting and the culture-shock-absorber role, which feel more decorative than structurally integral. The dual-allegiance frame and "invisible bridges not barricades" rhetoric are earnest but lack a non-obvious moral calculus or synthesis that reweights prior material in hindsight. Emotional specificity is present but the arc follows a predictable hope-amid-threat trajectory without a bold inflection that heightens risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kael as "culture shock absorber" is introduced early and frames his mediator role. He makes one key choice—initiating the graffiti network—but the role itself does not force a meaningful turn or trade-off on the page. His dual allegiance is asserted and resolved through narration ("found balance") rather than a dramatized decision with visible cost. Present and functional but swappable with "mediator" or "liaison" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Foundation stone chip appears in opening paragraph, recurs at Kael's belt during graffiti work, and returns in the penultimate and final paragraphs as "compass" and "profound comfort." It charges the final image and symbolizes foundational values that are now "encoded in hearts, hands, and walls." However, it does not constrain a middle choice or alter tactics; its function is largely thematic anchor and comfort object. Strong lyric reprise with closure linkage, but no causal middle development caps it in the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Dual allegiance" (Carnival Guild versus OmniCorp repairs) is signaled in the opening third and shapes Kael's stake throughout. It drives his choice to create the graffiti network as a way to "navigate gentrification" rather than resist outright. At closure, he explicitly balances both: advocate for preservation zones (corporate role) while the network safeguards uncensored voice (community role). The concept appears in setup, middle motive, and closure resolution with visible cost (fragile hope, ongoing vigilance), placing it solidly in the 7–8 band under Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Orderly intuitive" is introduced early and illustrated: Kael's "orderly mind placed symbols with geometric precision; his intuition guided artistic flourishes." This duality enables the graffiti encoding method. However, the trait does not constrain a choice or force a visible trade-off; it functions as a skill descriptor rather than a dilemma. No on-page cost tied to balancing order versus intuition. Present in setup and middle, but missing closure participation and causal pressure, capping at 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Reorganize" appears as Kael's strategic method ("strategically reorganizing the community's cultural defenses") and is enacted literally: he reorganizes faded graffiti into coded maps and symbols. The action drives the night sequence, sparks Elara's alliance, and cascades into community participation—the major turn of the story. Present in setup, middle beats, and closure ("reclaim their narrative"). Removing "reorganize" in favor of a generic "create" would weaken the specificity and the dual meaning (tactical + artistic rearrangement). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage place it in the lower 7-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Graffiti encoding is signaled in the opening third ("method crystallized at dawn: encode vital messages... within the carnival's ubiquitous graffiti art"), demonstrated across multiple middle beats (nautilus shell map, seven-star safe houses, wave patterns, flour paste), and present at closure when the network pulses and Kael reflects on "truth in a language of vibrant resistance." The mechanics matter: symbols must feel organic, initiated understand the code, outsiders see decoration. Drives setup, middle tactics, and closure image. Essential and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The perpetual carnival raft city is introduced immediately and supplies vivid micro-settings: Ferris wheel, spice market, baker's raft, clock tower, rope bridges. These locations enable and organize the graffiti encoding (archive beneath baker's raft, safe houses marked by stars). The carnival's "anarchic soul" and communal origins frame the cultural stakes. At closure, carnival lights and music charge the final image. Setting drives setup, provides resources and constraints in the middle, and returns with reweighted meaning at the end. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Before privatization" is signaled early: "OmniCorp's impending takeover" and the promise of repairs. The timeframe tightens at closure: "Tomorrow at noon, OmniCorp skiffs would arrive to finalize privatization papers." This live clock frames urgency (Kael works "through the night," community response occurs "at first light") and shapes the fragile-hope tone. However, the time pressure does not force a mid-story tactical shift or visible sacrifice; it functions more as atmospheric deadline than active constraint on choices. Present in setup and closure, modest middle pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Navigate gentrification" is established early as Kael's core motivation and is dramatized through his choice to build "invisible bridges of memory, not barricades of protest." The dual-allegiance friction (protect heritage versus accept needed repairs) creates on-page conflict, and the graffiti method embodies navigating rather than resisting. At closure, Kael's reflection ("leverage his official role... while the graffiti network safeguarded") confirms the navigation strategy with visible cost (fragile hope, ongoing vigilance). Friction between want (preserve identity) and cost (corporate encroachment) is legible across setup, middle, and ending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Hopeful desperation" is signaled early ("heart a tight knot of hopeful desperation") and modulates throughout: desperate urgency during the night work, fragile hope at dawn when the community responds, "weary yet certain" at closure. The final image—carnival lights, music as "resilient anthem," "soul... beat strong"—charges hope without erasing desperation's cost. Tone is coherent and intentional, threading setup and closure. However, the execution leans slightly toward assertion ("fragile hope take root") rather than letting action and image alone carry the contradictory charge, preventing entry to the higher 7-band.</comment>
