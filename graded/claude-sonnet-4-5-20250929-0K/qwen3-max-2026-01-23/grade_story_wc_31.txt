<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation (discovering the color of sound tied to grief for Elara) is clear and his defining attribute (hiding behind truth) is stated early, but the actual *dramatization* of internal contradiction remains thin. The moment when his defensive truth-telling "crumbles" in the climax is told rather than shown through embodied micro-choices under pressure. The final tears and "heart open" register as label-only emotional summary without the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously on the page. Backstory about Elara anchors motive but the present renunciation lacks the visible cost and trade-off required to elevate characterization above functional.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (lamplighter, pier, low tide, sunken ship) appear by the opening paragraphs and the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density of imagery and motifs (lanterns, light, color, vows) accumulates toward a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. However, the key's lock-and-discovery beat lacks causal friction—Elias finds exactly what he seeks with no complication or narrowing of options. The logbook's contents answer his quest directly, but the *cost* of this answer is asserted ("tears mingling with seawater") rather than made legible through a foreclosed path or tactical shift. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing (love's chromatic signature becomes eternal understanding) but the on-page *felt* cost remains abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sunken library setting is vivid and purposeful: waterlogged books, fractured moonlight through portholes, and sky lanterns casting shifting light create a charged atmosphere. The brass key and chest anchor tactile interaction, and the mudflats/tides constrain Elias's access window. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through his quest (trailing fingers over spines, seeking chromatic evidence). The recurring sky lanterns constrain the timeframe and charge the final image, pushing this into the 7+ band despite occasional ornamental phrasing ("cathedral of drowned knowledge").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering proof of luminous vows—is signaled early and pursued consistently, but pressure never meaningfully tightens or complicates. Elias seeks, finds, and understands without reversal or trade-off; the logbook delivers exactly the evidence he hoped for with no friction. The claimed escalation (sky lanterns ascending, tears breaking his defensive walls) is told rather than tested through a decision that forecloses an option. Agency at closure is passive recognition rather than a choice that alters tactics or costs. One meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens would require the discovery to impose a visible price or reweight his next move; neither occurs on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (love's emotional resonance as chromatic signature, light as carrier of vows) emerges organically from imagery and Elias's quest rather than direct statement. The logbook passage provides concrete particulars ("liquid topaz," "deep indigo") that answer the central question without moralizing. However, the final reflection—"love's chromatic signature was eternal"—edges toward thematic echo, and the closure insight feels more asserted than *earned* through prior struggle. The recurring light motifs (lamps, lanterns, dawn gold, cerulean harbor) charge the ending image without forcing symbolic convenience, lifting the score into mid-6s despite slight drift toward abstraction in the concluding beats.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout with consistent perceptual filters (Elias's lamplighter precision, grief-anchored attention to light and color). Diction is elevated and lyric but mostly coherent with the reflective, mourning tone. However, phrasing occasionally drifts into ornamental register ("cathedral of drowned knowledge," "cascade of liquid topaz") that reads more decorative than voice-specific. The final paragraph's syntax ("a conscious continuation of light—a quiet promise kept") leans toward thematic summary rather than embodied perception under stress. No dialogue present; interiority is clean but leans abstract at peaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Multiple prose artifacts cluster in the second half: paraphrase loops ("understood: the color of sound was love's emotional resonance—the sound of Elara's voice was dawn's gold"), template cadence in the middle third (repeated "he [verb]" structures), and filter-verb stacks ("he swore," "he knew," "he understood") that dull immediacy during the climactic logbook discovery. Stock metaphors ("sleeping sentinels," "celestial dust") and synonym churn around "light" (honeyed light, chromatic signature, luminous vows, glow, radiance) reduce clarity. The final three paragraphs recycle "light" and "promise" without advancing pressure. Deductions: paraphrase loop −0.4, template cadence −0.5, filter stacks −0.5, artifacts in closure zone push penalty toward −1.4 total, capping high-band entry and disallowing 9+ globally per artifact rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The premise (lamplighter seeks proof that sincere vows emit visible color) offers a fresh lyric angle on grief and synesthesia, and the logbook as evidence is a purposeful choice. However, the execution leans on familiar grief-quest tropes (deceased spouse, symbolic object, epiphany in a liminal space) without sufficient transformation through tactical friction or non-obvious moral calculus. The sky lantern release and sunken library are vivid but trend toward atmospheric decoration rather than irreplaceable story logic. Elias's final understanding is emotionally resonant but arrives without surprise or risk; the turn feels comfortable rather than inevitable in hindsight. Mid-band score reflects solid craft applied to a moderately fresh synthesis without bold structural or emotional risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias (lamplighter) is present throughout and his occupation anchors the opening and closing images (extinguishing pole, lit lamps as continuation). However, his *choices* remain passive: he walks, descends, trails fingers, finds, reads, understands. The key decision—leaving the hotel tag on the chest—is gestural rather than tactical; it does not alter options or impose cost. Setup gate met (opening), closure gate weak (he watches lanterns and walks away with renewed purpose, but the lamplighter role is decorative rather than causally active in the ending). Functional but replaceable with another seeker archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Hotel skeleton key tag appears early (first paragraph pocket detail), is handled at the chest-lock beat (middle), and left on the lid as a closure gesture (final third). Three beats with evolving function: talisman → tool → symbolic release. However, the lock opens without complication, reducing causal pressure; the tag's "hotel" origin and "Aethelstan library" conviction are told backstory without on-page friction. The final gesture "signifies closure" but does not foreclose a live option or impose visible cost. All three gates present but causal work remains thin; eligible for mid-6s, capped by lack of necessity and swappability (any keepsake could serve the release gesture).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Luminous vows are introduced early (paragraph 3 as Elias's quest focus), sought in the library, and answered by the logbook passage (middle-to-late) which provides concrete examples ("soft silver light," "liquid topaz," "deep indigo"). The concept shapes the dominant stake and reappears in the closure reflection ("love's chromatic signature"). However, it never *constrains* a choice or alters tactics; Elias reads confirmation rather than wrestling with contradiction or cost. Setup and payoff gates met; development gate weak (no middle choice hinges on the concept). Functional lyric throughline but lacks causal pressure, placing it in the 5.5–6.0 band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Hides behind truth" is stated explicitly (paragraph 4: "using precise facts... to deflect emotional vulnerability") and the climax claims this attribute "crumbled" when confronting the logbook's emotional truth (paragraph 13). However, the trait is label-only: no on-page scene shows Elias deploying factual deflection under pressure, and the "crumbling" is told summary rather than a visible choice with cost. Setup gate met (early statement); development and payoff gates fail (no middle constraint, closure change is asserted not dramatized). Ornamental mention trends low-4s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Signify" appears twice: paragraph 14 ("action of closing the logbook began to signify a profound shift") and paragraph 17 ("purposeful gesture to signify closure, release"). The logbook-closing beat marks an emotional turn, and leaving the key tag is framed as intentional symbolic action. However, both uses read as authorial labeling rather than dramatized choice with tactical consequence; the shift is told, and the gesture is described as symbolic without altering Elias's next move or foreclosing an option. The action is present in the closure zone but lacks causal teeth. Swappable with "mark," "indicate," or "represent." Mid-5s for closure presence without necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Wandering purposefully" is named in paragraph 5 ("proceeded by wandering purposefully across the mudflats") and echoed in paragraph 7 ("moving with deliberate aimlessness"). The method characterizes Elias's search—unhurried, exploratory—and fits the Accumulative/Textural lens, but it does not *shape* attempts or impose constraint. He simply walks, descends, and finds; no beat hinges on whether he wanders versus searches systematically. Setup gate met (early); development gate weak (middle beats do not test the method); payoff gate borderline (the final walk across the flats mirrors the opening, recharging the image). Lyric consistency lifts the score into mid-6s despite lack of mechanical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The forgotten library inside the sunken Aethelstan is introduced early (paragraph 2 backstory, paragraph 5–6 approach and entry), houses the key discovery beat (logbook in chest), and supplies the charged closure image (sky lantern light flooding the chamber, illuminating the log's final sentence). The setting provides resources (chest, logbook, portholes for lantern light) and its liminal, drowned atmosphere directly supports the theme. All three gates met; the setting is indispensable to the logbook discovery and the lantern-lit epiphany. Causal role in at least two beats (entry/search, discovery/illumination) and strong closure linkage push this into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sky lantern release timeframe is signaled in the opening line ("preceding the town's annual sky lantern release") and recurs visually through portholes (paragraph 6), at the climactic illumination (paragraph 15), and in the closing image (paragraph 18, "last lanterns ascend"). The lanterns charge the atmosphere and provide light for the logbook revelation, creating a purposeful lyric frame. However, the timeframe does not *tighten* decisions or impose a deadline; Elias explores at his own pace. Setup and payoff gates met; development gate weak (no middle urgency). Early-final reprise reweights the stake, reaching the 5.5–6.3 lyric allowance band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elias's motivation "to discover the color of sound" is introduced early (paragraph 3), deepened by memory of Elara's laughter (honeyed light), pursued through the library search (paragraph 8, seeking "luminous vows"), and answered by the logbook (paragraphs 11–12, specific color descriptions). The quest shapes the dominant stake and frames the closure insight (paragraph 16, "the color of sound was love's emotional resonance"). However, the motivation is never *conflicted*—Elias seeks and finds without friction between desire and cost. Setup, development (drives search), and payoff gates all met, but lack of on-page tension between want and obstacle caps the score in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" appears in the opening (paragraph 1, "immense quiet") and closing (paragraph 18, "profound meteor hush—a sacred silence thick with whispered hopes," paragraph 19 "hushed heavens"). The tone—reverent, suspended quiet layered with subtle intensity—is coherent across the piece and modulates appropriately: subdued in the approach, charged during the logbook discovery (tears, flood of memory), and resolute-yet-gentle in the ending. The final image of silence "thick with whispered hopes" reweights the opening quiet with earned emotional freight. Setup and payoff gates strong; tone charges the final image. Eligible for mid-to-high 6s; close to 7.0 threshold but slight abstraction in the closure phrasing ("soul's architecture," "luminous vows") prevents higher placement.</comment>
