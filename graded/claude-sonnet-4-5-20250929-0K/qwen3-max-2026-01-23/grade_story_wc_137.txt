<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's "sympathetic skeptic" nature is established early and her mentor's prior influence shapes her choice to use the tile. However, her interiority relies heavily on abstract phrasing ("courageously kind impulse," "skeptic's mind cataloged absurdities") rather than embodied contradiction. The pivot to transcription feels prompted by compassion for Liam but lacks visible internal cost or struggle—she moves from skepticism to tears without dramatized resistance. The final stance is declared rather than earned through competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory intensity builds through the tile vision, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elara places the transcription on the wall and Liam finds solace. Orientation anchors (tower, night, whale migration) arrive promptly. However, the closure cost is conceptual and relational rather than viscerally felt on the page—Elara's tears and the "palpable warmth" are asserted more than shown through a decisive forfeiture or tactical shift. The tile's cooling "its purpose fulfilled" reads as convenient resolution rather than a price Elara pays.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The stargazer's tower, meridian line, and whale migration below create a vivid spatial anchor with selective sensory detail (salt wind, ink-dark sea, lantern light on brittle vellum). The flagstone compartment and telescope contribute tactile specificity. The micro-setting (tile on meridian line, alignment with constellation) directly enables the vision sequence and the final transcription, charging the closure when Liam reads the vellum on the wall. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Elara can offer Liam solace—is signaled early and resolved at closure. The tile vision provides a tightening through emotional intensity, and the transcription narrows options by committing Elara to public compassion. Yet the escalation relies on emotional surge rather than a tactical dilemma or visible tradeoff; Elara does not forfeit skepticism so much as set it aside without friction. The vision itself is gift rather than struggle, and Liam's arrival at sunrise feels coincidentally timed rather than causally urgent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of interconnection across time and species emerges through the tile's entangled memories and the final image of Liam recognizing his father as "part of this journey." The "unheard symphony" motif recurs purposefully and the closing line "space was sculpted not with hands, but with heart" reweights the premise. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("true reflection requires courage to listen beneath the silence") and Elara's interior voice occasionally lectures rather than discovers. The earned insight is present but diluted by stated moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature ("sympathetic skeptic," star charts vs. superstition) anchors voice early, and diction elevates purposefully during the vision ("simultaneous, inseparable threads"). However, register drifts into prompt-echo phrasing ("courageously kind," "sculpt space for reflection," "unheard symphony") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. Liam's brief dialogue ("He's part of this journey too") carries subtext, but Elara's silent gesture and resting hand read as coaching rather than embodied character choice. Free indirect style is clean but occasionally slips into narration that explains rather than enacts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and sensory detail is selective, but the piece carries pervasive pattern artifacts: "courageously kind" appears three times, "sculpt/sculpted space" recurs mechanically, and several beats open with similar participial structures ("Unrolling the brittle journal," "Reading of stargazers," "With reverent hands"). The vision sequence stacks metaphor without grounding ("symphony of pure resonance," "tapestry of resilience," "silent chord") and the final two paragraphs loop thematic claims. Template cadence across multiple lines and label-reliance in peak beats (tears, warmth, "palpable") trigger cumulative artifact penalties and disallow 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of stargazer tower, whale migration, and memory artifact offers specificity, yet the core emotional arc—skeptic finds wonder and offers solace—follows a familiar template without sharp transformation. The "forgotten constellations" and mother-of-pearl tile provide textural detail, but the vision itself delivers revelation as gift rather than earned struggle, and the ending's hope-through-connection reads as comforting rather than surprising. Risk-taking is limited; the piece opts for affirming safety over ambiguity or cost that would deepen the premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's skepticism is established early ("trusted star charts over superstition") and her choice to use the tile hinges on this trait in tension with kindness. However, the arc from doubt to transcription lacks on-page friction—skepticism "bows" rather than fighting. Present across all three gates but replaceable with "cautious scholar" or similar; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tile appears in the discovery beat, the vision beat (placed on meridian line, warmth blooms, memories surge), and the closure beat (cools, transcription fastened to wall). It drives two major turns and its cooling signals the vision's end, altering Elara's next move. Specificity (obsidian, mother-of-pearl) and the meridian-line placement make it difficult to replace. Cost is indirect—tile's depletion rather than a price Elara pays—preventing top band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Entangled memories shape the vision sequence (stargazer's grief fused with calf's breach, whale navigating by starlight) and the transcription's content, which then alters Liam's stance. The concept is seeded in tower lore, developed through the vision, and paid off when Liam reads of stargazers and whales intertwined. However, "entanglement" functions more as metaphor than tactical constraint—Elara does not wrestle with competing memories or choose among them. Present in all three gates with moderate causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Courageously kind" is named three times but rarely constrains action with visible cost. Elara's impulse to help Liam and her transcription effort are consistent with kindness, yet no moment shows courage risking safety or status. The label appears as a thematic tag rather than a trait forcing a hard choice. Swappable with "compassionate" or "generous" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Transcription is seeded in the mentor's journal method, enacted during the vision ("took her quill to transcribe the flowing visions"), and delivers the closure artifact that Liam reads. The act transforms private experience into public solace and defines Elara's final stance. Removing transcription would collapse the Liam resolution. However, the mechanics (writing guided by visions) are asserted more than shown stroke-by-stroke, slightly reducing irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Forgotten patterns (Leaping Calf, Watchful Eye) are introduced via the mentor's journal, guide the tile's alignment at the meridian, and frame the vision's logic. They appear in setup (journal diagrams) and method beat (placing tile as constellation crowns horizon), but do not return in the closure image or constrain Liam's reading. The mechanics matter once—during activation—then recede. Two gates with moderate causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The open tower frames the entire story: parapet for opening image, meridian line for tile placement, telescope and wall for transcription display, and the space where Liam arrives at sunrise. The tower's function as sanctuary is both stated motivation and enacted closure ("sanctuary sculpted…from entangled memories given compassionate voice"). Setting enables key actions and charges the final image. Slight deduction for some ornamental description (whale spouts, rose and gold light) that beautifies without altering tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Whale migration brackets the story (opening spouts, Liam watching a distant spout at dawn) and the forgotten constellation's alignment depends on migration timing ("Leaping Calf constellation crowned the horizon where whales traveled"). Time progresses from moonlight to dawn, pacing Elara's discovery and transcription. However, migration does not tighten decisions—Elara could perform this ritual any night during the season—and no urgency tied to whales' passage pressures her choices. Present in two gates with modest thematic linkage but weak tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elara's desire "to sculpt space for reflection" is declared early and fulfilled at closure when the tower becomes "a sanctuary sculpted…from entangled memories." Her actions (using the tile, transcribing, offering the vellum to Liam) enact this motivation. However, the phrasing is repeated rather than dramatized through conflicting wants—no moment shows reflection competing with another need. The motivation drives the arc but lacks visible friction or cost, landing it in the functional band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Unheard symphony" anchors the vision ("unheard symphony of pure resonance," "silent chord," "complex song unheard by human ears") and recurs in the closing reflection ("we are all notes in the song"). Tone modulates from skeptical calm to emotional surge during the vision, then softens to quiet warmth at closure. The metaphor charges the final image and supports the theme of silent connection. However, "symphony" becomes a label applied repeatedly rather than evolving texturally, and the closing moralizing slightly flattens the lyric effect.</comment>
