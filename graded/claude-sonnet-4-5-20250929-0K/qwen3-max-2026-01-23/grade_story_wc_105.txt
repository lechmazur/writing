<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is highly abstract and reflective rather than embodied under pressure. The dominant motivation—"to find the sound of trust breaking"—remains declarative and never forces a difficult micro-choice with visible cost on the page. Her action (placing the coil, pouring absences) proceeds without friction or internal contradiction; the tear and epiphany arrive without earned struggle. The BRR load exceeds 30% without interleaved on-page choices that alter present options, flattening momentum.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who, where, and when anchor by line 23; no penalty. Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through collected absences and sensory layering. Closure unit: Resonant Reconfiguration (the coil pulse and epiphany reweight the stake). However, the cost is asserted ("a tear traced her cheek") rather than dramatized through a forfeited option or visible price. The forge's glow and coil emergence feel convenient—no established constraint is overcome—and the final ascent declares change without showing what path was foreclosed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The sunken orchard, fractured glass dome, shipwrecks, and aurora create vivid, specific anchors filtered through Elara's synesthetic perception. The forge paradox (dry under the sea) charges the climactic beat. However, the environment does not constrain Elara's choices; she kneels, places the coil, and succeeds without spatial friction. The setting functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical pressure, capping the score below 9-band entry despite strong sensory detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capturing the sound of trust breaking—is signaled early but never tested by opposition or a forced trade-off. Elara's method (recording absences, placing the coil) proceeds linearly without reversal or cost; the forge simply glows and delivers the imprint. No on-page tightening narrows her options or imposes a visible price. The piece accumulates texture but lacks a causal pressure point where agency forecloses a path, keeping it below the 8.0 band entry threshold.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—memory, absence, fracture as shape-giver—emerges through image (shipwrecks as nurseries, branch's curve) and avoids overt moralizing until the final paragraphs. However, lines 273, 325, 334, and 341 ("Trust, once broken, leaves a shape teaching us to mend," "For in the absences, we find the true shape of love") articulate the thesis in prompt-like language, flattening subtext. The thematic echo in the penultimate third applies −0.5 in Q5, and the explain-everything ending further caps resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV is single, stable, and third-limited. Diction ("battered marvel," "sacred geometry," "resilient echo") exhibits a lyric, elevated register consistent with Elara's designer sensibility. However, perceptual signature is thin—her synesthesia is told ("colors Elara heard as a faint, crystalline choir") rather than woven into embodied perception under pressure. Elevated metaphoric density in reflective passages ("silence's sacred geometry," "cycles continuing while cells divide") drifts toward committee voice in the final third, reducing character-specific texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense throughout, with mixed-vehicle metaphors ("colors…heard as…choir," "silence woven from…salt") and elevated diction that clashes with scene immediacy. Template cadence: "She heard…She focused…She saw…She would…" across multiple beats. Paraphrase loops: lines 213/219, 257/266, 290/300 restate without added pressure. The phrase "while cells divide" recurs as ornamental refrain without causal linkage (lines 116, 192, 355). Artifacts touch the closure third; apply −1.2 baseline and disallow 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Core premise—designer seeks a lost sound via recording absences—offers a lyric angle. However, execution leans on stock images (aurora, shipwrecks, forge) and therapy-speak epiphanies ("trust…leaves a shape teaching us to mend"). The forge paradox (dry under the sea) is unexplained and feels rule-convenient. The emotional arc (haunted → tear → acceptance) follows a template path without fresh inflection at the turn. Swappable details and median choices keep the piece in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara's occupation as hearing aid designer is mentioned (line 23, reprised at 266) but does not drive choices. Her professional skill—navigating silences—frames thematic resonance but never constrains an on-page action or enables a trade-off. She does not use designer methods to solve a problem; the coil and forge work autonomously. Present by setup and reprised at closure, but ornamental. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ashen forge appears at line 116, Elara places the coil in ash at 141, it glows at 183, and the coil pulses warm at 225. Three distinct beats; causal pressure (the forge imprints memory). Closure linkage: "the coil hummed" (300), "coil's pulse syncing" (309). Early signal absent (introduced past 30% mark) applies −0.3; swappability (any receptacle could hold the coil) applies −0.4. Strong beat involvement and closure tie elevate despite late entry.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Memories shape Elara's motivation (father's lie, flood, missing warmth) and are thematically central. However, the concept does not constrain tactics or create a trade-off on the page; Elara's method succeeds without friction. Memories are explored in reflection rather than tested under pressure. Present across beats but resolved through assertion rather than choice. Functional but mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Synesthesia (hearing colors) is established at line 45 and reprised at 183, 347. However, it remains label-only: the aurora's "crystalline choir" and "acceptance translating to a golden chime" are told perceptions without tactical consequence. The trait does not enable or constrain an on-page action. Ornamental use; no visible cost or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Imprint" is the method's goal and closure verb. Elara places the coil "meant…to imprint memory" (141), the forge imprints absence, the coil holds "the imprint" (225), and the final coil carries "memory made manifest" (300). Two beats (placement, retrieval) and closure linkage. However, the action is passive (the forge does the work) and easily swappable with "record" or "capture." Causal role present but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Collecting absences" is signaled at line 77, operationalized across lines 90–105 (recording hollows, missing sounds), and poured into the forge at 155. Three beats; the method shapes tactics and enables closure. However, the mechanics remain abstract—how absences are "collected" and "poured" is not grounded in physical action or constraint. Present early, drives middle, and participates in closure, but specificity lacks bite.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks is vividly described (lines 23, 32, 116, 251, 282) and functions as atmospheric anchor. However, the setting does not pressure choices or alter tactics; Elara kneels, works, and ascends without spatial friction. The environment supplies mood but not constraint. Present across beats and reprised at closure, but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.4</grade><comment>"While cells divide" recurs at lines 116, 192, 355 as a lyric refrain but does not function as a timeframe. No clock tightens decisions; time is unmeasured and elastic. The phrase is thematic decoration without tactical consequence. Ornamental mention; no pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The motivation—"to find the sound of trust breaking"—is signaled at line 66, operationalized through recording absences (90–105), and achieved at closure (208, 290, 300). Three beats and closure linkage. However, the desire is never tested by a conflicting want or visible cost; Elara succeeds without trade-off. Causal role clear but friction absent; mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Battered marvel" appears at line 237 and 300, framing the resolution. Tone is elegiac and lyric, modulating from haunted (66) to acceptance (183, 273). However, the tone remains uniform under pressure—no tonal shift sharpens the climax. The phrase charges the final image but does not constrain choice. Lyric reprise earns mid-band credit.</comment>
