<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dreamless freight guard is defined primarily by his vow and mission rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. His motivation is coherent but presented through summary and reflection rather than embodied choices under pressure. The archive's weight and the chess clock are handled, but no micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost—he walks, kneels, hums, nurtures sparks in a sequence that feels more iterative than internally conflicted. The final certainty ("quiet certainty was his only reward") tells rather than dramatizes the renunciation's cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where by the opening lines; the post-forest wasteland timeframe is clear. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through repetition, lyric cadence, and the accretion of spark-cultivation beats. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the chess clock shifts from tombstone to seed; the guard becomes cultivator), but the cost is asserted rather than dramatized—"his emptied mind" and "dreamlessness" are labels without a visible forfeiture or friction that narrows options on the page. One meaningful deepening (the "occasionally everywhere" glimpse at line 222) reweights the mission, but the final image relies on thematic echo rather than a decisive turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The glowing dune is vivid and purposeful, its bioluminescent blooms contrasting the void and grounding the mission. Spatial choreography is clear: guard walks, kneels in a hollow, stands, continues. The chess clock and archive are handled across beats, constraining choice (he must kneel to use the archive, the clock remains in his pocket as conceptual anchor). Sensory detail is selective—"sand that bloomed with soft bioluminescence," "obsidian surface shimmered"—and filtered through the guard's focus. The dune's blooming in his wake charges the final image, fulfilling the micro-setting requirement for high-band entry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: cultivate sparks in unlit corners. The story offers one meaningful tightening when the guard's consciousness expands "occasionally everywhere" (line 222), glimpsing alternate timelines, then anchors back to the present. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens relies on iterative moves (walk, kneel, hum, nurture) without a trade-off or visible price that narrows later options. The final blooming is fulfillment rather than a decision that forecloses a path. Cost is conceptual (emptied mind, dreamlessness) but not dramatized as a live friction in the peak beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the chess clock shifts from tombstone to seed, sparks bloom in hollows, the lullaby is "fractured by what was lost, yet whole in its devotion to what could bloom." The ending reweights prior material—future children will live "within the dawn he planted"—without stating a moral. However, the piece edges toward thematic echo in the final third ("a lullaby for the world," "time itself was learning to bloom anew"), where metaphor occasionally substitutes for scene pressure. The central question (can light be cultivated from void?) is answered non-literally through image, earning solid thematic resonance despite some abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable; no head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric, elevated register consistent with the post-apocalyptic mysticism. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract philosophical register ("quantum fabric," "interference patterns") without concrete anchoring, and peak beats rely on stock mystical phrasing ("necessary emptiness," "resonant intent"). Perceptual signature is present but not sharply individuated—descriptions lean toward generic poetic rather than character-specific noticing. Psychic distance is controlled, though the narrator's certainty about future children (line 332) reads as wishful projection rather than knowledge the POV can plausibly claim.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and paragraph lengths create visual breaks, but template cadence appears in repeated sentence stems: "He [verb]" opens ~dozen lines, and "The [noun]" anchors several descriptive beats. Paraphrase loops occur: lines 76 and 156 both describe the lullaby as "fractured...yet threaded/whole," and lines 88 and 168 both explain the charm's mechanics in near-synonymous terms. Figurative language is dense without always advancing pressure—"the archive's fragile paths," "resonant intent," "wave functions" repeat as conceptual placeholders. Information density is moderate; many sentences do one job (describe, not advance). No proximity errors or grammar breaks, but the accumulated scaffold and loop artifacts prevent high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dreamless guard cultivating quantum sparks in a post-forest wasteland offers a specific synthesis, and the chess clock as conceptual pivot is a fresh touch. However, the execution leans on familiar mystical-journey tropes: solitary wanderer, vow of sacrifice, iterative quest beats. The "wave functions" and "interference patterns" read as borrowed vocabulary rather than mechanics that matter to choice. Emotional arc is earnest but lacks friction—the guard never wavers, and his mission unfolds without complication or counter-pressure. The piece commits to its premise but plays it safe within genre conventions, avoiding bold risk that would heighten stakes or subvert expectations.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dreamless freight guard is present throughout and his choices (kneel, hum, nurture spark) drive beats. Setup occurs immediately; middle development shows him cultivating one spark (lines 130–198); closure names him "cultivator" and imagines future children (lines 308, 332). However, his choices are iterative rather than causal—each spark is cultivated the same way, and no decision alters tactics or forecloses a path. Swappable with "wandering mystic" or "solitary gardener" with minor edits. Functional but mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The chess clock is introduced at line 62, handled ("clutched in his palm"), and returns at line 244 with reweighted meaning (tombstone → seed) and again at line 372 ("frozen in time, yet...learning to bloom anew"). Two-beat involvement with charged reprise qualifies for mid-band. However, it is not used to constrain a choice—it remains in his pocket, a conceptual anchor rather than a tool. Specificity is high (frozen at midnight, tied to the forest's end), but causal pressure is absent. Lyric resonance lifts it above ornamental, but it does not shape tactics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The divergent archive is introduced at line 34, strapped to his back, and is central to his role and mission. Setup is immediate; middle development occurs when he unstraps it (line 130), places hands on it (line 144), and feels it resonate (line 212). Closure references the archive's weight (line 362) and the "occasionally everywhere" attribute it embodies. The archive shapes stakes (he guards it) and enables the spark-cultivation method (placing palms upon it). However, it does not constrain a choice or impose a visible cost—he never struggles with its weight or faces a decision about its use. Essential to premise but not to on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "occasionally everywhere" attribute is introduced at line 48 and dramatized at line 212 when the guard's consciousness expands across divergent timelines. This moment is the story's single meaningful deepening, reweighting the mission's scope. Closure echoes it obliquely (future children, planted dawn). Two-beat involvement: setup and one key dramatized moment. However, the attribute does not constrain a choice or impose a cost—the guard anchors himself back to the present without difficulty (line 230). Functional and purposeful, but mid-band due to limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The charm (humming a fractured lullaby) is introduced at line 156, executed at line 168, and results in the spark blooming at line 188. The hum continues softly as he walks (line 264) and is invoked again at the ending (line 386, "a song for the sparks, a lullaby for the world"). Three-beat involvement with closure linkage. The charm is the method by which he cultivates sparks, making it essential to the mission. However, it is not contested or refined—each use follows the same pattern without variation or escalation. Swappable with "ritual" or "incantation" with minor edits. Solid mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Wave functions are mentioned at lines 88, 168, and 274 as the mechanism of the charm. Setup occurs at line 88; middle development at line 168 ("through wave functions, he wove interference patterns"); closure beat at line 274 ("prayer whispered through wave functions"). Three mentions across beats, but the mechanics are told rather than shown—no on-page action demonstrates how wave functions constrain or enable the charm. The term reads as borrowed mystical vocabulary without specificity. Functional label but replaceable with "quantum magic" or "resonant force." Mid-low band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The glowing dune is introduced in the opening line, provides the setting throughout, and charges the final image (line 391, "the glowing dune bloomed brighter with him"). Setup is immediate; middle development includes the hollows between dunes (line 130) and the dune "leaning into his passage" (line 298). The dune supplies resources (unlit hollows to cultivate) and mirrors the mission's success (blooms brightening in his wake). Spatial choreography is clear, and the setting's defiant bloom contrasts the burned forest, deepening thematic weight. Strong causal involvement and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the last forest burns" is established at line 11 and anchored by the chess clock frozen at midnight (line 62, the "exact hour the final ember...guttered out"). The post-catastrophe setting shapes stakes (he cultivates light in the void left by burning) and informs the mission. However, time does not tighten decisions—the guard's journey is iterative and untimed, with no live clock or deadline pressing tactics. The timeframe is a backdrop that primes theme but does not alter on-page choices. Functional setup with thematic resonance but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The motivation "to cultivate the sparks in the unlit corners" is stated at line 76 and dramatized repeatedly: kneeling in a hollow (line 130), nurturing a spark (line 188), scanning for the next shadow (line 264), walking until every hollow holds light (line 286). Setup is early; middle and closure beats show him enacting the motivation. However, the motivation is never conflicted or tested—no moment forces a choice between competing wants or costs. It drives the mission but lacks friction. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, but no visible trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The fractured lullaby is introduced at line 156 ("hum a fractured lullaby, its melody broken by loss yet threaded with unwavering intent"), dramatized as the charm's catalyst, and echoed at closure (line 320, "His journey was a living lullaby—fractured by what was lost, yet whole in its devotion"; line 386, "a lullaby for the world"). Tone is coherent: elegiac yet hopeful, quiet yet purposeful. The lullaby metaphor charges the final image and shapes voice throughout. However, tone does not modulate with pressure—the cadence remains lyric and steady rather than tightening or fracturing further under stress. Strong thematic integration and closure participation.</comment>
