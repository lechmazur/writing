<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation (redemption through resignation) is clear and his operatively gentle attribute shapes multiple beats. However, the confession "I burned the Vale" arrives as summary exposition rather than dramatized struggle, and the internal contradiction between his gentle approach and violent past never complicates a present choice—it's recounted, then resolved through declaration. The secondary characters (elder, delegate) apply pressure but remain functional props. Embodied emotion is present in small gestures (thumb tracing clipboard, tremor in soul) but therapy-adjacent phrasing ("redemption was not absolution") flattens peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: ritual significance and the treaty-signing accumulate pressure toward the final departure, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where Kaelen's resignation forecloses his role with visible cost. One meaningful deepening occurs when his confession shifts the elder's stance, narrowing options and enabling the signing. Cost is legible in "walked away from the negotiator's title, the war, the weight" and the certainty that peace "could outlive the hands that planted them." The lens holds and closure lands on the page with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The terrace, moons, and ebony clipboard anchor setting and atmosphere with vivid, purposeful detail (sun-bleached limestone, violet sky, cooled obsidian surface). The clipboard's material history ("last peace tree felled before the war") charges the final image when placed on the altar stone. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. However, the setting remains largely scenic; the terrace does not constrain a tactical choice—Kaelen's actions would proceed identically in any ceremonial space. This places the work just below the 7.0 gate, which requires environment to alter a choice or charge the ending beyond description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (anchoring peace through self-sacrifice) is signaled early and tightens once when Kaelen's confession changes the elder's response from contempt to negotiation, narrowing options. His agency is renunciation—stepping aside as "the first act of trust"—with visible cost (loss of title, departure from the terrace). The elder's spitting and the delegate's scoffing provide authentic resistance. One meaningful tightening fits this length and the Accumulative lens. Pressure coheres through the signing ritual to the final departure, and the cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme (the price of redemption, ideals anchored in practice, flawed beauty) emerges through concrete actions—the confession, the shared ink, the departure—rather than assertion. The final image ("not paved with ash") reweights prior material without moralizing. "Flawed beauty was not perfection; it was the cracked terrace holding steady" edges toward echo but is grounded in the physical setting and choice. The piece invites reflection and resists tidy resolution ("Peace would be flawed"). Minor slip: "ideals, once anchored in practice, could outlive the hands that planted them" restates the core concept rather than allowing the image to carry it alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Kaelen; psychic distance is controlled. Voice carries a formal, elevated register ("operatively gentle," "muster every ounce") that fits a ritual negotiator but occasionally drifts into abstraction ("fury only breeds more ash," "quiet certainty"). Dialogue is sparse but functional, with subtext in the elder's question and Kaelen's correction ("As anchor"). Internal voice remains consistent under pressure. However, perceptual signature is generic—no distinct idiom or bias filters the moons, limestone, or delegates in character-specific ways. The prose reads competent but not voice-driven, lacking the textural particularity required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several areas show craft debt. Template cadence in "His attribute was operatively gentle... His motivation was redemption... The price of redemption was..." creates a checklist feel in the opening third. Paraphrase loop: "to anchor ideals in practice" appears three times with near-identical phrasing. Stock metaphor: "sigils blooming like dark flowers" and "fury only breeds more ash" lack freshness. Filter-verb stack in "he would muster / he had ordered / he never spoke" flattens immediacy. Figurative density ("less like wood and more like cooled obsidian," "roadmap of old grievances") appears in most lines of high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching. No loops touch the closure beat directly, limiting total deduction, but cumulative artifact presence disqualifies 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise (peace negotiator resigns to enable treaty) offers a functional twist on war-weary mediator tropes, but the core emotional arc (confession → acceptance → departure) follows a familiar redemption template without sharp deviation. "Operatively gentle" and the ritual clipboard provide specific texture, yet the conflict and resolution would function unchanged with different proper nouns. The elder's shift from contempt to acceptance and the moons' solstice alignment add purposeful detail but do not transform the underlying structure. The piece commits to its premise and avoids hedging, placing it in mid-band: competent synthesis without bold risk or a non-obvious inflection that redefines expectation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kaelen is present from the opening and his decisions drive the treaty signing (confession changes elder's stance, enables signing, resignation anchors peace). He constrains multiple beats and his final choice—departure—shapes closure. However, much of his work is recounted ("as a young commander, he had ordered the burning") rather than enacted in present pressure, and secondary characters make the treaty possible without his agency altering their options on the page beyond the confession beat.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ebony clipboard appears in the opening, is handled across at least three beats (opening grasp, presentation during signing, placement on altar), and its material history ("last peace tree felled before the war") charges the final act. Its transformation from anxious tool to silent offering reweights its meaning and ties to closure. It is used, not merely described, and its removal would weaken the ritual's anchoring image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The concept (price of redemption) is named explicitly and shapes Kaelen's choice to resign, which alters the treaty's success and forecloses his role. It appears early (within first third) and drives the confession beat and final departure. However, "redemption" is stated more often than dramatized through competing costs—the tradeoff between staying to ensure implementation versus leaving to enable trust is asserted, not tested through on-page friction.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Operatively gentle" is introduced early and demonstrated in at least two beats: Kaelen meets the elder's glare "with unwavering calm" and his voice remains "low but carrying" under hostility. The trait enables the confession beat and shapes his final departure without bitterness. However, the attribute is labeled ("a deliberate softness... forged not from weakness") in addition to shown, and no moment tests whether gentleness costs him tactical advantage or forces a visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Muster" appears once in "He mustered his courage" immediately before the confession, which is the story's key turn—it shifts the elder's stance and enables the signing. Removing "muster" would not break story logic; the confession itself does the causal work. The action is present and tied to a major beat but is easily replaceable with "summoned," "gathered," or "drew," reducing specificity and necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Ritual significance is signaled early ("timeframe chosen for its ritual significance," "hallowed ground," "ritual begins at moonrise") and its mechanics matter: the ebony clipboard's origin, the shared ink, the aligned moons, the altar placement. The method shapes the signing beat and the final offering, and Kaelen explicitly argues for it ("ritual significance gives weight to words"). The ritual constrains the sequence of acts and charges the closure image. It is integral across setup, middle choice, and ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The ancient terrace is introduced in the opening line, anchors spatial choreography throughout, and provides the altar stone for the final clipboard placement. The "cracked terrace holding steady" becomes a thematic image at closure. However, the terrace does not constrain a choice—Kaelen's actions would proceed identically on any ceremonial ground. It functions as atmospheric anchor and lyric reprise but does not alter tactics or options, placing it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The timeframe (celestial alignment, midsummer, moonrise) is introduced early and the silver moon's kiss to the horizon marks the signing beat. However, the "slow dance of celestial bodies" imposes no on-page pressure or deadline; the signing could occur at any chosen moment without altering tactics. Time is tracked but does not tighten decisions. The alignment adds ritual weight but functions as symbolic backdrop rather than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Kaelen's desire to anchor ideals in practice is stated early and drives his confession and resignation, which are the story's decisive acts. The motivation is dramatized through choice (he confesses, signs, departs) with friction between his past violence and present gentleness. However, the want versus cost tension is more told ("The price of redemption was not forgiveness—it was surrender") than tested through competing on-page options. The motivation shapes two beats and participates in closure, meeting integration thresholds.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Flawed beauty is introduced early ("beauty existed in the trying," "cracked terrace holding steady," "imperfect courage to begin again") and modulates with pressure—solemnity at the opening, tension during the spitting, tentative hope at the signing. The tone charges the final image: "not paved with ash" and "flawed beauty was not perfection" reweight prior harshness with fragile optimism. The tone is coherent through turns and lands in the ending without forced uplift, though the explicit labeling ("Flawed beauty was not perfection") reduces subtlety.</comment>
