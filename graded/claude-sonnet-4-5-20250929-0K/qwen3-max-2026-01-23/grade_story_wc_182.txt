<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is stated but rarely tested through contradictory impulses; her "carefully resourceful" trait is label-only until the late honesty beat. The Warden encounter offers one moment of genuine agency when she voices her fear, sprouting the vine, but most beats—describing gaps, interpreting Kael's trembling—read as observation rather than high-cost choice. Kael's dissolution is told more than shown, limiting relational pressure. Interior voice leans heavily on elevated diction ("symphony of ancient forests contemplating change") that feels authorial rather than character-particular under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the botanical diary's gaps accumulate meaning, the vine sprouts from honesty, and the final library descent reweights "unlearned lessons" as invitations. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. However, the closure unit—Elara's realization that she tends gardens rather than seeks a library—is asserted in summary ("she understood her motivation had transformed") without a prior on-page micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The Warden steps aside after her declaration, but we do not see Elara choose to stay or renounce another option; the final walk-back is reflective gloss rather than a decisive reconfiguration with felt price. Kael's rescue completes off-stage (he vanishes), so the rescue-mission stake resolves without her visible sacrifice or trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The mountain bookstore supplies vivid tactile detail (dust on runes, moonpetals near wisdom passages, shelves groaning into the Warden) and the spatial labyrinth pressures navigation. The botanical diary functions as micro-setting, constraining her method (she opens it to the gap, the void hums). Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the transition from "slumped against a shelf" to "stone at their feet" to "stairway of soft light" compresses geography quickly. The environment charges the final image (whispering corridors, rustle of pages) but does not constrain the ending choice—Elara's decision to "tend gardens" is reflective rather than forced by setting limits.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rescue Kael and reclaim the lost lesson—is signaled early. Pressure tightens when Kael is fraying and the diary's gap must be filled, but escalation relies on thematic assertion ("the price is not a buried truth, but the courage to nurture the void") rather than a protagonist trade-off that narrows live options. Elara's voiced fear sprouts the vine, a micro-turn, yet the Warden's capitulation ("stepped aside") feels coincidental—her renegotiation is persuasive rhetoric, not a visible cost that alters her tactics afterward. Kael retrieves the book and vanishes; no on-page consequence shows what Elara forfeited to make that possible. The accumulative lens moderates the demand for causal reversals, but the final "rescue is complete" remains told rather than dramatized with a felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme—unlearned lessons as invitations, gaps as potential—emerges from the diary's torn pages and the sprouting vine. The Warden's question ("What gap have you been too afraid to fill?") applies the premise recursively, a purposeful turn. However, Elara's transformation is summarized in the penultimate paragraph ("she understood her motivation had transformed") and the final walk recycles the theme in elevated language ("melody of redemption waiting to be sung," "conducting the symphony of what could be") that reads as authorial gloss rather than earned insight from concrete struggle. The "unheard symphony" tone label appears only in the final paragraphs, arriving late without prior signal. Thematic closure lacks a non-literal answer; instead, it restates the premise as a mission statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elara with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (she "hears grammar in grooves," notices moonpetal cartography) but diction often drifts into elevated register ("cavernous silence," "temporal static," "vellum") that sits above an arcane linguist's internal lexicon under stress. Kael's single line of dialogue ("The Silence War… the lesson on listening") is functional but generic. The Warden's speech ("Seekers of the Unlearned must pay") and Elara's counter-rhetoric are formal and interchangeable in rhythm. Free indirect thought is consistent, though filter verbs ("she urged," "she declared") cluster in the Warden exchange. The final paragraphs shift into lyric summary voice ("she would spend her days carefully resourceful") that loses the on-page present anchor.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Sentence openings vary adequately; paragraphs modulate length. Multiple paraphrase loops appear: "carefully resourceful" recurs four times without evolving function; "unlearned lessons" cycles through noun and verb forms across adjacent lines without added pressure. Template cadence is present in the final two paragraphs (repeated "every [noun]" parallel structure, stacked "she [verb]" stems). Stock metaphors cluster: "turning toward dawn," "fireflies," "paths through dust," "melody of redemption." The Warden's description ("woven wood, stitched leather, whispered pages") is vivid but the simultaneous groaning-coalescing action blurs sequence. Figurative density in the closing walk ("whispering corridors," "rustle of pages turning," "sigh of stone," "symphony of what could be") stacks metaphors without clear propulsion, slowing the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—rescue a time traveler by filling gaps in a botanical diary inside a sentient mountain library—layers multiple speculative elements, but the execution follows a template: seeker meets guide (Warden), answers riddle (voice fear), gains access (stairway appears), retrieves object (book), mission complete. The "gaps as language" concept is intriguing yet the gaps themselves (harmony-ivy, torn pages) function as passive clues rather than active constraints that force difficult trade-offs. Elara's renegotiation and Kael's retrieval resolve without visible cost or surprise; the Warden's capitulation after one question reads convenient. The ending's "tending gardens of unlearned lessons" restates the premise without fresh inflection or hindsight inevitability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and makes the key verbal turn (voicing her fear, renegotiating the Warden's terms). However, most beats are observational (brushing dust, opening the diary, noting moonpetals) rather than high-stakes choices. Her decision to stay and tend gardens is told in summary at the end rather than enacted with cost. The "arcane linguist" trait shapes her perception (hearing grammar in stone) but does not constrain her actions under pressure; her success depends on honesty, not linguistic skill. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but the causal role is moderate—her choices enable rather than force the rescue.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The botanical diary appears early (clutched against chest), is opened to the jagged tear mid-scene (gap as key), and implicitly persists at the end (feeling "like a compass calibrated to compassion"). It constrains her method: she must interpret the absence rather than read a present entry. However, the diary itself does not change state or impose cost—Elara does not tear another page, add a sketch, or sacrifice it. The gap's meaning is asserted ("unspoken truth") rather than discovered through failed attempts. Functional across three beats but swappable for any symbolic journal with blanks; no irreplaceable mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Rescue mission" is stated early and frames the dominant stake (save Kael from dissolution, reclaim the lesson). It drives Elara's urgency and justifies the Warden encounter. Yet the rescue itself happens off-stage: Kael retrieves the book and vanishes without Elara's direct intervention in the final act. The concept is present but the on-page tactics (voicing fear, describing a gap) do not feel rescue-specific—similar moves could serve "unlock a door" or "pass a test." No visible cost unique to rescue (no triage, no choice of whom to save, no sacrifice of her own safety). Setup and middle presence earn mid-band; lack of closure participation and swappability lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Carefully resourceful" is invoked four times but remains label-only until the honesty beat, where voicing fear is more vulnerability than resourcefulness. Noticing moonpetals and connecting diary gaps to barren stone are observational inferences, not resource-constrained tactics. No moment shows Elara improvising with limited tools, rationing effort, or trading one resource for another. The trait does not enable a unique action or impose cost—her success hinges on emotional honesty, not careful resource management. Present as a descriptive tag but functionally inert; swappable with "determined" or "perceptive."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Renegotiate" appears mid-scene when Elara counters the Warden's demand, reframing the price from buried truth to nurturing the void. This moment turns the Warden's stance and opens the stairway. However, the renegotiation is rhetorical rather than costed—she offers a new interpretation but does not trade status, knowledge, or safety. The action could be replaced with "persuade," "reframe," or "challenge" without structural loss. Present and functional in one key beat, but lacks specificity and does not recur or shape the ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"By researching gaps" is stated early as her method and enacted when she examines the diary's torn page and asks Kael to describe the void. The gap-filling mechanic matters once: identifying the harmony-ivy absence leads to the honesty beat. Yet the research itself is minimal—one glance, one question—and does not shape multiple attempts or escalate in difficulty. The method is told more than shown (she "researched the gaps") and could be swapped for "interpreting symbols" or "asking questions." Present in setup and middle, absent from closure (the ending reflects on gaps thematically but does not show her researching another). Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore occupying an entire mountain is vividly described (cavernous silence, towering bookcases, shifting pathways, sentient shelves that coalesce into the Warden) and signals early. It provides the core pressure: navigating to the hidden library, interpreting the mountain's "language," dealing with the Warden as gatekeeper. Moonpetals mark wisdom passages, offering a navigation resource. However, the labyrinth does not impose a spatial cost—no wrong turns, no exhaustion from climbing, no choice between paths that foreclose options. The stairway appears after the Warden steps aside; the descent is unobstructed. The setting enables atmosphere and houses the conflict but does not force a difficult spatial choice at closure. Present across all three gates but causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the time traveler arrives" anchors the timeframe early (Kael materialized "moments ago"). Urgency is stated (Kael is fraying, dissolution imminent) but not tracked—no clock tightens decisions, no visible degradation mid-scene forces faster action. Elara's conversation with Kael and the Warden proceeds at steady rhetorical pace without time pressure altering tactics. The ending shows Kael's form solidifying, suggesting the rescue was timely, but elapsed time is vague and consequence-free. Setup present, middle and closure lack time-driven escalation. Swappable with "during the crisis" or "when Kael appears."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation "to find the Library of Unlearned Lessons" is stated early with "quiet urgency" and frames the quest. It drives her to interpret the diary and confront the Warden. However, the motivation is not visibly conflicted—no moment shows her tempted to abandon the search, torn between safety and rescue, or questioning the cost. The ending asserts that her motivation transformed (from seeking to tending) but this shift is told in summary rather than dramatized through a choice that forecloses the original want. Present in setup, functional in middle pressure, but lacks friction and on-page change with cost at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Unheard symphony" as tone is invoked only in the final two paragraphs ("unheard symphony of the mountain," "melody of redemption," "conducting the symphony of what could be"), arriving late without prior signal. Earlier passages use elevated, lyric diction (cavernous silence, temporal static, whispered pages) but do not establish a musical or harmonic motif that modulates with pressure. The tone does charge the final image thematically, but the late introduction and static application (summary gloss rather than rhythmic escalation) limit integration. Missing setup gate, minimal middle presence, thematic cameo at closure. Ornamental rather than structural.</comment>
