<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior life is vivid and her renunciation of conventional music is motivated by loss, but her therapeutic stance—"teach endings how to begin"—leans toward diagnostic self-awareness that feels workshopped rather than discovered under pressure. The caller's grief is embodied through his compulsive dialing, yet his transformation from loop to path arrives too smoothly without contradictory impulses resisting the shift. Elara's micro-choices (humming the scale, tracing the disc) are present but her own stake remains observational; she guides rather than risks, so no cost forecloses a path for her on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story seeds pattern (loop, disc rotation, circular sorrow) early and the final image reweights the disc from relic to compass, achieving Resonant Reconfiguration. Cost is felt—the caller's eighteen-month loop ends with a decisive choice to dial anew—but Elara herself pays no visible price; her "cultivated estrangement" softens descriptively ("less like a fortress, more like a harbor") without on-page forfeiture. Closure lands cleanly under the accumulative lens with one meaningful deepening, satisfying the 600–800 word gate, but the lack of protagonist cost in the closure beat prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The subway utility tunnel anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph, satisfying the Orientation Test. The scarlet phone booth, dripping pipes, and swinging bulb create tactile specificity, and the glass harmonica disc charges the final image by shifting from "relic of loss" to "compass." However, the tunnel itself does not constrain a choice—it remains atmospheric backdrop—so the 9+ gate (environment/object must constrain choice or charge closure) is not met. The disc's reprise and the streetlamps' hum thread setting through the ending effectively, lifting the score into the 7-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Elara's mission to "teach endings how to begin." The caller's circular grief provides one meaningful tightening—his loop is reframed as a condition for song, and his decision to "dial anew" narrows options with a felt cost (ending the nightly ritual). Agency is present but belongs to the caller; Elara's role is facilitator, so her own escalation is muted. The cost is legible on the page ("I feel it… the space"), satisfying the lens, but the lack of a second reversal or complication and Elara's observational stance cap the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the loop/rotation motif and the disc's dual function (instrument and compass), avoiding direct statement. The caller's arc—from compulsive dialing to conscious ending—offers a non-literal answer to the question of how grief transforms. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic echo ("guide a loop of sorrow into the overture of a beginning") that restates rather than deepens, and Elara's own thematic movement is told ("felt less like a fortress") rather than shown through a renunciatory choice. The glass disc and streetlamps reprise purposefully, and the "rest in the music" metaphor avoids platitude, but the ending's explicit moralizing holds it below 8.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara with a consistent register ("melodically haunted," "honest echoes") and perceptual signature (every sound becomes musical notation). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, and the caller's voice carries distinct vulnerability. However, elevated diction ("cultivated estrangement," "purposeful architecture") occasionally drifts above the tunnel's grit without clear tonal purpose, and the final paragraph's summary tone ("ready for the next ring") externally narrates rather than inhabiting Elara's present sensation. Free indirect style is clean, and no head-hopping occurs, but the prose modulates less under peak pressure than the score demands for 7.5+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("loop isn't imprisonment—it's the condition for the song"). Yet paraphrase loops appear: "teach endings how to begin" is restated three times across the story, and "melodically haunted" is both shown and then re-labeled in near-identical phrasing. Template cadence appears in the opening cumulative markers (not story text, generation artifact), but within the prose itself runs of "Her X, her Y" and "no longer X but Y" recur. The final third leans on summary ("felt less like," "now the tunnel's symphony") rather than concrete image, dulling momentum. No filter-verb stacks or major clarity breaks, but accumulated scaffold and loops apply −0.8 under the Non-closure Accumulation Cap, preventing entry to 7.5+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—phone booth oracle in a subway tunnel—offers a fresh spatial frame, and the glass harmonica disc is a specific, non-obvious object choice. However, the emotional template (grief counselor helps caller release) is widely used, and the transformation from loop to path follows a recognizable arc without subversion or complication. The "melodically haunted" trait and wrong-number-friendship method add texture but do not fundamentally alter the familiar structure. Specific details (scarlet booth, etched disc, eighteen months) prevent full genericness, yet the core feels derivative without a bold, lived-detail twist that would elevate originality above mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara is seeded early (setup ✓), shapes the middle conversation by offering the loop/disc metaphor (development ✓), and appears in the final image (payoff ✓). Her choices—humming the scale, urging the caller to "dial anew"—enable his turn, giving her causal pressure across two beats. However, her role is facilitator; she does not face a cost or foreclose a path for herself, so irreplaceability is moderate. Two-gate lyric reprise and mid-scene enabling lift the score to 5.8, but lack of personal stake caps it below 6.5.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The glass harmonica disc is introduced early (setup ✓), Elara traces its edge during the call (development ✓), and it reappears in the penultimate paragraph as "no longer a relic of loss but a compass" (payoff ✓). Its rotation metaphor directly shapes the caller's reframing of his loop (causal pressure +0.9), and the closure image reweights it (+1.0). Specificity is high—glass harmonica is unusual and its etched surface is handled twice—but swappability is present (any circular instrument or object could serve the metaphor with minor edits, −0.5). Three gates met, two-beat involvement, closure linkage, but moderate swappability caps at 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Cultivated estrangement is named in the fourth paragraph (setup ✓ borderline late) and described as "deliberate architecture" after loss. It recurs thematically in the final third ("felt less like a fortress"), but does not constrain an on-page choice—Elara's behavior (answering calls, offering metaphors) would read identically without this label. Summary-only use (−0.6) and late first mention (−0.3) apply. No middle development beat where estrangement alters tactics; closure participation is thematic echo, not causal. Caps at 4.6 for missing middle development; additional penalties lower to 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Melodically haunted is seeded early (setup ✓): "every drip of water became a metronome tick, every groan of infrastructure a cello note." It enables Elara's humming of the ascending scale in the climax (development ✓), and returns in the final third ("still melodically haunted, but now the tunnel's symphony wove threads of hope," payoff ✓). The trait shapes one on-page action (the hum that releases the caller, +0.4) and charges the closure by reweighting the tunnel's soundscape. However, the trait is mostly perceptual—it does not visibly constrain a choice with cost. Three gates met, one-beat causal involvement, closure linkage, but constraint is light. Score 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Loop is seeded in the caller's confession ("trapped in a loop," "circle with no exit," setup ✓), becomes the pivot of Elara's reframe ("that loop isn't imprisonment—it's the condition for the song," development ✓), and reappears in the final line ("guide a loop of sorrow into the overture of a beginning," payoff ✓). The loop metaphor directly drives the caller's turn from compulsive dialing to conscious ending (causal pressure +1.2) and charges the closure image (+1.0). Irreplaceability is moderate—cycle or spiral could substitute with edits (−0.5)—but three gates, two-beat causal work, and closure linkage lift to 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Wrong number friendships is named once in paragraph six ("through the method of wrong number friendships") as Elara's established practice (setup ✓ late, −0.3). The current call exemplifies the method (development ✓), and the final line references "the next wrong number" (payoff ✓). The method enables the entire encounter (causal pressure +0.9), but its mechanics are not detailed—how calls arrive, how she distinguishes them—so specificity is low (−0.4). Three gates met, one-beat involvement, closure participation as thematic frame. Score 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Subway utility tunnel is anchored in the opening line (setup ✓) and returns in descriptive touches (dripping pipes, train vibrations, streetlamps) throughout. It provides atmosphere but does not constrain a choice—the conversation could occur in any isolated space. The tunnel's "honest echoes" are thematic texture, not spatial pressure that alters tactics. No middle beat where the setting enables or blocks an action; closure image (streetlamps hum above) is postcard reprise without causal force. Setup ✓, no development beat (cap 4.6), ornamental use (−0.7). Score 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Between the hum of streetlamps" appears in paragraph two as a descriptor of Elara's vigil hour (setup ✓ late, −0.3). The timeframe recurs in Elara's advice ("when streetlamps hum their evening song") and the final paragraph ("streetlamps hummed their steadfast vigil"), but never tightens a decision or creates urgency—no clock or deadline pressures the call. The phrase functions as lyric motif, not temporal constraint. Setup ✓, no middle development (cap 4.6), ornamental (−0.7). Score 3.9.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—"to teach endings how to begin"—is dramatized in paragraph six (setup ✓) and drives her engagement with the caller: she reframes his loop, hums the release scale, and urges new action (development ✓). The final line restates the mission ("guide a loop of sorrow into the overture of a beginning," payoff ✓). The desire shapes two beats (reframe + hum, +0.9) and charges the closure (+1.0), but the cost falls on the caller, not Elara; her want faces no friction or trade-off. Three gates, two-beat involvement, closure linkage, but no visible protagonist cost (−0.6). Score 6.9.</comment>
