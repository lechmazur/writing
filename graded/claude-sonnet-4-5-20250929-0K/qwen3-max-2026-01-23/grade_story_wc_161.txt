<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to preserve echoes and his contradiction between hiding/revealing are established, but interiority leans abstract and diagnostic ("grief, sharp as the meteorite's edge"). The final choice to write truth and show Clara carries visible cost but arrives through lengthy reflection rather than embodied pressure. Micro-choices are present (lowering the meteorite, turning to blank page) yet feel orchestrated by theme rather than urgent need. The cooing pigeon at the end tests his stance credibly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—dust motes, paper trails, and the meteorite accumulate meaning across the piece. Orientation is delayed: we learn "Elias," "vintage bookshop attic," and his pigeon-trainer past only through embedded backstory, arriving past the 120-word mark without spatial grounding (−0.4). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): writing truth and deciding to share with Clara reweights his solitude with conceptual cost, though the cost is asserted more than dramatized. The accumulative pattern holds, but late orientation and abstract cost language prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The attic skylight and meteorite chip anchor the spatial frame once established, and dust motes function as micro-setting that charges the final image. However, the attic itself remains generic—no tactile detail of books, no smell or temperature—until late. Spatial choreography is minimal: Elias stands, lowers hand, writes; no movement through the space. The pigeon on the sill at the end adds sensory constraint but arrives too late to shape prior choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether Elias will continue hiding his past or reclaim it. The dust-mote vortex acts as a tightening that "shatters his reinvention," and the decision to write truth is a meaningful deepening. However, the escalation is reflective rather than situational—no external pressure forces the choice; it arises from internal readiness. The cost (ending solitude, risking Clara's judgment) is named but not tested on the page. One credible tightening under the accumulative lens, but agency feels contemplative rather than urgent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges clearly through blooming/withering imagery and the tension between concealment and testimony. The meteorite and dust motes recur with shifting weight, and the final line ("tiny anchor between worlds, between past and present, between withering and bloom") recharges prior material without overt moralizing. The piece resists tidy resolution—Elias's choice is tender but uncertain. However, "balance is found not in stillness, but in the graceful acceptance of the swirl" edges toward thematic summary. Overall, resonance arises from particulars and the ending image holds complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, anchored in Elias's perception. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("meticulously mapping the swirling constellations," "testimony," "liberation") in ways that feel authorial rather than character-particular for a "quiet book mender." Perceptual signature is present—dust motes as historians, paper trails as sanctuary—but the metaphoric density is uniform across calm and peak beats, flattening urgency. No dialogue to judge. Psychic distance is consistent; the final smile and warm meteorite ground the ending in embodied detail.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and several lines carry double duty (meteorite as gift and anchor, dust as historian and ritual). However, paraphrase loops appear: "These paper trails… were his true sanctuary" / "each fragment a desperate attempt to preserve the echo" restates the same content. Template cadence in "He had told… weaving… / But today… shattering… / Grief… threatened…" runs across multiple beats. Figurative language is dense throughout without taught pattern or payoff at closure—"tiny historian," "fragile bloom," "withering soil," "graceful acceptance of the swirl" stack without clear escalation. Line-level clarity is intact but momentum suffers from ornamental phrasing. Apply −0.6 for loops and template cadence, −0.4 for unearned density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise—former courier pigeon trainer hiding in a bookshop attic, using dust-mote observation as grief ritual—offers a specific synthesis. However, the emotional arc (solitude → tentative trust) and the method (mapping dust, writing truth, showing a surrogate) feel familiar. The Mars meteorite and "blooming withering" motif add texture but do not transform the underlying template. The piece commits fully to its lyric register and the ending is earned in hindsight, yet the transformation test reveals the core could transfer to other hidden-past scenarios with minor edits. Mid-band for competent execution of a recognizable grief-and-trust arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias as courier pigeon trainer is backstory that frames his grief and the decision to write truth. The role does not create on-page turns—he is a book mender in present action. His past identity motivates the final choice but does not constrain it; the meteorite and dust motes do more causal work. Present by setup and payoff (two gates), functional but largely replaceable with any lost vocation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The Mars meteorite chip appears in the opening (balance test), is lowered onto the ledger mid-piece, and remains "warm against the paper" in the final line. It anchors Lyra's memory and serves as a physical test of Elias's balance. However, its Martian origin is ornamental—any gift from Lyra would serve the same function. Three gates met, two beats involved, closure linkage present, but swappability and lack of unique causal pressure cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Paper trails" are introduced early as yellowed ledgers and love letters, reappear when Elias writes in the "most sacred paper trail" (the ledger with Starlight's flight path), and the attic transforms from "tomb of reinvention into a sanctuary of testimony, where every paper trail led toward liberation." The concept shapes stakes (preserve vs. reveal) and the climactic writing act. All three gates met, causal involvement in the final choice, but the term "paper trails" functions more as thematic motif than tactical resource—removing the phrase would not break the plot. Mid-band for theme-stakes integration without mechanical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Reinvents personal history" is established early ("a man who had spent decades reinventing his personal history… told the bookshop owner he knew nothing of birds or war"). The trait constrains the present by forcing Elias to choose between continued concealment and restoration. The dust vortex "shatters his reinvention" and the final writing is explicitly "not a fabrication, but a restoration." All three gates met, causal pressure in the ending choice, but the trait is largely told rather than dramatized in micro-choices—Elias does not lie or hide on the page, only reflects on having done so. Mid-band for setup and closure linkage with limited beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Balance" is the opening action (balancing the meteorite chip), returns when "grief… threatened to topple the chip; balance was not rigidity… but yielding to the swirl," and is named again in "This balance, forged by mapping dust and memory." The action defines the method and delivers the thematic realization. All three gates met, two distinct beats, closure linkage strong. However, the meteorite is not actually toppled or dropped—the balance crisis is metaphorical, reducing physical stakes. High mid-band for thematic and closure integration with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Mapping the swirl of dust motes under a single skylight" is introduced in the second sentence as Elias's method for achieving balance, described as "a ritual essential" and "tracing paths only he could decipher." The method is invoked when "a specific vortex of dust mimicked Starlight's ascent," triggering the emotional break, and dust motes return in the final paragraph as "perpetual, gentle reminder." All three gates met, clear setup and closure reprise, but the mechanics are decorative—Elias does not use the method to make a choice; it observes rather than enables. Two gates with lyric reprise and closure charge, but limited causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The "vintage bookshop attic" is named early and supplies the skylight (essential for dust motes), the ledger, and the pigeon on the sill at the end. The setting frames the solitude and provides the sacred ledger for the climactic writing. However, spatial detail is sparse—no books on shelves, no smell, no temperature—and the attic does not constrain movement or choices; it is backdrop. Setup and payoff gates met, one beat (writing in ledger), but the setting is largely atmospheric rather than tactical. Mid-band for framing and closure presence without micro-setting pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Across learning to trust again" is the implied timeframe—Elias's twenty-year solitude and the single scene where he begins to trust. The phrase "a breath that felt like his first in twenty years" marks the shift, and the decision to show Clara "tomorrow" sets a near-future stake. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—no clock pressures the choice; Elias moves at contemplative pace. Setup in backstory, payoff in future intent (two gates), but no urgency or lived duration that alters tactics. Functional but replaceable with any recovery arc.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To preserve the echo of lost songs" is stated mid-piece ("His motivation had always been pure: to cradle the fragile echo of Lyra's songs…") and drives the final writing: "Starlight carried Lyra's Song for the Weary." The motivation is told rather than shown in conflicting micro-choices—Elias reflects on his desire but does not struggle against competing wants on the page. Setup and payoff gates met (two), closure linkage strong, but the desire is asserted rather than dramatized in friction. Mid-band for clear motivation with limited on-page conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Blooming withering" is woven throughout: "fragile bloom pushing through the withering soil," "light nurturing memory even as paper aged, hope persisting within decay," and the final line's "between withering and bloom." The tone is elegiac and bittersweet, coherent across the piece, and modulates slightly at the ending smile. However, the tone is maintained through repeated metaphoric assertion rather than dramatic pressure shifts—emotional intensity is steady rather than escalating. All three gates met, strong closure charge, but the tone is applied rather than emergent from action. Mid-high band for coherence and closure integration with limited modulation under pressure.</comment>
