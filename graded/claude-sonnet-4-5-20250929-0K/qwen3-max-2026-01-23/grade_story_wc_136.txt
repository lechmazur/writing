<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is established and sustained, but interiority leans heavily on abstract labels ("quiet desperation," "emotional armor") rather than embodied contradiction. The surrender of the map is motivated, but the transformation feels declared rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final tear and "buoyant lightness" read as emotional summary without the messy irrationality or competing impulses that would ground the shift. No visible cost forecloses a path; the ending grants wholeness without trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pattern of cracks → booth → punch → map-hole accumulates toward a Resonant Reconfiguration. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening third. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing—the fortress is revealed as internal—but the cost remains abstract; no on-page action or forfeiture crystallizes what Elara loses by accepting this truth. The map's surrender could have been irreversible (a real letting-go), but its careful folding afterward softens the price. One meaningful deepening (arrival at booth, punch moment, realization) satisfies length, yet the final image doesn't land with undeniable pressure because the transformation is told rather than shown through choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The starlit vault, mist, collapsed dome, and ivy-choked booth are vividly rendered and create strong atmosphere. The map functions as a micro-setting object that constrains the climactic choice (she must surrender it). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (ozone, wet stone, forgotten flowers). However, spatial choreography weakens at the booth: the mechanics of sliding the map through the slot and the booth's interior void are not clearly visualized, and the rain-pool reflection's spatial relationship to the booth and Elara's position is unclear. The setting charges the final image but does not force a tactical adaptation beyond the initial offering.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the fortress and achieving clarity—is signaled early and sustained. The tightening occurs at the booth when Elara must dare to surrender her maps, narrowing options to acceptance or retreat. Yet the reversal lacks genuine friction: no competing desire, no cost that alters later tactics. The phantom punch delivers resolution without complication; luck (the mythical object simply works) resolves rather than complicates. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices for this length, but the final reconfiguration grants emotional payoff without forfeiture, capping the score.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of internal truth versus external quest emerges through image and action, yet the final paragraph ("understood then the true route mapped…") states the thesis overtly, replacing scene pressure with summary. The map-hole as window to authentic self is a strong conceptual anchor, but "fortress of unspoken truths was not a distant citadel; it was the sanctuary within her spirit" is a Thematic Echo that articulates the premise in prompt-like language at closure. Diagnostic label-speak ("emotional avoidance," "self-acceptance") in the climax further dulls resonance. The piece invites reflection but resolves ambiguity too neatly, losing complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and psychic distance narrows appropriately at peak beats. Diction is elevated and lyric, matching Elara's character. However, register drifts into abstract philosophical vocabulary ("lithic signposts," "alchemical work," "unspooling of self-deception") that feels authorial rather than character-bound, especially under emotional duress. Filter verbs ("she understood," "she felt") stack in the final third without voice motivation. Perceptual signature is present (she sees arrows in cracks, symphonies in grates) but the specificity fades at closure, replaced by summary interiority. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose is ornate and rhythmically controlled in places ("sacred, breath-held threshold of midnight"), but overwriting pervades high-pressure beats: almost every sentence in the climax carries figurative or elevated diction without pattern-teaching or payoff. Template cadence appears in the resolution ("The weight anchoring…dissolved, replaced by…"; "felt not a mapper…but a traveler…"). Paraphrase loops cluster: "unraveling mysteries achieved its ultimate resolution—not as external discovery, but as internal unspooling" restates the same idea across two clauses. Mixed metaphors: "dawn's faint, rose-gold promise" follows "mist glowed," conflating timeframes. Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the lower range of the artifact penalty and disallowing 9+ globally. Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty, but scaffold phrasing ("with tender care," "finally, peacefully") pads without advancing stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—external quest reveals internal truth—is a widely used template (the fortress is really inside you all along) executed without transformative specificity. The phantom ticket punch and crack-arrows are inventive surface details, but the emotional arc and moral calculus are generic: self-acceptance resolves all friction without cost or ambiguity. The final revelation is legible but entirely obvious from the opening, lacking earned surprise or fresh synthesis. Emotional honesty is undercut by tidy resolution and therapy-speak labels. No bold risk heightens stakes; the piece hedges toward lyric beauty over narrative consequence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's role as route mapper is established early (setup gate met) and her act of offering the map is tied to her profession (payoff gate met), but no middle choice or constraint is shaped by her mapping skill. The trait is mostly decorative backdrop; removing "route mapper" and replacing it with "seeker" would not alter any turn. Present and functional, but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The phantom train ticket punch is signaled by legend, dramatized in the climactic beat (it punches the map), and its effect shapes the closure image (the hole becomes a lens). Three gates met, two distinct beats (approach, use), closure linkage strong. However, the object resolves a problem (Elara's self-deception) it did not complicate; it simply works when invoked. No cost tied to its use, no constraint it imposes. Causal work and irreplaceability elevate it into mid-7s range, but lack of friction and late problem-solving cap it here.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Unraveling mysteries is the stated goal, appears early (setup gate), and the climax delivers a revelation (payoff gate). Yet the concept is thematic rather than tactical: no middle choice is constrained by mystery-solving methods, no false lead alters her approach. The "unraveling" is metaphorical self-discovery, not an investigative process that narrows options. One beat involvement (closure), closure linkage present, but swappable with "seeking truth" or "finding answers" without structural change. Functional reprise that reweights meaning at the end pushes it into the 5.5–6.3 lyric range.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Analytically artistic" is described in paragraph two (sees grates as symphonies, walls as narratives) but never constrains or enables an on-page action. The trait is label-only; we are told she possesses it, but it does not force a trade-off or shape a choice. Setup gate barely met (early mention), no middle development, no closure tie. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dare to surrender her maps is signaled as the required invocation (setup), dramatized at the booth (middle beat), and its consequence shapes the closure (she receives the punched map and insight). Three gates met, two beats, closure linkage strong, and causal pressure is clear: without the dare, no punch, no revelation. The element is irreplaceable and drives the climax. However, the dare itself is emotionally costless—she performs it with "reverent slowness" and retrieves the map intact, undermining the felt price. Strong integration with moderate cost visibility.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Cracks forming arrows are signaled early (paragraph five), guide her route through multiple districts (middle development via summary), and the final crack-arrow points to the booth (payoff). Three gates met, two distinct beats (journey, arrival), and the method enables her arrival at the setting. Yet the arrows are passive guides, not constraints that force adaptation or wrong turns. Removing them and replacing with "followed her intuition" would not break logic. Present across the arc with clear setup and closure callback, but the method is a convenience rather than a crucible. Solid functional integration without high irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The starlit vault in mist is established as the legendary setting (setup), frames the entire climactic sequence (middle and closure beats), and its imagery charges the final moment (mist glowing, starlight through the dome). Three gates met, present across multiple beats, and the setting supplies the booth, the atmosphere, and the visual anchor for the map-hole revelation. The vault does not constrain her choice (she could surrender the map anywhere), but it provides the resources (the phantom object, the rain-pool reflection) and amplifies the emotional resonance. High closure linkage and beat involvement, moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Midnight as "the hour that divides bad habits and new starts" is named at her arrival (setup), and the text later declares "Midnight completed its alchemical work" (payoff). Two gates met. However, the timeframe is symbolic rather than tactical: no clock tightens her decision, no urgency forces haste. The element is thematic ornamentation, swappable with "dawn" or "dusk" without altering choices. Lyric reprise reweights meaning slightly, lifting it into the low-6s, but lack of middle constraint and summarized payoff limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's quest to find the fortress is stated early and sustained throughout (setup, middle journey, climactic revelation). Three gates met, multiple beats. The motivation drives her to the station and to offer the map, and the closure redefines the fortress as internal. However, the desire is never dramatized in friction: no competing want, no moment where she questions whether clarity is worth the price. The motivation shapes the plot but lacks embodied conflict. Strong setup and closure linkage, moderate causal pressure, but told rather than shown under stress.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Trembling certainty is embodied in "violent tremor shook her hands, yet beneath the fear bloomed a trembling certainty" (middle beat) and modulates through the climax into "starlit certainty" and "peacefully, at home" (closure). Setup, middle, and payoff gates met. The tone is coherent and charges the final image, supporting the Accumulative lens. However, the modulation is smooth and declarative rather than layered with contradiction; the tremor is stated, not shown through fragmented perception or syntactic breakdown. The tone fits but does not heighten pressure through rhythm or diction under stress. Functional across beats with purposeful arc, moderate closure charge.</comment>
