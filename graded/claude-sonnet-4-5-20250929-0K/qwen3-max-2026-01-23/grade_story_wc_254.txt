<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The poet remains a label rather than a person; "aesthetically driven in every breath and choice" tells rather than shows through contradictory impulses or difficult micro-choices. Interior experience consists almost entirely of abstract certainty and fulfillment without embodied friction or genuine cost. The "tremor of certainty" and "profound peace" are declared states rather than dramatized through competing desires that force visible sacrifice on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The Orientation Test penalty applies: who, where, and when emerge slowly across the opening, with the poet's name, physical details, and the ban's nature remaining vague past the 120-word threshold. The closure—dissolving the boundary through paraphrase—occurs on the page, but the cost is asserted ("scar was healed," "purpose fulfilled") rather than felt as a foreclosed path or trade-off. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (pattern of paraphrase deepens the hum), but the final reconfiguration lacks visible price; the poet simply steps forward into unity with no friction or loss dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Cobalt walls, quartz colonnade, and frozen lake are anchored early and the quartz hum recurs across beats, but spatial choreography remains painterly—the poet walks, touches, whispers, steps—without the environment constraining a choice or altering tactics. The final step onto singing ice is a thematic flourish rather than a test of access or cost. Sensory detail (diamond sparks, lantern-moth hush) decorates rather than pressures.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—stride through boundaries once thought sacred—is signaled early but unfolds without on-page opposition or cost. Each paraphrase softens the boundary "exactly as the poet had envisioned," eliminating friction rather than escalating it. No reversal, complication, or meaningful tightening occurs; the method works perfectly on first attempt, and the resolution is declared fulfillment rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The theme of boundaries dissolving through language emerges from events, but the final image—"scar was healed," "true purpose of poetry"—delivers an overt thesis statement in place of earned resonance. "Not to conquer but to connect, not to destroy but to dissolve with grace" moralizes the ending. The paraphrase method operates as concept rather than particulars with cost, and the closing lines ("living paraphrase," "promise kept") abstractly summarize rather than reweight prior material through a non-literal image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Voice remains distant and elevated throughout, with diction ("aesthetically driven," "lantern-moth hush," "tremor of certainty") held in a uniform poetic register regardless of pressure. Template cadence dominates: "The poet [verb]" and "Where X let Y" structures recur without variation. Perceptual signature is generic—cloud, shadow, beauty, harmony—without character-specific bias. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("felt sacred," "seemed to lean in") stack without purpose, dulling immediacy in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "boundaries once thought sacred" appears three times, "tremor of certainty" twice, "lantern-moth hush" three times, "aesthetically driven" twice, with synonym churn around dissolve/soften/clear/bridge. Template cadence runs across multiple beats: "The poet [verb], the [noun] [verb]." Figurative density is high without coherence—"frozen wave," "watercolor on wet paper," "diamond sparks"—and metaphors do not accumulate pressure. Scaffold sentences restate content: lines 5–6 paraphrase each other, as do lines 21–22 and 28–29. Information density is low; most lines perform atmosphere rather than advance situation or choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The core premise—dissolving a boundary through poetic paraphrase—offers a fresh angle, but execution trends toward abstraction: the ban's nature, the prohibition's original text, and the cost of transgression remain unspecified. The poet's prior dreams, the scar on the land, and the aesthetic drive are asserted without grounding in lived detail. The paraphrase method is presented as a working magic system rather than a human struggle with language, and the resolution fulfills a template arc (sacred boundary → poetic act → harmony restored) without non-obvious complication or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The cloud-shadow poet is named early and present throughout but makes no decision that narrows options or alters tactics. Walking, touching, whispering, and stepping unfold without friction; each action succeeds as envisioned. The character is a vehicle for thematic statement rather than a causal agent whose choices create turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The humming quartz colonnade is introduced early, touched physically, and returns across three beats (threshold, paraphrase, gateway). The hum deepens in response to the poet's words, and the final image acknowledges it as a melody of welcome. However, its properties do not constrain choice or impose cost; it responds perfectly to the poet's method. Setup, development (middle paraphrase beat), and closure participation are present, lifting it into mid-band, but swappability and lack of causal pressure limit higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>A tremor of certainty appears once at the poet's touch on the pillar and recurs at the end as "promise kept." It functions as thematic label rather than a concept that shapes stakes or alters tactics on the page. The poet never doubts, hesitates, or pays a price for this certainty. Ornamental use without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Aesthetically driven is declared in line 5 and restated in line 28 but never constrains an on-page choice or creates visible cost. The poet's aesthetic motivation is told rather than tested by competing values or a trade-off. Label-only integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase is introduced as the method, demonstrated across three quoted lines that soften the boundary, and acknowledged at closure as the living act. It shapes the middle escalation (each line advances the dissolving) and participates in the final image. However, the paraphrase content is generic and could be swapped with similar poetic inversions; the specific words do not matter, only the category of action. Setup, development, and closure participation earn mid-band but not irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Dissolving boundaries is stated as method in line 10, enacted through the paraphrase sequence, and fulfilled at closure ("final boundary dissolved"). It is signaled early and shapes the middle mechanics. However, it operates as abstract thematic layer rather than a technique with trade-offs or friction; the boundary softens "exactly as envisioned." Functional but no causal pressure or cost tied to this method over alternatives.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Cobalt atrium by a frozen lake is anchored early and recurs as visual frame, but it does not constrain choice or supply resources that alter outcome. The poet walks to it, acts within it, and steps onto the ice without the setting imposing obstacle or cost. Postcard description without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>After the ban lifts is stated in the opening line and frames permission for the journey, but time does not tighten decisions. No clock, deadline, or temporal constraint shapes tactics. The lifting occurred "hours ago" but elapsed time plays no role in the action. Setup present, but no development or closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>To stride through boundaries once thought sacred is named as motivation in lines 6 and 21 and fulfilled at closure, but it is not dramatized as conflicted desire with friction between wants and costs. The poet pursues this goal without hesitation, obstacle, or trade-off on the page. Told-only motivation with no visible price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Lantern-moth hush appears three times (lines 4, 16, 26) and establishes a quiet, sacred tone consistent across beats. It does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image with new meaning; the hush "remained" and is "filled with quiet music" in static repetition. Single mood without escalation or reconfiguration at closure.</comment>
