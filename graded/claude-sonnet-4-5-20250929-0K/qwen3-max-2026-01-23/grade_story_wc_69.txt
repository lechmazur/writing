<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is present through her "expectantly resigned" posture and her observation of micro-shifts in the choir members, but her own internal conflict remains thin—she watches more than she wrestles. The secondary characters (Liam, Anya) show embodied emotion in small gestures (Anya's hum, Liam's nod), yet their arcs are told in summary ("Weeks passed...") rather than dramatized across distinct pressure points. The final exchange between Liam and Anya lands with warmth, but the lack of on-page struggle in those weeks keeps the transformation from feeling fully earned. Elara's motivations are consistent, but her choices do not visibly narrow options or foreclose a path with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors orientation early (library, autumn, choir rehearsal) and establishes a dominant stake: can the choir transcend old hatreds? The "weeks passed" summary compresses the core escalation, so the tightening effect is asserted rather than dramatized beat-by-beat. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration (the Liam–Anya exchange reweights prior tension), but the cost is conceptual and muted—no visible sacrifice or foreclosed path on the page. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (pattern of subtraction + final cadence shift), yet the ending reconfiguration lacks the sharp felt price that would anchor it firmly in closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The velvet library, autumn light, and frost on windows are vivid and anchor the rehearsal space throughout. The rosette is handled twice (placement, final pocketing) and functions as a spatial anchor and thematic charge at closure. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (dust motes, geese, crimson leaves), though the space does not constrain a tactical choice—it serves atmosphere more than action. The final image (moonlight on velvet, rosette warm against skin) charges the ending, lifting the setting into closure participation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (healing fractured town through choir harmony) is signaled early, and the "subtract noise" method provides a conceptual frame for escalation. However, the weeks-long arc is summarized rather than shown in distinct reversals, so pressure accumulates off-page. The Liam–Anya exchange is a meaningful shift, but it arrives as a micro turn without visible prior cost that narrows Elara's options. Agency is collective rather than protagonist-driven, and Elara's role is facilitative—she holds space but does not make a costly choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (harmony through subtraction, unlearning hatred) emerges from the rosette's symbolism and the choir's practice, not overt statement. The final exchange between Liam and Anya offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question, reweighting prior tension. However, lines like "hatred had no home" and "seed of harmony was planted" edge toward thematic echo, stating the thesis rather than letting the image carry it. The rosette's shift from loss to continuity is purposeful, but the piece leans on prompt-like phrasing ("vanishing art," "traveled stillness") that risks ornament over integration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable in third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. The narrative voice carries a lyric, contemplative register ("snow," "velvet quiet," "dawn") that fits the tone and remains consistent under pressure. Dialogue is spare but functional, with Liam's and Anya's lines distinct in content if not idiom. The prose modulates smoothly from early tension to final warmth, and free indirect style is clean. The perceptual signature is Elara-specific (choir teacher observing voice and gesture), though the diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("traveled stillness," "denoting continuity") that flirts with over-writing without breaking clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm, and the prose is largely clean of grammatical errors. However, decorative phrasing recurs: "traveled stillness" appears four times, "expectantly resigned" twice, "subtract noise" three times, creating a template cadence that blunts momentum. The rosette is described as "denoting" twice in succession, a synonym loop. Purple touches ("her heart full of traveled stillness," "tapestry of mended threads") cluster in the final third without clear pattern payoff. Information density is moderate—many lines advance atmosphere but not plot or choice—and the "weeks passed" summary is a missed opportunity for scene work.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise (choir teacher heals town rifts through subtraction method) is earnest but familiar, echoing workshop templates for community healing narratives. The rosette and "subtract noise" frame offer specificity, yet the emotional arc (hatred → understanding) follows a predictable path without a non-obvious turn. The Liam–Anya exchange is warm but not surprising in hindsight. The piece commits fully to its lyric tone and avoids gimmickry, but does not take structural or perspectival risks that heighten stakes. The transformation is asserted more than dramatized, limiting freshness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara places the rosette, dims lamps, and holds space, but these are facilitative gestures rather than choices that create key turns. The piece's arc is driven by Liam and Anya's shift, not Elara's decisions. She observes and guides but does not face a costly dilemma that alters tactics. Present across beats but largely passive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The rosette is placed early, sits between the singers as an anchor, and is pocketed at the end with reweighted meaning (loss → continuity). It is handled in at least two distinct beats and charged at closure. However, it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic—its role is symbolic rather than causal. Strong lyric reprise, but swappable with another symbolic object without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The vanishing art (zither tradition, unlearning hatred) frames stakes and Elara's motivation. The rosette "denoted" vanishing arts, and the final line reprises the concept as resurrected. It shapes the emotional register but does not alter tactics on the page—no on-page choice hinges on the "vanishing" quality. Present in setup and closure, weak in middle development.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Expectantly resigned" is stated twice as a label but does not constrain or enable a specific action with visible cost. Elara's posture matches the phrase (she anticipates failure yet proceeds), but the attribute is told rather than dramatized through a tradeoff or foreclosed option. Functional but replaceable with a near-synonym like "hopeful pessimism."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Denote" appears twice in quick succession to describe the rosette's symbolic role (lineage, continuity). The verb frames the object's meaning but does not create a turn—removing it would change tone, not plot. It is present in setup and payoff, shaping the thematic charge at closure, but the action itself is not causal. A purposeful lyric reprise that reweights the stake without driving a beat.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Subtracting noise" is signaled early ("we listen to the silence," "discard sharp retorts"), shapes the choir's practice across beats ("subtract the noise of judgment," "discarded defensive postures"), and is invoked at closure ("subtracted enough noise to hear each other"). The method structures tactics and the final image. It is present in setup, middle, and payoff, with specificity that would be missed if removed. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The velvet library anchors all action, with autumn light, leaded windows, and frost charging the atmosphere. It is present throughout and supplies the rosette as a prop. However, the space does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—it is a vessel, not a pressure. The setting charges the final image (moonlight, velvet quiet) and supports tone, earning closure participation. Present in all three gates, but its role is atmospheric more than causal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Across unlearning hatred" frames the arc's duration (weeks, autumn to solstice), but time is compressed in summary rather than tracked beat-by-beat. The timeline does not create urgency or narrow options—rehearsals could stretch or contract without plot consequence. Present as a frame, weak in shaping tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara's desire to "braid diverse voices into harmony" is stated early and shapes her facilitative choices (dimming lamps, holding space, placing the rosette). The motivation is consistent and legible, but it does not face friction or a costly tradeoff on the page—she does not risk or sacrifice to achieve it. Present in setup, middle (via her observation of progress), and payoff (final validation), but the want is not dramatized against a competing need.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Traveled stillness" recurs four times and establishes a contemplative, patient tone that modulates with the piece's arc (early tension → final peace). The phrase is purposeful and coherent, charging the final image ("her heart full of traveled stillness"). However, the repetition trends toward ornament, and the tone does not shift sharply under pressure—it remains steady rather than dynamic. Present across beats and at closure, with a clear lyric signature.</comment>
