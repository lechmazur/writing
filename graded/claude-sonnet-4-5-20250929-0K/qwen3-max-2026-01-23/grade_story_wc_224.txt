<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's core motivation (understanding home) is clear and her arc from avoidance to confrontation traces cleanly. The surrender to memory via the feather shows embodied emotion ("tears flowing as she channeled the raw truth"). However, the final realization feels somewhat abstract—"the shape of home was not a location...but the enduring architecture of connection she held inside"—leaning toward epiphany-speak rather than earned through micro-choices under contradictory impulses. The mercury-glass attribute is abandoned rather than tested in tension with her need.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive quickly and the lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through ritual, discovery, texture-seeding, and finally a passage opening. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Elara steps toward the passage with reclaimed strength—and the stone's message reweights the ten-year avoidance with conceptual cost. One meaningful deepening (seeding the memory) tightens her stance. The cost is felt but slightly abstract; the walk "toward a state of being" softens the physical stakes at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore is vivid ("staircases spiraled into star-charted darkness," "sub-basement of extinct dialects") and the sanctuary behind the astronomy dome anchors the ritual. The stone's obsidian/quicksilver texture and the feather's "impossibly soft barbules" constrain the seeding action. However, spatial choreography is loose—Elara teleports from sub-basement to sanctuary without transition—and the mountain's response (shelves grinding, pine-scented breeze) feels convenient rather than causally prepared. The feather-texture method charges the final act but the bookstore itself functions more as backdrop than active constraint after midpoint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding home after ten years of avoidance—is signaled early and the timeframe shift ("numbness had become a heavier burden") creates one meaningful tightening. The seeding action forecloses illusion ("deliberately set her mercury glass aside") with visible cost ("Pain surged, sharp as shattered glass"). The escalation reads under Accumulative lens: density builds to the ritual, then the bookstore's response. However, the final passage opening feels slightly exterior to Elara's agency; the mountain "responded" rather than her forcing a path. The walk toward light is poised but lacks a second on-page choice that tests the new stance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of home-as-internal-architecture emerges through concrete particulars: the mercury glass (illusion vs. truth), the feather/stone ritual, the mother's hands shaping clay. The stone's projected message—"Home is the shape your love leaves upon the world"—borders on direct statement but is earned by the seeding action and reweights the exile/bookstore-as-prison framing. The final image (stepping toward light with "the shape of home in her breath") offers resonance without moralizing. Minor slip: "hidden thunder" appears as both a motif and the required tone element, risking thematic echo, but it's grounded in the storm/rain metaphor ("cleansing rain") and emotional release.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with Elara's perceptual signature clear: "mercury-glass seer" lens colors early description, then shifts to tactile precision during the feather ritual ("impossibly soft barbules whispered comfort"). Diction is controlled and literary ("aching hum beneath her ribs," "autumn leaves") without register breaks. The prose modulates with pressure—short syntax during the seeding ("she held fast"), lyric expansion at closure. No dialogue to judge. One minor slip: the stone "projected the translated essence" reads slightly external, as if narration steps outside Elara's perception, but recovery is quick.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is strong with varied syntax and high information density. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line recharges the "shape of home" motif. However, several ornamental constructions slow momentum: "the impossibly soft barbules whispered comfort, the resilient quill promised strength, the asymmetrical vanes echoed life's beautiful imperfections" stacks three parallel metaphors in one beat without escalation. The phrase "the hidden thunder of suppressed sorrow" is repeated across paragraphs (lines 215, 304) as a thematic anchor, bordering on loop. Minor filter-verb clustering ("she felt the emotional history") in the talents-surfacing beat. No major artifacts touch closure, so deductions remain modest.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—mercury-glass seer in a mountain bookstore using a lost-language stone—combines high-fantasy elements in a fresh configuration, and the feather-texture seeding method is specific. However, the emotional arc (avoidance → confrontation → epiphany about home) follows a familiar template, and the bookstore's response (shelves grinding to reveal a passage) leans on convenient world-mechanics introduced late. The resolution, while earned by the ritual, does not surprise; "home is carried within you" is a well-trodden insight. Transformation is present but incremental rather than bold.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara (mercury-glass seer) is present throughout and her choice to abandon the mercury glass and seed the memory drives the key turn. She appears early, acts in the middle (seeding), and walks toward the passage at closure. However, "mercury-glass seer" functions more as a label/backstory trait than a skill tested on-page—she uses the glass to "paint gentle illusions" in summary (line 43) but never demonstrates it in scene. The seer role is told, not shown constraining a live choice. Score: setup +0.6, middle choice (abandoning glass) +0.4, closure participation +0.7, but swappability (could be "exiled scholar" with minor edits) −0.6, label-only trait −0.3. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lost language stone is discovered early (line 81), handled in the seeding ritual (line 163–202), flares with silver light (line 202), projects the translated message (line 237), and is placed in the pouch at closure (line 280). Three distinct beats: discovery, seeding, message. The stone's obsidian/quicksilver texture and resonance are specific, and removing it would break the seeding mechanism. Score: setup +0.7, two+ beats +0.9, causal pressure (enables the ritual) +1.0, closure linkage (carried as talisman) +0.9, irreplaceability +0.6. Strong integration, one step shy of indispensable because the bookstore's response (passage opening) could occur via other triggers.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Buried talents (the ancestral gift to perceive emotional truth in language) is stated early (line 107) as sealed away, surfaces after the ritual (line 226: "she felt the emotional history in the candle wax"), and subtly informs the stone's translation. The concept shapes the stakes (reclaiming what was lost) and the seeding action unlocks it. However, the talent's demonstration is brief and abstract—Elara feels "emotional history" in objects but does not use this perception to alter a subsequent choice. Score: setup +0.6, middle enabling +0.4, closure presence (implied in her new perception) +0.5, but summary-only use (talents "surfaced naturally" without dramatized cost) −0.5, partial swappability (could be "sealed memories" instead) −0.4. Functional but underutilized.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The attribute "substitutes reality nightly" via mercury glass is introduced early (line 43) as a ten-year ritual of avoidance. Elara deliberately sets the glass aside (line 149) to reject illusion, which is a visible choice with cost (facing raw grief). However, the attribute is never shown operating on-page—only summarized in backstory. The glass reappears at closure as "a relic of fear" left behind (line 290). Score: setup +0.6, middle choice (abandonment) +0.4, but ornamental (no on-page demonstration of illusion-making) −0.7, summary-only −0.5, late closure cameo +0.3. Present but not tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The action "seed" is introduced via marginalia (line 116), performed in the central ritual (line 173–178: "she performed the action of seeding—the memory of her mother's hands"), triggers the stone's response (line 202), and enables the talents to surface (line 226) and the bookstore to open the passage (line 263). The seeding drives the major turn from avoidance to reclamation. Score: setup +0.7, two+ beats (ritual, stone response, talents unlocked) +1.3, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, irreplaceability (no other action is prepared) +0.7. Very strong. One point shy of 9+ because the passage opening feels slightly exterior to the seeding rather than a direct result.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The method "via the texture of a feather" is signaled by the marginalia (line 126: "the seeding intention must be channeled solely via the texture of a feather"), the raven feather is retrieved (line 137), and the texture is engaged in the ritual (line 163: "the impossibly soft barbules whispered comfort, the resilient quill promised strength"). The feather appears in three beats: retrieval, seeding, and pouched at closure (line 280). Score: setup +0.7, two+ beats +0.9, causal pressure (enables the seeding) +1.0, closure participation (carried as talisman) +0.8, specificity (tactile detail matters) +0.6. Strong integration; the method is necessary and irreplaceable for the ritual.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The labyrinthine bookstore occupying a mountain is introduced early (line 29) with vivid detail ("staircases spiraled into star-charted darkness"), supplies the discovery site (sub-basement, line 81), and responds at closure by revealing the passage (line 263). The setting frames the entire story and shifts from "prison of avoidance" to "cradle" (line 314). Score: setup +0.8, middle resource (discovery location) +0.4, closure participation (opens passage) +1.0, thematic reweighting +0.5. However, the bookstore does not constrain mid-story choices—Elara moves freely—and the passage's appearance feels reactive rather than earned by spatial logic. Partial swappability: any vast, labyrinthine space could serve. Strong framing, moderate causal role.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after remembering becomes painful" is introduced early (line 53: "the timeframe had irrevocably shifted; the numbness of avoidance had become a heavier burden") and drives the inciting shift from avoidance to action. The ten-year backstory (line 43) frames the stakes. However, time does not tighten choices in the present scene—the ritual proceeds without deadline or urgency, and the passage opens when complete. Score: setup +0.7, shapes inciting motivation +0.6, but no live clock −0.4, static once the scene begins −0.3. Functional as backstory pressure but not as a present constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to understand the shape of home" is introduced early (line 69: "a desperate need to understand the shape of home, a concept blurred by exile") and recurs at key beats: the seeding memory involves her mother and "the lost word for 'hearth,' a sound meaning safety" (line 178), the stone's message redefines home (line 237), and the final image carries "the shape of home in her breath" (line 323). The motivation drives the ritual choice and is resolved by the closure insight. Score: setup +0.8, two+ beats (seeding, message, closure) +1.2, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage (reweighted understanding) +1.3, cost connection (grief faced) +0.4. Very strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tone "hidden thunder" is named explicitly (line 215: "The hidden thunder of suppressed sorrow") and recurs at closure (line 304: "the hidden thunder within her settled into calm strength"). The metaphor of storm/release structures the emotional arc: suppressed (hidden), released ("cleansing rain," line 215), then resolved (calm strength). Tone modulates from silent tension (opening) to raw grief (seeding) to poised calm (closure). Score: setup (implicit early tension) +0.5, middle intensification (storm breaks) +0.8, closure charge (settles into strength) +1.2, coherence +0.6. However, the phrase "hidden thunder" is used as a thematic anchor rather than sustained atmospheric pressure; it's named twice rather than textured throughout. Strong lyric reprise but slightly over-reliant on the label.</comment>
