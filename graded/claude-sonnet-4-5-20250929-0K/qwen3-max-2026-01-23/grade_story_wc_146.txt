<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her attribute of "infinite patience" is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. The action sequence shows deliberate choices (footfall patterns, rhythm shifts), but her interiority remains largely label-driven ("her patience held firm") without embodied contradiction or genuine struggle. The piece tells us she feels "tremors of the looming collapse" yet no micro-choice reveals cost or hierarchy of values—she simply proceeds. No meaningful change or renunciation occurs; she executes a plan without visible forfeit.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates resonant images (water drop, phantom ember, translucent figures) toward a final reconfiguration where "shared balance was restored." Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: the town revived to "serene sanctuary"), but the cost is asserted ("collapse averted") rather than shown through a visible forfeit or altered option on the page. Orientation anchors are present early (Elara, archway, ghost town), and the pattern of footfall-driven restoration is taught and held, but the final beat lacks a concrete price paid—no choice forecloses a path, no tangible loss appears.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ancient archway functions as both frame and setting anchor, appearing at opening and closure with amber-light transformation that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (archway, cobblestones, well, forge, square), and sensory detail is vivid (chamomile/rosemary, rain-scented stone, hearth-baked bread). The ebony tuning fork and cobblestones constrain Elara's method (rhythm via footsteps), satisfying the micro-setting allowance. However, the setting does not impose a hard choice or resource limit—it receives her action without resistance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: prevent the collapse and restore balance. The piece shows one meaningful deepening as Elara's rhythm shifts from slow cadence to triplet to spiraling dance, each coaxing new manifestations (water drop, ember, translucent figures). However, escalation is sequential accumulation without a pivot that narrows options or forces a trade-off. No on-page reversal tests her commitment; coincidence does not resolve, but neither does protagonist agency visibly alter her path under pressure. The "final dissonance snap" is told, not shown through a contested choice with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory, community, and shared rhythm emerges through concrete particulars (chamomile ghosts, hammer-song, children's laughter), avoiding overt moralizing until the final paragraph's "testament to patience, purpose, and the healing power of intentional rhythm" edges toward summary. The tuning fork and footsteps recur with shifting meaning (seed note → town's heartbeat), and the ending image ("wild hush remained... full of listening, full of peace") reweights the opening's "wild hush... thick with forgotten footsteps." However, the central question (how to restore severed connection) receives a tidy answer without ambiguity or counter-reading; the resolution skews toward reassurance rather than earned complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric ("a well of stillness forged by decades," "coaxing moss to retreat like respectful shadows"), consistent across the piece. However, perceptual signature is generic—her way of noticing reads as authorial rather than character-specific, and the prose does not degrade under the asserted stress of looming collapse. Filter verbs appear sparingly ("felt not sound, but a tremor"); the larger issue is register uniformity that abstracts rather than grounds sensory perception in Elara's particular expertise or emotional state.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Prose is polished with vivid imagery and varied sentence structure, but information density is low: many lines restate the same action (footsteps restore, memory rekindles) without advancing pressure. Template cadence appears in mid-section beats: "A shutter... swung," "At the dry well...," "Past the blacksmith's forge..." (location + passive effect). Paraphrase loops include "rekindled," "woven back," "restored" across adjacent paragraphs. Metaphor is consistent but occasionally strained ("threads of silver light" coexisting with "moss... respectful shadows"). The final third avoids major artifacts, preserving closure clarity, but cumulative scaffold and synonym churn lower momentum earlier.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The ghost-town-revived-by-ritual premise is familiar; the tuning-fork twist offers modest freshness, but the emotional arc (arrive, perform ritual, succeed) follows a predictable template without meaningful resistance or transformation. Elara's character does not change—she executes her plan as intended. The piece commits fully to its lyric premise and avoids hedging, but the transformation test fails: swapping "bell tuner" and "ebony tuning fork" for "herbalist" and "seed pouch" would leave plot and arc largely intact. Risk-taking is stylistic (elevated diction, mosaic imagery) rather than structural or thematic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her choices (pressing fork to keystone, walking patterns, rhythm shifts) structure the sequence. However, her decisions are execution of a known plan without on-page friction or cost; she does not face a complicating choice that alters tactics. She appears in setup, middle beats, and ending, meeting two gates, but her agency is mechanical rather than tested.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The ebony tuning fork appears in three beats: opening (in her palm, pressed to archway keystone for diagnosis), mid-section (humming against her thigh as confirmation), and ending (stilled, song absorbed). Early signal is strong, and it enables her diagnostic method, but it does not constrain a choice or return with reweighted meaning at closure—it simply completes its function and disappears. Present in setup and middle, but closure participation is passive.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Ghost town revival is the dominant stake and shapes every tactic on the page: footfall rhythm, memory rekindling, balance restoration. Elara's method and all narrative beats serve this concept. However, the concept is executed rather than complicated; no friction arises from the revival itself. It drives setup, middle beats, and ending, meeting all three gates with strong causal pressure, but swappability remains moderate—another restorative ritual could replace it with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Infinitely patient" is asserted in setup ("her attribute was... infinite patience") and mentioned once in a pressure beat ("Elara's patience held firm though tremors... vibrated"), but the trait is label-only. No on-page action demonstrates a visible tradeoff where patience costs her speed, opportunity, or safety. The slow cadence could read as patience enacted, but the text does not show haste tempting her or patience foreclosing an alternative. Missing middle development and closure participation; present at setup only as exposition.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Rebuild" is the core action from setup through ending: she rebuilds via footsteps, each turn (water drop, ember, translucent figures) traces to her rebuilding rhythm, and the final image declares balance "restored." The action is irreplaceable—removing "rebuild" collapses the plot. However, the method (rhythm) does more mechanical work than "rebuild" as a concept; the action itself is broad and could encompass many means. Strong across all three gates with clear causal pressure and closure linkage, but moderate specificity limits the top band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Footstep rhythm is signaled early ("rebuild via the rhythm of footsteps on cobblestones"), used in every major beat (slow cadence, triplet at the well, staccato at the forge, spiraling around the archway), and the ending declares "her rhythm had become the town's eternal heartbeat." The method is mechanically specific and irreplaceable: removing footsteps breaks causality. It shapes tactics, constrains her approach (she must walk, not sing or speak), and charges the final image. All three gates met with high causal pressure and closure integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ancient archway frames the opening and ending, is pressed with the tuning fork for diagnosis, and pulses with amber light at closure. It provides spatial anchor and symbolic weight (guardian promises, stones sighing gratitude). However, it does not constrain a choice—Elara uses it as a passive anchor, not a resource or obstacle. Present in setup and ending with charged reprise, but missing middle development as a pressure source. Lyric resonance elevates it within the mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Before the collapse" is mentioned in setup as motivation and surfaces once mid-section ("tremors of the looming collapse vibrated through the soles of her boots"), but the timeframe is vague—no live clock or ticking deadline alters her tactics. The collapse is averted off-page ("the final dissonance snap—... the collapse averted") without a visible race against time. Present at setup, weakly in middle (as atmosphere, not constraint), and resolved at ending, but the temporal pressure is asserted rather than dramatized through narrowing options.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To restore shared balance" is stated as motivation in setup, pursued through every beat (footfall rhythm to awaken memory and connection), and declared achieved at ending ("shared balance was restored"). The desire drives all choices and is causally active across the arc. However, it is never conflicted—no friction between restoring balance and another want or cost appears on the page. Meets all three gates with strong causal work, but lacks the friction or visible tradeoff that would reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Wild hush" is established in the opening line ("existed in a wild hush, a silence thick with..."), modulates mid-section ("The wild hush transformed; no longer empty, but humming with potential"), and anchors the final image ("The wild hush remained, but it was no longer a void; it was a vessel, full of listening, full of peace"). Tone is coherent, purposeful, and charged at closure with clear reweighting of the opening mood. The hush frames pressure and shifts meaning as the town revives, meeting all three gates and supporting the accumulative lens.</comment>
