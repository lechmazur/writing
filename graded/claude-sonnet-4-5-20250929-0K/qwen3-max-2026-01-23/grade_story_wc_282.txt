<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clearly established and drives her choices through the network, but her interiority relies heavily on abstract declarations ("purpose burned with quiet intensity") rather than contradictory impulses in scene. The transition from encountering the fossil to the decision to map it feels inevitable rather than contested; no visible internal friction appears when she chooses to remove the artifact or later decides to leave it for others. The final turn toward continuing her work reads as affirmation rather than a choice that forecloses a path with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara's sensory mapping work builds through heat-mapping, fossil encounter, map completion, and placement. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first 120 words. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of Elara returning to the depths with the fossil's pulse as "compass and confirmation" reweights her solitary witness role. However, the cost at closure is implied rather than viscerally legible on the page—no specific renunciation, loss, or altered tactic appears in the final beat, only mood ("hope, heat-mapped and true").</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The coastal cave network is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (bioluminescent algae, moss-lined cases, tide-worn crevices) and the setting directly enables Elara's heat-mapping practice. Spatial choreography is clear across moves from grotto to workshop to shore. The elm leaf fossil's placement in a marked crevice at closure links environment to future action. The cave's "damp contour" and her "bare feet" establish tactile familiarity that supports her professional authority, satisfying the micro-setting gate for 9+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—ensuring sleepers awaken to a remembered world—is signaled early and remains coherent. The fossil encounter provides one meaningful deepening (validation through "light and motion"), and the map's transformation shows escalation under the Accumulative lens. However, no on-page choice narrows live options or imposes a visible trade-off; Elara encounters no resistance, resource constraint, or competing demand. The decision to leave the fossil for "future seekers" rather than deliver it directly to the cryo-chambers is presented as natural continuation rather than a dilemma with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The theme of transitional objects and graceful passage emerges through concrete particulars: the elm's "serene acceptance," the map as guide rather than record, and the covenant between silence and memory. The final image of the fossil's pulse offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. However, the closing paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("a covenant—a factually mystical promise") and Elara's internal declaration ("hope, heat-mapped and true") leans into label-speak at a high-pressure beat, reducing earned ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and controlled, blending lyric compression ("a labyrinth of stone and memory") with concrete action. Psychic distance remains stable in close third throughout. However, several lines drift into elevated register that clashes with immediate perception: "factually mystical, not myth" reads as authorial gloss rather than Elara's thought, and "Pre-hibernation science had irrefutably documented" carries exposition weight inconsistent with her embodied focus. Filter verbs ("she perceived," "she felt") appear in clusters during the grotto beat without adding urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or purposeful restraint: "silent language of place," "ember of deep time," "planetary breath," and multiple variations on warmth/light metaphors appear in nearly every paragraph. The grotto beat stacks filter constructions ("a wave of profound peace flooded her," "she perceived," "she felt") that dull immediacy. Paraphrase loops occur: "translate the silent language" / "speak for the silent stones" and "waiting sea" / "patient memory" restate without adding pressure. Template cadence appears in the workshop sequence with repeated "she [verb]" stems across four consecutive sentences.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of sensory cartography, cryo-hibernation premise, and heat-mapped emotions offers fresh angles on post-human stewardship. The elm fossil's measurable anomaly ("irrefutably documented heat signature") attempts to ground the mystical in verifiable science, a non-obvious choice. However, the floating artifact and Elara's solitary-witness role echo familiar lone-wanderer templates without transformation through lived friction or non-obvious moral calculus. The decision to leave the fossil rather than integrate it into the master map or deliver it directly lacks the bold risk that would elevate the premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara appears in every beat and her professional method (heat-mapping) frames the action. She makes three key choices: to approach the fossil, to capture its signature on her map, and to place the case in a marked crevice for future seekers. The final choice alters her immediate path (returning to the depths) but does not narrow prior options with visible cost; continuation rather than renunciation. Present throughout, causal in the workshop and shore beats, and shaping the ending image, but swappable for another solitary witness role without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The elm leaf fossil is introduced in the grotto beat (~30% mark), handled physically when Elara presses palm to stone, captured in the crystal case where it continues to hover, painted onto the master map as "radiant amber core," and placed in the shore crevice at closure. It drives the validation beat, the map transformation, and the covenant promise. Removing it would break the map's emotional anchor and the closure image of "gentle pulse." Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, though late first appearance and the fact that another ancient artifact with measurable warmth could serve a similar structural role prevent full indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Transitional objects appear as explicit theme in two passages: the fossil described as "the ultimate transitional object" and the map labeled "itself a powerful transitional object." The concept shapes Elara's stated motivation (bridging past and present) and the decision to create guides for disoriented awakeners. However, the concept does not constrain on-page choices—Elara encounters no friction between preservation and use, no dilemma over whether to keep or release the artifact. It operates more as interpretive lens than tactical pressure, present in theme and closure image but not altering options in middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Factually mystical" is introduced mid-story as a descriptor for the fossil's heat signature, presented as "measurable truth defying explanation." The trait enables the floating phenomenon, which validates Elara's work and charges the final image. However, the trait does not constrain action or impose a visible trade-off—the anomaly simply confirms rather than complicates. The phrase itself reads as authorial gloss rather than dramatized property. Functional in one beat (the grotto validation) but easily replaceable with "scientifically verified anomaly" or similar phrasing without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating action occurs in the grotto beat when the fossil detaches and hovers, is sustained in the crystal case during transport, continues in the workshop, and implicitly persists in the shore crevice ("gentle pulse"). It provides the validation Elara seeks ("the unknown speaking through light and motion"), charges her emotional response (tears, hope), and anchors the closure image. Removing the float would require Elara to validate her work through other means and would diminish the mystical bridge between her method and the artifact. Present in three distinct beats with clear causal and emotional weight, though "glow and emanate warmth" could substitute with moderate edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Heat-mapping is introduced in the opening third as Elara's core method: perceiving "residual feelings embedded in stone" and rendering "thermal signatures onto kelp-paper using pigments." She applies the method in the grotto ("focusing her heat-mapping intent"), uses a whalebone brush to paint the fossil's signature onto the master map, and the final internalized metaphor ("hope, heat-mapped and true") ties closure to the method. The technique shapes her professional identity and the map's transformation beat. However, the mechanics remain abstract—no visible constraint (limited pigments, fatigue, perceptual overload) alters her tactics, and the method succeeds without friction in every application.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The coastal cave network is established in the opening line and structures all action: damp contours, sea-level grotto with bioluminescent algae, high cavern workshop open to the sky, and tide-worn shore crevice. The setting supplies the fossil (embedded in limestone), provides Elara's workspace (moss-lined cases, kelp-paper, cave crystals for pigments), and her professional domain (the master map of the entire network). The marked crevice at closure ensures future seekers will find the artifact. The caves constrain her solitary work and enable her sensory practice; removing this exact setting would require reimagining her entire method and the hibernation premise's geography.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The post-hibernation timeframe is introduced early ("Generations slept in cryo-chambers") and frames Elara's motivation: humanity's absence creates the need for sensory maps to guide awakeners. The premise shapes her solitary witness role and the intended audience for her work. However, time does not tighten on-page choices—no countdown, seasonal pressure, or approaching awakening alters her tactics. The timeframe provides context and stakes but does not constrain the beats; Elara's work proceeds without temporal friction. Present in setup and closure thematically but passive in development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation "to become the voice of the unknown" is declared early and restated in the final third ("she had given voice," "to speak for the silent stones"). It drives her map-making practice and the decision to place the fossil for future seekers rather than keep it. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized through conflicted choice—no moment shows her weighing personal attachment against public service, or risking her voice for the unknown. The phrasing itself ("voice of the unknown") trends abstract and borders on prompt echo. Present in framing and closure but without visible friction or cost that tests the commitment.</comment>
