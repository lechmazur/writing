<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Aris's motivation is clear and consistent—outwit cosmic tricksters—but his interior remains thin and label-driven rather than contradictory under pressure. The "cautiously hopeful resolve" is asserted twice without embodied tension; his weary tears at the end feel performative rather than earned by prior micro-choices. Dean Croft's memo and the quad conflict are told rather than dramatized, flattening the relational crucible. No meaningful internal contradiction acts on the page; he proceeds from plan to execution without genuine friction or surprise.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when by the opening and delivers an on-page Decisive Change: the tricksters' signal softens, students reconcile, and Aris accepts Croft's approaching consequence with resolve. Cost is visible—termination looms, modulator may be destroyed—but the causal chain is weakened by heavy exposition (chart marginalia, cosmic background) that tells rather than shows the trickster mechanism. The climax relies on subsonic broadcast mechanics introduced late and summarized rather than tested, creating a modest orientation debt and reducing felt escalation. Under a Causal lens, the because/therefore linkage is fragile; under Accumulative, the density increase at the ending is present but muted by repetitive thematic statements.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The basement radio station is anchored early with oscilloscope glow and humming console, providing tactical resources (transmitter, modulator). Spatial choreography is clean; Aris's position, the quad outside, and Croft's approach are legible. However, the setting remains functional rather than charged—no tool or environmental detail constrains a choice or charges the final image beyond backdrop status. The astronomical charts are handled twice but do not evolve causally; sensory detail (dust motes, green glow) is vivid but ornamental, not filtered through urgency or integrated into micro-choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake—stop the tricksters' discord—is signaled early and pursued consistently. One meaningful tightening occurs: Croft's memo escalates institutional pressure, forcing Aris to bypass filters and act despite consequence. The broadcast succeeds, and the quad calms with visible cost (Croft's footsteps, inevitable termination). However, the turn is not driven by Aris's agency under live pressure; it is executed per a pre-planned alignment with no surprise, adaptation, or complication. The stakes are declared cosmic yet resolved through a single technical act that faces no mid-scene friction, reducing felt escalation. Cost is legible but modest for the scale claimed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of cosmic manipulation versus human empathy emerges through particulars (subsonic frequency, quasar pulse, student reconciliation), but the final paragraphs dissolve into overt thematic echo: "ethereal grit: the fusion of cosmic wonder and stubborn, earthly resolve" and "humanity had scored a point—not through power, but through precise, compassionate interference." These meta-statements replace scene pressure and articulate the thesis rather than earning it. The recurring astronomical charts are mentioned but do not shift meaning at closure. Subtext is thin; the piece explains rather than invites reflection. The ending offers resonance, but the stated moral—"in the silent language of subsonic frequencies, that was everything"—summarizes theme rather than embodying it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Aris with no head-hopping. Diction is generally consistent, though elevated register ("celestial puppeteers," "frequency of empathy woven from celestial mathematics") occasionally clashes with the scientist's tacit pragmatism. Perceptual signature is present but generic; Aris's noticing is filtered by occupation yet not character-particular. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("knew," "allowed himself") are sparse and acceptable. Psychic distance remains mid-close throughout; no purposeful modulation under pressure. Voice is readable but lacks rhythmic control or syntactic variety that would reflect stress at peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clarity is high and grammar clean, but the prose suffers from moderate template cadence and paraphrase loops. Multiple sentences open with "Aris" or "He" in identical stems; "cautiously hopeful" appears twice verbatim. Stock metaphors abound: "sleeping giant awakened," "flowers after drought," "dawn bled across the horizon." Figurative density is uneven—high in setup (dust motes dancing, jagged scar of malice) without pattern-teaching or payoff. The final third recycles thematic summary across adjacent lines ("ethereal grit," "precise, compassionate interference," "silent language of subsonic frequencies") without added pressure. Information density is moderate; several scaffold sentences restate prior content. Rhythm is static; no acceleration or breath in step with escalation. Apply baseline artifact penalties for template stems and stock metaphor strings; the closure beat is touched by thematic echo, escalating the deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Core premise—celestial tricksters sowing discord via infrasound—is inventive but not transformed through grounded stakes or non-obvious moral calculus. The resolution is a single technical broadcast without complication, reversing discord with no friction, which reads as convenience plotting. Emotional specificity is thin; Aris's arc follows a predictable trajectory from plan to execution to acceptance. The quad reconciliation is generic ("tentative conversations bloomed like flowers after drought"); details are particular to the sci-fi frame but not to lived human complexity. The combination of elements (charts, transmitter, pulsar alignment) feels checklist-driven rather than organic. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the piece plays it safe within template bounds.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Aris frames the story, makes the key decision to bypass filters, and executes the broadcast—driving setup, middle choice, and closure. His occupation shapes perception and tactics (chart marginalia, modulator soldering, frequency tuning). The character is indispensable; removing him breaks all causal linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Charts are present in setup (traced, pinned above console) and reprise in the final beat ("glowing softly under console light like a promise kept"), but they are handled only twice and do not constrain a mid-scene choice. The lyric reprise reweights meaning modestly, but the object remains decorative between beats. Missing middle development caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Dean Croft's memo is the sole on-page power play, declared but not dramatized; it raises stakes modestly but does not alter Aris's tactics (he bypasses filters per existing plan). The concept is functional yet replaceable—any institutional threat would serve. Closure does not hinge on power dynamics. Late signal and low causal pressure limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Cautiously hopeful" is labeled twice verbatim (lines 11 and 23) but never constrains an on-page action with visible cost. The trait describes Aris's stance rather than shaping a trade-off or choice under pressure. It is thematically consistent but ornamental; swapping it for "determined" or "resolute" would require only minor edits. Present in closure but without causal teeth.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Interfere" is the story's engine: Aris interferes by hijacking the transmitter and broadcasting the counter-frequency, which forms the climax and reverses the tricksters' signal. The action appears in setup (stated plan), middle (execution: bypass filters, launch frequency), and closure (maintains broadcast as Croft approaches). Removing interference collapses the plot. High integration with one friction: the execution is told rather than tested, reducing felt cost slightly.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Subsonic frequencies are signaled early (Aris's specialty, tricksters' weapon), shape the method (custom modulator, counter-frequency from quasar pulse), and resolve the conflict (softening the jagged signal). Present across all three gates with specificity that matters—ears cannot detect it, yet it unravels psychic poison. One friction: the mechanics are summarized rather than dramatized at the peak beat, weakening causal pressure. Strong but not indispensable; another esoteric method could substitute with edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>WXRU basement frames the story and supplies the transmitter, which Aris uses to execute the plan. The reinforced window overlooks the quad, grounding spatial logic. The setting enables the climax and appears in closure (console light, transmitter hum). However, it does not constrain a choice—Aris proceeds unimpeded—and no micro-setting detail (tool state, access limit) alters tactics. Solid causal role but no felt pressure from environment itself.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Community division is the backdrop and supplies the problem Aris addresses, but the timeframe is vague (weeks of soldering, "that afternoon," midnight alignment). No live clock tightens decisions; the pulsar alignment is stated as perfect per charts, not dramatized as narrowing. Division appears in setup (quad battlefield) and closure (reconciliation blooms), but elapsed time is untraceable and does not pressure tactics. Two gates met; missing middle escalation and clock-driven tactics cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Outwitting cosmic tricksters is Aris's stated motivation, drives his soldering and chart analysis, and shapes the climax (launching counter-frequency as the pulsar aligns). The motive is consistent, specific to character, and causally active across beats. One friction: the desire is declared more than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices; Aris proceeds methodically without internal friction or competing want. Strong integration with modest cost visibility.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Ethereal grit" is asserted in the final beat ("the fusion of cosmic wonder and stubborn, earthly resolve") and present in earlier images (dust motes in green glow, cautiously hopeful resolve, tears on grime-streaked cheeks). Tone is coherent but static; no modulation under pressure differentiates calm setup from climax. The label appears once as meta-commentary, weakening its organic emergence. Lyric reprise reweights modestly but does not charge the closure with undeniable pressure. Two gates with thematic consistency but ornamental final use.</comment>
