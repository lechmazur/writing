<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's guilt and motivation are clearly signaled, but the arc remains linear: he moves from passive guilt to passive acceptance without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The climactic "realization" beat (207) is delivered as an abstract insight—"a seed to nurture into action"—rather than embodied choice under pressure. The final resolve to "offer second opinions" feels asserted rather than dramatized with visible cost that forecloses a path. Internal conflict is present but not layered; Elias never wrestles between competing goods on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative lens: pressure builds through the repair sequence and pays off when the music box plays "Amazing Grace." Orientation is prompt (shop, Elias, the box) and the closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Elias's apology transforms into actionable purpose with felt cost (accepting mercy he doesn't feel he deserves). The cost is emotional and legible at lines 238–247. However, the key reversal (the hairline fracture discovery, 191) is triggered by a deus ex machina shaft of light rather than Elias's agency or prior causality, weakening the earned quality of the turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The shop is vivid and selective: "dust motes," "lemon oil," and "soft tick" anchor the space with sensory specificity. The workbench, magnifying lamp, and light-through-rain all constrain Horvath's discovery and charge the climax. The environment subtly mirrors interiority ("vibrant hush," storm clearing) without heavy-handed symbolism. Spatial choreography remains clear. The recurring clockwork heart constrains the final image, qualifying as micro-setting that charges closure and pushing this into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>One dominant stake—repairing the box to honor Samuel—is signaled early and tightens when the first opinion declares it "scrap" (91). The turn at line 191 narrows options (repair becomes possible), but it arrives via coincidence (the light shaft) rather than Elias's decision. Agency is limited; Elias observes while Horvath acts. The final resolve to "turn apology into action" offers a trade-off, but it is told rather than tested on the page with a dramatized choice that forecloses an alternative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—second chances, grace, redemption—emerges organically from the repair sequence and Samuel's legacy. The clockwork heart's pulse becomes a concrete correlate for the lesson without overt moralizing. Line 207 risks abstraction ("a seed to nurture"), but the final image (277) reweights prior material non-literally: the repaired heart's "steady beat" echoes Elias's renewed purpose. The piece avoids a stated moral and invites reflection through particulars. Minor slip: "divine precision" (173) nudges the subtext toward the obvious.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elias; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent, with rhythmic control ("vibrant hush," "silent sermon"). Dialogue (68) feels natural and character-specific for Samuel. However, register occasionally drifts into literary stock phrases: "prayers through slanted light" (line 2), "soft rasp blending with the shop's gentle ticking" (135). These constructions read as authorial rather than rooted in Elias's chaplain idiom. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at peak beats (238), but the prose sometimes prioritizes lyricism over embodied immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; most sentences advance multiple jobs. But figurative language clusters heavily: "silent prayers," "physical echo," "divine precision," "silent sermon," "vibrant hush" recurs three times. Lines 173–191 layer metaphor on metaphor without pattern-teaching, creating register drift at the climax. Paraphrase loops appear: lines 135 and 159 both describe Horvath's voice with similar texture. Template cadence: "He [verb]" structure repeats across multiple paragraphs (146, 159, 227). Apply −0.6 for density and −0.4 for loops, totaling −1.0 in this category.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The penitentiary chaplain and clockwork heart offer fresh particulars, and the "second opinion" frame is non-obvious. However, the redemption-through-craft arc follows a familiar template: guilt → mentor figure → symbolic repair → epiphany. The shaft of light that reveals the fracture (173) is a stock device. Emotional specificity (Samuel's steady voice, Elias's throat tightening) adds texture, but the transformation test reveals the arc would survive unchanged with different names and objects. Risk-taking is modest; the piece executes competently within conventions rather than transforming them.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and frames the story, but his choices are passive: he seeks Horvath, observes, and accepts the lesson. His final resolve (263–287) is an interior decision without on-page cost that alters tactics. Setup is immediate; closure participation is present but observational. Two beats (seeking second opinion, accepting the repaired box) involve him, but neither narrows options through his agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The clockwork heart appears in the opening (line 38), drives the repair sequence (multiple beats: first opinion dismisses it, Horvath examines it, the fracture is found, it plays), and charges the final image (238, 277). Removing it would collapse the story's stakes and closure. It is handled, examined, and its state (broken/repaired) shapes all turns. Specificity is high (brass, human-organ shape, mainspring). Cost is tied to it (Samuel's execution, Elias's guilt). This is indispensable integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The concept is signaled early (Elias seeks a "second opinion" after the first dismissal, 101) and shapes the central action: Horvath's re-examination discovers the fracture. It alters options (scrap → repairable) and drives the thematic lesson (207, 263). However, it is not tested again after the discovery; Elias's final resolve to "offer second opinions" is told, not dramatized. Three beats: first opinion, seeking second, discovery. Causal and closure-linked, but the concept's mechanical work ends before the final image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Aptly deliberate" is used twice (111, 217) to describe Horvath's movements. It characterizes his method but does not constrain a choice or impose visible cost. The trait is label-only; we see Horvath work carefully, but the story would function identically if he moved quickly or erratically. No middle development or payoff that shapes outcome. Introduced late (first use at 111, past the 40% mark). Cap at 4.6 for missing setup and being swappable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Deserve" is present in dialogue (146) and Horvath's reply (159), shaping a thematic beat. It recurs in Elias's final acceptance (247). Setup is mid-story; development is thematic rather than mechanical; closure participation is present ("did not feel he deserved," 247). Two distinct beats, but the action is a concept discussed rather than a physical turn. Lyric reprise reweights the stake at the end. Eligible for ~6.1 under the lyric allowance, but swappable with "worth" or "merit" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The method appears once, at the climax (173), when the light shaft reveals the fracture. It enables the key discovery but is not signaled earlier and does not shape prior attempts. Setup is absent; development is absent; payoff is present and causal. The mechanics matter (illumination allows the find), but the element is a passive environmental trigger rather than a tool Elias or Horvath deploy. Swappable with "Horvath tilts the lamp" or similar. Cap at 4.6 for late intro, but +0.9 for causal pressure at one beat yields ~5.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The shop is established immediately (line 1) and provides resources: the magnifying lamp (123), the workbench (173), and the repair tools (217). Horvath's presence and expertise are setting-dependent. The space's "vibrant hush" charges the final image (227). Three beats: initial anchoring, lamp/workbench enable discovery, tone reprises at closure. Removing the shop would require wholesale rewrite. Specificity is high (lemon oil, velvet stool, slanted light). Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, causal pressure +0.8. Baseline 3.0 + 4.0 = 7.0, round to 7.6 for strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Calm before realization" is fulfilled at line 123 (Horvath probes, "calm before realization thickening the air") but functions as atmospheric description rather than a time constraint. No clock tightens decisions; the repair sequence is untimed. The phrase is ornamental and does not alter tactics. Setup is present (123); no middle development; no closure participation. Swappable with "focused silence" or similar. Decorative use −0.5, no causal work −0.5, yields ~3.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is stated early (80: apology "demanding payment only tangible repair could satisfy") and drives every choice: seeking Horvath, watching the repair, accepting the lesson. It is conflicted (guilt vs. helplessness) and reappears at closure (247, 287). Three beats: initial framing, middle persistence, final transformation. Removing it would erase Elias's arc. Friction between wants (redemption) and costs (accepting undeserved mercy) is legible. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4. Baseline 3.0 + 4.6 = 7.6, round to 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Vibrant hush" opens the story (line 1), recurs at the climax (227: "filling the vibrant hush"), and modulates with pressure (storm outside, calm inside). Tone is coherent and charges the final image. Setup is immediate; development is sustained (the shop's quiet persists); closure reprises the phrase with reweighted meaning (hush becomes hope-filled). The tone is specific and irreplaceable. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.6. Baseline 3.0 + 3.8 = 6.8, round to 6.9 for strong lyric integration.</comment>
