<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elian's spiritually curious nature is present but operates largely through reflection rather than conflicting impulses acting in scene. The cosmic janitor follows a contemplative arc from solitude to realized connection, but the internal journey unfolds through meditation without the contradictory desires or genuine struggle that would elevate characterization. The final peace settles smoothly without foreclosing a live option with visible cost. Interiority leans toward abstraction ("sacred space where connection blossomed") rather than embodied, character-particular perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the meteor event and the reflection deepens at the lantern glass. Closure arrives as a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Elian's acceptance of his role carries conceptual cost (the overlooked era reframed as preparation), though the price remains implied rather than dramatically foregrounded. Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the meteor triggers empathy and crystallizes his understanding, satisfying the lens, but the cost is felt more than visible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The shooting star tracking station supplies vivid atmospheric detail (crystalline floor, great dome, dormant consoles) and the yellow lantern glass functions as micro-setting that charges the final reflection. The dome viewport and the lantern's curve constrain Elian's nightly ritual and provide the physical anchor for his epiphany. Sensory selection is filtered through reverence (dust motes as dormant stars, amber glow as small sun) and the environment remains consistent across the arc, meeting the 9+ gate by shaping both choice and closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: to find strength in vulnerability through empathic communion with falling stars. One meaningful deepening occurs when the brilliant meteor's arc syncs Elian's entire being with its descent, narrowing his understanding and altering his stance from custodian to guardian. The escalation is driven by protagonist attention and the act of tracing, though agency reads more as receptive witness than active decision that forecloses options. Cost is conceptual (renunciation of armor, acceptance of fragility) and legible in the final image, though the price lacks a visible trade-off or loss on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—vulnerability as sacred space for connection and strength—emerges through the meteor event and the lantern-glass reflection rather than direct statement. The story resists overt moralizing until the penultimate third, where lines like "Vulnerability was not weakness but the sacred space where connection blossomed" veer toward thematic echo, reducing subtext. The final image (lantern glass holding cosmos within him) offers resonance, yet the piece edges into philosophical summary ("resilient grace," "flourishing stillness") that abstracts rather than embodies the central question. Recurrence of stillness and stardust accumulates purposefully but lacks the non-literal answer that would elevate theme to the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct contemplative register ("profound hush," "primal elegance," "sacred method"). Perceptual signature is spiritually inflected and selective, filtering setting through reverence. However, elevated diction ("flourishing stillness," "tuning fork for the cosmos's subtle whispers") occasionally drifts beyond what the janitor's voice would naturally produce, and the prose converges on a single lyric texture without modulation under the meteor's peak pressure. No dialogue to evaluate. Focalization is clean with no head-hopping, and purposeful compression (the shift from observation to descent to epiphany) is legible, though the register feels slightly imposed rather than organic to character.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose carries lyric rhythm and vivid images ("silver scar across the heavens," "liquid gold"), but pervasive figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching, creating density that slows rather than propels (−0.5). Paraphrase loops recur: "flourishing stillness" is restated across multiple paragraphs without added pressure; "vulnerability" and "strength" cycle through synonym variants (−0.4). Template cadence runs appear in the middle third ("The station…," "The hush…," "He…") with identical stems (−0.4). Stock metaphors (dust motes as stars, heart as tuning fork) lack fresh specificity. Information density is uneven—beats often do two jobs (setting + interiority) but repeated thematic assertions ("not weakness but sacred space") add scaffolding rather than momentum. Combined artifact and loop penalties total approximately −1.3 in Q7, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The cosmic janitor in a derelict observatory offers a recognizable template (solitary contemplative finds meaning in small rituals). The story personalizes through the yellow lantern glass and the act of tracing falling stars, yet the emotional arc—loneliness to peace via acceptance of vulnerability—follows a well-worn path without a non-obvious synthesis. The transformation test suggests plot and arc could transfer to a different setting (lighthouse keeper, monk in ruins) with minor edits. Tone and voice cohere, but the piece does not take bold structural or perspectival risks that heighten stakes. Derivative premise guardrail applies (−0.8): the solitary seeker archetype is executed competently but not transformed through lived detail or unexpected moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cosmic janitor is introduced early (first sentence), recurs across beats (sweeping, ascending, tracing, reflecting, descending), and his final decision to resume sweeping as a "deliberate act of reverence" reweights his role from custodian to guardian. The character's choices (placing the lantern, tracing the meteor, lowering his hand) create the arc's key turn. Causal pressure is present but moderate—decisions alter his stance rather than tactics under external conflict. Closure linkage is strong; the janitor's realization charges the final image. Integration earns 6.8: setup +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.2, cost connection +0.4, minus late cost visibility −0.3, minus swappability (role could be monk, keeper) −0.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Yellow lantern glass appears early (second paragraph), is used in two distinct beats (placed on viewport to begin tracing ritual, then examined for reflected starlight), and charges the closure ("lantern glass held no flame but reflected the cosmos within him"). The object's curve and amber glow shape Elian's communion and the final epiphany. Integration: setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.4, specificity (curve, amber, salvaged beacon) +0.6, cost connection (holds light within vulnerability) +0.5, minus slight ornamental description in beat two −0.2. Total 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Flourishing stillness is named early ("core concept he sought") and recurs as theme ("flourishing stillness where silence was fertile soil," "cultivator of flourishing stillness," "allowed his own spirit to flourish"). However, it functions primarily as thematic label rather than a mechanic that alters on-page choices or tactics. The concept deepens understanding but does not constrain action or narrow options with visible cost. Integration: setup +0.5, closure echo +0.4, thematic resonance +0.3, minus ornamental/label-only use −0.8, minus swappability (could be "sacred quiet," "generative solitude") −0.5. Total 4.8, capped at 4.6 for missing middle development gate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Spiritually curious is introduced early (fourth paragraph) and frames Elian's motivation ("trait that transformed his solitude into pilgrimage"). The attribute enables the nightly ritual and the decision to trace stars, appearing again near the end ("His spiritually curious nature had led him here"). However, it remains largely a label without on-page constraint or visible trade-off—curiosity does not force a difficult choice or cost. Integration: setup +0.6, one beat (ritual decision) +0.4, closure mention +0.3, minus label-only treatment −0.6, minus no visible cost −0.4. Total 5.1, capped at 4.6 for missing middle development gate.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Empathize appears mid-story as the climactic action ("pure empathy washed over him—he felt the star's joy in release") and drives the key turn from observation to communion. The action is prepared by prior tracing beats and leads directly to the tear and the lantern-glass realization. Integration: middle arrival +0.3, one major beat (meteor empathy) +0.4, causal pressure (empathy triggers epiphany) +1.0, closure linkage (realization flows from empathy) +1.2, cost connection (tear as shared vulnerability) +0.5, specificity (empathy with star's surrender) +0.5, minus late first appearance (past midpoint) −0.4. Total 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Tracing the path of falling stars is introduced in the fifth paragraph as Elian's "sacred method," demonstrated when he traces the meteor's arc ("traced its entire arc, breath held"), and recalled in the penultimate paragraph ("traced falling stars to find his own place"). The method shapes the ritual and the peak beat, though the mechanics (fingertip on viewport) are simple. Integration: setup +0.6, two beats (nightly ritual, meteor arc) +0.9, causal pressure (method enables communion) +0.9, closure linkage (method yields his place) +1.0, specificity (fingertip, arc, descent) +0.5, minus slight swappability (could be "following," "charting") −0.3. Total 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Shooting star tracking station is anchored early (first paragraph) and provides both macro-setting (dome, consoles, observatory stairs) and resources (viewport for ritual, lantern salvaged from beacon). The station's abandonment and stillness pressure Elian's solitude and supply the dormant consoles and crystalline floor that embody the core concept. The setting shapes his nightly ascent, the meteor observation, and the final descent, functioning as crucible and sanctuary. Integration: setup +0.8, three beats (ascent, observation, descent) +1.4, causal pressure (station enables ritual and isolation) +1.2, closure linkage (station as sanctuary charges final image) +1.3, specificity (dome, consoles, stairs, beacon) +0.7, cost connection (overlooked era as preparation) +0.4. Total 7.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Through the hush of an overlooked era is introduced in the opening line and recurs in the final paragraph, framing the station's abandonment. However, the timeframe remains vague (era unspecified, no ticking clock) and does not tighten decisions or tactics. The "overlooked era" functions as mood and thematic backdrop (reframed as "preparation") rather than a constraint. Integration: setup +0.6, closure reprise +0.5, thematic charge (overlooked → preparation) +0.4, minus no middle development −0.5, minus vague/untracked time −0.6, minus no tactical pressure −0.4. Total 4.2, capped at 4.6 for missing middle development gate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>To find strength in vulnerability is stated early (eighth paragraph: "His motivation was clear") and drives the arc from tracing stars to accepting shared fragility. The motivation is dramatized through the meteor empathy ("felt the star's joy in release") and the tear as testament, culminating in the realization that "vulnerability was not weakness." However, the want is never conflicted with a competing desire or cost on the page—Elian pursues it without friction or trade-off. Integration: setup +0.6, two beats (empathy, realization) +0.9, causal pressure (motivation shapes choices) +0.9, closure linkage (motivation resolved in final stance) +1.0, minus told-only framing ("motivation was clear") −0.4, minus no friction/trade-off −0.6. Total 6.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Primal elegance appears in the third paragraph ("truth crystallized with primal elegance") and the sixteenth ("elegant, vulnerable dance of existence"), setting a tone of lyric reverence. The tone remains coherent across beats—elevated diction, contemplative rhythm—and modulates slightly during the meteor event (intensity in "breath held," "wave of pure empathy"). The final image (lantern glass, resilient grace) sustains the tone and charges closure. Integration: setup +0.5, two beats (meteor, final image) +0.9, closure charge +1.0, coherence across turns +0.6, modulation under pressure +0.4, minus static lyric texture (little variance) −0.3. Total 6.3.</comment>
