<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is specific and purposeful—her dry wit anchors the high-stakes revelation. The motivation (finding river origins as rebellion against symptom-mapping) is clear and drives choices. However, the protagonist's journey is largely observational rather than decisional until the final commitment to drill, which arrives late and feels more like stance crystallization than a choice that forecloses competing paths with visible cost. Internal contradiction is minimal; she moves from curiosity to confirmation without sufficient friction or competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: condensation pattern, falcon flight path, and phrasebook converge to reweight Elara's understanding of river origins. Orientation anchors quickly (outpost, frozen lake, after falcon returns). Closure arrives as Charged Poise—"she would drill" crystallizes intent, and the final footnote image reconfigures her cartographic project with conceptual cost (rejecting "settled science," accepting solitude). The cost is felt but oblique; the story stops at commitment rather than consequence, which keeps it shy of the high band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setting details are vivid and selective: crystalline ice dust, frost-rimed planks, grimy window, rusted beams all create tactile atmosphere. The outpost's corroded infrastructure and the frozen lake pressure Elara's isolation and supply her tools (window condensation, shadow-casting geometry). The single-location constraint and recurring objects (window, glass, stove) charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout, and the environment actively enables her method.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—confirming river origins at convergence—is signaled early and tightens through accumulation: falcon return, condensation pattern, phrasebook phrase all converge to narrow her uncertainty. The deepening is meaningful but cerebral; Elara's agency is largely interpretive (deciphering, correlating) rather than decisional under competing pressures. The choice to drill arrives late and feels inevitable rather than a trade-off. Cost is conceptual (professional rebellion, isolation) but not viscerally tested on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: "maps are conversations, not conclusions," origins versus symptoms, convergence as answer. The final footnote image—"Source confirmed at convergence of sky, messenger, and memory"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates through gesture (Elara's palm on glass, Glyph's chirp, the dog-eared page) and purposeful ambiguity (upwelling as literal and metaphorical). One minor slip: "worrying tranquility" is stated rather than fully embodied in early beats, though it charges the ending effectively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: dry wit ("rather bold cartographic correction"), atlas-editor diction, subtly confident rhythm. POV distance is stable; no head-hopping or withholding. Perceptual signature is character-specific (she notices condensation patterns, phrasebook dog-ears, falcon flight paths). However, some diction drifts elevated in peak moments ("uncanny precision," "latent power," "silent confirmation") without clear voice motivation, and the single line of dialogue feels more ornamental than goal-driven or subtext-laden.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Clarity and momentum are strong; sentences advance atmosphere and knowledge efficiently. Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is mostly controlled. However, several paraphrase loops appear: lines 131 and 122 both assert convergence; lines 139 and 242 restate "worrying tranquility" shifting to peace; "the polyglot's phrasebook" is described twice in similar terms (lines 91, 165). Template cadence in the middle third ("The falcon's return was...," "This was the singular convergence...," "Her motivation crystallized...") flattens propulsion. Apply −0.6 for loops and template runs, per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of cartography, convergence mysticism, and avian messenger is specific and non-obvious. Emotional particularity (arguing with publishers, tracing phantom tributaries) personalizes the quest. However, the core frame—lone scholar at remote outpost deciphering ancient wisdom—is familiar, and the piece does not transform it through bold risk or non-obvious moral calculus. The ending stakes are conceptual rather than visceral, and the resolution feels preordained once the convergence aligns. Transformation test: the emotional arc could transfer to other settings with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her choices (approaching window, consulting phrasebook, deciding to drill) create turns. However, most beats are observational; her key decision (to drill) arrives late and is more a confirmation than a choice under competing pressures. She shapes two beats (condensation reading, phrasebook cross-reference) and the ending, reaching mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The phrasebook appears in three beats: early mention (satchel), dog-eared page 47 consulted (beat involvement), and silent witness on cot at closure. The dog-ear is handled physically (thumb finds it without hesitation) and the phrase reweights her understanding of convergence. It shapes tactics (cross-referencing ancient wisdom) and the closure footnote echoes its language. However, it does not constrain a choice with visible cost; it enables rather than pressures.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Singular convergence is signaled early (line 37: "where the rivers begin"), developed through condensation's inward pull (line 70), falcon path alignment (line 113), and phrasebook phrase (line 102). It shapes stakes (finding the source) and tactics (correlating evidence). The closure image ("convergence of sky, messenger, and memory") articulates it explicitly. Removing this concept would collapse the story's logic and thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Subtly confident appears as label (line 48: "subtly confident grace") and flavor (line 176: warm tone, line 252: "subtly confident heart"). It colors her bearing but does not constrain or enable a key choice with visible cost. Her actions read as competent throughout without a trade-off where confidence risks something or subtlety hides vulnerability under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The falcon's return opens the story, signals the convergence (line 113: "herald foretold"), and Glyph's chirp punctuates the pre-dawn beat (line 176). The logged flight path aligns with condensation, creating the convergence proof. This action drives two beats and shapes the ending's logic. Swapping it for another messenger would require structural rewrites, though the herald function itself is archetypal.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The condensation pattern is signaled early (line 58: "deciphering...pattern of condensation"), demonstrated (line 70: rivulets converge inward), and used again (line 149: palm on glass, vibration). It enables her method and shapes the middle turn (convergence proof). However, its mechanics are described more than enacted under pressure, and it does not constrain a failed attempt or force a tactical shift.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The rusted outpost supplies essential resources: grimy window (condensation map), corroded beams (Glyph's perch), small stove (warmth/comfort), and shadow geometry (dawn plan). It pressures isolation and frames the frozen lake's silence. The setting enables her method (window reading), shapes multiple beats, and charges the final image ("threshold...where cartography bowed to convergence"). Removing this exact location would break the story's micro-geography and closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe anchors the opening and creates a forward clock: after falcon return, Elara reads condensation, consults phrasebook, plans to drill at dawn. The wait-for-dawn tactic (line 158) is time-shaped. However, elapsed time is vague (one evening/night?), urgency is low, and the clock does not tighten decisions or force trade-offs. Present in setup and closure, but does not constrain middle choices with cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation ("find where the rivers begin") is stated early (line 37), dramatized through her method (condensation reading, phrasebook consultation), and articulated at closure (line 131: "rivers...begin...where atmosphere, intention, and memory intersected"). It drives her presence at the outpost and the decision to drill. However, it is not visibly conflicted; no competing want (safety, companionship, career) creates friction or cost on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Worrying tranquility is named early (line 27), shifts meaning (line 139: "hummed with latent power"), and resolves (line 242: "no longer a tension but a clarity"). Tone modulates with pressure and charges the final image. However, the opening use is stated rather than embodied through perception, and the phrase recurs with synonym churn ("profound hush," "peace"). Present across all three gates but not consistently enacted through sensory texture under pressure.</comment>
