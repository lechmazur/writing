<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Aris's motivation is clear and embodied through the crystal vial and Elena's memory, with internal contradiction evident in the tension between panic and meditative patience. The oxygen alarm provides concrete pressure that forces micro-choices. However, interiority occasionally drifts toward label-speak ("profound peace," "lonesome splendor") rather than purely embodied perception. The final renunciation is earned by prior causality with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Earned Stasis: Aris surrenders with the memory preserved, foreclosing his survival with visible cost. The causal lens holds throughout—descend, unsnarl with patience, secure vial, accept death. Orientation anchors quickly (underwater temple, failing oxygen, distress beacon). One meaningful tightening occurs when the oxygen alarm forces him to override instinct at the climax.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The underwater temple is vividly rendered with bioluminescent fungi, obsidian dais, and coral archways. The oxygen gauge and crystal vial function as micro-setting elements that constrain choices throughout. Spatial choreography remains clear across the sanctum. The "gathered hush" functions atmospherically but could more directly shape a tactical choice to reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve the memory before oxygen expires—is signaled early and tightens through the oxygen alarm chimes. The reversal occurs when panic surges at ten minutes but Aris consciously overrides instinct, using Elena's memory as anchor. Agency is clear: his choice to maintain slow, deliberate movements forecloses the rushed alternative with visible cost (his life). The price is legible and scales appropriately.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of ephemeral beauty versus mortality emerges through concrete action (unsnarling threads, witnessing temple memories). The final image of the vial resting against his still heart offers resonance without stating a moral. However, phrases like "lonesome splendor" and "profound peace" trend toward thematic declaration rather than pure emergence from scene. The connection between personal redemption (Elena) and communal memory could be more tightly braided.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited with clean focalization through Aris. Psychic distance modulates appropriately under pressure (vision tunneling, black spots). The prose carries a distinct lyric texture with controlled rhythm. However, elevated diction ("colossal archway veiled in ancient coral," "gathered hush") occasionally feels decorative rather than strictly character-filtered. No head-hopping or filter-verb excess noted.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. The unsnarling sequence propels cleanly. However, overwriting appears in clusters: "profound, gathered hush," "lonesome splendor," "bittersweet anchor to purpose" stack figurative language without clear payoff. Paraphrase loop detected: "gathered hush" and variations recur without functional evolution. Stock metaphors ("crushing dark," "cold fire") appear in peak beats, triggering cumulative −0.8 under patterned-artifact penalties.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—dying diver unsnarling a memory-knot—offers a fresh synthesis of familiar elements. The crystal vial's attribute (touching memories) and the method (overriding instinct) show specificity. However, the broader frame (redemptive death in a mystical place) follows recognizable patterns. The transformation test holds: changing names and setting would significantly alter texture. Risk-taking in the quiet, sacrificial ending is present but not exceptional.</comment>
