<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's cool-headed resolve manifests clearly through "voiced silence" and deliberate movement, but her interiority leans heavily on abstract labels ("quiet intensity," "profound understanding") rather than embodied contradiction. The grief for her lost daughter surfaces late and feels inserted to generate emotion rather than complicating earlier choices. Her competence is high throughout—no genuine struggle or mistake pressures her arc until the vortex, where the shift to openness rather than capture reads more told than earned through prior micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening lines; the piece holds a single POV across one continuous scene. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the garden's chaos accumulates through vivid imagery and Elara's voiced silence deepens in the vortex, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (she does not capture the echo but is remade by it—Charged Poise with felt cost). The cost is legible: she abandons her original goal of capture and accepts transformation, though the exact sentence marking that shift could be sharper. Minor deduction: the transition from zigzag avoidance to "straight and sure" closure reads slightly asserted rather than fully dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is vividly realized with selective, purposeful detail: crystalline harmonics, rivers of melody, thorny dissonance. The rail spike constrains choice—its warmth and glow guide Elara's method and charge the protective circle. The garden's emotion-transliteration rule pressures tactics (grief → rose-gold path). Micro-setting qualifies: the spike and soil anchor the climax, and the final constellation shift (the Cradle) reweights the space. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout; no generic postcard syndrome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—catching the goddess's echo—is signaled early and tightens once: Elara's shift from pursuit to receptivity at the vortex narrows options and forecloses the original goal with visible cost (she does not capture, but opens). The escalation reads as deepening under the Accumulative lens: shattered C-major, cacophony surge, thorny dissonance all pressure her method until the vortex crystallizes the choice. Agency is present (driving the spike, voicing perfect silence), though coincidence plays a role (sleepwalking constellations pausing). One meaningful tightening is sufficient for this length; cost is felt but could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the rail spike as "pen for the earth," chaos incorporating into "richer, more resilient symphony," the shift from catching to being caught. The final image of the goddess's echo as a permanent heartbeat rhythm offers a resonant answer without moralizing. However, lines like "wild with cosmic power yet tender as a whispered promise" and "the ultimate feral lullaby" lean toward thematic echo—telling the theme rather than letting it emerge. The grief integration feels late and somewhat imposed to generate thematic weight rather than arising organically from earlier conflict.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is distinct: Elara's cool-headed filter shapes what is noticed (calm nimbus, precise zigzag). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, with purposeful compression in metaphoric language ("feral lullaby," "voicing silence"). Minor slips: "profound attribute" and "boundless compassion" drift toward elevated abstraction not fully grounded in Elara's lexicon under pressure. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance modulates intentionally at the vortex. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings diversify. Information density is high in the garden's sensory catalog and Elara's method. However, multiple lines repeat the "feral lullaby" label (opener, mid-section, twice near the end) without added pressure—paraphrase loop that dulls the closure beat. Template cadence appears in the mid-section: "She leaped… sidestepped… She shaped… exhaling…" Stack of subject-verb stems across four lines triggers minor deduction. Figurative density is high but mostly legible; "rivers of liquid melody" and "thorny thickets of dissonance" work, though some metaphors (indigo mist, silver light) feel stock. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The sound wave garden and emotion-transliteration offer a fresh synthesis, and "voicing silence" as method is non-obvious. The rail spike as humble bridge between mortal and divine is specific. However, the emotional arc—grief for lost daughter, acceptance of grace, internal peace—follows a familiar template: solitary seeker finds healing through mystical encounter. The constellation as witness and the shift from zigzag to straight path are well-executed but not bold enough to overcome the derivative grief-journey frame. Transformation test: swap names and setting details, the arc remains recognizable. Mid-band originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara appears in setup, drives middle beats (spike planting, zigzag navigation), and is present at closure. Her cool-headed trait manifests as calm nimbus and voiced silence, constraining her method across at least three beats. However, her choices feel more observational than decisive until the vortex; earlier moves (leaping fissures, sidestepping vortices) are evasions rather than reconfigurations. The final choice—opening rather than capturing—is signaled but not sharply turned by prior contradiction. Causal pressure is moderate; cost is felt but the trait could be swapped for "focused" or "disciplined" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The rail spike is seeded early (paragraph 5), used in two distinct beats (driving into soil to create protective circle, striking into vortex), and present at closure ("cooled to dull iron… purpose fulfilled"). Its warming/glowing states evolve with Elara's resolve and grief, transliterating emotion into action. Grandmother's whisper primes its function ("pen for the earth"), and the spike's humble materiality ("rust-pitted relic") contrasts its charged role. Cost is tied to it: the spike channels love/loss and enables the final reconfiguration. High irreplaceability; removing it would break the method and closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Sleepwalking constellations appear in setup (paragraph 8), complicate middle action (causing sound waves to shiver/warp, pausing to observe Elara), and shift at closure (settling into "the Cradle"). They tighten the timeframe ("erratic light") and provide external validation of Elara's work. However, their mechanics are vague—do they control the garden's chaos or merely witness it? They do not directly constrain Elara's choices; she would proceed similarly without them. The concept shapes atmosphere and theme more than tactics. One strong beat (the Swan's recognition) lifts it above ornamental, but swappability remains moderate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Emotion-transliteration is seeded early (paragraph 6: "grief into indigo mist or resolve into silver light"), demonstrated in Elara's calm manifesting as nimbus (paragraph 7), enacted when she channels grief into the spike (rose-gold path, paragraph 23), and drives the protective circle (paragraph 18). The attribute constrains tactics: Elara must manage her emotional state to shape the garden's response. Visible cost: surfacing raw grief (paragraph 22) is vulnerable and necessary. The rule is specific and irreplaceable—removing it would collapse the method. Three beats plus closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Zigzag is introduced early (paragraph 10), used across middle beats (paragraphs 11, 21), and abandoned at closure ("no longer a zigzag of avoidance but a journey of integration"). The shift from zigzag to straight path signals transformation. However, the action is generic evasion; "weaving" or "threading" could replace it with minor edits. It does not create a key turn—Elara's method (voicing silence) and the spike's use drive reversals, not the zigzag itself. The closure reprise reweights it thematically but does not prove causal necessity. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Voicing silence" is seeded in paragraph 12 ("passed through generations"), demonstrated in paragraph 13 (shaping mouth, exhaling quiet), enacted at the cacophony surge (paragraph 18 implicit, spike channels it), and crystallizes at the vortex (paragraph 27: "voiced the most perfect silence she had ever conceived"). The method is specific, irreplaceable, and drives at least two beats. It constrains her approach and pays off at closure. Slight deduction: the mechanics remain somewhat abstract—how does unspoken quiet absorb vibration?—but the cost and causal linkage are strong. Early signal and closure participation elevate it.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is seeded in the opening line, shapes every beat (crystalline forests, rivers of melody, thorny dissonance, vortex), and transforms at closure (waves weave anew, healing light). It supplies the obstacles Elara must navigate and the resources she manipulates (spike into soil, emotion-transliteration). The setting is indispensable—removing it collapses the story's logic. Micro-setting qualifies: the soil's hum and the vortex's structure are tactile and consequential. High specificity and causal pressure across all beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The timeframe ("sacred hour—the precise timeframe when patterns break themselves") is seeded in paragraph 3 and governs the garden's state throughout. It tightens urgency: the garden's symphony dissolves into chaos, forcing Elara to act now. However, the clock is not visibly tracked—no countdown or escalating time pressure within the scene. The timeframe enables the premise but does not alter tactics beat-to-beat; Elara's moves are driven by spatial obstacles and method, not a ticking deadline. Setup and conceptual constraint present; middle development and closure linkage are weak. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motivation to catch the goddess's echo is stated early (paragraph 4: "burned with quiet intensity") and present at closure (she does not catch it but is remade by it, paragraphs 29–35). Friction emerges late: paragraph 22 introduces grief for her lost daughter, which charges the spike and alters the path. However, the grief is not dramatized as conflicting with the original goal—Elara simply adds it rather than choosing between pursuit and vulnerability. The shift from catching to opening is told more than shown in micro-choices. Two beats (setup, closure) with moderate causal pressure; cost is felt but dramatization is thin.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Feral lullaby" is introduced in paragraph 14, repeated in paragraphs 30 and 38, and named in the final paragraph. The tone blends wild chaos with tender tranquility, modulating through the garden's violence and Elara's calm. However, the phrase is more label than enacted atmosphere—lines like "wild with cosmic power yet tender as a whispered promise" tell the tone rather than letting it emerge from rhythm and image. The repetition across beats suggests purposeful recurrence, but the tone does not sharply charge the final image; it diffuses into summary. Lyric reprise is present but tonal coherence under pressure is middling.</comment>
