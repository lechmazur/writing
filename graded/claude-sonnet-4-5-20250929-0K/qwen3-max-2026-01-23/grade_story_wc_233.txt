<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Queen Lyra's interior life is largely told rather than shown through contradictory impulses in scene. The motivation is declared early ("unravel the mystery") but remains abstract; the climb itself offers few micro-choices that reveal competing values under pressure. The "disenchantment washed away" shift at closure is asserted rather than earned through dramatized internal conflict. The silver fox encounter and firefly moment provide fleeting specificity, but her agency remains passive observation more than decision that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with lyric patterning (bleeding starlight, fireflies, embers). Orientation is prompt: queen, ridge, midnight warning. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lyra returns "star-forged" with resolve to mend light. Cost is implied—her withdrawal caused the bleed—but the final image leans heavily on assertion ("starlight in her veins") rather than a concrete action or renunciation that makes the price undeniable on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs (the tapestry vision), satisfying minimal escalation under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The ridge, grotto, and veins of azurite are vivid and stage the journey clearly. Spatial choreography is clean: base → ledge → cloud layer → cobalt archway → inner chamber. The dew-slick ledge and obsidian altar anchor key beats, and the environment pressures the climb with "treacherous" terrain and "thinning air." However, setting remains largely descriptive postcard; no object or environmental constraint forces a tactical choice that alters outcome. The fireflies and silver fox offer atmospheric resonance but do not constrain agency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: solve the dream mystery before "all light will fade." The midnight warning sets urgency, and the climb provides one tightening (breaching the cloud layer into the grotto). Inside, the bleeding starlight vision deepens understanding, reweighting her prior withdrawal as the cause. However, no on-page reversal tests commitment; luck and atmosphere deliver the revelation without protagonist agency forcing a trade-off. The cost—her neglect—is conceptual and recounted, not a visible forfeiture or choice that narrows future options in scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the bleeding starlight conceit: wounded sovereignty, neglect's cumulative harm, the delicate balance of fragility and strength. The fireflies and embers recur with shifting resonance, and the final image ("mending light, one shared breath, one ember, one firefly at a time") offers a non-literal answer. Yet the climactic realization is delivered via expository vision ("she understood then") rather than a concrete action or renunciation that embodies the theme. The softly commanding voice returns but does not shape a choice; thematic weight rests on assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Single POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and poetic throughout, creating a consistent lyric register. However, the prose leans heavily on ornamental phrasing ("lacy menace," "star-forged purpose," "celestial wound weeping luminous sorrow") that risks overwriting without grounding the queen's perceptual signature in character-specific bias. The dialogue line ("Show me the truth you bleed") arrives late and feels performative rather than goal-driven. Under peak stress (the vision), syntax remains ornate and does not compress to reflect urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The prose is lush and rhythmically controlled, but density issues accumulate. Stock metaphors ("a steady flame in her chest," "starlight in her veins") and elevated diction ("latent energy," "luminous sorrow," "star-forged purpose") appear in most beats without pattern-teaching or payoff. Paraphrase loops: "bleeding starlight" is named, described, then re-explained; "disenchantment" is declared, then "washed away" with minimal bridge. Template cadence: "She discarded… began the arduous action… the path was treacherous… her inherent attribute" reads scaffolded. Filter-verb stacks ("She understood then," "She stepped inside," "She witnessed") dull immediacy. Apply −0.8 for density and loop issues in Q7; artifacts touch closure ("starlight in her veins"), so disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The disenchanted queen and mystical quest follow familiar high-fantasy templates without a sharp conceptual inversion. Bleeding starlight as a metaphor for wounded sovereignty is evocative but not freshly synthesized; the realization ("her withdrawal caused the bleed") arrives via vision rather than dramatized trade-off. The silver fox and fireflies offer atmospheric specificity but remain ornamental. The ending commits to its lyric register, and the journey structure is executed cleanly, yet the emotional arc (disenchantment → revelation → renewed purpose) could unfold with different proper nouns unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Disenchanted queen is setup (paragraph one), middle (climb with few choices), and closure (returns "star-forged"). She observes more than decides; the vision delivers the turn without her agency forcing a trade-off. Swappable with "weary ruler" with minor edits. Two gates, lyric reprise, but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Ember grotto appears in the midnight warning (setup), as destination during climb (middle), and in the climactic chamber where ancient coals pulse and the vision occurs (closure). Its stubborn heartbeat of warmth charges the final image of "tending embers with grace" and the closing "one ember at a time." Three gates, closure linkage, and specific properties (coals that glow, rhythmic pulse) make removal damaging. Not fully indispensable—another relic could serve—but strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Bleeding starlight is seeded in paragraph one ("recurring dreams of bleeding starlight"), reappears as the core mystery, and manifests in the climactic hairline fracture ("liquid radiance dripped steadily… celestial wound weeping luminous sorrow"). The vision reweights her reign's wound. Three gates, closure participation, and thematic charge. However, it remains largely symbolic; the starlight does not constrain a choice or tactic on the page, and the cost (her withdrawal) is recounted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Softly commanding is label-only in paragraph six ("her inherent attribute, a voice that was softly commanding"), returns in the dialogue line ("her softly commanding voice… rose clear and calm"), and noted again at closure ("softly commanding certainty"). Present in setup, middle, and closure, but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost—it's asserted, not demonstrated through a choice or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Climb is setup (paragraph four: "began the arduous action of climb"), dominates the middle (ledge pause, cloud breach), and frames closure (descent "not as a queen fleeing duty"). Each phase of the ascent tightens options (discarding cloak, thinning air, treacherous path), and the physical journey structures all major beats. Removing climb would require a fundamentally different story. Strong causal pressure, three gates, closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The shared exhale with the silver fox and spotting fireflies appears once in paragraph eight, mid-climb. It provides a moment of "profound, wordless connection" and "warmth that defied the cold," and the fireflies recur thematically in the vision and closing line ("one firefly at a time"). Setup and closure reprise reweight the moment, but the method itself (shared exhale) does not shape tactics or enable a choice. Lyric resonance elevates it into the low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Cobalt grotto is reached at paragraph ten (breaching cloud layer), entered at eleven ("deep sapphire archway humming with latent energy"), and houses the climactic chamber. Its azurite veins guide her deeper, and the vaulted ceiling's fracture delivers the bleeding starlight. Three gates, closure participation, and spatial specificity. Yet the grotto remains largely scenic; no tactical constraint (narrow passage, unstable floor) forces a choice or alters her approach.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Timeframe is setup: the midnight warning declares "before the moon sets, or all light will fade." The climb occurs under that clock, and "dawn's blush" at closure signals success. However, elapsed time is vague—no moment dramatizes racing moonset or shows the deadline tightening tactics. Present in setup and closure, but the urgency remains asserted rather than pressuring on-page choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Motivation is setup (paragraph two: "unravel the mystery of these dreams"), drives the climb, and is answered in the vision ("bleeding starlight reflected her realm's wounded spirit"). Three gates and closure participation. Yet the dreams remain abstract; no on-page beat shows her struggling between competing desires (duty vs. flight, safety vs. revelation). The friction is told ("disenchantment," "despair") rather than dramatized through a micro-choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Lacy menace appears in paragraph five ("lacy menace of the whispering pines") and is reprised in paragraph seventeen ("lacy menace of the grotto transformed"). The phrase is vivid but ornamental; tone does not modulate meaningfully under pressure—lyric register remains constant from disenchantment through revelation to closure. Present in setup and closure, but swappable with "delicate danger" without structural loss. Functional reprise, mid-low band.</comment>
