<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is stated abstractly ("to find where unused courage waited") but never tested through contradictory impulses in scene. The guides serve as passive conduits for delivered wisdom rather than forcing genuine internal conflict. The final "recognition" arrives as assertion ("tears of recognition") without prior dramatized struggle between competing desires. Emotional progression reads as smooth epiphany rather than embodied cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed past 120 words with no purposeful disorientation pattern; who, where, and when remain vague through the opening third (−0.4). No meaningful causal linkage: the guides appear, walk, dispense wisdom, then vanish without Elara making a choice that narrows options or forecloses a path. The "closure" is a told realization ("the courage you sought was never out there") without visible cost or a decision that changes her situation. The ticket-punch mechanic functions as symbolic décor rather than causal pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The ridgeway, mist, and standing stones are vivid but remain postcard backdrops; no environmental feature constrains a choice or alters tactics. The ticket functions as a carried object but does not shape action. Setting modulates atmosphere effectively but does not pressure the protagonist's stance at closure, capping the score below 7.0 per the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("find unused courage") is signaled early but never tightened through a trade-off or narrowed option. The journey is a guided tour with no reversal, live decision, or price paid on the page. Elara remains passive; the guides control all movement and deliver the resolution as exposition. Coincidence (guides appear, lead, reveal, vanish) drives every beat, violating the lens requirement that protagonist agency shape escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme ("courage waits within") is stated directly by the elder guide in the penultimate beat, undercutting emergence through particulars. The ticket-punch recurs but as a symbolic token rather than a motif that constrains choice. The shoreline lullaby and twilight vigil remain ambient mood rather than thematic friction. Final-paragraph moralizing ("the courage you sought was never out there") replaces scene pressure with thesis statement (−0.6).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds Elara's POV without head-hopping. Diction is elevated and uniform ("liminal path," "sacred meander," "indigo and silver") throughout, creating a tonal wash that does not modulate under pressure. The elder guide's dialogue and narrative voice converge in lyric register, blurring distinction. Perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific; Elara notices beauty and wisdom without bias or blind spots.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Dense figurative language appears in nearly every sentence ("sea mist curled like whispered secrets," "leash of sorrow snapped," "unused courage stirred...as a steady, warming ember") without pattern-teaching or payoff at closure (−0.5 overwriting density). Paraphrase loops: "gently persistent" recurs as label across multiple beats without varied embodiment. Stock metaphors ("shoreline lullaby," "seed planted in stillness") cluster in peak beats without fresh specificity (−0.4). Template cadence: "They paused...and lingered...With each deliberate detour..." (−0.4). Cumulative line-level debt disallows 9+ globally and triggers artifact cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise (interior journey externalized as guided walk to self-discovery) follows a widely used therapeutic-journey template without transforming it through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus (−0.8 derivative premise). The "courage was inside you all along" resolution is a stock epiphany. The ticket-punch and star-stamp are inventive props but do not alter the template arc. No bold structural or perspectival risk-taking.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The wise ferry guides appear in the second paragraph and remain present through the ending, satisfying setup and closure gates. However, they make no on-page decisions that create key turns; they dispense wisdom and lead Elara along a predetermined path. Elara does not resist, negotiate, or force them to adapt. They observe and explain rather than face choices with cost. Swappable with any mentor archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The ticket punch appears in three beats: introduction (paragraph 5), mid-journey mark (paragraph 14), and final mark (paragraph 28). It is handled on the page and its star-stamps accumulate, but it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; Elara never refuses a stamp, bargains for one, or acts differently because of its presence. The object is present across beats and shapes the ending image, but the causal pressure is thin—removing it would require only minor narrative edits to the closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The vigil in twilight frames the entire journey from the opening line ("twilight's threshold") through the ending ("vigil complete," "twilight like mist at dawn"). It sets tone and anchors the temporal window, satisfying setup and closure gates. However, it does not shape stakes or tactics on the page; Elara does not face a time limit, choose between daylight and dark, or act differently because twilight is ending. It remains atmospheric rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Gently persistent" is attributed to the younger guide (paragraph 8) and echoed in the narrative voice ("Gently persistent, they guided her," paragraph 20). It describes manner but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. The guides do not adapt their persistence when Elara resists, nor does their gentleness force a trade-off. Label-only use without tactical friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Traverse" is signaled early ("she must traverse this liminal path," paragraph 3) and executed across the middle third ("they traversed the ridgeway and the landscape of her heart," paragraph 19). The action structures the entire journey and is present in the ending ("She turned toward the descending path"). It drives two distinct beats (physical ridgeway walk, metaphorical heart landscape) and anchors closure. However, the traversal itself is passive—Elara is led rather than choosing the route—so causal pressure is moderate. Scores mid-6s for multi-beat involvement and closure linkage, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Through indirect routes" is named in paragraph 3 ("the old ways demanded movement through indirect routes") and demonstrated in paragraph 10 ("moving in a sacred meander—circling ancient standing stones"). It appears in one middle beat and is implied at closure ("descended path" suggests she now moves directly). The method shapes one turn (the meandering walk) but does not recur or constrain later choices. Functional but replaceable; a direct path with reflection would yield a similar arc.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The veiled ridgeway is named in the opening line and recurs in paragraph 19 ("traversed the ridgeway"). It anchors spatial continuity and contributes to tone, satisfying setup and closure gates. However, it does not pressure choices or supply resources that affect outcome; the ridgeway is a stage rather than an active constraint. No scene moment depends on ridge-specific geography (height, exposure, narrowness). Functional setting but swappable with any liminal landscape.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After the leash breaks" is stated in the opening line ("The leash...snapped") and recalled at the midpoint (paragraph 24, "the broken leash a silver thread") and ending (paragraph 17, "The leash broke not to abandon you"). It frames the journey as post-rupture but does not tighten decisions or tactics; Elara never faces a time limit, deadline, or consequence of delay. The temporal frame is static rather than escalating. Present across beats but ornamental to pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"To find where unused courage waits" is named in paragraph 2 and restated in paragraphs 13 ("unused courage is not a distant treasure"), 20 ("unused courage stirred within her"), and 26 ("the courage you sought"). It drives the journey's premise and is resolved at closure. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices; Elara does not face a moment where finding courage costs something else she values. The motivation is present across beats and participates in closure but lacks friction between wants and costs, capping it in mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Shoreline lullaby" appears in paragraphs 6, 12, 30, and 32, forming a recurring tonal anchor from setup through closure. It coheres across turns and charges the final image ("carrying the shoreline lullaby in her bones"). However, the tone remains static—calm, lyric, gentle—without modulating under pressure; peak doubt (paragraph 21) is met with the same soothing register. Coherent and purposeful but does not deepen with escalation, placing it in mid-5s.</comment>
