<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and drives her journey, but her interiority leans heavily on therapeutic language ("psychological safety," "hyper-vigilance") that feels diagnostic rather than embodied. The involuntary truthfulness trait appears only in retrospective summary at the checkpoint, never constraining an on-page choice. Her embodied experience during the truffle hunt is concrete, but the closure moment—envisioning the future ritual rather than performing it—means the final choice lacks visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a lyric design: the orchard, relic, and truffle accumulate symbolic weight toward a Charged Poise ending. However, the closure unit remains entirely prospective ("she would attempt," "envisioned the cabin"), never landing an on-page moment where cost is legible. The orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly within the first paragraph. The causality is stable but the final image substitutes declaration for dramatized pressure, weakening the closure effect required at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The hanging orchard is vivid and purposeful, its storm-battered resilience mirroring the thematic stakes. Spatial choreography through the ravine path is coherent, and the lightning-scarred quince tree grounds the truffle harvest in tactile detail. The orchard constrains Elara's movements and supplies the critical resource, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for setting participation in choice and closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—cultivating psychological safety for Lena—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, the on-page action consists of a single beat (finding the truffle) without meaningful tightening or cost; Elara faces no opposition, and the success is frictionless. The emotional weight resides entirely in past smuggling (told) and future application (envisioned), leaving the present scene without escalation or a choice that narrows options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of fractured grace and cultivated safety emerges organically through the orchard metaphor and Elara's methodical care. The final image attempts a resonant reconfiguration but remains declarative ("this was love," "seeds of safety") rather than offering a non-literal answer through dramatized action. Subtext operates in the textbook's ritual logic and the orchard's resilience, but the thematic landing leans toward assertion over earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV distance is stable and Elara's perceptual signature—rational forager's precision, botanical detail, ritual logic—is consistent and distinct. The prose modulates between lyric compression and concrete observation without head-hopping. However, therapeutic register ("psychological safety," "hyper-vigilance") intrudes at peak moments, pulling the voice toward clinical abstraction rather than character-specific idiom under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but paraphrase loops appear: "fractured grace" recurs four times without evolution, and the final third cycles through synonymous declarations of purpose ("this was necessary," "this was love," "this was an act of fractured grace"). Template cadence in the closing paragraphs ("The antique glass eye, once...now held," "And in the fractured light...") flattens propulsion. Figurative language is controlled except for the stacked metaphors around "fractured grace" that blur rather than sharpen.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of empathy virus, discredited textbooks, smuggled relic, and truffle-based neural healing offers a fresh speculative frame. The involuntary truthfulness and the specific ritual (occlude for seven minutes) provide original texture. However, the execution retreats into safe lyricism rather than following the premise's implications on the page; the checkpoint smuggling and the actual ritual remain off-stage, and the orchard foraging lacks friction or surprise. The piece opts for thematic resonance over narrative risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her forager's precision shapes her perceptual filter. However, her role as "rational truffle forager" drives only one on-page beat (the harvest); the smuggling and ritual application are summarized. She makes no key turn on the page—the decision to attempt the cure is prior, and the story ends before she acts on it. Present in setup and ending image but not causal in middle choices.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The antique glass eye appears in setup (secured against her ribs), development (recalled at the checkpoint), and the envisioned closure (placement over Lena's lid). It accumulates symbolic weight as "lens focusing her love" and "key," and the ritual's core action depends on it. However, it is never handled or used in a dramatized beat—only described and envisioned—reducing its causal force. Strong thematic presence but limited on-page agency.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The smuggled relic frames the inciting pressure (Elara risked everything to obtain it) and shapes the ritual method. The checkpoint moment demonstrates its cost via her involuntary truthfulness, though that scene is summarized. It participates in the closure image but does not constrain a present choice on the page. Setup, recalled in development, and present in ending; causal in backstory but not in the live scene.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Involuntary truthfulness is introduced late (second half) and only in retrospective summary: "her involuntary truthfulness forcing her to state..." It creates no on-page constraint or cost in the present scene; Elara faces no interrogation or moment where the trait pressures a choice. The final thought ("her truthfulness whispered a final, clear thought") is internal metaphor, not dramatized cost. Label-only mention without action pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Occlusion is the ritual's core action and is framed as necessary for neural healing. It appears in setup (the textbook's precise instruction), drives the method, and is envisioned in the closure ("placement of the cool glass eye over Lena's closed lid"). However, the action itself never occurs on the page—it remains prospective. It shapes the goal but does not redefine options in a dramatized beat. Strong thematic centrality but no live execution.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The method (discredited textbooks from a flooded university library) is signaled early, its mechanics detailed mid-story ("harvest after a storm, prepare a paste, occlude for seven minutes"), and it governs Elara's choices: the timing (after the storm), the location (this specific orchard), and the ritual logic. It shapes two beats (truffle harvest, envisioned application) and the closure depends on its credibility. However, the application remains off-page, limiting its causal force in the live scene.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The hanging orchard is introduced immediately, constrains Elara's movement (rain-slicked stones, ravine ascent), supplies the critical resource (the truffle), and mirrors the thematic stakes (battered resilience). It participates in setup, development (the harvest beat), and closure (the backward look, "testament to endurance"). The storm's aftermath makes the truffle accessible, tying environment directly to tactics. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The empathy virus frames the world state and Lena's condition, creating the need for the cure. It appears in setup (Lena's shattered mind) and shapes motivation throughout. However, it functions as static backdrop rather than tightening pressure; no clock or viral progression alters Elara's tactics on the page. Present in two gates (setup, thematic grounding) but does not pressure the live scene's choices. Functional setting element but not a tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cultivating psychological safety is Elara's explicit, stated motivation from the opening and drives every choice: the smuggling risk, the truffle harvest, the ritual preparation. It appears in setup, governs the middle beat, and charges the closure image ("carrying the seeds of safety"). However, the motivation is declared and reiterated rather than tested through conflicting desires or visible cost in the present scene. Strong framing but limited on-page friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Fractured grace is introduced early ("fractured grace that resonated deep within her"), coheres through the orchard imagery (battered yet resilient), and modulates with pressure in the lyric final passage. The tone charges the ending's attempt to balance despair and hope. However, the phrase recurs four times without evolution, becoming a thematic label rather than an emergent quality. Coherent and purposeful but leans toward assertion over earned texture.</comment>
