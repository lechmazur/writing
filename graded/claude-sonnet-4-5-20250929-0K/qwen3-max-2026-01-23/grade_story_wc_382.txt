<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to learn building language is clear and rooted in Dr. Thorne's legacy, driving her archival quest. The shift from "interrogating stone" to "listening with compassion" is earned through Mrs. Davison's revelation about agreed-upon lies. However, interiority leans heavily on reflection and label-like insight ("empathy, not excavation") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The tears and heart-full moment at closure feel somewhat announced rather than embodied through specific sensory contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration: Elara moves from forceful interrogation to compassionate stewardship, crystallized when she receives the seal and understands Dr. Thorne's living wisdom. Cost is present—she abandons her prior extractive method—and the lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with the meteor shower, tea ritual, and seal combining to reweight her stance. Orientation anchors early (rooftop, meteor shower, tea). The tightening occurs when Mrs. Davison reveals the cornerstone fiction, which reframes Elara's entire archival approach, though the causality is more conceptual than action-driven.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The rooftop garden during the Perseid shower is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (steam curling, jasmine scent, meteor-illuminated parapet). The setting constrains choice subtly: the meteor flash reveals the preserved archway, making visible the "agreed upon lie" and charging Elara's realization. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The body and teacup micro-setting anchor perception effectively, though the garden itself could press harder on tactical decisions.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—learning the building's language—is signaled early and tightens when Mrs. Davison reframes the cornerstone date as compassionate fiction. This reversal narrows Elara's prior extractive method and forces her to adopt a listening stance. The cost is conceptual and relational: she must abandon her archival confidence. However, escalation is primarily contemplative; no physical or external obstacle tests her new understanding on the page, and the resolution arrives through revelation rather than a decision under competing pressures.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—compassion over extraction, agreed-upon lies as mercy—emerges through the seal, cornerstone fiction, and tea ritual rather than assertion. The final image (Elara receiving the seal, understanding soul over stone) offers a non-literal answer to her quest without moralizing. "The language of old buildings was not a puzzle to solve, but a song to hum along with" borders on summary but is anchored in prior particulars (steam, silence, stars). One moment of slight over-articulation: "Dr. Thorne's greatest lesson was empathy, not excavation" states the theme directly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elara throughout. Perceptual signature is selective (brushing doorframes, tracing wax) and voice carries literary texture. Mrs. Davison's dialogue feels natural and purposeful. However, diction occasionally elevates beyond Elara's established register ("ephemeral," "syntax in sagging floorboards") without clear motivation, and some interiority edges toward summarizing insight rather than showing perception under pressure. Filter verbs ("saw," "understood," "knew") cluster in the final third without disrupting clarity but dulling immediacy slightly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with varied syntax and strong imagery (gargoyle offering key, meteor scratching sky). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "agreed upon lies" is restated across multiple paragraphs without added pressure; "patiently nimble" recurs as decorative label. Template cadence in the final third: "She had come to interrogate stone, but…" / "She was no longer an outsider…" / "She had sought to interrogate stone, but left understanding soul." Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching, and some metaphors stretch ("verbs in the building's living tongue"). These artifacts dull momentum in non-closure beats and trigger accumulated line-level penalties.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise—learning a building's emotional truth through mentorship and ritual—transforms a familiar archival-mystery frame through the "agreed upon lies" concept and the seal as tangible legacy. Emotional specificity (borrowed sugar as first syllable, key offered rather than withheld) lifts the familiar mentor-student dynamic. However, the rooftop tea session with elder-teaches-younger and the meteor-shower epiphany follow recognizable templates, and the final pivot from extraction to compassion is signaled early without sufficient friction or surprise to feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Dr. Aris Thorne (dead language tutor) is present through legacy and backstory: designed the seal, ignited Elara's quest, believed every scratch holds story. His philosophy shapes Elara's motivation and the seal's symbolism. However, he never makes an on-page choice or action; his influence is entirely retrospective. Setup and payoff gates are met (backstory in first third, seal/wisdom at closure), but no middle development. He constrains Elara's approach conceptually but does not alter tactics in scene.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The antique desk seal appears in beat one (Mrs. Davison polishing it), beat mid-story (she explains the gargoyle-offers-key emblem), and closure (she presses wax, hands notecard, then places seal in Elara's palm). Its unique property—offering rather than withholding—embodies Dr. Thorne's philosophy and becomes the tangible symbol of trust and stewardship passed to Elara. All three gates met with strong causal and thematic linkage. The seal's transfer forecloses Elara's extractive stance and charges the final image with visible cost (responsibility and connection intertwined).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Agreed upon lies" is introduced mid-story when Mrs. Davison reveals the cornerstone fiction (1898 vs. 1881 penitentiary). It reframes Elara's entire quest, narrowing her extractive method and opening a compassionate reading of history. The concept shapes the central turn and is present at closure ("the most vital stories are the agreed upon lies that become truth of the heart"). Setup is late (second third), but development and payoff are strong. The lie-as-mercy becomes the thematic and tactical pivot, altering Elara's interpretive stance with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Patiently nimble" describes Mrs. Davison's hands polishing the seal (beat one), tracing grooves (mid-story), and warming wax (closure). It recurs as a label but does not constrain or enable a distinct choice with visible tradeoff. The trait characterizes her careful stewardship thematically but remains decorative; no moment hinges on patience vs. speed or nimbleness vs. clumsiness. Present across beats but swappable with "careful" or "precise" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Interrogate" anchors Elara's initial method: she digs archival records, interrogates the sealed cellar mystery, and brushes doorframes for clues. Mrs. Davison's lesson reframes interrogation as the wrong question, and Elara shifts to listening. The action is present early and at closure ("came to interrogate stone, but left understanding soul"). However, no on-page interrogation scene dramatizes her extractive method; the action is summarized retrospectively. Setup and payoff met; middle development is thin. The verb defines the conceptual turn but could be replaced with "decode" or "excavate" with minor textual edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Borrowing sugar (inciting incident six months prior) unlocks the weekly tea ritual, which frames the present rooftop session. The method is signaled early ("borrowed sugar unlocked more than a recipe") and returns at closure ("The sugar you borrowed was merely the first syllable"). It establishes the relationship foundation and Mrs. Davison's role as keeper of building wisdom. All three gates met. However, the mechanics of the ritual (weekly meetings, shared stories) do not constrain a mid-story choice or tactic; the method is more thematic bridge than tactical tool. Strong setup and payoff lift the score into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The rooftop garden during the Perseid meteor shower provides the frame for the entire scene. Meteors scratch the sky (opening line), a brilliant flash illuminates the western parapet and resolves the brick pattern into the penitentiary archway (key revelation), and the shower ends as the conversation concludes. The setting charges the revelation moment with visual metaphor and supplies the specific image (archway preserved as tribute) that reweights Elara's understanding. Setup, development, and payoff all present. The garden itself (jasmine, gate's creak) anchors sensory continuity. Could score higher if the meteor timing or rooftop access had constrained a tactical choice, but as-is it supplies crucial visual resource and atmospheric charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—to learn the language of old buildings, decipher whispers in brick—is stated early, tied to Dr. Thorne's legacy, and dramatized through her archival digging and intent to interrogate the sealed cellar. The motivation drives her to Mrs. Davison and structures the tea session's stakes. Friction emerges when Mrs. Davison reveals Elara has been "interrogating the wrong question," forcing a shift from extraction to empathy. Cost is visible: Elara must abandon her confident method. All three gates met with clear causal and emotional pressure. The motivation undergoes meaningful transformation at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>"Mysterious familiarity" is established through the ritual (weekly tea, borrowed sugar origin, shared stories) and the rooftop as both intimate and open to the cosmos. The tone blends wonder (meteor shower, celestial cascade) with domesticity (teacup, sugar bowl, Earl Grey). Mrs. Davison's voice is soft and page-turning; the building's language is whispered not shouted. The tone modulates gently—curiosity to revelation to heart-full acceptance—without jarring shifts. Closure sustains the tone: "cool air carried the city's hum, yet up here, time felt suspended in mysterious familiarity." The phrase is made literal on the page and charges the final image. All three gates met; tone coherence is strong and participates in the ending's resonance.</comment>
