<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The ensemble cast (seven named members) spreads thin across the word budget, reducing individual interiority. Kael's engineering skepticism and Lena's intuitive touch provide glimpses of contradiction, but most characters function as coordinated parts rather than individuals with competing impulses. The family's unity is asserted more than tested; the blight threatens their orchard but no interpersonal friction emerges under pressure. Elara's altruism is labeled rather than embodied through conflicted choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive promptly (Veridia, floating arches, orchard family). The drive lens reads Situational-leaning-Accumulative: Elara's messages guide collective action, the bell discovery escalates, and the midnight alignment pays off. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Elara's departure, the family's inheritance of stewardship) with felt cost (her vanishing), but the cost is primarily emotional rather than a visible forfeiture that alters tactics. The nebula alignment resolves the blight conveniently; no failure mode or live trade-off sharpens the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Veridia's floating arches and impossible-hued fruit establish vivid, specific setting. The watering bell's verdigris surface, hidden star charts, and mossy pedestal ground tactile interaction. Spatial choreography (scaling arches with ropes, positioning mirrors, bell on pedestal) remains clear. The bell and mirrors constrain the climactic choice: Kael must aim the beam precisely, and that constraint charges the resolution. Micro-setting (the bell as tool) elevates the score into the 7-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (save the orchard from blight) is signaled early. The reexamination of the bell narrows options and the mirror-aiming sequence tightens pressure, constituting one meaningful escalation. However, the nebula's alignment at midnight introduces a new solution rather than forcing a trade-off among live options. No visible cost (stamina, tool failure, interpersonal friction) complicates the execution. The resolution feels gifted by cosmic timing rather than earned through protagonist sacrifice or renunciation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme (strangers become family through shared tending) emerges through action and Elara's final benediction without heavy-handed moralizing. The "brambled hope" motif recurs purposefully, linking hardship's thorns to persistence. Elara's line "Strangers become family when they choose to tend the same garden" skirts Thematic Echo but ties to on-page actions (pruning, watering, mirror-aiming). The ending's "tend it well" offers a resonant, non-literal answer. The nebula and butterflies risk symbolic convenience, yet they grow from prior setup (butterfly garden, star charts). No false equivalence or safety-hedging flattens complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited with stable distance; no head-hopping. Diction ("brambled hope," "breath of brambled hope") recurs with purpose, though "brambled" twice in close proximity risks self-echo. Dialogue carries subtext (Kael's "That rusted relic?" conveys skepticism, Lena's "Wait" shifts momentum). Elara's spectral voice ("like wind through leaves") maintains tonal consistency. Free indirect style is clean. Minor issue: "Her light softened, merging with the starlight" slightly elevates register at the emotional peak without disrupting clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid uniformity. Information density is high (star charts, harmonic key, Respite Nebula mechanics compressed efficiently). Minor loops: "brambled hope" appears in paragraph 5 and recurs verbatim in the final line; "shared effort" and "collective effort" echo across beats. Template cadence in the climax: "Kael...adjusted...A beam...struck...A silent chime vibrated...Where the light touched..." uses parallel "[Subject] [verb]" stems across four sentences. "Threads of patience," "tapestry stitched with threads" risks metaphor redundancy. Line-level clarity remains strong; these issues lower from mid-7s to upper-6s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The altruistic-ghost-as-guide and cosmic-alignment-solves-blight beats follow familiar template arcs (mysterious helper, celestial deus ex machina). Veridia's floating arches and sapphire fruit provide vivid decoration but don't transform the underlying found-family and collective-healing premise. The watering bell as harmonic key offers a fresh twist, yet the nebula's convenient midnight arrival and the bell's hidden purpose arriving late feel like late-stage revelations serving plot convenience. Emotional truth (shared hardship forging unity) is sincere but expressed through well-worn beats. The story reads competent rather than surprising.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara appears in setup (dawn messages), middle (coalesces to explain nebula mechanics), and ending (vanishes with benediction). Her guidance enables beats (pruning, bell reexamination, mirror aiming) but she observes and instructs rather than making choices with cost. Her departure is emotional closure but not a decision that alters tactics. Swappable with any benevolent adviser archetype. Present across gates but lacks causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bell appears in setup (morning message), is reexamined mid-story (carvings reveal star charts, harmonic key function), and anchors the climax (beam strikes it, releasing golden wave). Handled physically (Lena traces verdigris, Finn brushes dirt, positioned on pedestal). Its hidden purpose transforms it from "rusted relic" to indispensable tool. Removing it would collapse the resolution. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage; irreplaceability is high.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The Respite Nebula is seeded early (archives mention, alignment at midnight), shapes the climactic tactic (mirror aiming to catch its light), and charges the ending image (blazes with clarity, celestial benediction). However, it functions as a cosmic timer rather than a stake the characters wrestle with. Its mechanics arrive via Elara's exposition rather than discovery through trial. Present across beats and closure-linked, but lacks felt cost or constraint that narrows options under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Strangely trustworthy" is attributed to Elara in paragraph 9; her prior guidance (mended irrigation, predicted storms) establishes credibility that enables the family to follow her bell instruction. Kael's skepticism ("her advice had saved the pear crop") shows the trait constraining doubt and enabling collective action. Visible in setup and development; it alters one key choice (trusting the bell reexamination). Cost is low (trusting Elara risks wasted effort but no on-page failure). Two-gate presence with modest causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Reexamine" is the morning's chalked command (paragraph 11), directly sparks the discovery of hidden star charts (paragraphs 12–14), and redefines the bell from decorative relic to harmonic key. This realization drives the entire climactic sequence (mirror aiming, light channeling). Removing this action would eliminate the central turn. Essential across beats and ending; irreplaceable. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Chalk messages appear in setup (paragraph 6: "elegant chalk messages...deserted stone paths"), recur as examples ("Prune the third branch," "Collect rainwater"), and Finn echoes them with his own symbols (paragraph 20). The method enables all guidance beats and frames Elara's observational constraint. Present in setup, development (this morning's message drives plot), and ending (final chalked message). Swappable with any indirect communication method (notes, dreams) but tightly woven into the family's daily rhythm. Three-gate presence with moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The orchard planet and floating arches anchor every scene; Kael scales arches with ropes (physical constraint), and the central arch channels the nebula's beam at climax. Gravity tricks and spiraling trees establish vivid atmosphere. The arches supply the solve (light pathway) and impose danger (dizzying heights). Micro-setting (the bell on its pedestal) also constrains action. Present across setup, development, and climax; environment shapes tactics and charges the final image. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After strangers become family" is stated in setup (paragraph 3: "mere cycles ago") and recurs thematically in Elara's final words. However, the timeframe functions as backstory context rather than live pressure. No on-page tightening (countdown, deadline) forces urgency; the nebula's midnight alignment is introduced mid-story rather than tracked from the start. Present in theme but does not constrain tactics. Two-gate presence (setup and closure echo) without development pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Orchestrating collective effort is Elara's stated role (paragraph 10: "orchestrated collective effort solely through...dawn messages"). The family's coordinated mirror-aiming (paragraph 21: "scattered not as individuals, but as parts of a single organism") dramatizes the motivation. However, Elara's own conflict or cost (why she must orchestrate, what she sacrifices) is told rather than shown. Present across beats but lacks friction between wants and costs. Functional integration without depth.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>"Brambled hope" is introduced in paragraph 5 ("hope felt brambled: beautiful in its persistence, yet sharp with thorns") and reprised in the final line ("every breath of brambled hope"). Tone balances beauty (blossoms, butterflies, nebula) with hardship (blight, shipwreck memory, fear's thorns). The bramble metaphor charges the final image by linking persistence and pain. Coherent through turns; modulates from tension (blight threat) to exaltation (resolution) without flatlining. Lyric early-seed → final reprise with closure reweighting.</comment>
