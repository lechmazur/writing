<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's vow and her precise ritual create clear motivation, and her hands-on work with the emerald chip gives embodied purpose. However, interiority leans heavily on elevated descriptors ("lucidly watchful awareness," "clear pool reflecting") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The tear at closure reads sentimental rather than earned through visible internal conflict, and Kael remains a passive object rather than a second character applying pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The threshold of stillness is reached through pattern recognition and ritual completion, providing a coherent closure unit (Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. Cost is visible in the vow fulfilled and the spark captured, but the escalation relies on atmospheric deepening rather than a meaningful tightening of options—Elara faces no substantive obstacle or choice that narrows her path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto, obsidian slab, and aurora are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (cooling skin, thickening air, stilled light). The aurora's shift to "watchful emerald green" and its final bow acknowledge the ritual, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the crystalline steps provide a tactile exit. The setting constrains the ritual's timing and amplifies its reverence without becoming a postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>One dominant stake—capturing Kael's essence before oblivion—is signaled early and sustained. The threshold moment provides a single meaningful tightening when the mandala snaps into focus and the aurora stills, forcing Elara to act. However, no live obstacle or choice complicates her path; the ritual proceeds as planned without error, refusal, or cost beyond the passage of time. Agency is present in the infusion act but unopposed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of preservation against oblivion emerges through concrete ritual rather than assertion, and the vial of saved lights offers a resonant image of continuity. The threshold of stillness operates as both literal boundary and metaphor without overt statement. The final image—the grotto holding peace and echo—reweights prior material. However, the tear and the whispered farewell nudge toward sentiment, and the piece risks symbolic convenience by having the aurora bow in acknowledgment rather than letting the particulars stand alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature—"galaxies in nerve impulses, rivers in slowing pulses"—is distinct and filtering. However, elevated diction ("congealed into ancient stone," "radiant hush," "spun glass") saturates most sentences, creating register drift that sits above a beautician mortician's plausible internal lexicon. The prose reads more like lyric omniscience than embodied focalization under pressure, flattening Elara's voice into ceremonial uniformity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative language clusters densely without pattern-teaching: "sky congealed," "silence so profound it seemed to glow," "minutes stretched like spun glass," "mandala snapped," all within a brief span. Template cadence appears in repeated "She [verb]" stems across the middle third. Paraphrase loops: "radiant hush" recurs as "luminous silence" and "sacred anticipation" without added pressure. Stock metaphors (rivers, galaxies, snowflakes in perception) and overwriting in high-pressure beats (the threshold moment) dull immediacy and lower information density. Apply −1.2 cumulative for density, loops, and template patterns per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The beautician mortician of the dead is a fresh role synthesis, and the threshold of stillness as a ritual boundary offers a non-obvious angle. However, the core arc—capturing a dying mentor's essence in a magical object—follows a familiar template without transformation through lived friction or moral calculus. Elevated prose and aurora choreography ornament rather than complicate. The piece hedges into lyric safety rather than pressing the cost or contradiction inherent in preserving versus letting go.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elara appears throughout, performs the infusion, and makes the final choice to seal the chip. However, her action is unopposed ritual execution rather than decision under conflicting pressure. No turn arises from her choosing between competing goods or adapting tactics when blocked.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The emerald chip is drawn early, placed on Kael's heart at the threshold, glows with captured essence, and is sealed in the vial at closure. It anchors three distinct beats (preparation, infusion, preservation) and its transformation from inert to humming beacon drives the ritual's success, making removal structurally damaging.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The threshold of stillness is signaled early, recognized via the mandala snap and aurora shift, and determines the precise moment Elara acts. It shapes the ritual's timing and stakes, though it functions more as a condition to recognize than a dilemma to navigate. Present in setup, middle recognition, and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Lucidly watchful" appears as a label in one paragraph ("cultivated lucidly watchful awareness") but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page choice with visible cost. The trait describes her state rather than forcing a tradeoff or altering her method under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Infusion is the ritual's climax: Elara channels memories, warmth blooms, the chip glows and pulses with Kael's star-song. The action is irreplaceable—her vow and the entire escalation point to this act. It redefines the chip's state and fulfills the dominant stake, participating directly in closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Finding patterns in static is signaled early ("method was finding patterns in static"), applied in the threshold recognition ("static behind her lids snapped into a perfect mandala"), and invoked again at infusion ("weaving a bridge with patterns found in static"). It shapes two beats and the mechanics matter, though the pattern itself remains abstract rather than tactically constrained.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto and aurora frame the entire ritual, and the aurora's shift to stillness and final bow participate in the closure. The obsidian slab and crystalline steps are handled on the page. The setting supplies reverence and timing cues (aurora pooling, air thickening) that Elara reads, altering her readiness, placing it above postcard use but short of direct tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The vow to capture one last spark is stated early, motivates every beat, and culminates in the infusion and sealing. Elara's gratitude tear and the line "oblivion would not erase him" show friction between loss and preservation. The motivation drives the ritual's structure and the ending's charge, with cost visible in the stakes she honors.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Radiant hush" appears in the opening, recurs as "luminous silence," and modulates to "deep peace" at closure. The tone remains consistent and charges the final image. However, it saturates most beats without variation under pressure—the hush never fractures or tightens—resulting in a static mood rather than one that escalates or transforms with the ritual's peak.</comment>
