<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to compile fragments is clear and her reactively visionary trait is shown through the trumpet vision, but her interiority leans toward label-speak ("reactively visionary," "gift and burden") rather than embodied contradiction. The restoration work provides concrete micro-choices, yet the ending epiphany with Elder Lin feels somewhat tidy—"profound warmth bloomed" and "quiet certainty" lack the ambiguity or felt cost that would elevate the final stance. The vision sequence is vivid, but the emotional progression from gasping stumble to certainty bypasses messier internal conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative lens: Elara restores fragments and distributes them in staggered intervals, building toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where her method is affirmed by Elder Lin and she commits to the next fragment. Orientation anchors quickly (Ivory Harbor, post-exile, archivist role by ~80 words). The closure lands as Charged Poise—she has not erased absences but navigated them, and the child's drawing awaits—yet the cost is largely conceptual and Elder Lin's affirmation feels more like validation than friction. The meaningful tightening occurs across the week of offerings, but the final beat could press harder against resistance or doubt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ivory stones, sea-green verdigris, salt-damp air, and leaded window establish a tactile, humid coastal world. The trumpet valve as micro-setting constrains Elara's first restorative act and charges the pier scene, satisfying the 9+ gate. However, spatial choreography during the week of offerings (market square, archive window, pier) is narrated in summary rather than grounded beats, reducing immediacy. The setting supports atmosphere but doesn't apply sustained pressure on choices beyond the valve restoration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—compiling fragments into meaning and heartening returnees—is signaled early and tightens as Elara moves from private restoration to public offering. The single trumpet note at sunset is a concrete escalation that elicits visible reactions (sobbing, straightened spine, wide eyes), and the fisherman's tears over Anya's chart add a secondary deepening. Yet the escalation is more additive than crisis-driven; no live option is foreclosed, and the cost remains atmospheric rather than forcing a trade-off. The progression feels steady rather than pressured.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Elara's method: navigating absences rather than erasing them, honoring healing's pace through staggered intervals. Elder Lin's line—"you navigate those absences with us"—articulates the theme but stops short of overt moralizing because it flows from his observation of her work. The final image (child's crayon drawing) offers a non-literal promise of continuity. However, the "profound warmth" and "quiet certainty" drift toward thesis-statement interiority, and the piece risks thematic echo by having Lin restate what the action already demonstrated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara; perceptual signature shows through "water-bloated ledgers," "phantom chill of that silenced sound," and sensory attention to verdigris and linseed oil. The Elder Lin dialogue is brief and serves affirmation without voice convergence. However, elevated register in peak beats—"crystallized in one motivation," "emotional geography," "staggered intervals of recovered truth"—reads more essayistic than voice-particular under pressure. The narrative distance remains consistent, but diction doesn't degrade or tighten with stress as expected for this archivist's lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sensory detail is vivid (verdigris, linseed oil, cobblestones), but the prose carries template-cadence artifacts: "Her entire purpose was crystallized," "This was her gift and burden," "Her deeper purpose crystallized" echo across paragraphs. Stock metaphors—"torn tapestry," "silent beacon," "fulfilled promise"—appear in high-pressure beats without fresh specificity. Paraphrase loop: "to compile these scattered fragments into coherent meaning" (paragraph 6) restates "compile fragments into meaning" without added pressure. Deduct −0.6 in Q7 for template stems and stock strings; cumulative artifact spread touching multiple beats warrants the penalty and disallows 9+ globally per the artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—archivist restoring post-exile memory through fragments—echoes familiar recovery-narrative templates, yet the "reactively visionary" trait and the valve as herald-turned-relic add a fresh angle. The staggered-interval method is specific and well-integrated, and the choice to honor silence rather than fanfare offers a non-obvious moral calculus. However, the emotional arc (exile → restoration → affirmation) follows a predictable redemption path, and Elder Lin's validation arrives without significant resistance. The transformation test is borderline: swap the harbor for another setting and the beats hold unchanged, suggesting the synthesis could be more irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout, drives the valve restoration (~paragraph 7), the pier offering (~paragraph 10), and the week of distributed fragments. Her decisions shape all major beats and the closure image (reaching for the child's drawing). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. Causal pressure: her method narrows options by committing to staggered intervals rather than a single grand gesture. Closure linkage: the final beat hinges on her choice to continue. Minor friction: the Elder Lin scene positions her more as recipient of validation than active agent in that beat, slightly reducing irreplaceability in the climax dialogue.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The trumpet valve appears in beat 1 (desk fragments), beat 2 (vision trigger), beat 3 (restoration with linseed oil), and beat 4 (pier sound). Its mechanics matter: the seized piston must be freed to produce the note that heartens returnees. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. Causal pressure: the valve enables the pier turning point and reweights from silenced symbol to recovered voice. Closure linkage: though not physically present in the final paragraph, the valve's sound resonates through the week and primes the archive's continued work. Specificity high: only this object carries the herald's history and Kael's memory. Slight friction: after the pier beat, the valve recedes and the story shifts to other fragments, reducing its presence in the closure unit itself.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Navigated absences" is named explicitly ("navigate those absences with us") and demonstrated through the visionary gap-filling and the staggered offerings that honor voids rather than erase them. Setup: the concept frames Elara's purpose by paragraph 6. Development: the valve restoration and Anya chart both enact navigation of loss. Payoff: Elder Lin's affirmation and the final line's "promise of the next interval" crystallize the method. Causal pressure: the concept shapes her decision to distribute fragments over time rather than all at once. Friction: the concept is more thematic than stake-altering; removing the label "navigated absences" would not break the plot, only the rhetorical framing.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Reactively visionary" is labeled in paragraph 7, demonstrated once in the Kael trumpet vision (paragraph 8), and referenced again in the phrase "reactively visionary, she could only navigate absences by surrendering to their emotional geography." Setup and development gates met; payoff absent—the trait does not return or shape the ending. Causal pressure: the vision provides Kael's backstory and motivates Elara's decision to restore the valve with care. Cost: the "gasping, stumbling back" and "phantom chill" show a brief toll. Friction: the trait is used once and then set aside; the restoration and offerings proceed without further visionary episodes, making it more a backstory device than a persistent constraint. Swappability: moderate—research or a found journal could deliver Kael's story with similar edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Hearten" is the story's engine: Elara's purpose is "to hearten the broken spirits of returning exiles," and beats 10–13 dramatize the trumpet note, the chart reading, and Elder Lin's recognition that she heartens through navigation. Setup by paragraph 9, development across the week of offerings, payoff in Lin's speech and the final resolve. Causal pressure: the desire to hearten drives the staggered method and each public act. Closure linkage: the final paragraph promises "the next note of heartening yet to come." Friction: the action is thematic and pervasive, but the verb itself is somewhat abstract—concrete acts (sound the trumpet, display the chart) carry the weight, and "hearten" functions more as interpretive frame than irreplaceable motor. Removing the word would not break the plot, only the rhetorical unity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Through staggered intervals" is signaled in paragraph 9 ("staggered intervals of recovered truth"), enacted across the week (one note, then chart, then log, then shanty fragments), and affirmed in Lin's speech ("honor healing's pace") and the final line ("next interval"). Setup, development, and payoff gates met. Causal pressure: the method shapes Elara's tactical choice to distribute rather than overwhelm, and the intervals structure the escalation. Closure linkage: the final sentence explicitly invokes "the next interval." Specificity: the intervals are time-based but not rigorously tracked (noon, dusk, "day by deliberate day" blur into summary). Friction: the intervals are described more than dramatized—only the first trumpet note and the chart moment are shown in scene; the rest are summarized, reducing immediacy and mechanical visibility.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Ivory Harbor post-rain is anchored early (paragraph 1), the ivory stones bookend the story (paragraph 1 and closing third: "The ivory stones, cleansed by rain, now held imprints of returning feet"), and the central pier, leaded window, and market square provide venues for the offerings. Setup and lyric-reprise payoff gates met; middle development weaker—setting supplies atmosphere but does not constrain a key choice. The rain-cleansed stones gain metaphorical weight (loss → endurance) at closure, qualifying as a charged reprise under the lyric allowance. Causal pressure: minimal; the harbor is backdrop rather than obstacle or resource. Cost connection: absent. The setting could swap to another coastal archive with minor edits, indicating moderate replaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"After the exile ends" is established in paragraph 3 ("Twenty years of exile had ended with the morning tide") and the timeframe shapes Elara's return and the returnees' displacement. The week-long sequence of offerings occurs "day by deliberate day," and the final beat gestures forward ("the next interval"). Setup and development gates met; payoff present as forward momentum. Causal pressure: the end of exile creates the opportunity and the pool of heartbroken returnees, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions—no clock or deadline presses Elara's choices. The "week later" is summary rather than tracked tension. Friction: the temporal anchor is more premise than motor; the story could unfold over any span without altering stakes, making the timeframe functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"To compile fragments into meaning" is stated in paragraph 6 ("to compile these scattered fragments into coherent meaning"), drives the valve restoration and chart display, and is reaffirmed in the final paragraph where Elara organizes and prepares the next fragment. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. Causal pressure: the desire to compile motivates each restorative act and the staggered method. Closure linkage: the child's drawing "awaited her touch," continuing the compilation work. Friction: the motivation is broad and could encompass many actions; "to restore and share" or "to heal through memory" would function similarly with small edits. The specificity of "fragments into meaning" adds rhetorical coherence but is not mechanically irreplaceable.</comment>
