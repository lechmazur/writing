<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is sketched through costume details (spectacles, gears, pockets) but her interior remains generic and declarative ("motivation burned quiet but fierce"). The thirty years of research is told rather than shown; no micro-choice under pressure reveals her hierarchy of values or embodied struggle. The final tears are label-only and the story grants her total success without visible cost or trade-off, flattening what could have been an earned renunciation or difficult choice. Interiority reads as summary exposition rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The story anchors who/where/when adequately early (grove, Elara, dawn/harvest moon alignment). Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration: the songs are restored and the grove responds, but the cost is invisible—Elara simply places the tendril back and walks away with "certainty," no path foreclosed, no palpable price paid. The lens reads Causal (ritual mechanics drive the sequence) but the final image lacks felt or conceptual cost; the transformation is wish-fulfillment without sacrifice. Under the cost-proof test, I cannot point to an on-page sentence showing what Elara lost or gave up, triggering a −0.6 deduction in Q2.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The grove is vividly rendered (dewdrops, jasmine, moss, altar cracks) but remains postcard backdrop; no environmental feature constrains a choice or alters Elara's tactics. The vine tendril and altar are handled as ritual props without spatial choreography that pressures action. The harvest moon's light and the sun's ray function as timer elements (see Q9 H) but do not charge the final image with cost, missing the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring the forgotten songs—is signaled early and pursued continuously. However, escalation is absent: Elara sings the songs in sequence without complication, reversal, or visible price. The "method demanded precision" and the alignment condition could have forced tactical adjustments or a near-miss, but every verse succeeds on first attempt with no friction. Coincidence (the perfect alignment arriving exactly when she finishes) resolves the conflict without protagonist agency narrowing options or accepting a trade-off. Under the Causal lens, this reads as and-then sequencing with no meaningful tightening or deepening that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme of restoration and gratitude emerges from the ritual structure, but the final image ("eternal echoes of golden stories") is stated rather than earned through a resonant non-literal answer. The grapes swelling "though the season was months away" is labeled a "tangible miracle" on the page, replacing subtext with overt thematic declaration. The closing line repeats the premise ("cyclical promise of renewal fulfilled") as a thesis statement rather than letting the image do the work, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty (−0.5 in Q5).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric register ("profound gathering hush," "rose-gold," "palpable reverence") that remains consistent but trends toward elevated diction throughout rather than modulating with urgency. Elara's perceptual signature is generic (she "knew," she "felt," she "closed her eyes") without idiosyncratic filtering; any restorer could narrate this way. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. Filter verbs ("seemed to lean," "appeared," "felt") cluster in the final third without voice motivation, adding minor distance drag.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Overwriting is pervasive: nearly every sentence in the opening and closing carries metaphor or elevated diction ("bled softly," "benevolent amber eye," "whimsical tinkerer," "liquid gold unspooled," "ghostly pearl") without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering density penalties (−0.6). Paraphrase loops appear: "gathering hush" is declared twice (opening and penultimate paragraph), and "the forgotten songs were now remembered" repeats the premise mid-closure without advancing it. Template cadence runs in the ritual sequence ("With each verse... the golden thread spun"; "Light seeped... sealing"; "wilted ferns straightened") follow identical structures across three lines (−0.5). Figurative language in peak beats is mixed: "liquid gold unspooled" and "weaving patterns only the heart could decipher" clash registers. Combined artifacts and loops: baseline −1.2, escalated to −1.7 because they touch the closure beat (the grapes, the final hush). Global 9+ disallowed per artifact-in-final-third rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise—restoring a sacred grove through song and ritual alignment—follows a familiar template (lone practitioner performs ancient rite at propitious moment, nature responds). The "whimsical tinkerer" descriptor and pocket contents (gears, thread, river stones) are cosmetic quirks unconnected to the ritual mechanics or stakes. The golden-thread visualization and out-of-season grapes are decorative flourishes rather than transformations of the premise through specific lived detail or moral calculus. No fresh inflection or non-obvious synthesis; the story could run unchanged with different names and a different grove, failing the transformation test.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Elara ("whimsical tinkerer") is present throughout but makes no on-page choice that alters tactics or creates a turn. Her role is executant of a predetermined ritual; the thirty years of research are backstory summary. Observation (recognizing the alignment) does not constitute decision under pressure. Swappable with "devoted scholar" or "patient archivist" with minimal edits. Present by first paragraph (setup ✓), no middle choice (development ✗), passive at closure (payoff ✗). Two gates missing; cap 2.8. Ornamental descriptor with no causal work: −0.4. Final score 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The vine tendril appears in three beats: clutched at the start, glows and spins thread during the ritual (middle), placed back into soil at the end (closure). Its legendary attribute (spinning golden stories when activated by melody) directly enables the remedy. However, cost is absent: Elara uses it successfully and returns it intact with no trade-off or visible sacrifice tied to the tendril itself. Setup ✓, development ✓ (enables the ritual), payoff ✓ (reprise in final act). All three gates met: eligible ≥6.1. Beat involvement (three touches) +0.9, closure linkage (planted as seed) +0.7, causal pressure (enables the golden thread) +0.8. No cost tied to the object itself: withhold upper credit. 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The harvest moon is present in the opening (third paragraph), functions as a timer (its last light must touch the altar), and is woven into the closure image ("the memory of the harvest moon smiled upon the verdant arbor"). It constrains the timing of Elara's action (alignment condition) but does not narrow options or force a trade-off; she simply waits for the condition to occur. Setup ✓ (paragraph 3), development ✓ (timing constraint frames the ritual window), payoff ✓ (named in penultimate line). All three gates; eligible ≥6.1. Causal pressure (timing) +0.6, closure linkage (final image) +0.8, but swappable with "solar eclipse" or "comet" without altering the dramatic stakes: −0.5. 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Spins golden stories" is the vine tendril's legendary attribute, described in paragraph 6 and enacted in the middle ritual sequence. The attribute enables the remedy by producing luminous narratives that heal the grove. However, the mechanics are ornamental: the golden thread "weaves patterns only the heart could decipher" without specificity, and no cost or constraint is tied to this spinning. Setup ✓ (paragraph 6), development ✓ (enacted during the songs), payoff (the stories are "stitched permanently into soil and stone"). Three gates met. Beat involvement (one extended sequence) +0.4, causal pressure (enables the remedy) +0.8, but no cost and high swappability (could be "weaves healing light" with minor edits): −0.6. 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Remedy" is Elara's goal stated in paragraph 5 ("to remedy the spiritual silence") and enacted through the entire ritual. The action—restoring the grove—structures the plot and produces the closure transformation (cracks sealed, plants blooming, stream awakened). However, "remedy" is broad and abstract; the specificity lies in the songs and the vine tendril rather than the remedy label itself. Setup ✓ (paragraph 5), development ✓ (the ritual sequence is the remedy in action), payoff ✓ (closure confirms success). Three gates. Beat involvement (entire middle) +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, but high swappability ("heal," "restore," "renew" all fit): −0.8. 5.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The "forgotten songs" are signaled early (paragraph 5: "restore the forgotten songs of gratitude and harvest"), their collection dramatized as thirty years of work (paragraph 9), and three songs are named and performed on the page during the ritual ("Awakening of Roots," "Blessing of Blossoms," "Chant of Ripening Grain," "Harmony of Alignment"). The method directly drives the remedy: each verse spins a golden story. Setup ✓ (paragraph 5), development ✓ (paragraphs 10–13, the songs are the active mechanism), payoff ✓ (paragraph 22: "The forgotten songs were now remembered"). All three gates. Beat involvement (four named uses across the ritual) +1.4, causal pressure (songs activate the vine and produce the remedy) +1.2, closure linkage (paragraph 22 confirms permanence) +1.0. Specificity: the named songs and the "thirty years" anchor irreplaceability +0.5. Total strong signals ~4.1 above baseline 3.0 → 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The "verdant arbor" is named in the opening line and closing line, and "at dawn" anchors the timeframe. The setting is lushly described (moss, altar, dewdrops, spiderwebs, ferns, oaks) but does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters Elara's tactics; she could perform this ritual in any grove at dawn. Setup ✓ (opening line), development ✗ (no middle action depends on arbor-specific features), payoff (named in final line as thematic echo). Two gates; cap ~6.0 per guidance. Lyric reprise (first line → last line) reweights slightly ("gathering hush" shifts from empty to filled) +0.3, but the reprise is thematic rather than causal. Ornamental middle: −0.6. 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"When everything aligns" is stated in paragraph 8 as the method's demand: harvest moon's last light plus sun's first ray, dew at peak, simultaneous convergence. This temporal condition frames urgency and is paid off in paragraphs 17–18 when the alignment occurs and the ritual completes. The timeframe does not force a trade-off or tighten Elara's decisions (she simply waits for the condition), but it provides a clear gate that structures the climax. Setup ✓ (paragraph 8), development (implicit: the ritual proceeds toward this moment), payoff ✓ (paragraphs 17–18). Three gates met. Causal pressure (the alignment is the enabling condition) +0.9, closure linkage (the flash of diamond light in paragraph 17 triggers completion) +0.9, but no visible cost or tactical adjustment tied to the timing: withhold upper credit. 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"To restore sacred practices" is Elara's stated motivation in paragraph 5 and confirmed in paragraph 26 ("the sacred practices were restored"). The desire is told rather than dramatized: no on-page friction between Elara's want and a competing cost, fear, or need. Her motivation is single-note and uncontested. Setup ✓ (paragraph 5), development ✗ (no scene shows her weighing or doubting the goal), payoff ✓ (paragraph 26 declares success). Two gates; cap ~6.0. Closure linkage (paragraph 26) +0.7, but motivation is label-only with no embodied conflict or trade-off: −0.8. 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Gathering hush" is introduced in the opening line, modulates to "palpable reverence" (paragraph 16) as the ritual intensifies, and returns in the penultimate paragraph ("no longer empty but filled with eternal echoes"). Tone is coherent and shifts subtly from anticipation to fulfillment, charging the final image. Setup ✓ (opening line), development ✓ (paragraph 16 deepens the hush under pressure), payoff ✓ (penultimate paragraph reweights it). Three gates. Closure linkage (the hush's transformation is part of the ending's resonance) +1.0, cadence shift (from stillness to living echo) +0.6, but the tone is static across most of the middle (lyric reverence throughout) and does not modulate with tactical friction: −0.4. 5.4.</comment>
