<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Aris exhibits consistent interior contradiction—grief versus scholarly ambition—and his choices (adjusting instruments, documenting, finally planting the seed) align with "kindly methodical" trait. The final renunciation of "haunted ambition" and shift to "gardener of hope" shows earned change with visible cost: thirty years of chasing retrieval abandoned for acceptance. However, the epiphany ("the physics of transition was not about tracking the gone, but honoring the connection that remained") arrives via sudden realization rather than through embodied struggle in the planting scene itself, slightly undermining the climb. Embodied emotion is present (trembling hands, tears) but some lines veer toward therapy-speak ("sharp edges of grief rounding into purpose").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through observation failure, analogical thinking, and seed-planting ritual, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: renouncing retrieval for acceptance). Orientation is swift (who, where, when by line 2). The closure unit lands on the page with felt cost: thirty years of quest abandoned, final tears, journal entry marking a new purpose. One meaningful deepening occurs when the arbor's hum stabilizes post-planting, signaling integration rather than loss. Minor slip: the transition from despair to understanding compresses rapidly in the planting sequence, slightly softening the causal texture of the shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The magnetic arbor is vividly specific (ironwood, magnetic filaments, luminous moss, pulsing nexus) and constrains Aris's action: he plants at the central nexus where magnetic currents converge, and the arbor's response (resonant hum, needle stabilization) validates his choice. Sensory detail is filtered through professional attention (frequency decay, residual warmth) and selective (the "soft pulse," "dark, rich soil humming with latent energy"). The micro-setting—seed in soil at the arbor's heart—charges the final image. Minor deduction: some phrases ("perpetual dawn," "swirling cloud cover") offer picturesque backdrop without pressure linkage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: understand the physics of transition to resolve grief over Elara. Pressure tightens when "despair threatened to swallow him whole" after the failed observation, then shifts via analogical thinking to a new hypothesis. The planting is an agency-driven choice (renunciation of retrieval, embrace of connection) that forecloses the retrieval path with visible cost (thirty years' ambition, tears). The arbor's stabilization and green shoot promise validate the new stance. One meaningful tightening is present, sufficient for this length. Minor issue: the turn from despair to insight compresses slightly, and the external validation (arbor hum, console needles) arrives quickly, softening the struggle slightly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—transition as connection rather than retrieval—emerges through specific actions (seed planting, arbor response, journal entry) and the Akkadian phrase for safe passage, not direct statement. The knowledge fruit seed shifts meaning from talisman to bridge, and the final image (green shoot, "gardener of hope") reweights the premise without a stated moral. Subtext operates in gesture (kneeling, brushing moss, whispering) and the arbor's warm hum as non-literal answer. Minor slip: "the physics of transition was not about tracking the gone, but honoring the connection that remained" edges toward thematic summary, though it remains rooted in Aris's professional vocabulary. The touching-distance tone supports theme consistently.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; distance modulates purposefully (close interior at grief moments, slightly wider for technical observations). Perceptual signature is character-specific: cuneiform translator's analogical leap, professional documentation habit, Akkadian whisper. Diction mostly fits Aris's register, though "touching distance" as a phrase recurs in narration and may read slightly imposed. No dialogue present. Minor issue: some lines ("sharp edges of grief rounding into purpose," "a gardener of hope above the clouds") elevate into poetic summary that slightly distances from Aris's immediate perception under stress. Free indirect style is clean, no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully (short urgent beats at despair, longer cadence at planting ritual). Sentence openings vary; no sustained template runs. Information density is high (every line advances character, action, or atmosphere). Minor loop detected: "haunted ambition" appears twice in adjacent paragraphs without added pressure. Some phrases approach overwriting ("a silent, graceful unspooling of luminescent energy," "a promise taking root in touching distance") with figurative language clustering in the final third without pattern-teaching. A few filter verbs ("felt the weight," "felt a warmth") dull immediacy slightly. No major artifacts obscure closure, but the density of poetic phrasing in the final paragraphs softens propulsion slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of grief scientist and cuneiform translator offers a fresh angle, and the magnetic arbor as ritual site is vivid. The turn from retrieval to connection is earned in hindsight via analogical thinking. However, the core arc—scientist learning to honor memory over control—echoes familiar templates (obsessive researcher finds peace through acceptance). The knowledge fruit seed as planted talisman and the Akkadian safe-passage phrase add specificity, but the emotional resolution follows a well-trodden path. The arbor's magnetic response and green shoot promise are evocative but not wholly surprising given the premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Aris (cuneiform translator) drives all key turns: documenting the failure, employing analogical thinking to reframe his hypothesis, planting the seed, and shifting his life's work from retrieval to guidance. His professional skill (translation, analogical bridging) enables the pivot. Present in setup (line 4), middle (analogical leap), and closure (journal entry, new purpose). Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong. Minor deduction: the trait "cuneiform translator" functions more as backstory credential than on-page constraint; the analogical thinking could belong to any interdisciplinary scholar.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The knowledge fruit seed appears in three distinct beats: introduction (Elara's gift, carried twenty years), despair/decision (drawn from pocket, symbol recognized), and planting/closure (seed in soil, green shoot promise, charged final image). It shifts meaning from talisman to bridge and drives the central action (planting at nexus). Causally active and irreplaceable: removing it would collapse the closure. High integration, strong closure participation, visible cost (releasing retrieval quest). Earns high score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Haunted ambitions" shapes stakes (thirty years pursuing retrieval, "despair threatened to swallow him whole") and the final renunciation with visible cost (tears, journal shift). Present in setup (line 6), middle (drives despair), and closure (softened into acceptance). The term recurs and pressures the protagonist's choices. However, "haunted" reads slightly as thematic label rather than embodied constraint; the ambition itself (understand physics of transition) does more concrete work. Still, the concept is causally active and alters options at the end.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Kindly methodical" is shown in documentation habit ("compelled him to document every detail"), deliberate planting ritual ("deliberate, reverent care"), and refusal to dismiss ancient poetic terms. It enables the analogical thinking and patient observation that lead to the pivot. Present in setup and middle, less visible at closure where emotion dominates. The trait constrains his approach (no rash leaps) but does not impose a high-stakes tradeoff on the page. Functional, one beat, minor closure echo. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Reestablish" is the central action: Aris reestablishes his hypothesis by integrating ancient wisdom with empirical truth, then reestablishes his life's work as compassionate guide rather than lonely quest. The word recurs explicitly ("To reestablish his shattered hypothesis," "He would reestablish his life's work"). This action drives the planting decision and the journal entry at closure. Causally indispensable, present across beats, charges the final image. Very strong integration, just shy of 8.5 because the mechanics of "reestablish" are abstract rather than tactile.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Analogical thinking" is signaled mid-story ("his training surfaced; he employed analogical thinking, his mind leaping between disciplines like a translator bridging tongues") and shown in the comparison of cuneiform text (spirit as seed on wind) to arbor's magnetic fields and departing spirit. It enables the pivot from retrieval to connection. Present in middle, shapes the key insight, echoes at closure (journal records "how kindness, not force, unlocks understanding"). However, the mechanics remain slightly tell-y and compressed; the leap itself is narrated more than dramatized in real-time cognitive struggle. Two gates, lyric reprise, solid but not essential.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The magnetic arbor provides the setting and functions as active agent: magnetic fields as "wind," conductive branches guide spirit departure, central nexus is the planting site, arbor's hum and needle stabilization validate Aris's choice. Present throughout (setup, middle, closure), constrains action (where to plant, what to observe), and charges the final image (green shoot, glowing arbor). Essential to world logic and closure. Strong integration, high irreplaceability. Minor deduction: some arbor description is picturesque (perpetual dawn, cloud cover) without direct pressure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"After the spirit leaves" anchors the opening timeframe ("Moments ago, the volunteer's spirit had departed") and sets the emotional stakes (failure, despair following the departure). The departure's clean escape defies instruments and triggers Aris's crisis. The timeframe shapes the setup and the middle turn (analogical reframe post-departure). However, it does not tighten tactics during the planting sequence or impose a live clock; the closure unfolds in ritual time without urgency. Two gates (setup, middle development), moderate causal pressure, no closure tightening. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To understand the physics of transition" is Aris's driving motivation, stated explicitly ("pursued the physics of transition—the precise mechanics of how consciousness moves beyond the corporeal") and shown through thirty years of observation, instrument adjustment, documentation. It creates friction (grief versus scholarly control, despair when understanding eludes him) and forecloses a path at closure (abandoning retrieval for acceptance). Present in setup, middle despair, and closure shift. Causally indispensable, high cost, strong closure linkage. Earns high score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Touching distance" as tone is coherent and modulates with pressure: gentle precision in the opening, deep quiet after departure, compressed grief at despair, reverent care during planting, warm acceptance at closure. The phrase recurs literally ("In this touching distance between absence and presence," "a promise taking root in touching distance") and charges the final image. Tone supports the theme of connection over retrieval and never breaks into harshness or irony. Strong tonal control, purposeful modulation, closure charge. High integration.</comment>
