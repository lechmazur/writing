<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("ghost of her own erased life," "midnight vigil") rather than embodied contradictions acting in scene. The heartbeat-counting trait is told more than dramatized; it never constrains a choice or creates visible friction. The ink ritual feels procedural rather than motivated by genuine internal conflict, and the "wisdom crystallized" moment arrives as assertion rather than earned through on-page struggle. No micro-choices reveal competing values with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty applies: who, where, when anchors arrive but remain vague past 120 words ("opal observatory" and "death certificate error survivor" require substantial unpacking; "after the radio static had finally cleared" offers temporal mood but no concrete stake). The closure unit—Elara's life record verified and new protocols imbued—is told rather than shown with visible cost; the "digital ghost dissolved" is metaphorical summary, not a decisive change legible on the page. Drive lens remains ambiguous (lyric-accumulative elements clash with causal framing), and no on-page reversal narrows options. Cap Q3 at 7.0 per Orientation Test; apply −0.4 in Q2 for lens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The opal observatory and snow mantle are vivid but remain postcard description; the porcelain shard and ink-stained paper function as symbolic props without constraining a physical choice or altering spatial choreography. The "opal beneath the paper hummed faintly" offers sensory texture that supports tone, and the snow's "gentle descent, erasing scars" charges the final image with conceptual cost. Micro-setting (body, tool) is present but does not force a tactical trade-off. The environment pressures mood more than decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"fetch wisdom from failure"—is declared but never dramatized as a choice that narrows options. The ink ritual unfolds without resistance, reversal, or visible trade-off; Elara discovers "the failure was human, not malicious" without on-page friction or cost. The heartbeat count climbs (219, 287, 340) but this escalation is decorative, not causal. No antagonistic pressure forces a renunciation or forecloses a live path. The "digital ghost dissolved" is summary, not a turn earned by protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme—failure as teacher, systemic compassion—is stated rather than emergent from specific on-page cost. "Verification protocols must honor the living behind every data point" is overt thesis. The porcelain shard recurs (brokenness → key → compass) but the transformation is told, not enacted through constrained choice. The final image "wisdom blooms where broken things are tended with intention" offers lyric resonance yet remains abstract. No plausible counter-reading or moral ambiguity complicates the closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Voice is stable and the perceptual signature—counting heartbeats, opal-veined paper, "midnight solace"—remains coherent. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("ephemeral patterns," "systemic negligence," "defragmentation") that exceeds the interiority's grounding. No dialogue present; focalization is clean with no head-hopping. Psychic distance is consistent but the syntax in high-pressure beats (ink ritual) does not compress or accelerate; rhythm remains uniform. No purposeful elision or compression serves closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear: "ghost of her own erased life" / "digital ghost of her deleted records"; "fragmented echo" / "scattered data shards." Template cadence in lines 10–12 ("Her action tonight was to defragment… Her method relied on…") and 13–15 ("She poured… Guiding… she carved") flattens momentum. "Tears traced paths down her cheeks, freezing at her jawline—release given physical form" is stock embodiment. Figurative density (neural map, constellations, blueprint, compass) stacks without payoff. Apply −0.6 for loops and template stems; −0.3 for register drift in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Core premise—bureaucratic death certificate error survivor—offers novelty, but the ink-ritual solution and "wisdom from failure" arc follow familiar self-discovery templates. The porcelain shard and heartbeat count are symbolic conveniences introduced to harvest thematic points rather than constrain live choices. The "opal observatory under snow" and "digital ghost" are atmospheric but do not synthesize into a non-obvious moral calculus. Transformation test: the plot and arc could swap settings (tarot cards in a lighthouse, pottery shards in a library) with minor edits. Apply −0.5 for derivative self-actualization structure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara ("death certificate error survivor") is present throughout and her backstory frames the ritual, but her choices do not create key turns. The ink ritual unfolds without resistance; her agency is procedural (pour ink, carve channels) rather than decisional. The life-record verification at the end is told, not enacted through on-page choice. Setup and closure participation present; middle development is observational rather than choice-driven. Two gates met; no strong causal pressure. Score mid-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The porcelain shard appears in beats 4, 17, 23, and 33 with evolving meaning (anchor of fragility → key → compass). It is handled on the page ("fingers closed around," "guiding… through the liquid black," "returned to her pocket") and the final reprise ("no longer a fragment of pain but a polished token of purpose") reweights prior material. Setup, development (guides ink), and closure participation all present. No visible cost tied directly to the shard's use; it enables rather than constrains. Three gates met; solid integration with charged reprise but no felt trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Digital ghost" appears in beat 7 ("digital ghost of her deleted records flickered") and beats 20, 27 as metaphor for erased records and systemic failure. It does not shape on-page tactics; Elara's ink ritual targets "the ghost's origin" but the ghost itself is passive, summary object. Setup present; no middle choice constrained by the ghost; closure mentions it dissolving but this is told outcome rather than causal participation. Two gates barely met; largely ornamental. Score low-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Elara counts heartbeats in beats 6, 13, 21, 29 (219, 280, 287, 340). The count is label-only backdrop; it never constrains a choice or enables a tactic with visible cost. The escalation (219 → 340) is decorative rhythm rather than causal pressure. Setup present; no middle development through the trait; closure mentions "steady, unbroken rhythm" as thematic echo but no on-page trade-off. Two gates barely met; ornamental integration. Score low-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Defragment" is Elara's stated action (beat 8) and the ink ritual beats 10–15 enact it metaphorically ("defragmentation, weaving ink into a narrative"). The ending (beat 27) shows "life record—verified, safeguarded, and imbued with new protocols" as outcome. Setup and closure present; middle beats perform the action but without on-page resistance or reversal—Elara discovers the error's origin and the lesson without friction. All three gates met but the action is procedural rather than pressure-driven. Score mid-band for presence across structure but limited causal force.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The method—ephemeral patterns in spilled ink—is signaled in beat 9 ("ritual where intention shaped chaos into revelation") and enacted beats 10–15 (pours ink, carves channels, sees constellations). The ink dries to silver (beat 19), creating a permanent map. Setup, development (ink ritual shapes insight), and closure (folded paper placed beside console) all present. The mechanics matter on the page and the method enables the "wisdom crystallized" moment. Three gates met; causal participation solid. Score mid-high band for essential presence and clear mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The opal observatory under snow is established in beat 1 and recurs in beats 15, 20, 26, 35. It provides atmospheric grounding and the opal "hummed faintly, amplifying the ritual's resonance" (beat 15), but it does not constrain a physical choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. The snow's "gentle descent, erasing scars" (beat 24) charges the final mood but is thematic rather than tactical. Setup and closure mood present; no middle constraint. Two gates met; largely postcard use. Score mid-functional band; late mention and ornamental role cap at 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"After the radio static had finally cleared into profound silence" (beat 1) and "The radio remained clear" (beat 30) frame the timeframe but impose no live clock or tightening deadline. The ritual unfolds without time pressure; "midnight vigil" is mood, not constraint. Setup present; no middle or closure participation in tactics. One gate met; vague and untracked time. Score low-ornamental band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to fetch wisdom from failure" is stated in beat 3 and echoed beats 22, 28, 35. Elara performs the ink ritual to achieve this goal, but the desire is never dramatized as conflicted choice with visible cost—she succeeds without friction or trade-off. Setup and closure participation present (she declares success: "She had fetched the wisdom she sought"); no middle beat where the motivation forces a renunciation or alteration. Two gates met; told-only desire without on-page friction. Score mid-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Midnight solace" (beat 23) names the tone, which is sustained through "hushed chamber," "profound silence," "quiet warmth," and "gentle glow." The tone is coherent and modulates slightly (tears in beat 25 add release) but remains static—no purposeful tension or break that charges the final image with new pressure. The tone supports the lyric mood but does not reweight the stake. Setup and closure mood present; no middle pressure modulation. Two gates met; coherent but static. Score mid-band for tonal consistency without dynamic charge.</comment>
