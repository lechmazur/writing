<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's infinite patience is shown through action (kneeling, tracing knots with "reverent focus"), and her motivation to preserve ancient methods drives her presence at the dock. However, her internal experience remains abstract; we see no contradictory impulses, no embodied cost of waiting, no micro-choice that reveals competing values. The fisherman's silent trust and final speech carry thematic weight but his interiority is inaccessible, flattening the interpersonal crucible. The ending realization ("To preserve ancient methods was the true treasure") borders on thesis-statement rather than dramatized shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accrues through fog, knot-reading, and discovery, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid: Elara accepts the method as treasure, not the seed). Orientation anchors (golden dock, fog, harbor) arrive early. The closure unit lands on the page with conceptual cost legible in "the fulgurite a warm weight… a promise," reweighting the premise from object-retrieval to stewardship continuity. One persistent constraint (the secret weavers' encoded knowledge) shapes tactics. Minor tension: the fisherman's arrival feels coincidental rather than causally motivated, and the final paragraphs risk drifting into summary rather than charged image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The golden dock, snow, fog, and harbor create a cohesive sensory field filtered through Elara's patient perception. The third piling and carved hollow constrain discovery; the fulgurite's "smoky silica" and the acorn's "dark and gleaming" specificity charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (snow muffling sound, fog swallowing outlines). Minor slip: "oceanic hush" and "pale gold light" recur without evolving meaning, and the fog's retreat at closure feels convenient rather than causally tied to Elara's action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: preserve the storm-oak seed via decoded knowledge. The knot-reading tightens from broad goal to precise landmark (diamond knot → third piling), forecloses guesswork, and the final realization reweights the stake from seed-as-relic to method-as-legacy. Agency is present (Elara decodes, moves to piling, secures glass), and the fisherman's silent approval adds pressure. However, no reversal or complication tests commitment; the sequence unfolds as smooth discovery without trade-off or visible price paid in the moment. The coincidental arrival of the fisherman weakens escalation causality.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—knowledge woven into daily life, method over object—emerges through the knot-decoding action and the fisherman's speech: "We guard the method. The glass may fade, but the knowledge… is eternal." The final image of the fulgurite as "tiny ark of memory sailing steadily toward tomorrow" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Minor weakness: the penultimate paragraph's "To preserve ancient methods was the true treasure" edges toward thesis-statement, and the final three paragraphs risk over-articulation ("each step felt like a stitch connecting lightning to seed") where the image could carry the weight alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; Elara's perceptual signature (patient, reverent focus on tactile detail) is consistent. Diction is elevated ("embodying the attribute," "a tapestry of intentional knots") and voice-motivated for a philosophical collector. The fisherman's single speech—"The secret weavers do not guard objects"—carries natural cadence and subtext. Minor slips: register occasionally drifts toward essay ("Her motivation was a quiet urgency") and some phrasing feels template-driven ("the fog began to thin, revealing pale gold light"). Filter verbs ("She felt understanding settle") dull immediacy at a key beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but coherent ("lightning-forged vessel," "map of wind and water"). Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere or discovery. However, paraphrase loops appear: "oceanic hush" recurs three times without reweighting; "the golden dock seemed to sigh, snow glittering like scattered promises" and "the harbor held its breath" are near-synonyms within three paragraphs. Template cadence in the final third ("She carried… She knew… Each step felt…") stacks four consecutive subject-verb openings, and the closing lines ("tiny ark of memory sailing steadily toward tomorrow") border on purple without adding causal pressure. Apply −0.6 for loops and template cadence; −0.3 for register drift in peak reflection.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—decoding knowledge from fisherman's knots—offers a fresh angle, and the philosophical seed collector is particularized through vocation and patient methodology. The fulgurite glass and storm-oak seed are specific, non-generic objects. However, the emotional arc (patience → discovery → realization) follows a predictable template, and the fisherman's arrival by coincidence undercuts ingenuity. The final image's ambition ("a tiny ark of memory") feels borrowed from familiar eco-literary registers rather than inevitable from prior particulars. Transformation test: swap knots for any other encoding system (quipu, runes) and the arc remains unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout; her choice to kneel, decode, and secure the glass drives the middle and ending beats. However, her role is largely observational and receptive; the fisherman's arrival and the knot-pattern's existence enable discovery without Elara making a high-cost decision. She enacts her vocation but does not face a competing pressure that tests it. Setup present; middle development weak (no choice under conflict); payoff present (she secures the seed and internalizes the lesson). Two gates met; smooth discovery without turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The fulgurite glass is signaled early as the sought object, discovered in the oilcloth bundle, and handled/secured in the satchel. It returns with reweighted meaning: from prize to "promise," "tiny ark of memory." Three beats (goal statement, discovery, final image) and the closure image ("the fulgurite glass pulsed faintly against her heart") charges the ending. Setup, development (discovery), and payoff all present; causal pressure moderate (the glass is the goal but does not constrain tactics). High integration, minor swappability (any rare vessel could serve).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The secret weavers are introduced as a fellowship who encode knowledge in daily life; the fisherman's speech explains their ethos. The concept shapes the dominant stake (find encoded knowledge) and the thematic resolution. However, the weavers themselves remain off-page abstractions; their presence does not constrain Elara's tactics or create on-page friction. Setup present (introduction); middle development absent (no weaver opposition or test); payoff thematic only (the fisherman's speech). Two gates, but the concept is told rather than dramatized through conflicting choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Infinitely patient" is stated early and shown through Elara's stillness, reverent kneeling, and slow knot-decoding. One on-page action (the decoding process) embodies the trait. However, no cost or trade-off is visible; patience is never tested by urgency, interruption, or competing need. Setup present; middle development weak (trait enacted but not constrained); payoff absent (the trait does not shift at closure). Label-plus-action but no visible price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Coax" is signaled in the goal statement and enacted in the knot-decoding beat where Elara "coaxes meaning from hemp and memory." The action drives the middle turn (diamond knot reveals the piling) and enables discovery. However, "coax" could be swapped for "decode," "interpret," or "extract" with minimal structural change; the specificity lies in the method (knots) rather than the verb. Setup present; middle development strong (the action narrows options); payoff indirect (the glass is found, coaxing complete). Two-plus gates; moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The method is signaled early ("by decoding knot patterns") and executed on the page: Elara traces half-hitches, figure-eight loops, diamond knot, Turk's head. The mechanics shape the middle beat (each knot is a syllable; the diamond knot reveals the landmark) and enable discovery. The method is irreplaceable—remove it and the discovery mechanism collapses. Setup, development (knot-reading constrains the search), and payoff (method validated in the fisherman's speech and Elara's final realization) all present. High integration; minor penalty for late signal (method named at the goal but executed only in one sustained middle beat).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The golden dock under snow anchors the opening and closing images ("the golden dock seemed to sigh, snow glittering like scattered promises"). Snow muffles sound, creating the oceanic hush; the third piling supplies the discovery site. However, the dock itself does not constrain Elara's choices or alter tactics—it is backdrop rather than pressure. Setup present (vivid opening); middle development weak (the piling is a landmark, not an obstacle); payoff present (lyric reprise in final third). Early-final reprise reweights atmosphere but not stakes; micro-setting (piling) functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Fog rolling across the harbor is present in the opening and recedes at closure ("the fog began to thin… the fog retreating"). However, time is vague—no clock, no urgency, no tightening window. The fog's arrival and retreat feel atmospheric rather than causal; Elara waits without visible duration cost, and the fisherman's arrival is unlinked to any temporal pressure. Setup present; middle development absent (no time constraint alters tactics); payoff decorative (fog retreat signals resolution but does not impose cost). Timeframe is mood, not mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—to preserve ancient methods before they vanish—is stated early and drives her presence at the dock. The final realization ("To preserve ancient methods was the true treasure") directly echoes and deepens the motivation. However, the motivation is never tested by friction; no competing want, no visible sacrifice, no moment where preservation costs her something else. Setup present; middle development absent (desire enacted but not conflicted); payoff thematic (realization validates the motive without cost). Two gates; told-and-resolved rather than dramatized-through-trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Oceanic hush is signaled early, sustained through "muffled every sound to a whisper," "the oceanic hush that settled upon the water," and recurs at closure ("The oceanic hush remained, now filled with the quiet hum of continuity"). Tone modulates subtly (from anticipation to discovery to reverent closure) and charges the final image. However, the tone is uniform—quiet throughout—without dynamic range under pressure. Setup, development (tone coheres across beats), and payoff (hush reweighted as "continuity") all present. Strong coherence; minor penalty for static modulation (no tonal break or contrast to heighten the ending).</comment>
