<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her method (hymning the mundane) is character-specific, but her interiority remains thin—she enters, observes, executes her plan without internal friction or cost. Arthur and Lena show embodied grief (stone in throat, frayed voice), yet their arc feels passive: they receive the gift rather than making a choice that alters the outcome. The final reconciliation ("We'll keep listening") is tender but unmotivated by prior contradiction or renunciation; no path is visibly foreclosed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (hospice room, post-blood-work, Arthur dying, Lena grieving). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: Elara's song weaves memory and sensory detail (vinyl shard, lavender scent) to reweight grief into connection. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the broken shard becomes "wholehearted emblem"), yet cost remains elusive—no tactic was altered, no option foreclosed; the family simply shifts from mourning to remembering without visible sacrifice or friction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The hospice room is vividly anchored (mountain ridge, clouds below, liquid gold sunlight) and the vinyl shard is handled across beats, gaining tactile history. Lavender scent arrives as a sensory bridge that charges the closure image. The "radiant haven" frame holds coherent spatial logic (window, nightstand, bed, curtain), and the micro-setting (shard, sachets) constrains the memory work, though it does not alter a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: Elara seeks a "flawless goodbye" that honors truth, not denial. Pressure deepens through the song's accumulation (coffee steam, off-key hum, broken record as music), and the lavender scent arrives as a complication that validates memory. Yet no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options—Elara's plan unfolds as scripted, and the family's reconciliation is received rather than earned through a trade-off or renunciation with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges implicitly: small rituals hold love, brokenness carries music, memory bridges loss. The vinyl shard and lavender function as charged motifs that reweight grief into connection. However, the final paragraph moralizes overtly ("She had not created hope; she had simply cleared the space for it to be found") and the closing lines drift into thematic summary ("flawless goodbye was not an end, but a gentle note sustained") rather than letting the image resonate without gloss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds cleanly on Elara until brief shifts to Lena and Arthur's perceptions (Lena's tears, Arthur's smile, his whispered thanks). The narrative voice is elevated and lyric ("clouds drifted like silent rivers," "pulsing stillness") with purposeful cadence, yet diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("decisively kind heart swelling," "luminous peace") that blurs the perceptual signature. Dialogue is sparse and functional, though Arthur's "I can hear her humming again" lands with naturalism and subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often vivid ("grief a stone in her throat," "her voice a warm thread stitching ordinary moments into grace"), but several metaphors stack without clear propulsion ("pulsing stillness," "radiant haven," "liquid gold," "deep water certainty" all in the opening). Paraphrase loops appear: "pulsing stillness" recurs three times, "flawless goodbye" twice, and the final third restates the thematic frame ("wholehearted emblem," "gentle note sustained," "enduring scent of hope") in near-synonyms. Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "Elara [verb]," and the closing lines loop thematic summary rather than compress. Propulsion stalls under the weight of decoration.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The hospice-music-therapy frame is familiar, and the emotional arc (grief → remembrance → peace) follows a predictable template. The vinyl-shard motif and lavender-scent twist offer specific texture, yet the premise relies on a saintly facilitator delivering closure to passive recipients—a common redemptive structure. The "hymning the mundane" method is named rather than transformed through risky particulars, and the "flawless goodbye" conceit resolves without moral friction or cost, choosing safety over bold stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her choices (lifting the shard, tuning the guitar, singing) structure the middle and ending. Yet her decisions feel scripted rather than constrained by friction: she arrives with a plan, executes it, and succeeds without adaptation or trade-off. Her observation and action are causal but not tested; she shapes the arc but does not alter her own tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The vinyl shard appears early (nightstand), is handled mid-scene (Elara lifts it, feeling its history), returns in the climax (Lena and Arthur close fingers around it), and is reweighted at closure ("wholehearted emblem of connection"). Its broken state is thematically charged ("Even splintered things hold music"), and its physical presence anchors multiple beats. It does not constrain a choice under pressure, but it charges the final image and participates causally across three distinct beats.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The lavender scent arrives late (after the song begins) as "the scent of hope," and the phrase "scent of hope" is used twice in summary. It functions as a sensory validation rather than shaping stakes or altering tactics. The concept is more thematic echo than causal force; it complicates the emotional register but does not change options or pressure on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Decisively kind" is labeled early ("decisively kind eyes," "decisively kind heart swelling") but never constrains an action with visible cost. Elara's kindness is performed through her song and presence, yet no on-page moment shows her choosing kindness over another impulse or paying a price for it. The attribute is ornamental, a descriptor rather than a tactical friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Reunify" is signaled in Elara's method ("reunify memory with the present moment") and dramatized when Lena reaches across the bed, her hand covering Arthur's, their fingers closing around the shard. This physical act embodies the emotional reconciliation and is framed as the story's pivot ("the action of reunify bloomed"). It appears in two beats (method statement, closure gesture) and defines the ending's meaning, though it could be replaced with "reconnect" or "bridge" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Hymning the mundane" is named explicitly ("Her method was hymning the mundane") and demonstrated in Elara's song (turntable whir, steam from mugs, off-key hum, blanket weight, chair scrape). The method structures the middle beats and charges the closure by making ordinary details sacred. However, it is told more than tested—Elara's approach succeeds without friction, and the mechanics do not shape her attempts under pressure; the method is present and causal but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The "radiant haven above the clouds" is anchored vividly in the opening (mountain ridge, clouds below, panoramic window, liquid gold sunlight) and reprised at closure ("radiant haven above the clouds now saturated with luminous peace," "High above the world"). It establishes tone and isolation but does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. The setting is atmospheric and coherent yet functionally replaceable; any serene, elevated hospice room would serve the same narrative work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe is anchored early ("The blood work had come back that morning") and establishes urgency (Arthur's imminent death). The "after" frame shapes the emotional stakes and Elara's mission, but the clock does not tighten tactics on the page—no pulse of time pressure alters Elara's choices or the family's responses. The frame is present, sets context, and motivates the goodbye work, but time itself does not escalate or constrain.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To execute a flawless goodbye" is stated explicitly as Elara's motivation ("Her motivation was singular and profound") and structures her entire arc. It drives her method (hymning the mundane, honoring the break) and is reprised at closure ("flawless goodbye woven from truth"). Yet the motivation is told more than dramatized—Elara does not face a friction between "flawless" and "honest," and no on-page choice forces her to trade off perfection for truth. The desire is present and causal but lacks visible conflict or cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Pulsing stillness" is named three times (opening, middle, ending: "pulsing stillness—a quiet thrumming with love and loss," "the pulsing stillness remained," "wrapped in pulsing stillness") and establishes a paradoxical tone—quiet yet charged. The phrase modulates slightly (empty → full of remembrance) and charges the final image. However, it functions more as a recurring label than a tonal engine that shifts with pressure; the mood remains consistently serene and reverent throughout, with minimal modulation across beats.</comment>
