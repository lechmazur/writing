<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and consistent—understanding the oasis's resistance to change—and his potter's "sharp gentleness" with clay translates coherently to handling the glass. His final choice to carry this ethos into the wasteland feels earned by the vision sequence. However, interiority leans heavily on abstract meditation ("phototropic devotion," "temporal roots") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure; the vision arrives passively rather than through a difficult micro-choice that forecloses another path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines; the drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural with a deepening that reweights the dominant stake (understanding → embodying kindness as temporal force). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kael's bow and resolve to carry the lesson forward crystallize his stance with felt cost (leaving the oasis behind, accepting its abandonment as reverence rather than restoration). The vision sequence functions as the meaningful tightening that narrows his purpose. Minor cost-proof issue: the exact price of this new purpose remains conceptual rather than foregrounding a specific forfeiture on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The oasis is vividly particular—lavender near silent hives, sun-bleached glyphs, dry stone well—and the phototropic glass constrains Kael's method (must align with precise sun angle). Spatial choreography is clean (kneeling, tracing glyphs, positioning for the final ray). The thrum and fractured-timeline vision charge the final image when Kael sees the hives as "vessels holding the shape of compassion." The micro-setting (glass + sun patterns + stones) directly enables the core revelation and reweights the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding the oasis's resistance—is signaled early and sustained. The escalation under an Accumulative lens is the thrum/vision that deepens Kael's knowledge and reweights his purpose. His final choice (to carry sharp gentleness into the wasteland) is protagonist-driven and forecloses the path of passive study. The cost is felt but remains abstract: no live tactical dilemma or visible forfeiture of a second option in the moment, limiting entry to the 8-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme—kindness as a force that bends time and resists entropy—emerges through the vision's particulars (beekeeper saving a drowning bee, sharing water, humming to swarms). The final image (pottery glazed with phototropic light memory) offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Minor slip: "phototropic devotion" and "temporal roots" edge toward abstraction rather than letting the images speak; the closing line ("kindness…leaves indelible marks on time itself") verges on thematic restatement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is consistent (potter's tactile awareness: "centering clay," "struck clay bell"). Diction is elevated and controlled, with purposeful lyricism ("bruised twilight," "ochre waves"). Minor register drift: phrases like "phototropic to kindness," "temporal roots," and "fractured timelines coexisted" read closer to prompt exposition than Kael's grounded craftsman voice under pressure, slightly diluting character-specific texture at peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Clarity holds through the vision sequence. Overwriting issues: "phototropic devotion," "temporal roots," "fractured timelines coexisted where kindness had been a constant anchor, woven not by magic but by memory" stack figurative/conceptual language in adjacent sentences without breathing room. Paraphrase loop: "Her kindness was not passive; it was a force…" immediately follows prior explanation of the same idea. Template cadence: "He watched…her actions a steady rhythm…each gentle touch…each whispered encouragement…each act a stitch" runs a parallel stem across three beats. Cumulative line-level artifacts lower the score and disallow 9+ globally per the filter-verb and template-cadence caps.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis—phototropic glass revealing kindness as temporal anchor in a post-collapse oasis—is specific and non-obvious. The beekeeper's ghost and her micro-acts of care offer fresh particulars. However, the frame (lone mystic seeks meaning in wasteland ruin, receives vision, departs transformed) follows a recognizable template; the transformation itself (potter vows to carry gentleness forward) lacks the on-page tactical cost or ethical friction that would make it feel inevitable rather than declared. Within Q8, no severe derivative penalty applies, but the lack of bold risk holds the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kael is present throughout and his choices—tracing glyphs, aligning the glass, infusing his touch with sharp gentleness—drive the vision. His final decision to carry the lesson into the wasteland provides closure participation. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. However, many beats are observational (watching the beekeeper's ghost, witnessing acts) rather than forked decisions with visible cost; the peak choice is a resolve rather than a tactical dilemma.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lantern glass appears early, is handled in multiple beats (cradled, aligned with sun, held "as a friend"), and its thrum and vision reweight the story's meaning. Its phototropic attribute constrains Kael's method and charges the closure when he pockets the warm, now-polished glass. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Minor swappability concern: another divinatory tool could serve a similar function with edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Fractured timelines are introduced early and drive the vision: Kael sees three coexisting layers (parched present, vibrant past, fragile future) that explain the oasis's resistance. This reweights his understanding and fuels his final purpose. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. The concept shapes stakes (why the place endures) but does not create on-page tactical pressure or a forked choice; it functions more as revelation than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The phototropic-to-kindness attribute is named early and constrains Kael's handling (must be "sincere, gentle intent"). It enables the vision and links thematically to the beekeeper's acts. Setup and payoff gates met; middle development is implicit (his potter's touch must match the trait). Cost is conceptual rather than visible: no moment where Kael's kindness is tested or a harsh impulse must be suppressed. The attribute reads more as a rule than a friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The thrum begins mid-story, signals the vision's arrival, and carries through the revelation ("vibration traveling up his arm…humming deep in his bones"). It reappears at closure as "a steady rhythm in his own breath." Setup in first third is absent (−0.3), but the thrum drives the peak beat and charges the final image. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; irreplaceability is solid (the tactile/auditory cue is distinct).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Following sun patterns is named early ("aligning the glass with the day's final, precise angle of light etched into the oasis stones") and Kael enacts it on the page (tracing glyphs, positioning for the final ray). The method shapes his approach and the timing of the vision. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. Causal pressure is moderate; the method is necessary but its mechanics feel more procedural than a source of friction or cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned beekeeping oasis with lavender, hives, and glyphs is established early, supplies the phototropic glass and sun-angle glyphs as resources, and its emptiness vs. resilience frames the central question. The setting pressures Kael's understanding and charges the closure ("less abandoned, holding its breath in the memory of care"). Setup, development, and payoff gates met. Strong causal linkage and specificity; the scorched wasteland contrast heightens the stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "as chimney smoke flattens" anchors the opening and signals dusk; Kael must align the glass with "the day's final, precise angle of light." The vision occurs "as the sun's last ray vanished." Setup and payoff gates met; middle tracking is implicit. The clock tightens the window but does not force a tactical trade-off or alter Kael's moves under pressure; time functions more as atmosphere than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Kael's motivation—understanding why the oasis resists change—is stated early ("His motivation was not escape but understanding") and drives his actions (tracing glyphs, aligning the glass, seeking the vision). The vision answers his question and shifts his purpose to embodying that understanding. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. However, the motivation is not dramatized as a conflicted want vs. cost; it reads as a pure intellectual quest without friction or competing desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Sharp gentleness" is named and demonstrated early (Kael's potter's touch, handling the glass "as a friend to be honored") and modulates through the vision's intensity. The tone charges the closure image ("reverence," the bow, carrying the oasis within). Setup and payoff gates met; middle development is consistent. The tone is coherent but remains largely static—gentle throughout—rather than showing a turn or deepening under real pressure.</comment>
