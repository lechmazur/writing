<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is concrete and his method (peripheral vision, reflective diagnosis) constrains his approach, but the story lacks genuine struggle—every observation leads smoothly to the next insight without misstep or cost. The final repair feels inevitable rather than earned through contradictory impulses or blind spots. Internal conflict is absent; Kael never wrestles with doubt, error, or competing desires. The character reads as a vehicle for the concept rather than a flawed individual under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: dawn → mid-morning → noon → dusk observations build density and shift the beam angles, culminating in the echo harvest. However, the closure lacks visible cost—Kael succeeds without forfeiting anything on the page, and the final image (echoes safe, heart stocked) asserts resonance rather than dramatizing a reweighting with felt price. The Resonant Reconfiguration (if intended) reads as declared wonder rather than pressure-charged poise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The marble cavern's geometry directly enables the diagnostic method: reflection angles, dewdrop magnification, shadow in the pool all constrain and guide Kael's approach. Sensory details (slanted light, hairline fracture, subterranean vibration) are filtered through his peripheral focus and integrated into action. The setting charges the final harvest beat by providing the acoustic resonators and unique frequency. Micro-setting (timer on altar, reflective walls) functions as constraint and tool, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—repair the timer to harvest echoes—is signaled early and drives each observational beat. However, escalation is weak: each time-of-day observation smoothly reveals the next clue without genuine reversal, risk, or tradeoff. The misalignment discovery (line 182) is presented as insight rather than a turn that forecloses options. No visible price is paid; Kael's success feels procedural. The accumulative lens permits steady intensification, but the final beat lacks the felt cost required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme—reason cradling wonder—emerges organically from the mechanism-repair-as-reverence arc and the peripheral/reflective method. The closing image (locksmith of lost wonders, heart-cellar stocked with echoes) offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing. The wounded-season motif recurs purposefully (opening, closing) and reweights fragility. Subtext operates in the contrast between precision and awe. The piece resists neat binaries and earns its quiet closure through accumulated particulars, though the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("reason had not extinguished wonder—it had cradled it").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single POV, stable distance, and a consistent perceptual signature (peripheral gaze, meticulous observation) anchor the voice. Diction is controlled and character-specific: "harvest of echoes," "cellar of reason," "wounded season" build a coherent idiom. However, elevated register occasionally clashes with urgent moments—lines 283 ("proving that insight often dwells at the edges of sight") and 325 veer into essayistic summary. No head-hopping, clean mechanics, and purposeful psychic distance shifts (dawn to dusk) maintain coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies across the dawn-to-dusk structure, and sensory detail is concrete. However, paraphrase loops appear: lines 269 and 283 restate the peripheral-insight theme, and the final two paragraphs (315–338) recycle "echoes safe," "cellar," and "wonder" without advancing pressure. Template cadence in the observation beats (dawn/mid-morning/noon/dusk) reads mechanical. Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff (e.g., "liquid starlight," "swirled into glass vials"), applying −0.5 for overwriting in a non-crisis beat and −0.3 for the paraphrase loop.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of locksmithing, echo-harvesting, and peripheral diagnosis is specific and non-obvious, avoiding direct tropes. The wounded-season frame and time-based reflection method add freshness. However, the emotional arc (reverent craftsman succeeds without friction) follows a familiar template, and the final image's metaphorical tidiness (wonder safely stored) lacks the bold risk or counter-pressure that would elevate originality. The piece commits fully to its premise but does not transform it through unexpected moral calculus or lived cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Kael appears early (line 1), drives every observational beat (dawn sketch, mid-morning gear sequence, noon shadow insight, afternoon pin-crafting), and executes the final harvest. His reflective nature constrains method (peripheral focus) across multiple turns. However, his choices feel procedural rather than conflicted; no decision alters tactics under competing pressure. Present in setup, development, and payoff, but causal pressure is smooth rather than costly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The broken timer is introduced early (line 76), handled across four distinct beats (dawn shadow reveals sheared pin, mid-morning dewdrop magnifies gears, noon pool-shadow shows correct function ghost, dusk insertion completes repair), and its successful repair directly enables the echo harvest at closure. Each interaction advances diagnosis and solution. Irreplaceability is high—removing the timer would collapse the plot. The element shapes stakes and closure but lacks a visible cost tied specifically to the mechanism itself.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Echo harvesting frames the dominant stake (signaled in title and line 62) and delivers the final image (vials sealed, echoes safe). The concept shapes Kael's motivation and the cavern's purpose. However, it remains thematic and procedural; the harvest itself (lines 218–240) is described rather than dramatized with resistance or tradeoff. The concept enables rather than constrains, and its cost is asserted ("fragile voice") rather than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Peripheral focus is seeded early (line 28) and constrains method across all diagnostic beats: catching distorted shadow (line 124), observing reflections and ripples (lines 138, 174). The trait enables every key turn. However, no visible tradeoff or price is shown—peripheral vision never causes him to miss something crucial or forces a costly workaround. Present in setup, development, and closure participation, but cost linkage is absent.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Reverse-engineering is stated as method (line 98) and executed across the dawn-to-dusk observation sequence, culminating in the misalignment discovery (line 182) and pin-crafting (line 192). The action shapes all major turns and is irreplaceable. However, it is not tested—every step succeeds smoothly. Present in setup, drives multiple beats, and contributes to closure, but lacks on-page friction or cost beyond time passage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The reflection-angle method is signaled early (line 110) and drives four distinct beats: dawn shadow on wall (line 124), mid-morning dewdrop rainbow (line 154), noon pool ripple (line 174), and afternoon revelations guide pin-crafting (line 192). Each angle shift narrows the diagnosis and enables the final repair. Mechanics matter and constrain; the method is indispensable to plot logic and closure. Cost is implicit (time, patience) but not dramatized as a tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The marble cavern appears in the opening, its reflective geometry enables the entire diagnostic method (walls as screens, pool as mirror), and its acoustic properties (resonators tuned to stone frequency, line 218) directly enable the harvest at closure. The setting constrains choice (no direct scrutiny works, only reflection) and charges the final image. Irreplaceable: removing the cavern's specific properties would break the plot. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The wounded season is seeded early (line 46) and bookends the piece (closing line 300), but the timeframe's pressure is thematic rather than tactical. The dawn-to-dusk progression structures observation beats but does not tighten decisions—Kael works methodically without a live clock forcing tradeoffs. The lull enables clarity (line 62) but does not constrain or cost. Lyric reprise reweights fragility but lacks causal bite in the middle.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation is stated clearly (line 90) and frames the harvest goal. It drives setup and closure (sealing vials, stocking the heart-cellar). However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or costs. No friction between wonder and reason appears on the page; Kael never wrestles with doubt or sacrifice. The desire is consistent but lacks the embodied tension or tradeoff required for higher scores.</comment>
