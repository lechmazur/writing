<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and she makes choices under pressure, but internal contradictions remain largely sequential rather than simultaneous. The phobia is declared but never embodied in moment-to-moment perception or physical degradation; it's told as "screamed to flee" without the claustrophobic sensory collapse that would charge her decision to stay. The final epiphany ("vulnerability is power") arrives as label-speak rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Lily functions primarily as a plot catalyst rather than applying pressure that forces Elara into trade-offs with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive promptly and the causal lens is clear through the midpoint. The closure lands on the page—Elara modifies the shell, lures Silas away, and embraces vulnerability—but the cost remains asserted rather than viscerally felt: no forfeited path, no visible trade-off, only the declaration "we were brave together." The shell modification lacks mechanical specificity (how does etching a reverse star-path alter a tracker signal?) and Silas's defeat happens off-page, softening the decisive change. One meaningful tightening occurs when the journal reveals the shell's function, but the final image reconfigures options more through statement than dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The rusted library is vivid and returns at closure, but it functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining choice. The oxidation trails guide discovery in one beat, and the vent provides a hiding spot, yet neither imposes a felt cost or alters Elara's tactics under pressure. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the roof climb and Silas's simultaneous search below stretch plausibility. The micro-setting (cast, shell, iron shard) is present but not leveraged to force trade-offs or charge the final image beyond decoration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—protecting Lily from manipulation—is signaled early and drives Elara's choices. One meaningful tightening occurs when the journal reveals the tracker, raising the cost of inaction. However, the resolution depends on a coincidentally successful decoy rather than a protagonist trade-off with visible price; Silas chases the signal and vanishes, robbing the climax of earned consequence. The phobia is declared but never forces a micro-choice with felt cost, and the final "vulnerability is power" claim is asserted rather than tested through competing goods or unavoidable harms.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme "vulnerability is power" is declared multiple times rather than emerging from particulars, most egregiously in the final dialogue where Elara articulates the thesis directly. The rusted library and stars recur but function as atmospheric bookends rather than accumulating new meaning through character choice. The closing assertion—"truth forged in shared courage"—reads as prompt echo instead of a resonant, non-literal answer derived from specific scene pressure. No earned wisdom arises from concrete trade-offs; the epiphany is granted rather than won.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV is stable and third-limited throughout, with no head-hopping. Elara's perceptual signature is present in early beats ("feverish betrayal," "skeletal ruin"), though it flattens under peak pressure when clarity would benefit from sensory collapse. Lily's dialogue carries age-appropriate simplicity, but Elara's internal voice drifts toward elevated register ("trembling certainty," "forging a trembling certainty") that clashes with crisis idiom. The closing dialogue—"No, sweetheart. *We* were brave together. That is the real power."—reads as thematic summary rather than lived speech, and the phrase "trembling certainty" recurs as a tic rather than a voice-specific rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops and template cadences cluster in high-pressure beats: "transformative betrayal" appears three times; "trembling certainty" twice; "firmly adaptive" twice as label without embodiment. The phrase "The transformative betrayal deepened—he had weaponized his late wife's cherished object to control his daughter—but vulnerability became their compass" is exposition summary at the climax, not scene pressure. Filter verbs ("her eyes traced," "watched Silas storm") dull immediacy. Overwriting appears in "feverish betrayal still scorching her veins beneath the indifferent stars" where elevated diction clashes with urgency. Paragraph-cut test: multiple beats restate "vulnerability" and "betrayal" without adding pressure, totaling ~−1.0 cumulative in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The core premise—stunt double exploited via engineered phobia, now protecting a child with a whispering tracker shell—assembles multiple high-concept prompts without transforming them through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The DNA-reveal inciting incident, the whispering seashell halves, the cipher on a cast, and the rusted library under stars read as checklist fulfillment rather than inevitable synthesis. The final turn (etching a reverse path to alter a signal) introduces convenient mechanics late without prior constraint, and the emotional arc—vulnerability declared as power—could transfer unchanged to any mentor-betrayal template. No proximity echoes detected, but the transformation test fails: swap names and the structure remains generic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's phobia is declared in two beats (line 102: "Her phobia screamed to flee"; line 255: "She had not conquered her phobia") but never constrains an on-page choice with visible cost. The stunt-double backstory frames the betrayal but does not shape tactics or the final image. Present by setup, mentioned at closure, but the middle development is ornamental: the phobia does not force a trade-off during the decryption, the climb, or the lure. The character makes decisions, but the specific phobia-ridden trait is swappable with any fear or hesitation. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development that alters options; deduct −0.4 for label-only use in peak beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The seashell half appears in four distinct beats: Lily clutches it (line 76), Elara learns it's a tracker (line 170), she modifies it with the etched reverse path (line 209), and places it in the vent to lure Silas (line 218). It enables the climactic tactic and is causally active at closure. However, the mechanics of modification (how etching alters a signal) remain vague, reducing irreplaceability. Strong beat involvement (+0.9), closure linkage (+1.0), causal pressure (+0.8), but modest specificity due to unexplained function. Early signal present; all three gates met. Scores in the 7.0–8.4 essential band but lacks the mechanical precision and felt cost for ≥8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Transformative betrayal is introduced at setup (line 34: Silas engineered her stunt career to exploit her phobia) and recurs thematically (line 178: "transformative betrayal deepened"), shaping Elara's motivation to protect Lily. However, the concept functions primarily as emotional backstory rather than altering on-page tactics or the final image. The climactic outwit depends on the shell cipher, not on Elara's processing of the betrayal with a visible trade-off. Present at setup and echoed at closure, but middle development is thematic rather than causal. Scores mid-band for shaping one key turn (the decision to stay) with modest cost; deduct −0.5 for summary-only treatment in the climax (line 178).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Firmly adaptive" is declared twice (line 143: "her firmly adaptive nature honed by years of reading stunt environments"; line 282: "She was firmly adaptive") but never demonstrated through on-page action with visible cost. The trait is told as a skill set rather than constraining or enabling a choice under pressure. The decryption sequence credits this attribute, yet no scene shows Elara adapting tactics mid-crisis or sacrificing one approach for another. Present at setup and closure, but the middle beat is label-only. Cap at 4.6 for missing development; deduct −0.3 for label-speak at closure (line 282). Swappable with "resourceful" or "clever" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The outwit action drives two major beats: decrypting the cipher (lines 129–156) and modifying the shell to lure Silas (lines 195–218). Both turns depend on Elara's analysis and decisiveness, and the climax traces directly to this action. However, the mechanics lack specificity (how does etching a reverse star-path alter a tracker's signal?), and Silas's off-page defeat dilutes the causal payoff. Early signal when the cipher appears; strong beat involvement (+0.9); closure linkage (+1.0); causal pressure (+0.8). Scores in the 7.0–8.4 band but modest specificity and the off-page resolution prevent ≥7.0. Deduct −0.7 for summary-only climax resolution.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The method is signaled at setup (line 129: crayon stars and "rust tears" on Lily's cast) and drives the middle decryption sequence (lines 143–170), enabling the discovery of the journal and the tracker revelation. The mechanics are present—Elara reads the cast, follows oxidation trails—but the specificity is modest; the "reverse star-path" modification (line 209) is unexplained and feels convenient. Two distinct beats (decryption, modification); causal pressure modest; closure linkage present but indirect (the modified shell, not the cast itself). All three gates met; scores in 5.0–6.9 band for shaping one key turn with modest irreplaceability. Deduct −0.4 for swappability (any cipher or map would serve).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The rusted library is introduced at setup (line 48: "skeletal ruin of forgotten knowledge under the open sky") and returns at closure (line 273: "no longer a tomb of lies, but a cradle of resilience"). The oxidation trails guide one discovery beat (line 156), and the vent provides a hiding spot for the shell (line 218), but the setting does not impose a felt constraint or alter Elara's tactics under pressure. The roof climb offers spatial variation but no trade-off. Early signal strong (+0.6); beat involvement modest (+0.4); closure linkage present as thematic reprise (+0.5); causal pressure low. Scores in 5.0–6.9 for shaping one turn with a lyric reprise that reweights meaning modestly. Deduct −0.3 for primarily atmospheric function.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe is signaled at setup (line 34: "Hours ago, the DNA results had shattered her reality") and frames Elara's emotional state, but time does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page. The narrative unfolds in a continuous present with one transition (headlights arrive, line 184), yet no live clock pressures choices or forecloses options. Dawn arrives at closure (line 314) but functions as atmospheric bookend rather than deadline. Present at setup and closure; middle development is ambient. Cap at 4.6 for missing development that alters options; deduct −0.3 for ornamental use. The urgency is declared but not dramatized through time scarcity.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The motivation is declared at setup (line 102: "she would protect this child from the same manipulation she endured") and returns at closure (line 296: "vulnerability is power"). Two beats involve this desire: the decision to stay and decode the cipher, and the final assertion of shared courage. However, the motivation is told rather than tested through competing wants or visible costs. No on-page friction between Elara's phobia-driven impulse to flee and her protective impulse creates a trade-off; the phobia is mentioned but not embodied as a live obstacle. Present at setup and closure; middle development is modest. Deduct −0.6 for label-speak at closure ("That is the real power") and −0.4 for lack of dramatized conflict between wants and costs. Scores mid-band for shaping one key choice with modest friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Trembling certainty is present at setup (line 102: "forging a trembling certainty") and recurs at closure (line 296: "her voice steady with trembling certainty"). The tone modulates across beats—early fear, mid-sequence focus, final embrace—and the paradox charges the ending image. However, the phrase appears as a repeated label rather than emerging through rhythm and diction under pressure; the tone is declared rather than embodied in sentence cadence or sensory collapse. Present at setup and closure with modest beat involvement; the reprise reweights meaning but lacks the rhythmic control for ≥7.0. Deduct −0.4 for template repetition and −0.3 for label-only use in peak beats. Scores in 5.0–6.9 for a purposeful lyric reprise that charges the final image modestly.</comment>
