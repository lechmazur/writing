<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's transformation from silence to song is motivated by accumulated grief and the carousel discovery, but the progression feels compressed—twelve years of muteness broken in a single beat without sufficient embodied struggle. The "quietly persistent grace" and carpenter's identity are told more than shown constraining choices. Internal contradiction is present (love/loss, silence/possibility) but the obsidian eyes "softening" and wood feeling "alive" drift toward convenient magic rather than earned psychological shift. The final peace "settling over her like a warm shroud" lands cleanly but the path there smooths over the cost of voice recovery.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with elements of Situational (discovery-driven). Orientation anchors by ~66 words (Elara, coastal highway, carousel carpenter, daughter's loss). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to Charged Poise): she moves from sealed silence to voice and commitment to return, forecloses the grief-paralysis path. Cost is visible—twelve years of silence broken, peace earned through song—and the final image of her smile reweights prior material. One meaningful deepening occurs when she sings and the halo responds. Causality is mostly clean but the "wrong turn" coincidence launches the sequence without prior setup, and the carousel's magical responsiveness (eyes softening, wood alive) introduces late unmarked rules that convenience the resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting details are vivid and selective: "ivy cradling its silent wheels," "stained-glass dome," "walnut flanks." The abandoned train and hidden carriage function as micro-setting that enables discovery and constrains Elara's choice (isolated space for private song). Wind bells and misting hush recur to frame the timeframe and charge the final departure. Spatial choreography is clear (truck, carriage door, kneeling, tracing). The "hidden oasis" valley reveal at the end supplies thematic resonance but does not constrain a prior choice, so setting pressure peaks mid-story rather than at closure. Sensory detail favors the visual; tactile and auditory are present but less developed under stress.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Elara's internal paralysis (silence as void vs. possibility). Pressure accumulates through discovery, memory of Lily, and the halo fragment's "latent memory," tightening to the decision to sing. One meaningful turn: singing breaks twelve years of silence and "mends brass and soul alike." Agency is present (she chooses to sing, to place the fragment, to return tomorrow) with visible cost (shaking frame, voice unused for twelve years). Escalation is textural—density and sensory detail increase—but the magical responsiveness of the halo and horse (glowing, eyes softening) resolves the repair without requiring a second difficult choice. The coincidental "wrong turn" complicates setup but does not resolve, so situational allowance applies.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme: silence as fertile ground, renewal through voice and memory. The halo repair and Elara's arc enact this without overt statement until "The silence was no longer a void; it was fertile ground waiting for song"—a near-thematic echo that borders on summary. Motifs (wind bells, misting hush, whispering gleam, halo) recur and accumulate meaning, charging the final image of her smile. The carousel horse's obsidian eyes and Lily's memory provide specific anchors. However, the ending drifts toward tidy resolution: peace "settled," heart "clear," promise "humming"—emotional satisfaction that smooths complexity. The central question (can silence become possibility?) receives a resonant but somewhat packaged answer without lingering ambiguity or competing interpretation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV, stable psychic distance. Narrative voice is lyric and controlled: "hands that spoke fluently in wood grain," "ghost of calliope music in stillness." Diction is elevated but consistent, matching the meditative register. Free indirect style is clean in memory and reflection. No dialogue, so voice distinction does not apply. Perceptual signature is present: Elara sees "potential in the peeling paint" and hears "blueprint for renewal in abandonment." Purposeful compression in metaphor ("voice a sealed chamber," "misting hush felt different") supports atmosphere. One minor slip: "a warm shroud" in the penultimate sequence mixes comfort/death imagery without clear purpose. Rhythm modulates appropriately from descriptive opening to active peak (singing) to reflective close.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is textured and rhythmically varied, with vivid images ("ivy cradling," "sunlight fracturing into a whispering gleam"). Information density is high in the discovery sequence. However, pervasive figurative density in nearly every sentence ("pearlescent veil," "walnut flanks," "reverent dance," "compass," "cradle of renewal," "symphony," "fertile ground") overloads the register without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering −0.5 for density without escalation. Template cadence in the final third: "She would return… She started… Driving away…" uses repeated sentence stems without variation. Minor paraphrase loop: paragraphs describing "misting hush" and "quietly persistent" echo conceptually. Stock metaphor: "warm shroud" for peace. Figurative coherence mostly holds, but "shroud" (death) for peace introduces mild contradiction. Accumulation: −0.7 in Q7 for density + template + loop, with artifacts in the final third disallowing 9+ globally per the Text Artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Core premise—silent carpenter finds carousel and restoration in abandoned circus train—blends familiar redemption-through-craft and magical-realism healing tropes without a sharp fresh angle. The "wrong turn to hidden oasis" and singing-repairs-magic-object follow template fairy-tale logic. Specificity in Elara's carpentry, the stained-glass dome, and wind bells adds texture, but the emotional arc (grief → discovery → voice → peace) and closure image (smile, clear heart) follow well-worn contours. Transformation test: the plot would function unchanged with different names, objects, and setting (sculptor finds statue, potter finds kiln). Risk-taking is minimal; the piece executes its lyric mode competently but retreats into safety (magical responsiveness, tidy peace) rather than confronting ambiguity or unresolved cost. No close echo of famous lines, but the synthesis feels derivative rather than inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara present throughout; her choices drive key turns: she approaches the train, pushes open the door, sifts for the fragment, sings, places the fragment, decides to return. Setup by paragraph 1, development in discovery and singing beats, payoff in final commitment. Causal pressure: singing is the climactic choice that "mends brass and soul." Cost: twelve years of silence broken, shaking frame. The carpenter identity is told more than shown; we see her "eyes seeing potential" and "carpenter's fingers sifting" but no on-page carpentry constraining a choice. Her silence functions as premise and is broken, but the arc is more observation-then-epiphany than decision-that-alters-tactics. Two distinct beats (singing, placing fragment) plus closure participation. Swappable with "silent sculptor" or "silent musician" with minor edits; specificity of carpentry does not shape the resolution.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Halo fragment introduced at ~110 words (mid-story), handled in three beats: discovered while sifting, held aloft (glows and pulses), placed into circlet at closure. Development: its glow and "latent memory" cue Elara's memory of Lily and motivate singing. Payoff: placement "settled with a soft click, whole," completing the repair and Elara's arc. Causal pressure: the fragment's presence and incompleteness create the repair task that frames her vocal act. Closure linkage strong. Cost: the fragment's restoration is the visible proof of her internal healing. Specificity: "crescent-shaped," "tarnished yet humming," "whispering gleam" give it unique properties. Deduction for late first appearance (−0.3) and minor swappability (a missing carousel gear or jewel could substitute with edits, −0.2). Strong beat involvement and closure payoff elevate the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Misting hush" is introduced early (~40 words) and recurs: "profound misting hush," "misting hush felt different," "final note faded into the misting hush," "mist lifted." Setup clear. Development: the hush creates atmosphere and sets the tone for Elara's introspection, but it does not constrain a choice—she could discover and sing regardless of mist. Payoff: the mist lifts at the end, symbolically marking her internal clearing, but this is thematic resonance rather than causal pressure. The concept is ornamental, enriching mood without altering tactics or options. It appears in multiple beats but as description, not as a force that shapes decisions. Lyric reprise reweights the opening hush, earning mid-band placement, but the concept does not drive a key turn.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Quietly persistent" appears as a label in paragraph 6 ("Moving with quietly persistent grace") and again in paragraph 19 ("quietly persistent act of healing"). Setup mid-early. Development: the trait is told, not shown constraining action—Elara's approach and singing are dramatized, but we do not see persistence tested against an obstacle or cost. The phrase recurs thematically at closure but does not enable or constrain a specific on-page choice. No visible tradeoff tied to persistence versus another impulse. The attribute is generic (replaceable with "patient" or "steady") and functions as narrator commentary rather than embodied character pressure. Two mentions in different beats prevent ornamental-only score, but lack of causal pressure and swappability cap the grade.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Singing introduced at ~161 words as the climactic action: "began to sing." Development: her voice "wavered then strengthened," fills the chamber, causes the halo to glow and the horse's eyes to soften, "mending brass and soul alike." Payoff: the song's completion ("final note faded") triggers the wind bells' "pure, sealing chime" and enables her to place the fragment. Setup via Lily's memory of the carousel and Elara's sealed voice. Causal pressure strong: singing is the means of repair and internal breakthrough. Cost visible: "voice, unused for twelve years, wavered then strengthened," "breath that shook her frame." Irreplaceable: speaking or humming would not carry the same thematic or emotional weight. Three distinct beats (decision, performance, completion) plus closure shaping. Minor deduction for magical responsiveness convenience (−0.3), but action is indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Wrong turn" signaled early (~28 words): "landslide… forced a wrong turn onto a narrow, overgrown service road." "Hidden oasis" revealed late (~248 words): "sun-dappled valley blooming with wildflowers." Setup clear for the turn; the oasis appears only at the end. Development: the wrong turn is the causal mechanism that delivers Elara to the train, enabling the entire discovery sequence. Payoff: the oasis reveal is thematic (renewal, beauty) but does not alter a final choice—Elara has already decided to return. The method is functional and necessary to the setup but does not shape attempts or tactics beyond initiating the scenario. It operates as a fairy-tale convenience (coincidence delivers protagonist to magic site) rather than a contested means. Causal pressure at setup, no pressure at closure. Beat involvement: one (the turn itself). Swappable with "car breaks down" or "follows a sign" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Abandoned circus train introduced early (~52 words) and detailed: "ghost of crimson and gold stranded on rusted tracks, ivy cradling its silent wheels." The final carriage houses the carousel horse and becomes the sacred space for Elara's song. Setup and development strong: the train's isolation and decay mirror Elara's grief; its hidden carriage enables private discovery and vocal act. Payoff: the carriage is "transformed—a sanctuary of hope," and Elara will return "with tools and voice, ready to restore." Causal pressure: the setting constrains her experience (no witnesses, intimate space for song) and supplies the physical object (halo, horse) that frames her task. Closure linkage: she leaves the train but it anchors her future commitment. Specificity: "stained-glass dome," "walnut flanks," "groaning door." Three beats (approach, discovery, departure). Minor swappability (abandoned mansion or chapel could substitute, −0.2), but the circus imagery and carousel are tightly braided with theme.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Inside the chime of wind bells" introduced at ~66 words and recurs at ~239 ("inside the chime of wind bells") and ~284 ("wind bells chimed a farewell"). Setup clear. Development: the bells mark a sacred, bounded timeframe, but no ticking clock or deadline pressures Elara's choices—she discovers, remembers, and sings at her own pace. The chime is atmospheric rather than constraining. Payoff: the bells answer her song with "one pure, sealing chime" and later chime farewell, providing thematic punctuation but not altering her decision. The timeframe is poetic and symbolic, not causal. Elara's actions would proceed identically without the bells. Two distinct beats (opening frame, closure echo) earn mid-low band, but lack of pressure on tactics and generic "sacred time" function (swappable with "golden hour" or "held breath," −0.3) limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Motivation stated explicitly at ~86 words: "to interpret silence as possibility—to hear the ghost of calliope music in stillness, the blueprint for renewal in abandonment." Recurs at ~153 ("To interpret silence as possibility demanded courage") and implicitly in final paragraph ("silence was no longer a void; it was fertile ground"). Setup early, development via Lily's memory and the halo discovery, payoff in singing and commitment to return. Friction: the motivation is told rather than dramatized in conflicting impulses—Elara's sealed voice versus her desire is declared but not shown in a moment of internal contradiction or visible tradeoff. Cost: singing enacts the motivation with cost (shaking, unused voice), but the decision feels singular rather than conflicted. The motivation drives the arc but functions more as thematic lens than as desire tested against competing want or fear. Two beats (stated, enacted) plus closure echo. Label-only presentation and lack of on-page friction (−0.4) prevent higher score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Whispering gleam" introduced at ~100 words (sunlight fracturing), recurs at ~127 (halo fragment pulses), ~182 (intensifies during song), and ~254 (glows steady within her). Setup mid-early. Development: the gleam marks magical responsiveness and inner transformation, modulating from external (dome light, halo glow) to internal (steady certainty). Payoff: the gleam is internalized, charging her final state. Tone coherence: the piece sustains a lyric, meditative register throughout, with the gleam anchoring wonder and quiet magic. The gleam does not alter tactics but recurs as a charged image that reweights the ending. Four beats across the arc. Swappability: "soft glow" or "gentle radiance" could replace with minor edits (−0.3). The tone supports theme but does not pressure choices. Lyric reprise and closure linkage elevate the score into mid-band; lack of causal force and moderate specificity prevent higher placement.</comment>
