<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clearly established—debunker seeking truth—and the final renunciation is earned by on-page discovery. However, interiority leans toward abstraction ("crystalline moment," "profound truth") rather than embodied contradiction, and the arc from skeptic to guardian feels linearly executed without messier impulses acting simultaneously. The shift reads as epiphany more than struggle, weakening the sense of genuine internal conflict during the peak choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page: Elara's decision to rebury the letters and protect the myth is a Resonant Reconfiguration (renunciation) with visible cost—she abandons her life's work of debunking. The causal lens holds throughout; discovery of the letters → reconstruction → understanding → choice to conceal. One meaningful tightening occurs when she grasps the stillpoint's fragility. Orientation is clear early. The cost is legible in her becoming "silent sentinel," forgoing revelation for guardianship.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The orchard's impossible calm within the radiation storm provides vivid, purposeful contrast. Micro-details—dew on spiderwebs, earthworms, moss arrangement—constrain Elara's interpretation and guide her to the titanium container. The wasteland setting pressures the choice at closure: revealing truth would invite exploitation. Spatial choreography is clean. The apple's fall at the key moment charges the final image, establishing the setting as constraint and answer.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—excavate truth vs. preserve sanctuary—is signaled early and escalates through discovery. The tightening occurs when Elara realizes debunking would destroy the stillpoint; her agency (reburial) forecloses her debunker path with visible cost. The moral calculus between truth and protection is sharp. One meaningful deepening drives the closure under the causal lens, and the price (carrying the secret alone, abandoning her mission) is unmistakable on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—truth as guardianship rather than revelation—emerges from concrete action (reburial) and image (the falling apple, buried container) without thesis statement. The stillpoint functions as both physical location and philosophical principle, tightly woven. The final image offers a resonant answer: some truths protect rather than expose. Minor slip: "balance could be nurtured" and "life...could bloom" veer toward abstraction in the closing lines, slightly diluting the otherwise earned complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is present in cataloging contradictions and methodical patience. Diction remains largely controlled, though phrases like "crystalline moment" and "covenant with the future" drift toward elevated register inconsistent with observational rigor. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the reconstruction sequence. No head-hopping. Filter verbs ("felt," "looked") are minimal and voice-motivated. The prose reflects urgency and focus, though a few ornamental constructions ("ochre storm scouring") slightly disrupt momentum.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance discovery or stakes. However, several paraphrase loops and synonym variations appear: "excavate truth from comfortable lies" echoed in "benevolent deception," "protective myth," "sacred falsehood," and "necessary secret" across beats without added pressure. Template cadence in the final third: "She would become...," "She had come...," "The flawed diamond stayed...." Figurative language ("ochre storm scouring," "covenant with the future") occasionally overreaches. Clarity remains strong; no causality breaks. Deductions total approximately −1.3 for loops and cadence artifacts, capping potential.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The reversal—debunker becoming myth's guardian—offers a fresh angle on "truth vs. lie" material. The stillpoint as geological + philosophical synthesis is specific and non-obvious. The flawed diamond as deliberate regulator rather than curse transforms the trope. Execution is committed and the moral calculus avoids tidy binaries. However, the "fragile sanctuary threatened by revelation" frame echoes familiar templates; transformation relies more on competent synthesis than bold structural risk. No derivative penalties, but ceiling is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Debunker role drives setup (she arrives to investigate), middle development (methodical reconstruction), and closure (choice to protect rather than expose). Her observational skill catalogs contradictions, narrows to the container, and her skepticism is tested at the peak choice. The trait constrains her default instinct (debunk) and forces renunciation with cost. Present across all three gates; causal pressure and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The diamond is introduced early (setup) as rumored curse, reweighted mid-story as regulator, and mentioned in closure ("stayed buried"). It appears in at least two beats: initial legend and final sketch reveal. However, it is never physically handled or used on the page; all interaction is textual/conceptual via the letters. Swappable with another artifact (crystal, device) without structural collapse. Lyric reprise at closure, but lack of tactile engagement limits integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The stillpoint is introduced early as legend, developed through Dr. Thorne's letters (geological strata canceling radiation), and directly shapes closure—Elara's choice hinges on protecting its fragile equilibrium. It constrains tactics (reburial to deter scavengers) and charges the final image. The dual nature (physical + philosophical) is specific and irreplaceable. Causal pressure, closure linkage, and beat involvement across all three gates are strong; cost is tied to its fragility.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Sharply observant" is signaled early and enables the discovery (cataloging contradictions, spotting the moss depression). It appears in setup and middle development. However, the trait functions primarily as competence rather than constraint with cost; no moment where hyper-observation creates a trade-off or penalty. It shapes one key beat (finding the container) but does not return with reweighted meaning or complicate the closure. Mid-band for functional but limited causal role.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Intuit" appears at the climactic moment when Elara grasps the stillpoint's dual nature. It is signaled ("She intuited the profound truth") and drives the peak turn from discovery to decision. The action is specific to her processing style and enables closure. However, it could be replaced with "understood," "realized," or "grasped" without major structural loss. Present in two gates (middle insight, closure participation) with causal pressure, but moderate specificity limits indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Reassembling shredded letters is introduced early (titanium container discovery), dominates the middle (methodical reconstruction beat), and delivers the key information that shapes closure. The method is specific, tactile, and irreplaceable—no other mechanism could provide the fragmented revelation or mirror the theme of piecing together truth. Mechanics matter: "fragment by fragment" details the process. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and beat involvement across all three gates with high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The orchard is present from the opening, provides immediate contrasts that drive investigation (calm within storm, life amid fallout), and the stillpoint's location beneath the roots directly shapes closure tactics (rebury deeper, weave vines). Micro-setting (moss, roots, falling apple) alters Elara's actions and charges the final image. Environmental detail constrains choice (exploitation risk if revealed) and supplies resources (protective field). All three gates; strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"After the Liquidation" anchors backstory (fifty years prior) and establishes the orchard's duration. It frames the legend's persistence and Dr. Thorne's historical role. However, time does not tighten present decisions or create a live clock; the investigation proceeds without temporal pressure. The element shapes context but does not alter tactics or escalate stakes on the page. Functional setup but no middle or closure participation; mid-band for background role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation ("excavate truth from comfortable lies") is stated early, tested throughout (she discovers the lie is protective), and inverted at closure (truth becomes guardianship). The desire drives investigation beats and creates friction at the peak choice—her life's work conflicts with the sanctuary's need. Cost is visible: she must abandon debunking to preserve the myth. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage across all three gates; dramatized conflict between stated want and final renunciation.</comment>
