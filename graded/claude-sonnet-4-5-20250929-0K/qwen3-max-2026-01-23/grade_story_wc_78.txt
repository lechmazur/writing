<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Leeward's motivation is clearly stated but never tested by contradictory impulses in scene. His actions flow mechanically from premise to execution without internal friction or micro-choices under genuine pressure. The final satisfaction ("quiet peace settling deep in his bones") reads as declared relief rather than earned cost. His grandmother's aphorism arrives as wisdom-dispensing rather than emerging from embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates ritual beats (sketch, dub, sketch, dub) toward a final transformation, achieving a Resonant Reconfiguration when the storm "convinced to sing" reweights the opening threat. Closure lands on the page with conceptual cost (the storm's energy channeled, not defeated). However, the escalation reads as additive description rather than narrowing options or raising felt stakes; each dub simply layers another note without friction or trade-off, weakening the tightening requirement for the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating orchard, driftwood circle, and xylophone mallet constrain Leeward's ritual choices and charge the final image when he tucks the mallet away. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through his prophetic attention (cirrus clouds, salt air, wet wood scent). Spatial choreography remains clear across the ritual circuit. The micro-setting (orchard as sanctified stage) functions well at this length, meeting the 9+ quick test's constraint requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (orchard survival against the leeward tide) is signaled early. However, escalation reads as ornamental layering rather than narrowing options or forcing trade-offs. Each dub succeeds without friction; no live option is foreclosed, no tactic altered by emerging cost. The storm's transformation into "soaring, complex chord" arrives as aesthetic description rather than earned reversal with visible price, keeping the score below the 7.0 gate for felt consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme (obstacles as instruments, force yielding to song) emerges from Leeward's ritual particulars and the grandmother's aphorism. The final image of the storm "turned into a lullaby" reweights the opening threat without overt moralizing. However, the aphorism risks thematic echo, and the resolution feels conceptually tidy rather than embracing ambiguity or counter-readings. The piece invites reflection but avoids the complexity that would lift it into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable; perceptual signature (cloud-reading, ritual-focused attention) remains consistent. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("restless euphony," "soaring, complex chord") that feels imposed rather than character-particular under stress. No dialogue present to judge. Syntax varies purposefully but leans ornamental in peak beats ("erupted note was a wave of resonance meeting fury not with resistance, but invitation"), slightly dulling immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade the ritual sequence: "fractal generating" appears four times with minimal variation; "sketched resonance" and "dub" cycle without advancing new information. Template cadence in paragraphs 10–13 ("He knelt…etched…raised…performed," "Moving east…sketched…struck") flattens propulsion. Figurative density ("thread of intention," "audible lattice," "wave of resonance") clusters without payoff in the climax, triggering overwriting penalties. Apply −1.0 cumulative for loops and template runs touching the closure third, disallowing 9+ globally per artifact rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The floating-orchard premise and sketched-resonance ritual offer fresh visual texture. However, the execution follows a predictable arc: prophet reads omens, performs ritual, ritual succeeds without complication. The storm-as-collaborator twist lacks groundwork in prior friction or cost. Emotional beats (watching ancestral coast vanish, grandmother's wisdom) read as template backstory rather than lived particulars that transform the frame. Swapping names and setting would leave the emotional arc largely unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Leeward's choices (kneeling, sketching, dubbing tree by tree) drive every beat and shape the closure when he tucks the mallet away. His interpretation of accelerating cloud movements alters his etching tactics mid-ritual. However, these are execution choices within a predetermined plan rather than high-cost decisions that foreclose competing paths, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The xylophone mallet appears in setup (withdrawn from coat), drives the entire middle sequence (dub after dub), and charges the ending image ("wiped…humming with residual purpose…tucked securely away"). Its whalebone material and generational history add specificity. Removing it would break the ritual's physical causality. The mallet's "residual purpose" reprise reweights its opening introduction with cost (work complete, awaiting next call).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sketched resonance is named early, demonstrated across multiple beats (etching fractals, dubbing them into sound), and shapes the climax (final Heartwood sketch meeting the storm). The concept constrains Leeward's method (he must transcribe geometry onto bark before striking). However, it functions more as ritual procedure than a stake-altering pressure; the sketches succeed without friction or trade-off, limiting causal urgency.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Cloud interpretation enables the opening forecast ("recursive nautilus spiral signaled…devastating force") and mid-ritual adjustment ("interpreted accelerating cloud movements, sketching frantic spirals"). It constrains his response (he must read the pattern to replicate it). However, the trait operates as competence without visible cost or error; no misreading or ambiguity complicates his choices, keeping the score in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "dub" action (striking sketched bark to sound protective harmonies) drives every major beat from paragraph 10 onward and defines the climax ("final, foundational dub…erupted note"). Removing dub would require fundamental rewrite; no synonym action ("strike," "play") carries the ritual's accreted specificity. The action shapes tactics (tree by tree, layering frequencies) and charges the ending when the mallet is put away after its work.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Fractal generating appears in setup (clouds), middle (etching patterns), and ending (Heartwood's "perfect fractal replica"). The method constrains what Leeward sketches (he must replicate the cloud's geometry). However, the mechanics remain ornamental description; the text does not show how fractal recursion alters his choices or imposes cost. The method could be replaced with "pattern transcription" or "harmonic mapping" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The orchard afloat on driftwood is established in the opening line, pressures choices throughout (waves slapping urgently, driftwood circle as ritual stage, trees as resonant instruments), and anchors the ending image (orchard floating safe, driftwood steady underfoot). The setting's buoyancy and isolation are indispensable; landlocked orchard would collapse the tidal threat and the sonic-field defense. Spatial choreography (east-moving circuit, Heartwood at center) alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Blue hour is named in the opening and closing paragraphs, providing atmospheric color. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions; the "midnight" deadline is mentioned once and never tracked. No moment shows Leeward racing the clock or adjusting tactics as time narrows. The hour functions as mood rather than pressure, keeping the score below 5.0 for functional involvement.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation ("turn every obstacle into an instrument of harmony") is stated early, dramatized through the ritual (storm channeled into symphony), and fulfilled at closure ("obstacle became the instrument"). It frames his choices (propose collaboration over conflict) and charges the grandmother's aphorism callback. However, no moment shows friction between this want and a competing fear or cost, limiting felt complexity and capping the score in the low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Restless euphony is named twice (paragraph 13 "audible lattice of restless euphony," paragraph 25 "settled into deep peace"), modulates from frantic layering to resolved calm, and charges the ending's transformation of tempest into lullaby. Tone coheres through the ritual's escalation. However, the phrase reads more as thematic label than embodied texture in the prose's rhythm and diction; removing the explicit tag would leave the tonal arc intact but less overtly charged.</comment>
