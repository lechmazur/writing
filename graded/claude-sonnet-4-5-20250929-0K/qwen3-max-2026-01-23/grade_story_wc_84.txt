<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation—"the frequency of belonging"—is abstractly articulated rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. The shift from sharp-edged isolation to quiet warmth reads as smooth emotional arithmetic without genuine struggle. Elara's "perpetually surprised" trait is asserted repeatedly but never constrains a choice or creates friction; it functions as a label rather than a living contradiction. The hand-holding resolution delivers closure without visible cost—no path is foreclosed, no competing need abandoned on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The causal chain (drone → flagstone → chip → orrery activation → belonging) is clear and the ending lands a Resonant Reconfiguration (connection as constant). However, the final cost is felt rather than visible: no option is materially foreclosed, no tactical price paid. The orientation is prompt (observatory, dusk, drone mission) and the lens is causal-dominant with an RR ending. The closure satisfies the definition but lacks the sharp, on-page tradeoff that would lift it into higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The observatory's moss-choked archway, weathered carvings, meridian line, and flagstone all supply concrete spatial anchors and the chip's micro-glyphs add specificity. The orrery's brass arms and golden light charge the final image. The setting does not constrain a mid-scene choice—Kael follows the drone's instruction without environmental friction—but the ceremonial space shapes the closure mood, narrowly meeting the 9+ gate criterion of "charges the final image."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (recover the chip to awaken the orrery and decode belonging) is signaled early and pressure tightens from search → discovery → insertion → activation. However, the escalation is delivered by the technology and setting rather than Kael's agency under duress—he follows instructions, encounters no reversal, and the orrery simply works. The ending reconfigures meaning (connection vs. location) but the protagonist does not pay a visible price or foreclose a live option on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of "belonging as connection, not location" emerges clearly but is declared in near-prompt language: "the frequency of belonging: not a location, but the revelation that connection is the true constant" and "home he'd been searching for all along." The final paragraph edges toward thematic summary rather than letting the image speak. The chip and orrery function as symbolic conveniences introduced to resolve the loneliness they did not help create, weakening organic emergence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The POV remains stable third-limited on Kael with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present ("sharp eyes," tablet focus) but diction occasionally drifts toward elevated lyricism ("brilliant dimness," "harmonic frequency") that reads more authorial than pilot-specific. Elara's dialogue ("You stand where starlight converges") carries a poeticized register that flattens voice distinction under the story's emotional pressure. No major filter stacks or mid-paragraph leakage; the issues are tonal rather than structural.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Clarity and momentum are generally strong, but the prose carries scattered overwriting: "brilliant dimness" recurs four times without evolving meaning, "perpetually surprised" is asserted in three near-identical phrases, and elevated metaphors cluster in the orrery activation ("harmonic frequency," "celestial tapestry"). The final paragraph loops thematic language ("brilliant dimness was no longer empty; it was filled with the quiet hum of belonging") that restates rather than advances. Template cadence appears in "He [verb]…" stems. No major causality obscuration, but density sags under decorative phrasing. Accumulated artifacts and loops warrant −0.6 to −0.9 in Q7; the −0.9 estimate places the score in the low-6 band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core premise—lonely protagonist seeks artifact to awaken ancient mechanism and finds emotional fulfillment—closely matches template quest-to-belonging arcs without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The "frequency of belonging" is named rather than discovered through friction. The pairing of a sharp-eyed tech operator with a wonder-filled pilgrim and the hand-holding resolution read as median, safe choices. The orrery awakening and immediate emotional payoff lack the specificity or risk that would distinguish this synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael's sharp eyes are mentioned early and he operates the drone, but his key action (pulling the flagstone) is not a choice enabled by observation—the drone's triangulation tells him where to pull. Present across beats (tablet monitoring, kneeling, chip insertion) but the pilot skill does not constrain or enable a decision under pressure. Two-gate presence (setup, payoff) without middle development caps eligibility near 6.0; swappability (any competent operator could follow drone instruction) and lack of causal pressure lower the score to mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The chip is signaled early as mission object, discovered mid-story in a dramatized beat (flagstone pull), handled on-page (Kael lifts it, aligns edges), and directly shapes the ending (insertion activates orrery, triggering the belonging revelation). Present in three distinct beats (search framing, discovery, insertion/activation) with closure linkage. The chip's micro-glyphs add specificity and its insertion is the causal hinge for the final transformation. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff; irreplaceability is high (no generic key would carry the starlight motif). Minor deduction for the chip not creating earlier friction—it solves a problem it did not help complicate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Missing pieces" echoes thematically (Kael's void, the vacant socket) but does not drive on-page tactics or narrow options. The chip is the single missing piece; no competing absences, no choice between pieces, no escalation through serial recovery. The concept is present as metaphor rather than mechanism. Functional but largely ornamental; swappable with "lost artifact" or "final key" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Elara's "perpetually surprised" trait is asserted three times ("perpetual canvas of surprise," "unjaded wonder," "perpetually surprised nature") but never constrains or enables an action with cost. She watches, gasps, and offers poetic commentary without the trait altering tactics or stakes. Label-only use with no causal pressure or closure participation. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The pull (flagstone removal) is the story's physical climax, dramatized with sensory detail ("gritty sigh," "dark hollow") and directly enabling the chip recovery that drives the ending. Signaled mid-story, executed on-page, and causally essential to the orrery activation. Present in two beats (discovery, consequence) with closure linkage. Not introduced until the second third (−0.3 for late signal) and the action itself is straightforward (could be "lift" or "slide" with minor edits), capping swappability deduction at −0.5. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage offset late arrival, placing the score in upper-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Following star trails" is signaled early (Kael explains the drone's triangulation via Polaris/Altair paths), executed on-page (the red beacon weaves, convergence chime), and its mechanics directly enable the chip's discovery. The method shapes the search tactic and is irreplaceable—no other navigation logic is offered. Present across three beats (explanation, execution, payoff) with high specificity. The method is told rather than shown in technical detail, and the story does not dramatize a navigation failure or choice between star trails, but the causal chain is tight and closure-linked.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The observatory is anchored early (stone arches, weathered carvings, zodiac mosaics, meridian line, brass orrery) and its spatial details enable the search (flagstone at meridian line, orrery console socket). The dusk timing and golden light charge the final image. The setting supplies resources (flagstone, orrery) but does not constrain a mid-scene choice—Kael's path is dictated by the drone, not by navigating the space under pressure. Present across all three gates (setup, development via orrery, payoff) with moderate causal pressure and strong closure linkage. Specificity (meridian line, brass flower console) lifts the score; lack of tactical friction (no locked door, no rival, no environmental obstacle) prevents entry to the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"After the pilgrim arrives" marks story start but imposes no urgency or ticking clock. Time is vague (dusk → stars emerge → orrery activation) with no tracked duration or deadline that alters tactics. The timeframe is present as framing device but does not tighten decisions. Setup gate only; no middle development or payoff participation. Functional but entirely swappable with "at dusk" or omission.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Decode the frequency of belonging" is named early and recurs at the ending ("the frequency of belonging: not a location, but the revelation…"), framing Kael's goal. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants—no on-page moment where belonging competes with another cost (safety, pride, solitude). The desire drives the search but is not tested by friction; the orrery activation delivers the answer without requiring Kael to sacrifice or choose. Two-gate presence (setup, thematic payoff) with lyric reprise, but lack of mid-scene conflict and the abstractness of "frequency" cap the score in upper-5s. Told-only articulation and absence of visible tradeoff prevent higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Brilliant dimness" is introduced early (amber light, violet sky, "brilliant dimness") and recurs in the final paragraph ("brilliant dimness was no longer empty"), reweighting from atmospheric descriptor to thematic carrier (loneliness → connection). Tone is consistent across beats (reverent, contemplative) and modulates subtly (anticipation → warmth). The phrase charges the final image through reprise. Two-gate lyric structure (setup, closure reprise) without middle modulation under pressure. The repetition (four uses) edges toward decorative rather than evolving, and the tone does not shift sharply during the pull or discovery beats. Purposeful early–final reprise with thematic reweight places the score in mid-5s, eligible up to ~6.3 under lyric allowance; minor overuse and lack of pressure modulation hold it to 5.6.</comment>
