<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and consistent—his vow to let a garden reclaim the battlefield—but his choices on the page are largely sequential actions rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. The interiority leans toward elevated, almost ceremonial language ("his throat tightened," "tears traced clean paths") that reads more as performed emotion than embodied contradiction. The final micro-choice to return tomorrow is stated but not tested by a competing desire or visible cost that forecloses another path. The piece delivers coherent agency but misses the internal friction and embodied complexity required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural, with lyric resonance building toward a final image. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the first paragraph. The closure unit—a faint green thread pushing through wood and Kael's certainty that concord can bloom again—qualifies as Charged Poise under the Accumulative lens, reweighting the dominant stake (peace as dormant seed) with undeniable conceptual cost. However, the cost itself is more asserted ("carrying the unshakable certainty") than made viscerally felt or concretely forfeited on the page. The escalation from planting to nightingale's song to green shoot follows a lyric cadence but lacks a meaningful tightening or deepening turn that narrows Kael's options or changes his knowledge; the beats accumulate more than they complicate. The Orientation Test is satisfied and the lens holds, but the closure image, while resonant, does not charge prior material with a sharp enough reconfiguration or demonstrate the visible price paid to enter the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The blooming jetty at twilight is vividly rendered with sensory specificity—weathered wood, sea lavender, stubborn roses, violet sky, groaning planks—and filtered through Kael's perception as a battlefield reclamation site. The setting provides the materials (soil, planks, marsh, splintered piling) that Kael uses in his planting ritual, and the final image (green thread through a crack in the wood) charges the location at closure. The jetty functions as more than backdrop; it constrains his physical actions (kneeling, clearing earth, pouring water) and supplies the spatial logic for the bird calls and the submerged concord below. Micro-setting elements (jasmine thicket, splintered piling) anchor the bird translations and shift meaning across beats. This meets the 9+ gate requirement (environment charges the final image), but register occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("narrow ribbon of weathered wood defiantly cradling") that feels more authorial than POV-filtered, preventing full entry into the 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: to let a garden reclaim the battlefield and honor the broken Concord of Tides. The story delivers one meaningful deepening when the nightingale announces "The first root has touched water. The submerged concord is rising"—a lyric turn that reweights hope from abstract to imminent. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens remains more additive (plover → cormorant → sandpipers → nightingale) than tightening; no option is foreclosed, no competing desire tests Kael's resolve, and the final green shoot arrives as confirmation rather than a choice or sacrifice. The visible cost at closure is implied (years of labor ahead, "he would return tomorrow") but not dramatized as a price paid on this page. Agency is present but gentle; the story leans on accumulation without the sharpening pressure or forfeiture that would elevate conflict into the 7+ range.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—peace as dormant seed, beauty over brutality, amendment versus erasure—emerges organically through Kael's ritual and the layered image of the blooming jetty. The submerged concord functions as both historical wound and living metaphor, avoiding overt thesis statement. The final green shoot offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates well in the bird translations (forgiveness, memory, the earth is ready) and in Kael's tears as silent response. However, the piece occasionally edges toward thematic echo: "to amend it, letting beauty grow over brutality like ivy over stone, honoring the scar while transforming its meaning" reads more like authorial gloss than emergent realization. The ending image is quiet and purposeful, reweighting prior material with genuine resonance, but the articulation of theme in the penultimate beats risks slight redundancy that keeps this below the 8+ threshold.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, anchored to Kael throughout; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature—translating bird calls into dead languages—is distinct and purposeful, and the narrative voice carries a ceremonial, slightly archaic register ("his gnarled hands feeling the cold history," "the essence of narrow vastness") that suits the premise. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated authorial diction ("a narrow ribbon of weathered wood defiantly cradling," "a persistent argument for peace written in chlorophyll and light") that feels more written than thought, reducing the sense of true focalization under pressure. Psychic distance remains steady but does not modulate with emotional intensity; Kael's voice at the climactic nightingale moment reads the same as during the opening carriage halt. The piece teaches its pattern of bird-language translation cleanly, but the prose lacks the rhythmic compression or syntactic shift under stress that would demonstrate mastery in the 8+ range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and carries vivid sensory detail, but line-level momentum suffers from overwriting and decorative density. Runs of elevated modifiers appear in most sentences of key beats without pattern-teaching or payoff: "narrow ribbon of weathered wood defiantly cradling," "the ghost of a flower that had never known war," "a riot of color, a blooming bridge between sorrow and solace." Mixed metaphor: "a persistent argument for peace written in chlorophyll and light" stacks incompatible vehicles (argument, written, chlorophyll). Paraphrase loops: "He had not come to erase the past, but to amend it" is followed immediately by "letting beauty grow over brutality...honoring the scar while transforming its meaning"—adjacent lines restating the same idea without added pressure. Template cadence appears in the bird-call beats: "A plover's sharp cry...translated instantly" → "A cormorant croaked...it intoned" → "A flock of sandpipers erupted...forming a precise sentence." Register drifts into corporate/academic phrasing ("stitching harmony into a fractured world," "a living memorial"). Apply Overwriting Checks: density −0.5, coherence (mixed metaphor) −0.4, register drift −0.4; Paraphrase-loop check −0.2; Template-cadence check −0.5. Total artifact penalty −2.0 in Q7, plus the final-third presence of these artifacts disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The premise—translating bird calls into dead languages to plant a memorial garden on a betrayed peace treaty site—offers a fresh synthesis of character ability, setting, and theme. The emotional through-line (reclaiming a battlefield with beauty) transforms a familiar trope through the specific mechanics of Kael's gift and the layered history of the Concord of Tides. However, the execution leans toward surface novelty (the language-bird mechanic) without deep integration into character conflict; Kael's ability functions more as ornament than constraint or cost. The final image (green thread through wood) is purposeful but arrives as gentle affirmation rather than an earned, high-stakes reconfiguration. The piece commits to its premise without retreat, but the lack of friction—no competing desire, no visible sacrifice—keeps the ingenuity in the mid-band. Transformation is present but not fully realized; the story could achieve similar emotional arc with a simpler mechanic (e.g., ordinary gardening informed by historical research), signaling moderate swappability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Kael is present and his choices (halt carriage, kneel, clear soil, scatter seeds, pour water, gather pouch, turn horse home) create all beats. However, these are sequential actions rather than decisions that alter tactics or narrow options. His observation of bird calls and translation drive the ritual, but no on-page reversal tests his commitment or forecloses a competing path. Setup clear (opening), development present (middle planting beats), payoff present (final glance and turn home). Functional across beats but swappable with a similarly motivated character; no unique cost tied to Kael himself beyond general resolve. Cap at mid-band for presence without decisive turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The seed pods appear in beat one (withdrawn from greatcoat), are handled in beat two (crushed gently, scattered into soil), and return conceptually at closure when the green shoot emerges. Setup early, development via physical use, payoff when the first root touches water (nightingale's announcement) and the green thread appears. The object enables the central action (planting) and reappears with reweighted meaning (dormant potential realized). However, the pods themselves could be replaced with generic seeds without structural loss; their "ghost of a flower that had never known war" is evocative but ornamental. Two touches across beats with closure linkage, but swappability and ornamental framing lower the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The submerged concord—the betrayed peace treaty cast into the deep—frames Kael's motivation and the story's thematic stakes. It appears in the opening third (backstory block on the Concord of Tides), shapes Kael's planting ritual as symbolic amendment, and returns at closure when the nightingale declares "The submerged concord is rising" and Kael believes "concord, once submerged, could indeed bloom again." Setup present, development indirect (the ritual is framed as amendment to the broken covenant), payoff explicit in final lines. The concept shapes theme and emotional arc but does not constrain tactics or narrow on-page options; Kael's actions would proceed identically if the treaty were a generic battlefield tragedy. Lyric resonance at closure elevates into mid-5s, but lack of causal pressure or visible cost tied to the concord itself caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Kael's ability to speak dead languages by understanding bird calls is signaled early (opening third: "he spoke dead languages...hearing echoes of forgotten voices in wind, water, and wing") and enables the entire planting method. The attribute is used in four distinct beats: plover (Coastal People syntax), cormorant (drowned sailors' language), sandpipers (starling-tongue), nightingale (lost poets' sonnet). Each translation informs where and how Kael plants, constraining his choices (clear this patch, plant here, water the eastern seam). The trait is indispensable; removing it would collapse the method and the story's mechanics. Visible cost is implied (the emotional weight Kael carries, his tears at the nightingale's song) but not dramatized as a tradeoff or constraint in the moment. Setup, development across multiple beats, closure linkage all present. High integration, minor dock for ornamental emotional cost rather than sharp tactical price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Fertilize/plant is the central action: Kael clears soil, scatters seed fragments, pours water, and the final green shoot confirms success. The action is signaled early (his vow to let a garden reclaim the battlefield), executed across the middle beats, and pays off at closure. However, "fertilize" specifically (enriching soil) is not dramatized; Kael clears and plants but does not amend or prepare the earth beyond pouring fresh water. The action could be more precisely termed "plant" without structural change, signaling mild swappability. The beats trace to this action, but no major turn arises from it—the escalation is additive (more planting) rather than a tightening complication. Setup, development, payoff present; causal role solid but not transformative. Mid-6s for essential presence with moderate replaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Understanding bird calls is the method by which Kael fertilizes the soil: each call translates to instructions (thin soil, prepare with memory; plant forgiveness; water the eastern seam). The method is signaled in the opening third ("to fertilize the wounded earth solely by understanding bird calls") and demonstrated in four beats (plover, cormorant, sandpipers, nightingale). Each translation constrains Kael's planting choices, shaping both tactics and the ritual's meaning. The nightingale's final message charges closure ("The first root has touched water. The submerged concord is rising"). Setup early, development across all major beats, payoff decisive. The method is mechanically specific and irreplaceable; removing it would require a full structural rewrite. Minor dock: the mechanics of translation (how does Kael know these dead languages?) remain ornamental rather than grounded in cost or tradeoff. High integration, just shy of 8.5 band for full indispensability with cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The blooming jetty at twilight anchors all action: weathered wood, sea lavender, stubborn roses, groaning planks, splintered piling, marsh, jasmine thicket. The setting provides the soil Kael works, the structures (planks, piling) birds perch on, and the crack where the green shoot emerges at closure. Spatial choreography is clear (carriage halt, kneeling on planks, eastern seam). The jetty's dual identity—battlefield memorial and potential garden—drives the dominant stake. The setting constrains Kael's actions (he must work where the earth is thin, where the cannon's shadow fell) and charges the final image (green thread through wood). Setup immediate, development throughout, payoff decisive. The setting is indispensable to plot and theme. Minor dock: "twilight" functions more as atmospheric mood than a tightening constraint (no urgency tied to fading light). High integration, just below 8.0 for lack of time-pressure mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the reef dies" frames the story's temporal moment and contributes thematic weight (the battlefield beneath the still water, the silent memory). It appears in the opening third and returns implicitly at closure (the submerged concord rising). However, the timeframe does not constrain Kael's choices or create urgency; he could perform this ritual at any hour post-reef without altering tactics. The "hour after the reef dies" reads as atmospheric mood rather than a ticking clock. Setup present, development absent (no mid-scene pressure tied to time), payoff thematic but not causal. Functional but replaceable; the story would work identically set "at dusk" or "as night fell." Cap at mid-4s for presence without tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Kael's motivation—to let a garden reclaim the battlefield—is signaled early ("his motivation was a quiet, lifelong vow"), dramatized through his planting ritual across all middle beats, and affirmed at closure when he vows to return "until the jetty was a riot of color." The desire is embodied in his actions (clearing soil, scattering seeds, pouring water) and charged by his emotional response (throat tightens, tears fall, rare smile). The motivation is indispensable; removing it collapses the plot. However, the desire is not conflicted or tested by a competing want or visible cost on this page; Kael's resolve is unshaken throughout. Setup early, development across beats, payoff present. High integration with minor dock for lack of on-page friction between want and sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Narrow vastness"—the juxtaposition of Kael's small task (a few square feet of soil) against the colossal scale (ocean, history, hope)—is articulated explicitly mid-story ("This was the essence of narrow vastness") and echoed at closure ("one man on a narrow stage beneath an infinite sky"). The tone is coherent, modulating from ceremonial solemnity (opening) to quiet hope (ending). The final image (faint green thread, rare smile) carries the tone's charge. However, the explicit statement of the concept mid-story reduces its emergence to near-thesis; the tone is told as much as shown. The piece commits to the tone without retreat, and it shapes the reader's perception of scale throughout. Setup implicit, development explicit, payoff present in final image. Strong integration with minor dock for overt articulation rather than pure dramatization.</comment>
