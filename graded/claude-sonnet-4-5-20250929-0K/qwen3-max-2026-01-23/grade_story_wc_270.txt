<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's insurgent past and plant-telepathy traits are established early, but her interior life trends toward summary rather than contradictory impulses in scene. The choice to unseal the amber herself is signaled as "scoffing softly" at tradition, yet no on-page cost or trade-off pressures the decision—she simply acts. Embodied emotion is present ("tears streamed down her weathered cheeks") but the interiority leans on abstraction ("vindication," "insurgent conviction") rather than specific sensory or gestural conflict. The final scene with Kaela adds relationship pressure, but Elara's response is declarative wisdom without visible struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph (hot springs, reconstruction, Elara). The causal lens holds: kite → glyphs → amber → unseal → fern emerges. Closure is a Decisive Change (the fern flourishes, terraces gain roots) with conceptual cost legible in Elara's realization that tradition was fulfilled through action. One deduction: the pine's telepathic instruction ("Decode the script. It is a key.") supplies convenient guidance that narrows Elara's agency at the inciting moment. The cost at closure is more thematic vindication than visible forfeiture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The volcanic hot springs anchor setting with sensory specificity (sulfur, turquoise pools, mineral deposits) and constrain the unseal action—amber must be warmed in "the spring's heart." The scarred pine and moss-draped crevice function as micro-settings that guide Elara's search. Spatial choreography remains clear across kite discovery, crevice search, and pool immersion. The setting charges the final image: "sunset cast the valley in amber light mirroring the unsealed resin."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: reconstruction needs roots now, and Elara refuses passive waiting. One meaningful tightening occurs when the glyphs reveal the unseal method, narrowing her options. However, escalation is lean—no reversal or compounding obstacle tests her resolve between discovery and action. The choice to unseal carries thematic weight but no visible on-page cost (loss of status, resource, safety) that alters later tactics. Agency is present but the decision arc is smooth rather than pressured.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—tradition evolved through conscious action—emerges from Elara's choice and the story's images (amber, roots, reconstruction). The final line ("rooted in respect, reaching boldly toward tomorrow") leans toward summary but the preceding image (land exhales gratitude, roots stabilize) offers resonance. The pine's declaration ("The implanted destiny was the keeper's conscious choice") edges into thematic statement but is balanced by the on-page fern flourishing. No heavy moralizing in the final beat, and the story resists binary resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third with Elara; no head-hopping. Voice carries insurgent and elder registers ("scoffed softly," "counterpoint to bubbling waters") but diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("vindication," "insurgent conviction") that feels asserted rather than embodied. Dialogue with Kaela is brief and goal-driven, advancing theme without excess exposition. Filter verbs ("felt the land exhale") are acceptable within the telepathic frame. One slip: "Stories wait for readers with intent" reads more authorial than character-particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Line clarity is high; sentence openings vary and spatial choreography tracks cleanly. However, template stems recur ("Her plant-telepathy...," "A flash of...," "The glyphs unfolded...") and synonym loops appear ("Her insurgency taught her destiny required action, not passive hope" closely echoes "she, the insurgent grandmother, must unseal it herself"). Stock metaphors ("ghostly plumes," "latent potential") populate descriptive beats. The closure beat is clean, but mid-section density could tighten. No major artifact touches the ending, so non-closure deduction applies: −0.8 for loops and template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The insurgent-grandmother-as-guardian premise offers a fresh angle on "chosen one" prophecy by inverting passive waiting with elder agency. The kite-script decode and plant-telepathy are specific choices that ground the fantasy frame. However, the emotional arc (discovery → choice → vindication) follows a familiar template without unexpected complication or cost. The resolution—fern flourishes, community gathers—delivers satisfaction without friction. Transformation test: swapping names and setting would not fundamentally alter the arc. Sits mid-band due to specific world-building but predictable trajectory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara drives the inciting beat (discovers kite), middle turn (decodes glyphs, searches crevice), and climax (unseals amber). Her insurgent past informs the choice to act rather than wait, shaping tactics. She appears in the final beat instructing Kaela, reweighting her role from saboteur to partner-guide. Three beats plus closure linkage; causal pressure evident. Cost is thematic rather than material, lowering ceiling slightly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Amber appears at discovery (mid-story), is handled in the unseal beat (warmed, cracked), and the embryo's emergence drives the climax. The final image mirrors amber light, recharging its symbolic weight. Three beats with closure participation. Specificity high: honey-colored, palm-sized, resin seam. Causal role: without it, no fern, no stakes resolution. Strong integration; slight deduction for late first appearance (past setup window).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Implanted destiny frames the conflict: scrolls demand an "innocent child," Elara rejects passivity. The concept shapes her choice to unseal and the pine's closing explanation ("The implanted destiny was the keeper's conscious choice"). Present in setup (elder scrolls), middle (Elara's scoff), and payoff (pine's resonance). However, the concept trends toward theme rather than on-page constraint—no visible cost for defying the prophecy, no counter-pressure. Causal but moderate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Plant-telepathy enables three on-page actions: feels willows' thirst (setup), interprets kite glyphs via botanical intent (decode), senses resin softening during unseal (climax). The trait constrains method—only Elara can read the script. Visible in all three gates. Cost is implicit (unique burden) but not dramatized as trade-off. Solid causal role; deduction for cost opacity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Unseal is the climax beat: Elara submerges amber, applies pressure, cracks the seal. The action triggers the decisive change (fern emerges, valley responds). Setup via script decode ("warm the amber... break the seal"), payoff in resolution (roots anchor, leaves purify). Irreplaceable—without this exact act, no story closure. Three gates, causal pressure, closure linkage, and felt cost (Elara's tears, community awe). High integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Kite appears in setup (inciting discovery), glyphs are decoded mid-story (shapes tactics), and the method returns at closure ("The kite's script revealed the method"). Three gates, but the mechanics remain abstract—"botanical intent woven into fibers" is described, not dramatized through trial or error. Specificity moderate; causal role present but the decode itself is smooth rather than pressured. Sits mid-band for lyric reprise without mid-scene friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Hot springs anchor every beat: steam carries sensory detail (sulfur, turquoise), mineral deposits hide the amber, the spring's heat enables the unseal ("warm the amber in the spring's heart"), and volcanic stone receives the fern's roots at closure. Setup, development (crevice search), and payoff all depend on this exact location. Constraint is high: another setting could not support the action. Causal pressure and closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Reconstruction frames urgency ("terraces needed roots now," "Reconstruction could not afford such luxury") and appears in setup (hammers ringing), middle (Elara's impatience), and payoff (workers gather, slopes stabilize). Time pressure is declared but not tracked—no clock tightens decisions on the page. Functions as thematic backdrop and stakes context. Two gates (setup, closure); causal pressure moderate. Caps at mid-6s for declared rather than dramatized urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elara's desire to "evolve tradition with intent" appears in setup ("never to discard tradition but to evolve it"), drives the choice to unseal ("To evolve tradition with intent meant she... must unseal it herself"), and is validated at closure ("She had not broken tradition; she had fulfilled its purpose"). Three gates, causal role in the climax decision. Friction is present (passive waiting vs. action) but cost is vindication rather than loss. Strong thematic tie; deduction for lack of on-page trade-off.</comment>
