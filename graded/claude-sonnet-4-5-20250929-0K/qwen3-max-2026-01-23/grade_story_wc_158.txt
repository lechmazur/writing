<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The poet's interiority is vivid and consistent, with embodied longing across centuries and the alchemy of pain-to-verse clearly motivating his existence. However, the protagonist remains largely passive—centuries pass in reflection without micro-choices under pressure until the shell resonates, and that shift arrives through external magic rather than an earned internal contradiction forcing a decision. The final "surrender" reads as received grace rather than a choice with visible cost. Label-speak like "blossom armistice" and "reef-shadow joy" occasionally abstract the emotional stakes when concrete embodiment would sharpen them.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors clearly by the opening (who, where, centuries-long when). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the shell's light bloom acknowledges his longing and the poet rests in acceptance), but cost remains oblique—what path is foreclosed, what is sacrificed for this peace? The escalation relies on mystical resonance triggered by his song rather than prior causal pressure or a tightening choice. Under an accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is present (the shell transforms from refuge to living archive), but the final image's cost is felt rather than concretely legible, keeping this in mid-range.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell is vividly rendered with pearlescent walls, nacre slopes, and aperture, and it evolves from passive refuge to resonant partner, directly shaping the closure image when the light blooms in spiral patterns. The galaxy postcard functions as micro-setting, handled across multiple beats and pressed into the glowing wall at the turn. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (e.g., "smooth as forgotten promises," "dappled happiness"), and the shell's curve physically constrains his posture each evening, meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping choice and charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming insomnia's pain into beauty—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through centuries of longing, but escalation is thin: the poet repeats the same ritual (lullabies, tracing the postcard) without a narrowing choice or tactical shift until the shell spontaneously resonates. The climactic turn is externally triggered (the wind shifts, the shell vibrates) rather than driven by protagonist agency. The "blossom armistice" arrives as a gift, not a trade-off with visible cost, keeping this below high-band thresholds under accumulative escalation standards.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: centuries of longing as compost, pain photosynthesized into verses, the shell transforming from refuge to living archive. The final image (postcard dissolving into the shell's constellation, lullabies now a duet) offers a resonant answer to the central question—whether endless pain can yield light—without moralizing. Subtext operates through the off-key wind, the shy unstoppability, and the "reef-shadow joy" metaphor. Minor demerit: "blossom armistice" and "photosynthesize pain into beauty" edge toward prompt-label phrasing, but the enacted transformation (glowing nacre, dissolved postcard) grounds the abstraction sufficiently.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-person limited with poetic diction that fits the character (e.g., "residual song of tides long turned to memory," "saltwater essence of reef-shadow joy"). Psychic distance is controlled, and the perceptual signature—centuries measured in longing, details filtered through insomnia and solitude—is consistent. No dialogue present. Register occasionally drifts into elevated lyricism ("alchemy," "photosynthesized," "kiln of waiting") that feels authorial rather than emergent from the insomniac's idiom, and some figurative clusters ("sharp thorns...bloomed like night-blooming cereus") risk purple density, but voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings and paragraph lengths modulate well. Information density is high in the opening and closing thirds. However, figurative language saturates nearly every sentence in the climactic beats ("tears...saltwater essence of reef-shadow joy," "luminous, dappled happiness born from...interplay," "celebrating the beauty forged in the kiln of waiting"), creating density without always advancing causality. Paraphrase loops appear: paragraphs 15–16 restate the armistice and its resonance with near-synonyms ("acknowledged, honored, woven" / "gentle surrender...hands like old friends"). Template cadence in the resolution paragraphs ("He continued...," "He saw how...," "And as...") flattens momentum. Combined artifacts trigger −0.8 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The core synthesis—insomniac poet in a giant shell, centuries of longing, off-key lullabies—is specific and memorable. The shell-as-resonant-partner twist and the postcard dissolving into living light offer a fresh angle on transformation-through-endurance. However, the "creative soul heals through art" template is widely used, and the mystical resolution (shell spontaneously glows, pain is simply accepted) leans on a familiar arc without transforming it through non-obvious moral calculus or lived complication. The piece commits fully to its lyric premise, but the climax's lack of trade-off or protagonist-driven turn limits ingenuity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Insomniac poet is present throughout and his centuries-long alchemy (pain-to-verse) motivates the piece. However, his choices are limited: he repeats the ritual (lullabies, tracing postcard) without on-page decisions that alter tactics. The climactic turn (shell resonating) happens to him rather than through him. Observation and endurance dominate; agency at closure is acceptance rather than a decisive pivot. Setup and payoff gates met, development (constraining middle choice) is weak. Swappable with "reclusive artist" or "isolated mystic" with minor edits. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, but ornamental action −0.8, late development −0.3, swappability −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Galaxy postcard appears early, is handled in multiple beats (tracing spiral arms, centuries of frayed edges), and returns at closure (pressed into glowing wall, dissolving into the shell's constellation). It serves as tether, motivation, and final image anchor. Setup, development, and payoff gates all met. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, specificity (Whirlpool Galaxy, faded blues/violets) +0.5, but the postcard does not constrain a choice or narrow options under pressure—it is observed and held, not wielded to alter tactics—so causal pressure is minimal −0.6. Swappability (any cherished image) −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Blossom armistice" is named early as the poet's dream, returns in the climactic paragraph ("the blossom armistice was realized"), and the final paragraphs elaborate its terms (pain and beauty clasping hands, dancing with darkness). Setup and payoff gates met; development is thin—it remains a stated goal rather than shaping on-page tactics. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, but the concept functions primarily as thematic label rather than a constraint that alters options −0.7, ornamental (declared rather than enacted choice) −0.6, label-only trait −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Shyly unstoppable" appears twice: paragraph 6 (his quiet resolve cannot be diverted) and paragraph 17 (his nature cultivated peace). The attribute is asserted in reflection rather than demonstrated through on-page action with visible tradeoff—no moment shows the cost of being unstoppable or the friction of shyness constraining a choice. Setup and payoff gates met, development gate missing. Early signal +0.4, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.5, but label-only trait without enacted cost −0.8, ornamental use −0.6, swappability (any resilience synonym) −0.5, summary-only −0.4. Cap for missing development gate: 3.4; lyric reprise allowance lifts slightly to 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Ensconce" appears in the title setup (ensconced centuries ago), recurs in paragraph 7 (each evening he would ensconce his bones), and again in paragraph 20 (continued to ensconce himself each evening). The action frames his ritual and defines the shell's function as protective embrace. Setup, development (repeated choice to settle deeper), and payoff (continued ritual post-transformation) all present. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9, specificity (nacre slopes, shell's heart) +0.4, but easily swappable with "shelter," "nest," "curl into" without structural impact −0.6, and the action does not create a key turn—transformation comes from the shell's resonance, not the ensconcing −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind" is signaled in paragraph 8, recurs as his nightly method, and becomes a duet with the wind at closure (paragraph 20). Setup, development (the lullabies are his prayer, shaping attempts across centuries), and payoff (now a duet, harmony metaphor for wholeness) all met. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, but the method does not constrain a choice—the poet sings regardless, and the transformation occurs when the wind shifts and the shell resonates, not because of a tactical change in his lullabies −0.8. Swappability (any repeated artistic ritual) −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell is present from the title, provides spatial constraint (spiraled sanctuary, nacre slopes, aperture), and becomes the site of transformation when it blooms with light at closure. Setup, development (the shell's curve ensconses him, its walls hum with memory), and payoff (shell transforms into living archive, glowing constellation) all clearly met. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.5, causal pressure (the shell's resonance triggers the turn) +1.0, specificity (pearlescent walls, nacre, spiral arms) +0.6, cost connection (the shell's transformation is the visible peace) +0.4. Indispensable: the story's logic and final image depend on this exact setting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Across centuries of longing" is stated in paragraph 3, frames the poet's existence, and the resolution notes "centuries of longing...woven into this radiant tapestry" and "endured centuries." Setup and payoff met; development is weak—centuries pass without clear tightening or a clock that alters tactics beat-to-beat. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, but time does not constrain a choice or create urgency—it accumulates as background rather than pressuring decisions −1.0. Swappability (any long duration: "decades," "a lifetime") −0.5. Lyric-resonance allowance and conceptual weight (endurance as cost) lift slightly above caps.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To photosynthesize pain into beauty" is named in paragraph 5, drives the poet's daily vow, and the closing paragraphs confirm he has achieved it (verses now carry reef-shadow joy, pain photosynthesized into light). Setup, development (his alchemy shapes his verses and ritual), and payoff (the transformed poetry, the shell's light as metaphor) all met. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, but the motivation is told more than dramatized—no on-page beat shows him choosing between pain and beauty with visible friction or cost −0.8. Label-only trait ("alchemy," "photosynthesis" as metaphor) −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Reef-shadow joy" appears in paragraph 14 (tears as saltwater essence of reef-shadow joy), returns in paragraph 22 (verses carry the gentle weight of reef-shadow joy). The tone is coherent—muted yet luminous, dappled happiness from shadow and light—and modulates with pressure (longing → resonance → duet). Setup mid-story, payoff at closure; development is thin—the tone is described rather than enacted through rhythm shifts. First appearance ~60% mark, late signal −0.3, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, specificity (muted by memory yet radiant) +0.5, but tone as static mood rather than pressure-driven modulation −0.6. Lyric reprise (mid → end) with reweighted meaning lifts into 6.3 band.</comment>
