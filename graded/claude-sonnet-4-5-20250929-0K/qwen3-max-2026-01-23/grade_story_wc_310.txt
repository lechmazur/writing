<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is highly abstract and repetitive—"wavelength align," "stellar doubt," "quiet enthusiasm" are label-recycled across dozens of lines without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. The coin-casting ritual and vigil stance are present, but her decision to cast lots feels ceremonial rather than conflicted; no live option is foreclosed with visible cost. Emotional progression flattens into solemn acceptance without dramatized struggle. The final "alignment" reads as affirmation of a path already walked, not a choice that alters tactics or forecloses a competing desire.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when early (Elara, observatory deck, post-contraction universe). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure accrues through static bursts, coin interpretation, and ritual deepening. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Elara confirms her vigil role with acceptance. However, the cost is oblique: no live alternative is dramatized or refused on the page; "stellar doubt" softens into "solemn peace" without a visible sacrifice or foreclosed path. The ending image (coins at rest, waiting for the next burst) reaffirms rather than reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Amber resin, brass telescopes, obsidian surface, and the luminous singularity pearl are vivid and anchored. The observatory deck functions as micro-setting: the ambered objects and console static constrain Elara's ritual and charge the final image. Sensory selection (trapped warmth, soft whispers of coins, resonant tone) filters through her meditative focus. The post-contraction cosmology is purposeful, establishing the backward-prophecy logic and the vigil's isolation. Minor slip: "faded velvet" and "leather pouch" appear without prior setup.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: to find purpose/alignment in a concluded universe. The coin-casting and static-listening deepen her understanding but do not narrow options or force a trade-off; the Xylosian disc's balanced stance and the "resonant frequency of acceptance" confirm rather than alter her trajectory. No reversal or tightening forecloses a live path. The "stellar doubt" is present but softens without on-page cost—no renunciation, no visible loss. Agency is attention and ritual endurance, valid under the Accumulative lens, but pressure does not escalate to a choice with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-archive and witnessing in a contracted cosmos emerges from images (amber-trapped warmth, backwards prophecy, coins as vessels of lost hope). The final realization—"to be the conscious witness"—is earned by the ritual and static-listening, but the voice articulates it directly: "her purpose was not to alter fate, but to be the conscious witness" borders on theme summary. The ending image (coins at rest, waiting) is resonant but does not reweight prior material with a non-literal turn. Subtext in the backwards-prophecy conceit (historical certainty vs. prediction) is clever and sustained.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Single-POV third-limited with stable distance and a distinct meditative register. However, diction is repetitive and elevated throughout: "wavelength align," "stellar doubt," "quiet enthusiasm," "distill meaning" recur as labels rather than embodied perception. Psychic distance remains wide even during the coin-casting peak beat; no compression or urgency modulates the voice. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew") are frequent and flatten immediacy. The piece maintains internal consistency but lacks perceptual signature or rhythm variation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "to wavelength align," "to find the precise harmonic resonance," "to distill meaning" cycle across adjacent lines. Runs of "She [verb]" stems appear in the middle third. The final third reprises "wavelength," "stellar doubt," "distill," and "backwards prophecy" without added pressure. Figurative language (amber as museum, universe as pearl, static as chaos-echo) is present in most sentences without payoff at closure. Baseline −1.0 for loops and template cadence; −0.4 additional for density without escalation in peak beats. Information density is moderate but momentum stalls from synonym churn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The post-contraction universe and backwards-prophecy conceit are fresh cosmological hooks. The ambered observatory and coin-casting ritual combine elements in a purposeful frame. However, the emotional arc—doubt softening into acceptance through ritual confirmation—follows a familiar template. The protagonist's vigil role and the "memory archive" resolution feel predetermined; no on-page turn transforms the premise. The Xylosian disc's balanced stance is a vivid detail but does not alter tactics. Specificity in world-building (foreign coins, mother-of-pearl disc, Vega soil) adds texture but the core move (seeking alignment, finding it) is not transformed by lived friction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and casts lots, but the decision confirms an existing path rather than creating a turn. The lots do not narrow options or force a trade-off; the text states "they reflected the unwavering path she had walked." Functional role, no causal pressure at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Coins are described in the first third (groat, disc, token), cast in the middle (five form a circle, disc balances), and gathered at the end with a lingering touch. The disc's balanced stance signals alignment, but the coins do not constrain a choice or alter tactics; their meaning (vessels of hope, clarity tools) remains stable. Two beats, closure participation, but low causal pressure. Cap at ~6.8 for lyric reprise without cost linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Backwards prophecy is signaled early, explained (prophecies as echoes of completed events), and employed during the static-listening. It shapes the vigil's logic and Elara's method. However, it does not change her options or create a reversal; the concept frames her role rather than testing it. Present across beats, modest causal work, no closure cost tied to the concept itself.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Quietly enthusiastic" appears as a label in several lines ("her attribute of quiet enthusiasm," "softly enthusiastic smile," "quietly enthusiastic, and waited"). It does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost; the trait is asserted rather than dramatized through choice. Ornamental use, no pressure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Distill" appears in the opening abstract, during the static-listening ("distill meaning from the noise," "distill the chaos"), and in the final paragraph ("Each distilled burst"). It describes her meditative process and produces the "resonant frequency of acceptance," but the action is interchangeable with "interpret" or "listen deeply." One beat of causal use (static → tone → acceptance), closure mention, moderate swappability. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Understanding static bursts is introduced early ("her method"), employed in the middle third (deep-listening, filtering to a pure tone), and mentioned in the final lines ("waited for the next whisper from the static"). The method produces the backwards-prophecy clarity and the acceptance tone, shaping her ritual. Two beats, closure participation, but the mechanics are abstract and do not constrain a choice. Just over the two-gate threshold with modest causal linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The ambered observatory deck is present in the first line (amber railing, trapped warmth), described throughout (brass telescopes, crystalline dome, obsidian surface), and transforms in Elara's perception near the end ("no longer a tomb, but a sanctuary"). The setting provides the console (static source), the dome view (singularity pearl), and the ritual space, pressuring her vigil role. The final hand-on-resin gesture closes the frame. Three gates, closure linkage, and the perceptual shift charges the ending. Strong integration, irreplaceable location.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The post-contraction timeframe is established early (universe contracted, conclusion reached) and sustained throughout. It defines the vigil's context (no futures to shape, only memory to honor) and the backwards-prophecy logic. However, time does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the vigil is ongoing and undifferentiated. Functional framing, no escalation tied to the timeframe itself. Cap mid-band for setup without pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To wavelength align with purpose" is stated early as her motivation, repeated across multiple paragraphs, and confirmed at the end ("she found her wavelength," "She was aligned"). It drives the ritual and the quest for resonance, but the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting choices. No visible friction between this want and a competing cost or fear. Functional motivation, label-heavy execution, closure participation but low embodied conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Stellar doubt" is introduced early as "a heavy frost," recurs in the middle ("did not vanish… but softened"), and appears in the final paragraph ("settled like dust in amber"). The tone modulates from weight to solemn peace, charging the acceptance arc. However, the mood is asserted via the label rather than embodied through syntax or image shifts. Present across beats, closure participation, modest tonal pressure. Mid-band for told-tone with lyric reprise.</comment>
