<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Leo's motivations are clear and intensify appropriately, driven by his grandfather's confession. The shift from "reckless explorer" to someone seeking truth shows progression with cost. However, the grandfather's backstory—delivered entirely through reflection at the beaded wheel—feels convenient rather than layered through contradictory impulses. The final tear and resolve read clean but lack the friction of competing desires acting simultaneously in the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal lens holds throughout: phone confession → recordings → Eleanor's description → tunnel discovery → wheel触 → truth understood → resolve to speak. The closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (understanding shifts from blame to grace) with felt emotional cost. Orientation anchors quickly (Leo, tunnel, post-confession). One meaningful deepening occurs when tactile contact crystallizes understanding, narrowing his stance from skepticism to witness. The backstory block is substantial but changes present resolve, meeting BRR expanded allowance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tunnel is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (wet stone, rust, peeling ads, twisted rails). The beaded valve wheel functions as micro-setting and charges the final image when Leo turns it. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the descent. The "drowsy alertness" filters perception appropriately, and the valve's physical properties (cold, beaded spokes) constrain the revelation moment, meeting the 9+ gate criterion for environment shaping closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—appraising the swallowed truth—is signaled early and tightens when Leo finds the wheel, forcing a choice between dismissal and belief. The turn from skepticism to understanding narrows options with visible cost: he must now carry and voice a burden his grandfather bore alone. Agency is clear in the decision to turn the wheel and speak the truth. Pressure coheres under the causal lens; one meaningful tightening (tactile contact → comprehension) is sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—the weight of silenced truth and mistaken shame—emerges through concrete particulars: broken rosary beads, the sealed valve, the pact of silence. The beaded wheel shifts meaning from paranormal relic to testament of quiet courage without overt statement. The final image (turning the wheel as secular prayer) offers a resonant answer to the central question. Subtext operates in the "ghost shift" misnomer and the sensory metaphor of beads as frozen tears. No moralizing; complexity remains intact.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Leo with distinct perceptual signature (explorer's eye for decay, skeptic's scoff at spirits). The substantial reflection block at the wheel is anchored by tactile contact but flattens present pressure during the key revelation, becoming expository. Diction stays consistent ("frail path," "sorrowful eye") and voice-appropriate. No dialogue present to evaluate. Filter verbs ("reached out," "replayed") accumulate without serving immediacy, costing −0.3 in momentum.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several artifacts appear: "swallowed truth" is recycled four times without reweighting; "profound" modifies both "hush" and "silence"; template stems ("He was," "He replayed," "He reached," "He understood") cluster in the middle third. The backstory paragraph at the wheel, while causal, paraphrases its own points (grandfather tried to prevent / ordered sealed shut / never got the chance). Deduct −0.8 for loops and template cadence touching a high-pressure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of urban exploration, factory disaster, and the beaded rosary-as-evidence is specific and non-obvious. The "ghost shift" reframing from haunting to protective silence offers a fresh moral calculus. Eleanor's radio-psychic testimony as breadcrumb avoids cliché detective work. Risk is present in the reflection-heavy structure and the quiet ending, both of which succeed without obscuring closure. The transformation test passes: swapping names and places would lose the textile-factory vernacular and the rosary's Catholic weight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Leo's explorer trait frames entry and his usual thrill's absence signals stakes early. His choice to enter the tunnel and turn the wheel are key decisions that alter his stance. However, the "reckless" label does minimal causal work; a less extreme researcher would make identical moves. Present in setup, middle choice (descent), and closure (turning wheel), meeting all three gates, but swappable with "determined" or "curious" investigator without major edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The beaded valve wheel is set up via Eleanor's call, discovered at the tunnel junction (two beats), handled ("hand closing around… spokes"), and turned in the final act as secular prayer. Its specific properties (cobalt-blue beads, rosary origin, emergency-feed function) are irreplaceable and drive the truth revelation. Removal would collapse the grandfather's motive and the closure gesture. Charges the final image decisively.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The "ghost shift" legend is present early (Eleanor's call, Leo's research) and reframed at closure as "truth shift," altering the conceptual stakes. It shapes Leo's tactics (tunnel search, interpreting spectral-worker lore) and the final understanding. However, it functions more as thematic wrapper than on-page pressure; the actual conflict is Leo versus his own skepticism and the grandfather's hidden story. Two gates (setup, payoff) with lyric reprise that reweights meaning.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Religiously skeptical" is stated early and tested when Leo scoffs at ghosts yet follows Eleanor's supernatural claim. It constrains his initial interpretation (dismissing spirits) and is inverted at closure when he performs a "secular prayer." The trait enables one key choice (pursuing the valve despite disbelief) with felt cost (abandoning his worldview). Present in setup and closure; middle beats reference skepticism but don't press it under new conditions. Functional but not deeply causal beyond the opening and ending frame.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Appraise" is the engine: Leo seeks to appraise the explosion's true cause, appraises Eleanor's specificity, appraises the beaded wheel "not as paranormal relic, but as testament," and appraises "the true weight" of the legacy. The verb recurs with shifting objects, each use tightening understanding. Major turns trace directly to acts of appraisal. Swapping for "discover" or "understand" would lose the weighing/valuing dimension central to theme. Three beats, closure linkage, strong causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Interpreting frantic radio calls is signaled early ("predawn hours hunched over static-filled recordings") and supplies the beaded-wheel detail absent from reports, motivating the tunnel trip. The method's mechanics—Eleanor's specificity breaking Leo's skepticism—matter causally. However, it appears only in setup and brief flashback ("replayed Eleanor's frantic words"); no middle beat shows Leo cross-checking recordings or adjusting interpretation. Two gates (setup, payoff reference) with clear causal work, but mid-story absence caps upper range.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The abandoned train tunnel provides the space for discovery, its darkness and isolation heighten Leo's alertness, and the corroded pipe junction houses the valve. The environment pressures movement (twenty minutes of cautious navigation) and the "absolute blackness" charges sensory details. The valve's placement deep within the tunnel is plot-critical. Setting enables the key find and shapes Leo's embodied state. Three gates, causal involvement, micro-setting (valve junction) alters tactics and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "hush that follows a sudden confession" frames the opening and returns in the closing line as "hush now filled with purpose," creating a charged reprise. The timeframe compresses decision (confession to dawn tunnel trip) and the phrase "profound hush" recurs to mark emotional states. However, the temporal window is static mood-setting rather than a live clock altering tactics; Leo's choices would play identically in any post-confession window. Two gates (setup, lyric payoff) with purposeful return but no middle pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To find the weight of a swallowed truth" is the dominant stake, stated early and pursued across all beats: research, tunnel descent, wheel discovery, appraisal, and final resolve to voice it. The motivation is dramatized in friction between skepticism and Eleanor's specificity, between exhaustion and hyper-awareness. Cost is visible when Leo accepts the burden ("true weight settled upon him"). Three gates, strong causal linkage, closure participation. "Weight" and "swallowed truth" recur purposefully to track the quest's evolution.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Drowsy alertness" is introduced early ("drowsy alertness, exhaustion… warring with hyper-awareness") and modulates appropriately: it "crystallized into unwavering resolve" at closure. The oxymoron filters sensory details (every drip, every echo) and reflects Leo's liminal state between skepticism and belief. The tone charges the final contrast (hush → purpose). However, the phrase appears only twice and its modulation is told rather than shown through shifting syntax or rhythm. Two gates (setup, closure), coherent through turns, clear closure charge.</comment>
