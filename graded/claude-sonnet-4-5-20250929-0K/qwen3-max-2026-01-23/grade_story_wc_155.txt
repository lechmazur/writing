<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (rediscovering lost joy) is clear and her pilgrimage is purposeful, but her interior life relies heavily on abstract states ("pensive mirth," "quiet ache") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The daydream sequence blurs agency—she observes memories rather than making choices under pressure. The final "integration" of the fragment reads as ritual completion without a trade-off that forecloses another path with visible cost. The character is consistent but lacks the internal friction and micro-choice density needed for higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece builds through layered imagery (fog, light, fresco) toward a final reconfiguration. Orientation anchors arrive by ~120 words (orchard district, fog, Elara as artist). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: the daydream's luminous resurrection and the fragment's placement create a charged final image that reweights her relationship to loss. Cost is present but oblique—she leaves the fragment embedded, a gesture that closes the circle but does not foreclose a competing desire on the page. One meaningful deepening (the fresco blooms) is sufficient for this length, and the lens holds. The cost could be more visceral to elevate further.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ruined orchard district, fog-as-film, and the courtyard beneath the stone-sparrow archway are vividly rendered and purposeful. Sensory detail (pearlescent fog, moss-eaten bench, damp wall) is selective and filtered through Elara's artistic perception. The fog functions as both atmosphere and mechanism (exposed film), constraining her method and charging the final image. The fragment's ceramic coolness and the projected sun's warmth layer tactile and visual senses effectively. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The fog evolves from shroud to gentle veil, reflecting her internal shift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rediscovering lost joy—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure accumulates through the daydream's unfolding (ghost-sounds, blooming fresco, grandmother's memory) and tightens when the fragment aligns with its luminous counterpart. That integration reweights her relationship to the past, shifting from loss to "mature understanding." The cost is conceptual (joy is no longer lost but developed within her) rather than a trade-off between competing goods. Agency is mostly contemplative; she observes and places the fragment rather than choosing between live options under duress. One meaningful deepening is present, but the stakes remain abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—joy is rediscovered not by clinging but by engaging with the past—emerges organically from the light-as-film concept and the fragment's integration. The recurring fog and fresco motifs shift meaning at the end (fog as protective veil, fragment as seed). Subtext operates in the grandmother's painted eyes and the lullaby Elara still knows. The final image offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. However, the penultimate paragraph risks thematic echo: "joy is rediscovered not by clinging to the past, but by actively engaging with it" edges toward prompt-like articulation. The piece invites reflection through particulars (ceramic apple, light-painted wall) but flirts with abstraction near closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Elara's artistic perception. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("photons as her only pigment," "tactile whisper from a silenced era"), and the prose has a distinct lyric texture. Psychic distance narrows effectively during the daydream. However, several passages rely on elevated, near-ornamental phrasing ("pensive mirth," "luminous dialogue between absence and remembrance") that skirts the edge of the POV's plausible register under peak pressure. Filter verbs ("she could almost feel," "she saw") are voice-motivated but cluster in the daydream sequence. Perceptual signature is consistent—light, color, and memory—but the interior voice occasionally abstracts rather than staying grounded in sensation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but the piece carries multiple prose artifacts. Paraphrase loops appear: "the fog thickened with possibility" / "moisture-laden fog acted precisely as exposed film" restates the mechanism. Template cadence runs: "She [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" stems recur across adjacent lines without taught pattern. Stock metaphors ("like magic in a darkroom tray," "fading embers") and elevated register ("crystalline moment," "sacred circle") appear in peak beats without sufficient grounding. The closure beat itself is clean, but the mid-section carries −0.6 to −0.8 in scaffold and figurative density. No filter-verb stacks disqualify 9+ globally, but the artifacts prevent entry to high bands here.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The fog-as-exposed-film concept is inventive and the light-painting premise offers a fresh angle on memory and art. However, the emotional arc (pilgrimage to lost joy → mature understanding) follows a familiar template. The fresco fragment and knowledge network are integrated but feel like checklist elements rather than inevitable choices. The daydream frame softens stakes—Elara observes rather than risks. The story commits to its premise but remains in a safe middle: lyric beauty without bold structural risk or moral calculus that complicates the resolution. Transformation is present but not startling; the synthesis is competent rather than surprising.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara (vivid mural artist) is present throughout and her identity shapes her method (light painting). She makes the choice to display the projection and place the fragment, both of which participate in closure. However, these are ritual acts rather than decisions under competing pressure. Early signal (+0.5), two beats (projection, placement, +0.9), closure linkage (+0.9). Swappability (another artist could perform similar acts, −0.5) and ornamental interiority (much observation, limited tactical choice, −0.4). Net ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The fresco fragment appears early (clutched in palm), is described with tactile detail (ceramic, cool, child's hand/apple), and returns at closure when Elara presses it into the wall crevice to align with the projection. Three beats: introduction, memory anchor during daydream, physical integration at end (+1.4). Early signal (+0.6), closure linkage (+1.2), specificity (ceramic apple, unique image, +0.5). The fragment's properties (image of child/apple) enable the alignment ritual. Cost connection is mild (she leaves it behind, +0.3). Total ~7.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Exposed film is the core concept: fog acts as film developed by light. Signaled mid-story ("the moisture-laden fog acted precisely as exposed film"), it enables the fresco's emergence and shapes Elara's method. Two beats: calibration/projection, the bloom of latent memories (+0.9). Late first appearance (second third, −0.3). Causal pressure (the concept narrows her tactic to light projection, +0.8), closure linkage (the developed fresco charges the final alignment, +1.0). Swappability is low (the film metaphor is specific, +0.5). Net ~6.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Paints with light" is Elara's defining attribute and appears early ("renowned for painting with light"). It constrains her method (projector, not physical paint) and enables the fresco's development. Two beats: unpacking projector, the bloom (+0.9). Early signal (+0.5), causal pressure (method is tied to the concept, +0.6), closure linkage (the light display is the culmination, +0.8). However, the trait is more thematic label than tactical constraint with visible cost—she could have used another visual medium with minor edits (−0.6). Net ~5.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Display (the action) structures the story: Elara travels to display light, unpacks the projector, and executes the projection that reveals the fresco. Three beats: preparation, projection, final integration (+1.4). Early signal (her aim is to display, +0.6), causal pressure (the display enables the bloom and the fragment's alignment, +1.2), closure linkage (the display is complete at the end, +1.2). Swappability is moderate—another ritual act (e.g., "paint," "restore") could serve (−0.5). Net ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The knowledge network (method) is signaled early: "the village's knowledge network—a living tapestry of elders' whispers, annotated journals." Old Man Hemlock's clue leads her to the courtyard. One beat: finding the location (+0.4). Early signal (+0.5), causal pressure (the network provides the map, +0.5). However, it does not constrain middle choices or return at closure; Elara does not add her thread on the page, only promises to (summary-only future, −0.5). Swappable with "archives" or "local guide" (−0.6). Net ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ruined orchard district lost in fog is present throughout. It supplies the courtyard, the damp wall (which holds the latent fresco), and the fog (which acts as film). Multiple beats: arrival, courtyard discovery, projection surface, final departure (+1.4). Early signal (+0.7), causal pressure (fog and wall are necessary for the concept to function, +1.3), closure linkage (the district frames the final image and her departure, +1.0), specificity (stone-sparrow archway, moss-eaten bench, +0.6). Net ~7.4.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Timeframe "within the fold of a daydream" is stated explicitly ("she folded into a daydream") and frames the projection sequence. One beat: the daydream segment (+0.4). Signaled in second third (−0.3). The daydream does not impose a ticking clock or constrain tactics; it is a permissive frame rather than a pressure. Swappable with "meditation" or "trance" (−0.6). Closure linkage is weak—the daydream "gently recedes" but does not shape the final choice (ornamental, −0.5). Net ~3.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Motivation (to rediscover lost joy) is signaled early ("her motivation was a quiet ache") and drives the pilgrimage. Multiple beats: travel, projection, realization ("lost joy flooded her"), promise to return (+1.4). Early signal (+0.7), causal pressure (the desire shapes her method and the fragment's use, +0.9), closure linkage (the rediscovery is articulated at the end, +1.0). However, the motivation is more told than dramatized in conflicting micro-choices; friction between wants and costs is abstract (−0.6). Net ~6.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Tone (pensive mirth) is present: "a wave of pensive mirth washed over her—thoughtful sorrow for time's passage harmonizing with bubbling joy." The lyric register and mixed emotional valence (sorrow + joy) recur. Two beats: the wave of pensive mirth, the final "quiet peace warming her chest" (+0.9). Signaled late (second third, −0.3). The tone modulates with pressure (contemplative → tearful gratitude → peaceful, +0.5) and charges the final image (+0.8). However, "pensive mirth" is stated rather than consistently embodied in rhythm and diction (label-only, −0.3). Net ~5.9.</comment>
