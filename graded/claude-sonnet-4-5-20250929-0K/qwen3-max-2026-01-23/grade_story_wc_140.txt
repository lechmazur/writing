<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior life is vivid and particular—"quiet, persistent hunger to discover the texture of memories" grounds motivation in sensory archaeology rather than generic redemption. However, the character remains largely an observer-archivist without on-page contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene; his reverence for fragments never conflicts with another need or fear that would create genuine internal friction. The final choice to continue collecting is consistent but not earned through a dramatized cost that forecloses a live alternative. Embodied emotion is present ("bones aching with damp cold") but the piece leans heavily on lyric reflection rather than micro-choices under immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (pattern-taught layering of fragments toward a final reconfiguration). The piece signals its method early—collecting and layering—and the poison label arrival at the midpoint deepens the protagonist's archival practice by adding Dr. Aris Thorne's story. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the protagonist finds rhythm and purpose in witnessing, the final image crystallizes his stance. However, the cost is oblique—no visible sacrifice or foreclosed path on the page, only the assertion that he has "found his rhythm." The tidal structure provides temporal scaffolding, but the narrative lacks a meaningful tightening or trade-off that would elevate closure into high bands. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph; no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is vivid and specific: "steel cliffs," "moss-streaked containers," "narrow canyons" create a concrete maze. The setting functions as micro-archive, each "dent and scratch a sentence," and the tidal rhythm structures the protagonist's routine, pressuring his twice-daily retreat. The poison label is discovered "caught in chain-link near Pier Seven," grounding the object in spatial detail. The setting does not constrain a choice at closure—he simply melts back into the maze—so the piece stays below the 9+ gate, but the environment charges mood and reinforces the theme of erasure and layering without becoming postcard description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to honor erased histories by collecting and layering fragments, anchoring his own unmoored identity. The poison label serves as a keystone that deepens his practice, adding Dr. Aris Thorne's story to his archive. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as density increase—the new fragment reweights his purpose from abstract witnessing to intimate reconstruction. However, no on-page tightening or trade-off narrows his options or forces a sacrifice; he continues his routine without visible cost or a live alternative foreclosed. The piece demonstrates commitment but not agency-driven pressure that would push it into high bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—memory as texture, witness as purpose, erasure versus preservation—emerges organically from the protagonist's archival practice and the contrast between "scandalous footnote" and "intimate truth." The poison label and Dr. Thorne's reconstructed moment offer a non-literal answer to the question of what survives erasure. However, the final paragraph edges toward explicit thesis: "His purpose was witness—to ensure the texture of memory survived erasure" reads close to a thematic summary rather than letting the image speak. The piece resists easy morals and embraces ambiguity around the protagonist's own erasure, but the closing lines border on over-articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV is stable single third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "the industrial groan of cranes was not noise but punctuation," "every rust stain on container walls held the ghost of a story." Diction is controlled, lyric, and consistent—sensory archaeology filters everything. Distance modulates purposefully, moving from external observation to interior layering when the protagonist closes his eyes to reconstruct Dr. Thorne's memory. No dialogue appears. Reflection is extensive (~40% of the text) but anchored to present stimuli (the poison label, the tidal rhythm, the container maze) and interleaved with micro-actions (smoothing the label, placing it in the tin box, standing and gazing). Under the BRR reflection-led exception, the piece avoids penalty and maintains momentum through its accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high: "death certificate error survivor whose legal erasure had gifted him a nameless identity" packs backstory into one efficient clause. However, template cadence and synonym loops appear: multiple sentences open with "He [verb]" across the piece, and the poison-label beat recycles "fragment" and "texture" without adding new pressure. "Fragile mosaics," "erased histories," "unmoored spirit" edge toward stock metaphor strings in a lyric register. The final third repeats "fragment" and "whisper" in adjacent lines without progression, triggering paraphrase-loop and template-cadence penalties (−0.6 to −0.8 in Q7). Figurative language is dense but occasionally strained: "steel cliffs" and "salt-laced wind carried fragmented sentences" work, but "vessels of memory" in the penultimate section feels generic. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The premise—a legally erased man collecting fragments to honor forgotten lives—offers a fresh synthesis of archival witness and existential drift. The choice to filter reality through sensory archaeology ("the specific grit of gravel underfoot during a farewell") and to reconstruct Dr. Thorne's intimate truth rather than her scandalous footnote demonstrates emotional specificity and thematic commitment. However, the core emotional arc (lonely archivist finds purpose in witnessing) follows a familiar template, and the piece does not take bold structural or perspectival risks that would heighten stakes beyond the lyric mode. The transformation is sincere but incremental rather than revelatory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Death certificate error survivor: Setup clear in second paragraph ("legal erasure had gifted him a nameless identity"). Development weak—the erasure grants him anonymity to move through the port but never constrains a choice or creates a visible trade-off in the middle beats. Payoff ornamental—referenced in the final third ("His own erased history was a constant hollow") but does not shape the ending action or image. The element provides backstory motivation but remains swappable with other forms of marginalization (homelessness, undocumented status) without altering the arc. Two gates (setup, payoff mention) cap eligibility ~6.0; lack of middle development and swappability lower to mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Label from poison bottle: Setup late (~40% mark, "Today's receding tide revealed a new fragment...a label from a poison bottle"). Development strong—the label triggers the protagonist's layering process, he recalls other fragments about Dr. Thorne, and weaves them into her intimate memory. Payoff present—he places the label in his tin box alongside other fragments. The object drives one key turn (the reconstruction of Dr. Thorne's story) and charges the middle beat with specificity ("Aconite," "delicate sketch of monkshood flowers"). Late introduction (−0.4) and single-beat involvement prevent higher scores; the label does not recur in the ending image. All three gates met; eligible above 6.0; causal pressure and specificity lift into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Erased histories: Setup immediate ("erased histories" named explicitly in paragraph 5, "fragile mosaics of lives the port had forgotten"). Development functional—the concept frames the protagonist's practice and Dr. Thorne's story is positioned as an "erased history" versus the port's scandalous memory. Payoff explicit—"the core of erased histories" and "archive of the ephemeral" anchor the closing beats. However, the concept operates primarily as theme and label rather than constraining choices or altering tactics on the page; the protagonist's actions (collecting, layering, placing in tin) would be identical if framed as "forgotten stories" or "lost lives." Two gates (setup, payoff) allow ~6.0 ceiling; swappability and theme-only function keep score in mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Filters reality differently: Setup in fourth paragraph ("He filtered reality differently; the industrial groan of cranes was not noise but punctuation"). Development moderate—the attribute enables his perceptual signature (hearing "fragmented sentences" in wind, seeing "ghost of a story" in rust stains) and justifies his method. Payoff weak—final paragraph mentions filtering fog "not as obscurity but as possibility" but this is a decorative reprise, not a choice-constraining moment. The trait is specific and consistent but functions primarily as lens description rather than creating visible trade-offs or costs. All three gates present; eligibility above 6.0; lack of causal pressure or cost caps in low 6s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Layer: Setup early (paragraph 5, "began to layer the fragments into fragile mosaics"). Development strong—the action is the protagonist's core method; when he receives the poison label, he "began to layer them, weaving whispers with the label's tangible reality." Payoff direct—"listen, layer, remember" in the penultimate paragraph and the act of placing the label into the tin box is a physical instantiation of layering. The action drives two distinct beats (initial archival routine, Dr. Thorne reconstruction) and is irreplaceable—the story's logic depends on this accretive process. All three gates met; beat involvement and causal pressure lift into 7+ band; not quite indispensable (alternative verbs like "weave" or "gather" could substitute with moderate rewrites) so mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>By collecting fragments of overheard stories: Setup clear (paragraph 5, "by collecting fragments of overheard stories—a dockworker's sigh...a sailor's drunken toast"). Development present—the method is enacted when he recalls "an old fisherman's tremor speaking of 'the botanist's daughter,'" "a whispered rumor near customs," and layers them with the poison label. Payoff in final beats—"Tomorrow, the tide would bring new fragments...and he would listen, layer, remember." The method shapes his practice and is signaled early, but it does not constrain a choice or create a visible cost; the story would function similarly if fragments were written notes or found objects. All three gates met; functional but somewhat replaceable; mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Towering labyrinth of shipping containers in a port city: Setup immediate (opening sentence). Development strong—the containers structure his routine ("his shelter between two moss-streaked containers"), provide hiding and anonymity, and the spatial choreography is concrete ("narrow canyons," "Pier Seven," "chain-link"). Payoff direct—final images return to the maze ("melted back into the maze," "steel corridors") and the containers are reframed as "vessels of memory." The setting enables his archival practice and charges the ending, though it does not constrain a specific choice at closure. All three gates met; beat involvement and closure linkage push into low 7s; not quite indispensable (another marginal space—abandoned factory, sewer network—could substitute) so mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Across the rhythm of tides: Setup clear (opening mentions "the only clock was the rhythm of the tides"). Development present—"Twice daily, aligned with the tide's retreat, he retreated to his shelter"; "Today's receding tide revealed a new fragment"; "The tide was turning now." Payoff weak—closing mentions tide ("Tomorrow, the tide would bring new fragments") but as a future promise, not a live pressure at closure. The timeframe provides structure and pacing but does not tighten a decision or create urgency; the protagonist's choices are contemplative and unrushed. Two gates (setup, development); lyric reprise without cost caps ~6.3; lack of tactical pressure keeps score in mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>To discover the texture of memories: Setup early (third paragraph, "quiet, persistent hunger to discover the texture of memories—the specific grit of gravel underfoot"). Development strong—the motivation drives his entire practice; the poison label offers him the chance to reconstruct "the texture of her memory" with sensory specificity. Payoff explicit—"to honor the sensory truth of a life beyond rumor or record" and "he had found his rhythm." The desire is dramatized through action (smoothing the label, layering fragments, placing them in the tin) but never conflicted—no competing want or cost tests the motivation. All three gates met; causal pressure present but no friction or trade-off; mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Nameless identity (tone): Setup immediate ("nameless identity" in second paragraph, "a nameless man" in final section). Development weak—the tone of anonymity and erasure is consistent but does not modulate with pressure or create tension; the protagonist's namelessness is a static condition, not a shifting charge. Payoff present—"nameless man giving weight to the weightless" anchors the ending but as a thematic label rather than a tonal shift that reweights the final image. The element reads as attribute or theme rather than tone; treating it as tone, it is stable but does not charge the closure. Two gates (setup, payoff); lack of modulation and ornamental use keep score in mid-5s.</comment>
