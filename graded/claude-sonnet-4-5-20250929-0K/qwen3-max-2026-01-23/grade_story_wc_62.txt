<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her profession provides concrete grounding, but the emotional progression relies heavily on revelation rather than contradictory impulses in scene. The spectral mentor device reduces internal struggle—Lyra offers wisdom that Elara accepts without genuine friction or cost. The final memorial design emerges as insight rather than hard-won choice that forecloses a live path. Embodied emotion appears ("Tears traced warm paths") but the interiority often summarizes state ("fiercely meditative") rather than dramatizing simultaneous contradictory wants.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through layered images (monarchs, ribbons, poems) toward a thematic reweighting. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—Elara discovers the memorial's form and carries it forward as "compass forged from memory," a stance crystallization with felt purpose. Orientation anchors quickly (greenhouse, dusk, carver), and the arc tightens through retracing memory to present realization. Cost is implied (the weight of 37 lives, the sacred work ahead) but not sharply dramatized as a foreclosed option or visible sacrifice on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse is vivid and purposeful: "skeletal rose bushes," "moss-stained bench," "weathered glass panes" anchor the space with texture. The monarch migration functions as charged setting-as-metaphor, pressuring Elara's insight about collective grief. The woven ribbon roll and the family dinner table appear as micro-settings that enable memory and shape the final design. Spatial choreography is clean, sensory detail (jasmine, damp soil, rosemary chicken) is selective, and the setting participates directly in the closure image (monarchs as "living constellation").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clearly signaled: to find a memorial form that honors collective grief. The piece deepens rather than escalates—Elara moves from wrestling with the commission to discovering the circular sandstone path design through memory and metaphor. Agency is internal (retracing, listening, seeing the parallel), and the tightening occurs when Lyra's gesture and the monarchs crystallize the answer. Cost is conceptual (the sacred responsibility, the weight of 37 lives) but not dramatized as a tactical trade-off or visible forfeiture that narrows live options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: poems, ribbons, migration, the circular path. The final design—a walkable memorial with inscribed fragments and colored resin—answers the question of collective grief's shape without stating a moral. Lyra's line "The shape of collective grief is connection—a migration toward light" edges toward thematic echo but is cushioned by prior imagery. Subtext operates in silence ("thundering calm"), gesture (Lyra's translucent hand), and the ribbon roll's evolving meaning. The ending offers resonance through the image of butterflies as "living constellation of hope."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara with controlled distance. Voice carries lyric texture ("dusk bled indigo," "heart-opening clarity") that fits the reflective tone, but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("unstoppable pattern of communal purpose") that reads more thematic than character-particular. Perceptual signature is present (stone workshop dust, white scars of granite) but the internal narration often explains rather than shows perception degrading or shifting under pressure. No dialogue on the page; Lyra's spectral voice is narrated as resonance "within Elara's heart," avoiding head-hopping but flattening interactive pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is polished with varied rhythm and vivid images ("river of orange and black," "thundering calm"). Information density is high in the memory sequence, but several lines loop thematically: "fiercely meditative" appears twice, "sacred" recurs five times in the final third, and "shape" is repeated without fresh reweighting. Template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("She felt... smelled... saw..."). No major clarity breaks, but the closure paragraph stacks abstractions ("burden," "compass," "sacred creation," "tribute," "hope") that dilute propulsion. Filter verbs ("watching," "knew") are present but voice-motivated and do not stack heavily.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The gravestone carver discovering a living memorial through spectral mentorship and butterfly migration offers a fresh synthesis. The circular sandstone path with poem fragments and resin channels is specific and visually memorable. However, the spectral-mentor-guides-protagonist and collective-grief-as-shared-journey frameworks are familiar, and the story does not radically transform them—Elara's insight arrives through revelation rather than a risky, non-obvious choice. Emotional truth is present, but the arc follows a meditative template: solitary struggle → mentor wisdom → nature metaphor → epiphany → resolve.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara's profession anchors the premise and her choices (retracing memory, designing the circular path) drive key turns. She is present in setup, middle reflection, and closure. However, her decisions are primarily internal revelations rather than high-cost tactical choices—removing her carver identity would weaken the memorial's credibility but the core arc (meditation → insight → resolve) could function with another reflective profession.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ribbon roll appears in lap (setup), memory of grandmother tying verses (middle), and is "carefully rolled" with "sacred purpose" at closure. It evolves from personal heirloom to design inspiration (colored resin channels echo ribbons). However, Elara does not physically handle or use the roll in multiple beats—it is held, remembered, then rolled once. The object charges the final design but is not causally active across distinct on-page actions.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Spectral mentorship shapes the middle beat: Lyra's command "Retrace the path of memory" triggers Elara's reflection, and her gesture toward monarchs catalyzes the insight. Setup is immediate (Lyra emerges), and closure nods to "a mentor's gentle presence." Yet Lyra functions as oracle more than pressure—Elara accepts guidance without friction, and the concept does not constrain or complicate tactics. Removing Lyra and making the insight self-directed would require only modest edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Fiercely meditative" is labeled twice but not dramatized as a trait that constrains or enables action with cost. The attribute describes Elara's approach (listening to stone, turning focus inward) but does not create a visible trade-off—she does not sacrifice speed for depth, nor does her meditation fail or demand a price. The trait supports tone but remains ornamental to the causal chain.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Retrace" is signaled early (Lyra's command), executed in the memory sequence (dinner table, poems, ribbons), and directly yields the insight that monarchs mirror collective grief. The action drives the middle turn and shapes the circular memorial design (visitors "retracing steps"). Removing this exact action would collapse the causal link between family custom and the final form. Cost is conceptual (Elara must revisit grief) but legible.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The family custom of trading poems is seeded in setup (ribbon roll, "cherished family custom"), anchors the memory sequence (oak table, candlelight, grandmother's ritual), and informs the closure design (pavers inscribed with poem fragments). The method shapes the memorial's form and appears across three beats. However, the custom is remembered rather than enacted on the page—Elara does not perform the ritual in present action, limiting its tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The greenhouse is established immediately ("ancient greenhouse as dusk bled indigo"), provides sanctuary from the stone workshop, and houses the spectral encounter and memory work. The space's qualities (skeletal rose bushes, moss-stained bench) are referenced at closure and the setting's stillness supports the meditative tone. The greenhouse does not constrain a tactical choice (Elara could reflect elsewhere), but it charges the final image and differentiates this scene from her workshop, making it essential to the story's texture and resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The butterfly migration is visually present throughout: opening image, middle metaphor (Lyra gestures toward wings), and closure ("final monarch clusters lifted," "living constellation"). The timeframe provides thematic resonance (migration as collective journey) but does not tighten decisions—Elara's reflection unfolds at her own pace, and the monarchs' southward movement does not impose a deadline or urgency. Time is atmospheric rather than a tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation is signaled early ("to carve a memorial capturing the shape of the town's collective grief") and drives every beat: wrestling with the commission, retracing memory, seeing the monarchs as metaphor, designing the circular path. The desire is dramatized through internal struggle and the final design embodies the answer. Cost is implied (the weight of 37 lives, the sacred responsibility) but not sharply dramatized as competing wants or a visible forfeiture that narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Thundering calm" is named once (family dinner moment: "a silence heavy with understanding yet utterly peaceful") and echoed in the final paragraph ("tribute woven from... thundering calm"). The tone attempts stillness layered with emotional weight, and the prose maintains meditative pacing. However, the phrase functions more as label than embodied texture—pressure does not modulate distinctly across turns, and the final image ("living constellation... through the vast, compassionate dark") shifts toward hope without sharpening the paradox of thunder and calm.</comment>
