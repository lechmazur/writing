<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and sustained, but her interiority remains abstract—"quiet ferocity" and "decades of solitude" are asserted rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. The broadcast sequence shows goal-directed action, but the choice to send the clear signal feels inevitable rather than earned by visible internal conflict. Hemlock and Lena offer brief secondary pressure, yet their responses are told in summary rather than dramatized with micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story anchors who/where/when early and teaches a mosaic structure (observatory → Oakhaven → citadel → back) with legible transitions. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the ionosphere-clearing miracle and the vault discovery, reweighting the dominant stake (ancient knowledge versus rigid doctrine) with on-page cost—children's laughter and Hemlock's gratitude charge the final image. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Elara's isolation transforms into collaborative unfolding) with felt cost visible in her tears and the mosaic built from "fragmented frequencies." One meaningful deepening occurs when the twenty-three-second clarity lands the solution, tightening options and foregrounding the collaborative tapestry theme.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The observatory's brass dome, churning clouds, and cobalt portico anchor early with vivid sensory detail filtered through Elara's visionary perspective. The cobalt glass constrains her method (transforming chaos into meaning) and charges the final image when it catches sunrise, casting "a long, hopeful shadow across the star charts." Spatial choreography across observatory, Oakhaven orchard, and citadel remains coherent. The orchard's willow and moss-stone constrain the climactic choice at solstice noon, elevating the setting from backdrop to active participant in closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unlocking ancient knowledge to counter Kael's rigid doctrine—is signaled early and tightens through the ionosphere miracle, which narrows options to a single clear transmission. The vault discovery is a meaningful on-page reversal driven by Elara's agency (the broadcast) with visible cost: her exhaustion and tears, the erosion of Kael's doctrine, and the children's awe. Hemlock's variant allegiance and Lena's secret recording provide secondary pressure that complicates but does not resolve. The escalation reads coherently under the Accumulative lens: density increases, then the pattern breaks when clarity arrives, reweighting the stake with undeniable cost in the collaborative unfolding.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the cobalt portico's transformation of chaos into meaning, the fragmented frequencies demanding active listening, and the vault's literal unearthing of forgotten crops—no thesis statement intrudes. The closing image of the portico casting "a long, hopeful shadow across the star charts" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question (salvation through overlooked time) without moralizing. "Gritty whimsy lived in this truth: salvation arrived not on a banner, but in a child's laugh echoing up through broken static" risks stating the theme aloud, though it remains anchored to the particular (laugh, static) rather than abstract. Variant allegiance is explored through Hemlock's split loyalty and Lena's dangerous curiosity, adding complexity without false equivalence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable on Elara with clear section-break switches to Oakhaven and the citadel; no mid-paragraph head-hopping. The prose carries a lyrical, prophetic texture ("a river of metaphor and memory flowing against the wind's howl") that matches Elara's visionary role and modulates with pressure—compressed, urgent when the ionosphere clears. Hemlock's "bones ached for the old ways" and Lena's "heart racing with dangerous curiosity" briefly access their interiority, yet these moments read as tightly controlled focal shifts at section breaks rather than leakage. Elara's prophetic broadcast dialogue ("When the raven's shadow crosses the silent bell") feels purposefully stylized, though it risks opacity; the payoff (willow, moss-stone) justifies the method. Minor: "gritty whimsy" as a phrase in the penultimate paragraph intrudes slightly on the established lyric register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high, but several lines carry template cadence: "Her sanctuary, a stormlit observatory above clouds, hummed..." opens with appositive structure echoed in "This object was her lens, her oracle..." and "Her motivation burned with quiet ferocity..." (−0.4). "The timeframe of her vigil spanned the very rise of Prophet Kael—a man of absolute clarity whose doctrine..." stacks modifiers and risks register drift into exposition. The vault discovery beat ("Tears of awe fell as children traced carvings of forgotten crops—a tangible hope unearthed from shadow and whisper") is vivid but "tears of awe" and "tangible hope" edge toward stock phrasing (−0.3). No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks. The final image is clean and propulsive. Cumulative artifact penalty in Q7: −0.7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The mosaic structure (observatory, multiple locales, ionosphere miracle) and the specific method (fragmented radio frequencies, cobalt portico transforming lightning into legible shadows) offer fresh synthesis. The vault payoff (irrigation diagrams, forgotten crops) grows from established causality. However, the core arc—lone visionary broadcasting wisdom, skeptical authority figure, grassroots revival—echoes familiar template beats without deep transformation. The "gritty whimsy" tone label and "ancient shadows" as wisdom-source risk abstraction. The cobalt portico's dual function (literal tool, thematic lens) and the variant allegiance concept (Hemlock, Lena) add specificity, yet the ending's collaborative-tapestry resolution feels somewhat predictable given the setup. Within-band: no bold risk elevates stakes beyond competent execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara (lonely visionary) is present throughout and her choices create key turns: broadcasting fragmented riddles, continuing despite decades of solitude, leaning into the microphone when the ionosphere clears. The vault discovery and erosion of Kael's doctrine trace directly to her agency. Early signal (first line), beats across three segments (observatory broadcast, ionosphere miracle, final tears), closure linkage (she weeps, no longer isolated), causal pressure (narrows options to the clear transmission), cost connection (exhaustion, tears, collaborative unfolding). All three gates met. +0.8 early, +1.4 beats, +1.2 causal, +1.4 closure, +0.5 cost. Base 3.0 + 5.3 = 8.3, rounded to 7.2 after accounting for some choices being told rather than dramatized in real-time (−0.6 summary use) and the final realization feeling slightly inevitable (−0.5 swappability for any prophet-visionary role).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cobalt glass portico appears early (second paragraph), is used in two beats (transforms chaos into meaning for the broadcast; catches sunrise in the final image), and returns with reweighted meaning (from oracle to hopeful shadow-caster). Setup, development, and payoff gates met. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, specificity (mineral-infused, captures lightning) +0.5. Base 3.0 + 3.0 = 6.0. However, the middle beat (broadcast reliance) is asserted rather than shown handling the portico during the act (−0.4 ornamental use in the broadcast itself, though it bookends well). Additionally, the portico's mechanics (how exactly it makes shadows legible) remain abstract, reducing irreplaceability slightly (−0.3). Final: 6.0 + 3.0 − 0.7 = 8.3, capped at 6.8 by swappability concern (could be another divination tool with minor edits, though the azure/lightning specificity helps).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Variant allegiance is signaled early (Hemlock's split loyalty, Lena's secret recording) and the concept constrains on-page tactics: Hemlock leads the village despite respecting Kael; Lena records despite Commander Valerius's scorn. The vault discovery and doctrine erosion are shaped by this divergence. Setup and development gates met; closure participation is implicit (collaborative unfolding depends on variant allegiance). Early +0.6, two beats (Hemlock, Lena responses) +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage (doctrine eroded by questioning followers) +0.9. Base 3.0 + 3.2 = 6.2. Mild friction: the concept is more thematic accent than dramatized dilemma with visible cost in a single scene (−0.3 ornamental in middle stretch, as Hemlock and Lena's turns are summarized quickly rather than sustained under pressure).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Lyrically prophetic is signaled early ("her voice shifted into its lyrically prophetic cadence") and constrains the broadcast method: metaphor-laden riddles that demand active listening. The attribute enables the fragmented transmission and shapes the listener responses (Hemlock, Lena). Setup and development gates met; payoff occurs when the clear signal finally lands instructions. Early +0.5, two beats (initial riddle, clear solstice instruction) +0.9, causal pressure (the method demands interpretation, which Hemlock fulfills) +0.7. Base 3.0 + 2.1 = 5.1. Cost connection is present but subtle: the prophetic style risks misunderstanding, yet the story does not dramatize a failed interpretation or visible tradeoff on the page (−0.3). Swappability: another cryptic style could substitute without major rewrites (−0.4). Final: 5.1 + 2.1 − 0.7 = 6.5, adjusted to 6.1 for label-only mention ("lyrically prophetic cadence") without embodied cost in that beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Unfold is present in Elara's goal ("unfold a different paradigm"), the broadcast strategy (fragmented words invite active unfolding), the vault discovery (gears "groaned open"), and the collaborative tapestry closure ("not her conquest, but a collaborative unfolding"). Setup, development, payoff gates met. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (the paradigm shift depends on unfolding rather than imposing) +1.0, closure linkage (the mosaic metaphor and final line directly invoke unfolding) +1.2. Base 3.0 + 4.3 = 7.3. The action is more conceptual than physical (no single dramatic unfold-act like opening a scroll or door as the climax), which limits irreplaceability slightly, but the thematic and structural recursion is strong enough to hold the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Fragmented radio frequencies are signaled early ("she broadcast her insights through fragmented radio frequencies"), mechanics matter (storm static shatters words into riddles; ionosphere clearing allows the unbroken transmission), and the method shapes all three segments (Elara's broadcast, Hemlock's radio fragment, the clear signal at the climax). Setup, development, payoff gates met. Early +0.7, three beats (broadcast, fragment reception, clear transmission) +1.4, causal pressure (the method demands active listening and drives the vault discovery) +1.3, closure linkage (children's laughter flows through broken static in the final image) +1.4, specificity (ionosphere, twenty-three seconds) +0.6. Base 3.0 + 5.4 = 8.4. Minor: the radio is a passive receiver for Hemlock and Lena; the method's mechanical constraints on Elara's end (how she modulates the signal) are told rather than shown (−0.4 summary). Final: 8.4 − 0.4 = 8.0, adjusted to 7.6 given the middle beat (Hemlock/Lena) summarizes reception rather than dramatizing signal negotiation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stormlit observatory above clouds is anchored in the opening line, provides resources (brass dome, tempest energy, star charts) that Elara uses, and charges the final image (portico catches sun, casting shadow across charts). Setup, development, payoff gates met. Early +0.8, two beats (opening workspace, closing sunrise) +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, specificity (churning cloud ocean, brass-ringed dome) +0.5. Base 3.0 + 3.2 = 6.2. However, the setting does not constrain a middle choice in a pressured way—Elara's broadcast mechanics and Hemlock's orchard are the active pressure sites, while the observatory is more atmospheric frame (−0.5 postcard use in middle stretch). The final image elevates it, but the middle gap lowers development credit slightly.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Timeframe (across the rise of Prophet Kael) is signaled early and contextualized ("decades of solitude," Kael's doctrine as foil), but it does not tighten decisions with a live clock. The solstice noon deadline is the only time-sensitive beat, and it arrives late. Setup gate met (early reference), development gate weak (no mid-story time pressure alters tactics), payoff gate met (solstice noon). Early +0.5, one beat (solstice) +0.4, closure linkage (the vault opens at the appointed hour) +0.7. Base 3.0 + 1.6 = 4.6. The timeframe is more backdrop than constraint—removing "across the rise of a prophet" would not break story logic, as the core is the single broadcast → vault arc (−0.6 swappability). "Weeks later" is vague and does not track causally (−0.3 vague time). Final: 4.6 + 1.6 − 0.9 = 5.3, adjusted to 4.8 for told-only "decades" without on-page cost tied to duration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>To shape a new dawn using ancient shadows is signaled early ("Her motivation burned with quiet ferocity") and drives the broadcast, vault discovery, and collaborative-tapestry closure. Setup, development, payoff gates met. Early +0.6, three beats (broadcast, vault, new dawn arrival) +1.4, causal pressure (the goal shapes the fragmented method and the pursuit of the willow's shadow) +1.0, closure linkage (the dawn and shadow metaphor recur in the final image) +1.1. Base 3.0 + 4.1 = 7.1. Friction: the motivation is told ("quiet ferocity," "decades of solitude") rather than dramatized through contradictory wants or visible tradeoffs in the opening beat (−0.5 told-only in setup). The vault success feels somewhat inevitable given the clear signal, reducing felt conflict between cost and desire (−0.4 friction between wants and costs is asserted, not embodied). Final: 7.1 − 0.9 = 6.2, adjusted to 6.9 given strong closure linkage and beat involvement outweigh the told-only friction in the opening.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Gritty whimsy is present in the juxtaposition of tempest/brass dome with "dancing shadows...her only true companions," "salvation arrived...in a child's laugh echoing up through broken static," and the phrase "gritty whimsy lived in this truth" in the penultimate paragraph. The tone modulates: lyrical and prophetic in the broadcast, urgent when the ionosphere clears, tender in the vault discovery, wistful in the final image. Setup and payoff gates met; development is sustained across beats. Early +0.5, tone shifts across three segments +0.9, closure linkage (the laugh/static line charges the ending) +0.9. Base 3.0 + 2.3 = 5.3. However, the phrase "gritty whimsy" stated on the page is a label rather than embodied texture (−0.3 label-only), and the "child's laugh" risks sentimentality that undercuts the grit (−0.4 tonal drift toward wholesomeness in the vault beat). The portico's sunrise shadow recovers some whimsy, but the tonal coherence wobbles slightly. Final: 5.3 + 2.3 − 0.7 = 6.9, adjusted to 6.3 given the on-page label and minor drift.</comment>
