<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to create meaning through kintsugi repair is clear and sustained, embodied through the physical ritual. The memory-quilting feels more described than enacted—interiority often tells us Lyra's moments rather than showing how these memories constrain or complicate his present repair choices. The final peace feels announced ("Uncertainty dissolved, replaced by profound peace") rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Micro-choices exist but the arc trends toward therapeutic summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening beat. The drive lens reads accumulative-textural: density builds through paired fracture-memory stitches until the final golden ignition. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant)—the mended sparrow's glow and calmed sea reconfigure oblivion's edge into "a threshold illuminated by golden seams." Cost is conceptual and felt (acceptance of dissolution, transformation of grief) rather than a decisive action, but the image lands with undeniable pressure and the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The acid-sea workshop is vivid and purposeful: the shearing gear incites the crisis, the centuries-old statue provides the kintsugi map, and the raging-then-calmed emerald sea charges the final image. Sensory selection (ozone, acid mist, tortured brass) reflects urgency. The ceramic sparrow functions as micro-setting, constraining the repair ritual and charging closure. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—conjuring meaning before oblivion—is signaled early and sustained. Escalation proceeds through accumulative deepening: each matched fracture-pockmark pair tightens the ritual's cost and Kael's emotional investment. The final drop of resin ("the promise: to remember the wholeness she brought, not the breaking") forecloses retreat with visible emotional and conceptual cost. Agency is renunciation and endurance under mortal pressure, fitting the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the kintsugi ritual: breaks as sacred history, gold as visible love. The final image reweights grief into sanctuary without stating a moral. However, late-paragraph summary ("Meaning had been conjured," "indestructible sanctuary within") verbalizes the thematic answer rather than trusting the glowing sparrow and calmed sea to carry it. The prompt concept ("kintsugi intentions") occasionally reads as imported language rather than organic discovery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and Kael's perceptual signature (alchemist's precision, grief-sharpened focus) is consistent. Narration remains within his plausible lexicon except for occasional elevations ("topography of endurance," "quilting memories" as concept-label). The final paragraph's summary voice ("Uncertainty dissolved, replaced by profound peace settling deep within his bones") drifts toward therapeutic tell rather than staying in embodied pressure. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and rhythmically controlled through most beats. Information density is high in the ritual sequence. However, the final third accumulates paraphrase loops: "Meaning had been conjured. Oblivion's edge was no longer…" / "Uncertainty dissolved, replaced by…" / "he carried an indestructible sanctuary within—a truth meticulously quilted…" restates closure across three consecutive moves without advancing pressure. Template stems ("He began," "He quilted," "This chip is," "This gold is") cluster in the middle third but remain voice-motivated. The loops in the closure zone trigger −0.6 and disallow 9+ globally per artifact rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Kintsugi as grief ritual is familiar but executed with specificity through the statue-pockmark matching mechanic. The acid-sea workshop and memory-quilting trait add fresh angles. Emotional arc and thematic insight feel genuine but the closure summary ("to remember the wholeness she brought, not the breaking") verges on platitude. The final sanctuary metaphor is earned but not non-obvious. Risk is present in the lyric accumulation but the ending retreats into articulation rather than trusting image alone.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Kael's choices drive the ritual: selecting pockmarks, applying resin, narrating each stitch. His final exhale and acceptance alter his internal stance with visible cost. Present in setup, development, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ceramic sparrow is handled across multiple beats: clutched, repaired fracture by fracture, ignites at closure, and held warm in the final line. Its breaks constrain the ritual method and its glow charges the ending. Irreplaceable and causally active.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kintsugi intentions shape the repair ritual on the page: "honoring breaks as sacred history," matching fractures, celebrating chips rather than erasing them. The concept narrows Kael's method and reweights grief into mosaic. However, late summary ("kintsugi intentions meant…") tells rather than letting the enacted stitches carry the weight alone.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Quilts memories together" enables the ritual: stitching Lyra's seventh birthday, rain-soaked afternoon, whispered secrets into the ceramic fractures. The trait constrains his method and each memory-stitch incurs emotional cost. It is enacted on the page, not merely labeled, though the mechanic is more described than dramatized in choice pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Narration threads through the entire ritual, providing structure and escalation: "Align this wing fracture…" "Match this body crack…" "This chip is not a flaw…" Each spoken line advances the kintsugi sequence and intensifies commitment. The action is causally irreplaceable and shapes the closure's reverent tone.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Matching pockmarks to fractures is the ritual's mechanic, signaled early and sustained: temple crescent, collarbone cluster, star-shaped cheek mark, heart indentation. The method constrains each repair choice and charges the statue as witness. Specificity matters; swapping for generic guidance would break the ritual's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The gears-and-cogs workshop incites crisis (sheared drive gear, acid mist), supplies the statue constraint, and undergoes transformation (violent shuddering → reverent stillness) at closure. The acid sea mirrors the charm's glow in the final image. Setting pressures every beat and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Between breaths held underwater" frames urgency in the opening and late ("Lungs burning, vision narrowing") but does not function as a live clock altering tactics beat by beat. The ritual unfolds without breath-count pressure or asphyxiation choices. The timeframe is more lyric metaphor than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation to "conjure meaning from oblivion's edge" is declared early and dramatized through the repair ritual. Each memory-stitch enacts the conjuring with visible emotional cost. The final sanctuary image fulfills the desire. Friction exists between grief and acceptance but could be sharper in contradictory impulses during peak beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Dire enchantment" coheres: mortal peril (acid, sinking workshop, breath held) braided with ritual magic (golden resin, memory stitching, luminous ignition). Tone modulates from crisis tremor to reverent precision to final peace, supporting the accumulative lens. The glow and calmed sea charge the ending with enchanted consequence.</comment>
