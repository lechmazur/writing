<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Aris's gift is established clearly and his motive to "sandpaper rough memories" drives the action. However, interiority leans heavily on metaphor ("emotions were emotionally contagious through touch," "mental sandpaper") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final subsuming sequence operates more as a described process than a dramatized choice with competing impulses. Internal conflict reads as narrated method rather than simultaneous warring desires.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: rain → puddles → tidal pool → coral pavilion builds through linked imagery toward a closure image where ice melts and the glow shifts from cold blue to amber. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines. However, the closure unit—remorse alchemized into "tempered truth"—is asserted rather than shown through a decisive on-page change in Aris's options or stance. The cost is told ("Weight settled deep in his bones") but not dramatized as a forfeited path or visible consequence that alters subsequent action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Desert fortress after rain is vivid and purposeful: puddles as mirrors, damp sand, night-blooming cereus perfume anchor sensory texture. The coral pavilion's ice and the tidal pool constrain Aris's method and charge the final image when ice melts to amber. Spatial choreography (courtyard → western dune → archway) remains clear. Micro-setting—the body and the pavilion surface—drives the peak beat when Aris presses his palm flat and the stored remorse surges.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—processing the king's stored remorse—is signaled early and culminates in the subsuming sequence. One meaningful tightening occurs when Aris digs into sand, meets ice, and the emotion floods him. However, the resolution unfolds through narrated internal technique ("adding imagined warmth of forgiveness") rather than a visible choice that forecloses an option or tests commitment. Pressure is coherent but lacks a pivot where agency alters tactics or cost becomes undeniable on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of refining grief through disciplined patience emerges through specific images: slow-rising dough, water shaping stone, sandpaper softening peaks. The coral pavilion and tidal pool recur with shifted meaning at closure. However, the ending edges toward direct statement—"polished its sharpest shard until it could be held without cutting"—that borders on moralizing the lesson. The final image of the single melted drop and the fortress's sigh offer resonance, but "preserving lesson without wound" states theme rather than embodying it solely through action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyric, and purposefully heightened: "liquid sky," "bruised twilight," "emotions were emotionally contagious through touch." POV remains stable in close third; perceptual signature favors culinary and tactile metaphor (flour, consommé, desert glass). Diction stays within an elevated register throughout, which supports the fable-like tone. Purposeful compression in the subsuming sequence ("he cooked the remorse") maintains coherence. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high but mostly coherent: "spilled ink," "desert glass," "sun-baked clay." However, the subsuming beat stacks metaphors without clear physical grounding—"adding imagined warmth of forgiveness, sweetness of time, umami of hard-won wisdom"—blurring the line between concrete action and abstract summary. Paraphrase loops appear: "raw grief" / "raw pain," "stored remorse" recurs five times across adjacent paragraphs. Sentence openings vary, and rhythm supports the lyric mode, but peak-beat clarity suffers from metaphor density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—chef who tastes memories and refines emotional wounds stored in objects—offers a fresh synthesis of culinary craft and emotional alchemy. Execution leans on prompt-driven detail (coral + ice + desert + tidal pool) without fully transforming the elements into organic necessity. The king's exile memory and the unspoken dream motif feel like late reveals inserted to satisfy requirements rather than grown from prior causality. Risk-taking in the lyric register is present, but the core arc follows a familiar template: reluctant healer confronts stored trauma and emerges cleansed.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Chef Aris who can taste memories is present from the opening and his gift drives two key beats: tasting regret rings in the tidal pool and touching the coral to subsume the king's remorse. His decision to "subsume the remorse entirely" narrows options and the final state shows exhaustion and weight. Setup is early, development in the pool analysis and pavilion discovery, payoff in the melting ice and shift to amber. Causal pressure is moderate; swapping "taste" for another sensory gift would require edits but the gift's specificity—culinary metaphor throughout—ties to the resolution method. Cost is visible in trembling and slumping.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Coral icebound pavilion beneath the dunes appears after Aris digs (mid-story) and becomes the site of the climactic beat where he presses his palm, ice groans, and glow shifts from cold blue to amber. The pavilion is handled in two distinct beats: discovery and the subsuming sequence. Its properties—bleached coral, ice sheathing, cold surface—enable the stored remorse and constrain Aris's method (he must touch it to process). The object returns in the final image as a melted drop traces the archway. Closure linkage is strong; specificity (coral + ice paradox) matters. Late first appearance (~40% mark) caps potential but causal work and payoff elevate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Stored remorse is the central stake: Aris seeks to process the king's exiled-brother regret held in the pavilion. It shapes his goal and the subsuming method. However, "stored remorse" functions more as a thematic container than a mechanical stake that alters tactics beat-by-beat. The concept appears in the tidal pool discovery, the pavilion touch, and the closure melting, but the story could swap "stored remorse" for "trapped fear" or "frozen guilt" with minor lexical edits. Cost connection is moderate; the weight Aris carries is tied to the remorse but not uniquely to its "stored" quality.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Emotionally contagious through touch is stated early and demonstrated when Aris touches the coral: "phantom grief tightened his throat, tears welled for a betrayal not his own." The trait enables the peak action (he must touch to subsume) and imposes cost (he absorbs the king's pain). However, the contagion is narrated rather than shown through a visible behavioral change or immediate tactical consequence. The attribute appears in two beats (tidal pool mention, pavilion touch) but does not constrain a prior choice or force a tradeoff. Setup is early, development is present, payoff is functional but the trait feels more like a plot key than an ongoing pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Subsume is the core action of the climax: Aris "must subsume the remorse entirely, drawing its jagged essence inward to refine it." The action spans the longest beat, drives the pavilion's transformation (ice melts, glow shifts), and delivers the story's resolution. Setup occurs mid-story when the need is declared; the action itself occupies the final third. Payoff is clear. However, "subsume" could be replaced with "absorb," "dissolve," or "transmute" without breaking story logic. The specificity of the verb matters less than the general act of processing emotion. Causal pressure is strong; closure linkage is undeniable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Analyzing tidal pool formations appears in one beat: Aris kneels by the largest pool, reads "concentric rings swirled with profound regret," and the ripples point toward the western dune. The method is signaled and used to locate the pavilion, satisfying setup and development. However, the mechanics are ornamental—"emotional cartography" is a label without visible technique. The method does not recur at closure or constrain a later choice. Swapping "tidal pool analysis" for "following a vision" or "tracking energy" would require minimal edits. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Desert fortress after rain is established in the opening and provides vivid sensory anchors: darkened sandstone, puddles, damp sand, wet earth scent, night-blooming cereus. The rain-soaked environment enables the tidal pool (water shapes stone) and the damp sand Aris digs into. The fortress as a container for stored shame is thematic but does not pressure Aris's choices beat-by-beat. Micro-setting (the body, the pavilion surface) does more tactical work than the fortress itself. Setup is early, development is atmospheric, payoff is thematic ("The fortress would wake lighter"). The setting enriches but does not constrain.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"At the close of that unspoken dream" appears once mid-story and frames Aris's thirty-night arc, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. The phrase is lyric flourish rather than a pressure mechanism. No deadline, no urgency tied to the dream's end. The story could omit "unspoken dream" and run on the single rain-after evening without structural loss. Present but ornamental; no middle development or closure participation beyond the single mention.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>To sandpaper rough memories is Aris's stated motivation in paragraph three and the metaphor recurs throughout: "sandpaper rough memories," "applied mental sandpaper to the king's regret," "polished its sharpest shard." The desire drives the search, the tidal pool analysis, and the subsuming action. However, the motivation is narrated more than dramatized through conflicting wants. Aris never hesitates, doubts, or pays a visible emotional price for choosing to process the remorse; he simply executes the method. Setup is early, development is consistent, payoff is thematic. Friction between want and cost is implied ("weight settled") but not dramatized as a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Sturdy brittle appears explicitly once: "His resolve felt like sun-baked clay—strong, but capable of cracking." The duality is implied elsewhere in "Weight settled deep in his bones: sturdy yet brittle as desert glass." Tone supports the paradox of endurance and fragility, but the piece does not modulate this tension dynamically across beats. The mood is consistently lyric-elevated and contemplative; no moment where the tone cracks or shifts under pressure to embody brittleness. Setup via the clay/glass images, payoff in the final "quiet strength, sturdy enough to bear history's weight, brittle enough to honor its fragility." Present and thematically coherent but not charged by the ending's pressure.</comment>
