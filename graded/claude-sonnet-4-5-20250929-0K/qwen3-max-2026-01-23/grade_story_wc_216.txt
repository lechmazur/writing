<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and his trajectory from borrowed time to dissolution is causally earned. The interiority leans heavily on abstraction ("coarse weave," "silken slide," "gritty dust") rather than embodied contradiction; under peak pressure the texture catalog feels more lyric than dramatized internal conflict. The transition to Elara is clean but her understanding arrives as instant download rather than struggle. The final choice—embedding messages in garage-sale cards—reads more as backstory summary than on-page micro-decision that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid). Orientation anchors are present early (emerald silo, Kael, time capsule). Closure lands on-page with Elara's realization and Kael's dissolution, reweighting the "texture of time" premise with conceptual cost (his borrowed hours spent, legacy passed). One meaningful deepening occurs when the urn fragment triggers timelessness, then the final handoff crystallizes purpose. Cost is legible in Kael's dissolution and Elara's inheritance of responsibility. Minor slip: the "months" of prior garage-sale work is summarized rather than dramatized, weakening the causal chain slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The emerald silo is vividly recurring (humming core, pulsing light, final glow) and constrains the closure by housing the capsule and providing the green light into which Kael dissolves. The urn fragment and garage-sale table are tactile micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("cold, sharp edge," "sun-dappled oak table"). The "post-numerical age" world rule is asserted but not demonstrated through action or obstacle, remaining conceptual rather than lived-in.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: understanding time's texture before borrowed hours expire. The urn-fragment trigger at line 74 narrows options by casting Kael into timelessness, forcing the rediscovery beat. However, the garage-sale method is introduced retrospectively ("For months, he'd hidden truths") rather than dramatized as an on-page reversal that tests commitment. Elara's arrival provides a tightening at closure, but her instant comprehension lacks friction. One meaningful pressure point lands, but the escalation under the accumulative lens feels more thematic than tactical.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—time as felt texture rather than counted units—emerges organically from the capsule, the urn fragment, and Kael's tactile recall ("coarse weave," "silken slide"). The final card inscription and Elara's realization answer the central question without moralizing. The garage-sale method is a fresh vehicle for legacy transmission. Minor slip: "time passes not in ticks, but in textures—the velvet of peace after the storm" edges toward thematic echo, restating rather than dramatizing the premise in the climactic card text.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single POV with a clean handoff to Elara at closure; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: Kael notices textures, edges, weight. The diction ("borrowed-time timekeeper," "breathing tapestry," "pollen on the wind") sustains a lyric register throughout, avoiding register drift. Purposeful compression in the timeless-sea passage is pattern-taught and pays off at closure. Distance remains stable. Minor note: the card's direct address ("Hold it, and know:") briefly shifts into instructional voice but recovers quickly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and opening/closing lines anchor well. Information density is high in the timeless-sea passage. However, figurative language saturates most sentences ("hairline fractures spiderwebbing," "silent sea," "breathing tapestry," "pollen on the wind," "threads of borrowed time") without respite, creating texture overload in peak beats. Paraphrase loops: lines 140 and 148 restate Kael's clarity with near-synonym churn ("clarity flooded him" / "his final act must extend this understanding"). Template cadence: "He felt... He sought... He carried..." stem repetition across multiple beats. Artifacts touch the closure third, triggering the −1.7 baseline and the 9+ disallow.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The "texture of time" premise and garage-sale message method offer a fresh synthesis. Transformation of the time-capsule trope through Dr. Thorne's mortality-weaving and the post-numerical world avoids generic template. The urn fragment as anchor and the spiral symbol as key are specific and purposeful. Risk is present in the lyric accumulative structure and the post-numerical conceit. Minor derivative echo: the mentor's sacrifice woven into a mechanism and the timeless-sea passage recall familiar SFF motifs, though executed with care.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kael is present throughout, frames the opening, and his final act (placing the fragment, writing the card, dissolving) drives closure. Early signal is strong. His "borrowed time" debt constrains all choices. Two distinct beats: the urn-fragment trigger and the garage-sale card. Closure linkage is direct. Swappability is low; his timekeeper role and borrowed-time condition are irreplaceable. Cost is visible in his dissolution. Small friction: much of his key work (months of prior messages) is summarized rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The urn fragment appears in three beats: discovery (line 68), the timeless trigger (line 74), and the final placement/card (lines 186–214). Early signal, middle causal pressure (triggers the sea of moments), and strong closure linkage (the fragment is the subject of Kael's final card and Elara's inheritance). Specificity is high: the closed-eye glyph, milky white ceramic, Dr. Thorne's ashes. Irreplaceable. Cost connection is clear (Thorne's mortality, Kael's dissolution). No swappability or ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The damaged time capsule is present early (line 26), houses the urn fragment, and its "true purpose" is rediscovered (line 118). Setup and development gates are met. The concept shapes Kael's mission and the closure revelation (capsule as seed, not vault). However, the capsule itself does not constrain on-page tactics or force a mid-scene choice; it functions more as thematic container than active obstacle. Closure participation is conceptual rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Suddenly timeless" triggers at line 74 and enables the sea-of-moments experience (lines 88–102) where Kael feels all lived textures coexist. Setup is clear, development is sustained across one extended beat, and the insight gained there directly informs his final act. The trait constrains by removing sequence, forcing rediscovery. Cost is implicit (loss of linear time, though brief). Minor friction: the timelessness is one continuous event rather than recurring pressure across multiple beats.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Rediscover" appears at line 118 ("began to rediscover the capsule's true purpose") and drives the thematic turn from vault to seed. This realization motivates the final garage-sale card and Elara's inheritance. Setup is mid-story, development is thematic rather than tactical, and closure linkage is strong (the rediscovery is what Kael passes on). Swappability is moderate; "understand" or "realize" could substitute with minor rewording. Cost connection is present but oblique.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The method is introduced retrospectively at line 160 ("For months, he'd hidden truths... a chipped teacup described as...") and demonstrated once on-page with the urn-fragment card (lines 193–214). Setup is late-ish (past midpoint), but the example is vivid and the method shapes closure (Elara is "drawn by years of cryptic garage sale clues"). Causal pressure is moderate; the method is more vehicle than constraint. Specificity is high. Friction: much of the method's history is summary, not dramatized beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The emerald silo is present from the opening, recurs as sensory anchor ("humming core," "emerald light," "gentle green light"), and provides the spatial frame for all action. The silo's light freezes mid-pulse at the timeless trigger and envelops Kael at dissolution. The garage-sale table within the silo is the micro-setting for closure. Setup, development, and closure gates are met. The silo does not constrain tactics (Kael moves freely within it) but charges the final image strongly. Irreplaceability is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the Great Shift, numbers... changed meaning; seconds were no longer units but textures" is asserted at line 42 and echoed thematically throughout. It frames Kael's motivation and the "post-numerical age" world. However, the altered timeframe does not tighten decisions on the page; Kael's borrowed hours are mentioned but never counted down or used to force a tactical choice. The timeframe is more conceptual backdrop than lived constraint. Swappability is high; a simpler "after the cataclysm" would function similarly.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Kael's desire "to understand the very grain of time passing" is stated at line 42, embodied in the texture catalog (lines 54, 102), and fulfilled in the timeless-sea rediscovery (lines 118–132). Setup is early, development spans multiple beats, and closure directly answers the motivation (Elara continues the work). The motivation is told more than dramatized; Kael's micro-choices serve the quest but lack visible friction or competing wants. Cost is present (his dissolution) but the motivation itself does not create internal conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Tone of "anticipated mysteries" is established early ("sole motivation," "true purpose," "hidden messages") and sustained through the cryptic garage-sale clues, Elara's years-long search, and the spiral symbol as "key for the perceptive." The tone modulates with the timeless-sea calm and Elara's closing understanding. Closure is charged by the mystery's resolution into purpose. The tone is coherent and purposeful. Minor friction: the tone reads slightly declarative in expository beats rather than suspenseful, leaning more on lyric accumulation than active enigma.</comment>
