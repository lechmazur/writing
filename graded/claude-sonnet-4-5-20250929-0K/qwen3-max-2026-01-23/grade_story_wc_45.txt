<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear—proving Lyra was ill, not stolen—but the internal conflict remains abstract. The piece tells us she's a "forgiving skeptic" and "shrewdly innocent" rather than showing these traits constrain choices under pressure. Her discovery of the cleft in the tooth resolves doubt instantly without cost, and the final resolve to educate the village feels more like a summary of intentions than a choice that forecloses a path. The sob of "liberation" bypasses genuine struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Elara reflects on the tooth, recalls Lyra's illness, and resolves to transform the garden into a teaching space. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—she walks toward the hedge maze with a new purpose. However, the discovery itself (the cleft proves Lyra wasn't replaced) happens off-stage in memory; the tooth was found three winters ago, so the narrative tension is retrospective rather than present-scene pressure. The cost is conceptual (letting go of the changeling narrative) but not viscerally felt on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs, but the stakes remain largely internal and declarative.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The secret garden is anchored early and used as the frame for reflection. Specific plants (willow, rosemary, sage, lavender) are named and assigned symbolic purpose in Elara's plan, which charges the final image. However, the garden itself does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics; it functions as stage and metaphor rather than active pressure. The micro-setting (the tooth, the willow) does contribute to the closure image, lifting the score into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving Lyra's true condition—is signaled early, but pressure does not escalate on the page. The tooth's cleft is examined and immediately confirms Elara's hypothesis without complication or reversal. The resolution (planting a "constellation" garden, gathering elders) is planned rather than enacted, so agency remains prospective. No live tightening or trade-off forecloses an option with visible cost; the story summarizes future intentions instead of dramatizing a peak choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of "turning mistakes into constellations" and moving from superstition to compassion emerges from Elara's reflection, but it is stated rather than embodied in scene conflict. The tooth's cleft functions as a key—"no flaw; it was a key"—but this insight is told in summary. The final image of walking as "a cartographer of grace" offers resonance, yet the piece leans on metaphor (constellations, bone-setting as method) without testing the thematic question through on-page friction. The conclusion feels announced rather than earned through specific struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct narrative texture: "bone-setter," "forgiving skeptic," "cartographer of grace." Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("testament that truth resides in humble details") that feels authorial rather than Elara's working idiom. No head-hopping, and the perceptual filter (bone-setting metaphors, botanical details) is consistent. However, peak emotional beats (the sob of liberation, the resolve to educate) are externalized through summary rather than immediate sensation, dulling immersion slightly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose carries thematic weight but suffers from loops and template phrasing. "Cleft" appears three times in close proximity (cleft in the root, cleft in certainty, cleft in certainty again), and several sentences restate concepts: "mistakes, met with courage, could become constellations" echoes "turn this painful collective mistake into a constellation." Participial openers recur ("Clutched in her palm," "Rising, she smoothed"). Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff, and some metaphors are strained ("constellation of understanding," "cartographer of grace"). The closure image is clear but the path to it is weighted with scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—a mother using forensic detail (a tooth's cleft) to debunk changeling folklore—offers a fresh angle on the changeling trope. The bone-setting metaphor as method for both physical and communal healing is a specific synthesis. However, the emotional arc (doubt → discovery → resolve to teach) follows a familiar template, and the story does not risk genuine ambiguity or failure. The twist (Lyra was ill, not replaced) is earned but telegraphed, and the final plan (transforming the garden) is prospective rather than enacted, reducing ingenuity at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her skepticism drives the investigation of the tooth. However, her "forgiving" trait is told rather than tested—she nods at elders and plans to educate them, but no scene forces her to forgive in the face of genuine accusation or harm. The character is functional but not indispensable; a generic "rational healer" could replace her with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tooth appears in three beats: unwrapped and examined, the cleft discovered, and planned for burial at the garden's heart. Its physical flaw (the cleft) is causally essential—it disproves the changeling narrative. Early setup (Lyra lost it three winters ago), middle examination, and closure linkage (seed of purpose, key) all present. The tooth's specificity (a molar with a hairline cleft) makes it irreplaceable. Scores in the 7.0–8.4 band for driving two beats and shaping the ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"A cleft in certainty" is established early (the tooth's physical cleft) and returns as metaphor ("profound cleft in certainty within her"). It shapes the dominant stake—resolving doubt about Lyra's fate—and appears in the closure as the realization that "the tooth's cleft was no flaw; it was a key." Present across beats and thematically charged at the end, reaching mid-6s. However, the concept is more lyric echo than tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Shrewdly innocent" is assigned to both Elara and Lyra but remains label-only. The story tells us Elara will lead "with shrewd innocence" and defines it as "not naivety, but the fierce, clear-eyed hope," yet no on-page action demonstrates this trait constraining a choice. It appears late (final third) as summary rather than dramatized cost. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Yearn" is present throughout: Elara yearns for truth, to share revelation, for the day the village will see Lyra's illness with compassion. It colors interiority and frames motivation, but the action itself (yearning) does not create turns—it accompanies them. The examination of the tooth and the resolve to teach are the causal moves; yearning is the emotional texture. Functional but replaceable with "hope" or "long for."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Bone-setting is signaled early ("village bone-setter"), its method explained (understanding the break, applying pressure to align fragments), and applied both literally (Finn's wrist) and metaphorically (communal trust, resetting the narrative). It appears in the climax ("bone-setter's authority to realign perspective") and closure ("bone setting applied to belief"). The method shapes Elara's approach and charges the final image. Present across three beats and indispensable to her strategy, scoring solidly in the 7.0–8.4 range.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The secret garden is the frame and stage for all reflection. Early setup (hidden behind the hedge maze), middle use (weeping willow, rosemary beds), and closure participation (walking toward the maze, naming it "Lyra's Compass"). However, the garden does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it is backdrop and future plan. Mid-band for involvement across beats without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The timeframe ("after the substitute body is found") is mentioned in the opening and situates the story post-discovery. However, no clock or urgency tightens decisions; Elara reflects and plans without time pressure. The story is entirely retrospective analysis and prospective intention. Functional framing but no tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To turn mistakes into constellations" is articulated mid-story and frames the closure resolve (planting a star chart, "mistakes, met with courage, could become constellations"). It is told as crystallized motivation but not dramatized through conflicting wants or costs. The desire is present and shapes the ending plan, but friction between this goal and an opposing pull (e.g., anger, despair) is absent. Mid-band for thematic presence without on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Nostalgic innovation" is coherent: Elara mourns Lyra (nostalgia) while designing a teaching garden (innovation). The tone modulates from weary reflection ("hollow ache") to liberation ("sob escaped") to resolve ("rising, she smoothed her apron"). The final image charges the tone (cartographer of grace, Lyra's Compass). Present across beats and integrated into the ending, scoring mid-6s for consistent modulation that supports the closure image.</comment>
