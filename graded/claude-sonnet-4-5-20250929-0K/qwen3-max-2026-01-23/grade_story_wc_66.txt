<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior is evocative but leans heavily on abstract meditation ("teach dust to tell stories") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The core motivation—preserving forbidden narratives—is clear, but her choices lack visible trade-offs; she adjusts the cloak, transcribes, and imagines outcomes without on-page friction between competing desires. Embodied emotion appears in "pulse a frantic drum," yet much of the affective load rests on poetic assertion ("quiet fire in her chest") instead of dramatized struggle. The final choice to carry the journal forward feels anticipated rather than earned through a foregrounded internal conflict with cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening beat; the inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, holding through a sustained density increase that reweights the dominant stake (preserving forbidden stories). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—Charged Poise: the final image crystallizes Elara's role shift from copyist to "gardener of ghosts" with undeniable conceptual pressure, though the emotional cost remains oblique rather than viscerally felt on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when the broadcast fades and she inscribes the harvest, reconfiguring her task from preservation to invitation. The causality is minimal (receive → transcribe → plan future action) but sufficient under an accumulative design; the closure unit lands cleanly without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ember alcove functions as micro-setting that charges the final image (the ember-light reveals "secretly luminous shimmer" in the ink), satisfying the 9+ gate for closure linkage. Sensory detail is vivid and selective—frost-veined window, mist, dial glow, charcoal-gray cloak—but spatial choreography is thin; we never learn room dimensions or adjacencies that might constrain movement. The setting supplies atmosphere and recurs purposefully (ember-light bookends the piece), yet it does not materially narrow Elara's tactical options during the transcription beats. Modern-world realism is plausible for the shortwave mechanics and the depicted ritual.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transcribing forbidden broadcasts to resurrect shared narrative—is signaled early and coheres under the Accumulative lens. Pressure accumulates through sensory density and the recurring threat of discovery (cloak slip, crackle of interference), but no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options with visible cost; Elara completes her task without tactical adjustment or forfeiture. The final image deepens meaning (copyist → midwife) yet lacks a felt price paid in this moment. Agency is present as attention and endurance, but the ending reconfigures meaning more than it forecloses a live option with immediate consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—memory, resistance, the resurrection of narrative—emerges organically through image and action: dust as vessel, silence as grief, words as keys. The final image ("first faint sentences of a reborn world") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without stating a moral, reweighting "preservation" as "invitation" with conceptual clarity. Subtext operates in the broadcast lyrics ("silence between the notes") and in Elara's imagined audience of dust motes. No thematic echo or moralizing mars the ending; the piece trusts its particulars and avoids abstraction except where voice-motivated ("thistled calm," "secretly luminous") and anchored in concrete ritual.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a consistent lyric register; perceptual signature is evident in the narrator's selective focus on ember-light, static, and the "scratch of her nib." Psychic distance modulates purposefully, but diction drifts into elevated abstractions ("solemn vow," "transient shape of an oak leaf") that risk sitting above Elara's lived lexicon during high-pressure beats. The voice is distinct and textured, yet repeated constructions ("She was," "This was," "Every") create mild syntactic monotony. No dialogue is present to evaluate. Free indirect style is clean, and no head-hopping occurs; the narrator's certainty matches Elara's knowledge throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—"story famine," "thistled calm," "gardener of ghosts"—which risks overwriting in a compressed frame; the metaphors cohere but saturate nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff that alters tactics. Paraphrase loops appear: "teach dust to tell stories" is restated as "teaching cadence and metaphor" and "taught the dust a new word" across three beats without added pressure. Template cadence runs: "She was… She thought… She would…" recur in adjacent paragraphs. Information density is moderate; many lines do dual work (atmosphere + motive), but some ("Safe. For now.") stall momentum without advancing knowledge. No severe clarity breaks, yet the accumulation of figurative language and scaffold phrasing dulls immediacy in peak beats (cloak slip, broadcast fade).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise—forbidden radio broadcasts encoded in song lyrics, transcribed by a copyist to teach dust—offers a fresh synthesis of archival resistance and animist metaphor. The "story famine" provides a non-obvious societal frame, and the specific occupational detail (orchestra copyist) roots the character. However, the emotional arc (solitary ritual → affirmation of purpose) follows a familiar contemplative template without a bold turn or visible cost that surprises in hindsight. The final image is evocative but anticipated; the piece commits fully to its lyric mode yet does not take structural or perspectival risks that heighten stakes beyond the established pattern.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's occupation as copyist shapes her method (transcribing with "reverent precision") and is signaled early. Her choices—adjusting the cloak, inscribing the journal, planning tomorrow's ritual—are consistent with the role but lack a high-cost decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. The character is present across all three gates (setup, middle, ending) and the specificity (flawless copies, conductor's praise) is irreplaceable, yet her decisions trend observational rather than transformative on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The shortwave radio dial glow appears in at least three beats: initial hum, cloak coverage, and the switch-off at closure. It supplies the "spectral green light" that anchors the ritual and vanishes in the final moment, marking the transition from reception to action. The glow does not constrain a choice (Elara could transcribe by ember-light alone) but recurs with reweighted meaning (presence → absence) that charges the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The pirate broadcast is signaled early, shapes the middle beats (Elara transcribes its lyrics), and frames the stakes (forbidden narratives). It does not change options on the page—Elara's action is predetermined (listen, transcribe, plan)—but it supplies the content that defines her task and the risk (secrecy as survival). The concept is irreplaceable to the premise yet functions more as setting than a tactical pressure that alters her moves.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Secretly luminous" is labeled twice ("secretly luminous quality," "secretly luminous shimmer") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. The attribute remains metaphorical (resonance in the mind's eye, shimmer under ember-light) without a dramatized tradeoff or tactical consequence. It enriches atmosphere but is functionally ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The cloak appears in two beats: draping to muffle sound/light and the slip during interference. The slip creates a micro-turn (fear of discovery) but is immediately resolved ("Safe. For now.") without altering tactics or imposing cost. The action is specific and irreplaceable to the secrecy stakes, yet it does not redefine options or drive the closure; it could be removed with minor edits to the risk profile.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The method—elusive song lyrics—is signaled early ("entire narratives woven into melody") and enacted across multiple beats (three quoted lyrics transcribed with "reverent precision"). The mechanics matter: Elara's copyist skill is required, and the lyrics supply the content she will later teach to the dust. The method shapes her task and is indispensable to the story's premise, though it does not constrain a failed attempt or force a tactical shift on the page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The ember alcove is established in the opening line and recurs at closure ("in the ember alcove, surrounded by mist and memory"). The ember-light reveals the "secretly luminous shimmer" in the final image, charging the ending. The mist pressures secrecy (isolates her, obscures discovery) and the alcove's intimacy mirrors her solitary ritual. The setting does not supply a resource that alters tactics mid-scene but meaningfully shapes atmosphere and the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the story famine" is signaled early and frames the stakes (silence as grief, need for resurrection). It does not tighten decisions—no live clock pressures Elara's pace—but it explains the cultural void that motivates her task. The temporal anchor is irreplaceable to the premise yet functions as backstory rather than a constraint that alters on-page tactics or escalates urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to teach dust to tell stories" is stated explicitly and enacted in the final third (planning to hum melodies, speak to dust motes). It is present at closure and drives her ritual, but the desire is never dramatized as conflicted—she does not face a friction between this goal and a competing want or cost. The motivation is specific and irreplaceable, yet it trends declarative rather than tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Thistled calm"—surface serenity pricked by risk and poignant ache—is taught in the opening third and modulates with pressure (frantic pulse during the cloak slip, deepening quiet at closure). The tone charges the final image ("resilient as a thistle pushing through cracked stone") and coheres through turns without static repetition. It is indispensable to the piece's affective signature and irreplaceable with a generic mood label.</comment>
