<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and drives the quest, but her interiority leans heavily on declarative exposition rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The emotional climax—tears streaming as she hears her mother's lullaby—reads as label-only sentiment without prior embodied micro-choices that earn the moment. Her illustrator's precision is mentioned repeatedly but never constrains a choice or complicates her success; competence faces no genuine struggle. The final choice to illustrate the echo lacks visible cost or foreclosed paths—she succeeded cleanly and will continue her work enriched, which skirts Earned Stasis requirements.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first ~80 words, meeting the test. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds density through layered world-detail and metaphor until the cage-breaking moment, then reconfigures via the echo's release and Elara's vow to illustrate memory. However, closure cost is asserted rather than shown—no on-page forfeiture, injury, or foreclosed option appears; the pendant cools, the city wakes, and she rows home enriched. The final image reweights the premise conceptually (echoes liberated, canals singing anew) but the felt cost required for CR or RR remains invisible on the page, failing the Cost Proof Test by ~0.6.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The rooftop canal system, crystalline towers, Chronos Spire, and Confluence plaza are vivid and persistent. Spatial choreography is clean: skiff drifts, canals still, petal suspends. The pendant functions as a micro-setting object that enables the time-sculpting choice, constraining her method and charging the final image when it "rests against her chest" as testament. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (frost on raindrop, spider's web tension during the Pause). Minor deduction: much description serves atmosphere over choice—towers "scrape the sky," canals "weave," but these details do not alter Elara's tactics or complicate her success.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uncaging the primordial echo—is signaled early and pursued throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when the Silent Pause grants temporal access, and the pendant-key unlocks the cage. However, escalation lacks a live trade-off or narrowed option: Elara borrows time without visible depletion, sculpts the key without error, and succeeds on first attempt. No on-page reversal forces recalibration; coincidence (the giant's nap schedule) enables rather than complicates. The resolution is protagonist-driven but frictionless, and the cost—borrowed seconds, pendant coolness—remains abstract rather than a felt forfeiture that alters her world or self.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of memory, resonance, and fractured time emerges through concrete images: the cage of solidified soundwaves, the echo as "pure memory," and Elara's vow to illustrate "the visual shape of memory." The infinity pendant recurs and shifts meaning from heirloom to testament, a purposeful reprise. However, the final paragraph edges into thematic statement—"mended a fracture in the world's soul," "enduring song of the uncaged echoes"—that risks spelling out what the cage-breaking image already implied. The piece invites reflection on time and loss but leans toward summary rather than letting the echo's sensory flood (founders' chants, mother's lullaby) stand as the non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction carries an elevated, lyrical register consistent with Elara's illustrator profession—"lacework of aqueducts," "diorama of frozen motion," "spindle." Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the Silent Pause, tightening to embodied perception (frost patterns, web tension). Weakness: recurring syntactic stems ("She believed," "She possessed," "She poured," "She would") and filter verbs ("noting details," "closing her eyes") dull immediacy in peak beats. The prose occasionally tips into decorative exposition ("an intricate lacework," "crystalline towers that scraped the sky") that pauses momentum rather than advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Read-aloud rhythm is mostly smooth, but template cadence appears in clusters: "She believed... She possessed... She poured... She would..." across key beats (lines 54, 109, 200, 262). Paraphrase loops: lines 159 and 118 restate "borrowed time" and "borrowed seconds" without added pressure. Figurative density is high throughout—"clay in her illustrator's hands," "thread from a spindle," "shape of memory, color of a voice"—and while voice-motivated, the accumulation in nearly every sentence during the Pause and unlocking beats (lines 132–208) crosses into overwriting without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering the density penalty (~−0.5). Minor: "absolute silence" and "motionless canals" repeat the stasis concept adjacently. Information density is moderate; many lines do two jobs (world-building + mood) but few advance choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The premise—time-sculpting illustrator uncaging sentient echoes during a giant's nap—is specific and memorable. The infinity pendant as tool, the Silent Pause as temporal key, and the cage of solidified soundwaves offer fresh synthesis. However, the emotional arc (quest → success → vow to document) follows a familiar template without transformation: no moral calculus, competing goods, or unavoidable harm complicates the victory. The specifics (canal-dragonfly, moss veins, Chronos Spire) are particular to this voice and setting, but the protagonist's frictionless success and the tidy enrichment ending ("canals sang with newfound richness") trend toward safety-middle. Risk-taking in world-detail is not matched by risk in stakes or cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara's profession as natural history illustrator is present and colors her perceptual signature (rendering microscopic moss veins, precise observation), but her illustrator skills do not constrain or enable a key turn. The pendant-sculpting and cage-unlocking could succeed without this trait; the vow to illustrate the echo (final beat) is thematically apt but does not alter prior tactics. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The infinity symbol pendant appears in three beats: grasped at line 44, pulsing amber as she draws time at line 124, and sculpted into the key at line 200, then reprised as "testament" at line 299. It enables the time-sculpting method and charges the final image. However, its mechanics are abstract—no visible cost or trade-off when she "pours every borrowed second" into it. Two gates (setup, payoff) are clear; middle development is functional but could be more causally specific.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Interrupted cadence is signaled early (line 72: "deep, rhythmic cadence") and crystallized at line 80 ("Silent Pause—a profound stillness where time itself hesitated"). It functions as the temporal key (line 86) that enables the unlocking action. The concept shapes tactics: Elara must act during the Pause, and the story's structure mirrors the cadence (build, Pause, release). Present in setup, middle pressure, and closure participation. Causal role is strong; the unlock would fail without this exact element.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Time-sculpting is introduced at line 109 ("ability to sculpt time itself") and demonstrated twice: creating the protective bubble (line 141) and forging the pendant-key (line 200). The method enables the unlocking action, but no on-page cost or visible trade-off accompanies the use—she borrows time without depletion or consequence. Functional in two beats; closure-linked. Swappable with "manipulates time" or similar phrasing without structural loss; cost connection is absent.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Uncaging the primordial echo is the climactic action (lines 200–219) that delivers the quest goal and releases the story's central image—the flood of memory and her mother's lullaby. The action is prepared by prior beats (sonic maps, pendant-key sculpting) and redefines the world state ("canals sang with newfound richness"). Removing this action would collapse the narrative arc. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability; minor deduction for lack of visible cost tied to the act itself.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Borrowing time is introduced at line 118 ("by borrowing time—extracting minuscule fragments"), demonstrated in the bubble creation (line 141), and repeated at the key-forging beat (line 200: "poured every borrowed second"). The method shapes two distinct attempts and enables the unlock. However, mechanics remain abstract—no visible depletion, risk, or trade-off on the page. Setup, middle involvement, and closure linkage are present; cost connection is weak.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Rooftop canal system is established early (line 26) and provides the setting throughout: canals guide her skiff, the Confluence plaza is the unlock site, and liberated echoes charge the canals in the final image (line 288). Spatial detail is vivid (crystalline towers, seven canals meeting) but does not constrain or complicate Elara's choices—she navigates freely. The setting supplies atmosphere and a destination but does not alter tactics or pressure. Present in all three gates; functional but not causally decisive.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The giant's nap is introduced at line 64 ("entire quest must unfold precisely across a giant's nap") and governs the narrative clock: the Silent Pause grants temporal access (line 96), and the giant's stirring at line 239 snaps time back, ending the window. The timeframe tightens decisions (she must act during the Pause) and shapes the story's rhythm. Setup, middle pressure, and closure participation are clear. Minor deduction: the nap's duration and remaining time are not tracked on the page, softening urgency slightly.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation—to find the place where echoes are born—is stated at line 35 ("burning since childhood") and pursued throughout. It drives her quest to the Confluence and the unlocking action. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized in conflicted micro-choices; no on-page friction between want and cost appears. She succeeds cleanly, and the final vow to illustrate the echo extends rather than complicates the initial desire. Setup and payoff present; middle friction absent.</comment>
