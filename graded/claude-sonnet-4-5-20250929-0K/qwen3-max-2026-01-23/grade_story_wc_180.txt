<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to bridge generational wisdom is declared but her interior contradiction remains abstract—she "felt an endearingly feisty resolve kindle" rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The ribbon memory triggers embodied emotion ("A lump tightened Elara's throat"), yet the pivotal repair choice feels inevitable rather than costly; no on-page trade-off between competing goods. Lyra's arrival and reconciliation land emotionally but bypass genuine friction: the daughter immediately grasps the mother's intent without residual conflict, flattening what could have been a harder-won closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the orchard, ribbon, and repair beats accumulate toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (mother and daughter reconciled, "deciduous vows" reweighted). Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The closure unit (Lyra's arrival, mutual recognition, shoulder-to-shoulder on the pew) lands on the page with felt emotional cost, but the conceptual cost—what Elara or Lyra forfeit or alter in tactics—remains oblique; the ribbon's reweighting is more symbolic echo than a constraint that forced a different choice. One meaningful deepening (the ribbon's repurposing) tightens stakes, satisfying the lens, but the final image ("deciduous vow, shed and renewed") leans toward thematic declaration rather than charged particulars.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard hybrid is vividly rendered and pressures the repair task: Elara must "weave with" living branches, not restore rigid stone. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("dappled breeze," "moss-carpeted floor," "golden scar tissue"). The ribbon threaded through "reinforced wood and new cherry-branch supports" functions as micro-setting, constraining her method and charging the final image when Lyra traces it. Spatial choreography is coherent (pews, rafters, rose window) and the orchard's presence shapes the repair's symbiotic nature, meeting the 9+ gate for constraint on choice and closure participation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—bridging generational wisdom—is signaled early and tightens once when Elara realizes "the ribbon was the method" and shifts from rigid repair to flexible weaving. That turn narrows her options under the Accumulative lens. However, the escalation lacks a live trade-off: no moment where using the ribbon costs her a safer, more conventional repair or risks structural failure. Lyra's arrival resolves the stake without on-page resistance or a complicating reversal, and the "breach of contract" timeframe functions as backstory rather than active pressure that alters tactics in scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of deciduous vows—flexible, renewable promises—emerges from the orchard and repair imagery, but the final paragraph explicitly moralizes: "to persist is not to resist the current, but to weave with it, bridging the wisdom of roots and the ambition of branches." This thematic echo (Thematic Echo penalty −0.6) replaces scene pressure with authorial summary. The ribbon's repurposing offers a non-literal answer, yet the on-page articulation by both Elara ("Vows aren't unbreakable chains…") and the narrator undercuts subtext, turning earned image into stated thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara; psychic distance modulates appropriately (close during the ribbon memory, wider for the orchard survey). Perceptual signature is consistent—her "quartz-eye" lens, tool-focused diction ("suture," "resin," "spider-silk thread"). Dialogue, when it appears, carries subtext and goal pursuit: Lyra's "I thought you were rebuilding the old world" economically reveals her prior misreading. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("poignant gifts fulfilled their purpose," "tangible bridge") that feels more narrator than character under stress, and the final exchange risks therapeutic clarity ("I finally understood your wisdom") over embodied implication.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied syntax and high information density in the repair sequence. However, patterned artifacts cluster: "feisty" appears three times (label repetition), filter-verb stacks ("felt an… resolve kindle," "felt insufficient"), and the final third leans on stock metaphors ("amber tears," "scar tissue," "hopeful flag"). Paraphrase loop in the penultimate paragraph: "the breach of contract was transmuted—not a scar of failure, but the necessary opening" restates the deciduous-vows concept already articulated. Template cadence in early beats ("Above, the skeletal rafters…" / "This vibrant reclamation…" / "Elara, the valley's quartz-eye mender…") and the closing moralizing paragraph dull closure momentum. Baseline −0.8 for clustered artifacts; total deduction ~−1.0 for final-third concentration.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard hybrid and the ribbon-as-structural-thread offer a fresh synthesis of restoration and renewal. The "deciduous vows" concept reframes broken contracts as necessary shedding rather than failure, a non-obvious moral calculus. However, the framing feels premise-driven: the story illustrates the metaphor rather than discovering it through character agency under pressure. The reconciliation arc (estranged mother/daughter bridged by a keepsake) follows a familiar emotional template, and the closing moralizing ("to persist is not to resist the current…") retreats into abstraction. Transformation of the trope is partial; emotional specificity in the ribbon memory elevates, but the broader structure remains recognizably templatelike.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara is named in the opening, her mender role frames the task, and her decision to use the ribbon (middle beat) alters repair method. She is present and active in the closure scene (tying the final knot, covering Lyra's hand), shaping the reconciliation. Two distinct beats (tool inadequacy → ribbon choice; final knot → daughter's arrival) and closure participation meet integration thresholds. Causal pressure is moderate: her choice enables the symbolic bridge but does not foreclose a harder path or impose visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ribbon is introduced early (forgotten bag contents), used functionally in the repair (woven through wood and cherry branches), and charges the closure when Lyra traces it and recognizes the kept keepsake. Three beats: discovery, weaving, recognition. It constrains Elara's method (she shifts from rigid tools to flexible thread) and carries emotional cost (memory of Lyra's childhood voice, the apology and hope encoded in each knot). Closure linkage is strong—Lyra's reaction and the final image hinge on the ribbon. Specificity: its cerulean color and Lyra's childhood wisdom ("Ribbons hold things together when knots fail") make it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Deciduous vows are articulated twice: first when Elara realizes "resilient promises were not unyielding stone… but like the orchard's trees—shedding old leaves… to gather strength for vibrant renewal," then echoed in the closing moralizing paragraph. The concept is thematic scaffold rather than a constraint that alters on-page tactics; it does not shape Elara's repair choices beyond metaphorical framing. It reweights meaning at closure, but the reweighting is told rather than pressured through conflicting options or cost. Introduced implicitly early (breach of contract backstory) and paid off in theme, but causal work is weak.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Endearingly feisty" is applied three times as a label (Elara's resolve, her past descriptor for Lyra, the closing summary) but never dramatized through behavior that constrains or enables a choice with cost. The trait does not alter Elara's tactics, complicate the repair, or friction the reconciliation. It reads as ornamental voice color rather than a trait with on-page mechanical consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Persist" appears explicitly ("She would persist," "to persist is not to resist the current") and implicitly drives Elara's refusal to abandon the repair when her tools prove insufficient. The action shapes one key turn (reaching into the forgotten bag after tools fail) and the thematic closure. However, it does not impose a visible trade-off—no moment where persisting costs her safety, time, or a simpler path. Present across setup, middle choice, and ending, with moderate causal linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The forgotten bag is introduced early ("sealed by memory since Lyra had helped her pack years ago") and its contents—spider-silk thread, pine resin, ribbon—provide the method for the repair. Signaled in setup, enacted in the middle repair sequence, and the ribbon charges closure. However, the bag's mechanics are convenience-adjacent: its presence is not foreshadowed beyond the single mention, and its contents align too neatly with the repair needs (silk, resin, symbolic ribbon). One meaningful middle beat (repurposing forgotten items) and closure linkage, but swappability is moderate—anyKeepSake container could serve.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The orchard-cathedral setting is established in the opening paragraph, supplies the resources (cherry branches) and constraint (need for flexible, symbiotic repair rather than rigid restoration) that shape Elara's method, and charges the final image (mother and daughter on a sun-warmed pew under living trees). It pressures the central choice: "she was not here to mourn shattered stone, but to bridge" by weaving with the orchard's growth. Three beats: initial survey, repair mechanics (integrating cherry branches), closure scene. Micro-setting (the orchard spanning rafters) alters tactics and underpins the deciduous-vows metaphor, making it essential to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The breach of contract "five winters prior" anchors the backstory and explains the orchard's presence, but the timeframe does not tighten on-page decisions or impose a live clock. Elara's repair unfolds without urgency tied to season, decay, or Lyra's imminent departure. The "after" framing provides thematic context (renewal post-breach) but does not constrain tactics or escalate pressure. Present in setup and thematic closure, but causal work is weak.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to bridge generational wisdom is declared early, dramatized in the ribbon choice (a tangible bridge showing "honoring roots need not strangle growth"), and resolved when Lyra recognizes the gesture. The desire shapes two beats (repair method shift, reconciliation dialogue) and charges closure. However, friction between want and cost is muted: no on-page moment where the bridge attempt risks deepening the estrangement or requires Elara to forfeit a competing priority. Told and shown, but the stakes remain abstract until Lyra's arrival, which resolves rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Accidental wisdom appears explicitly ("Accidental wisdom bloomed. The ribbon was the method") and implicitly in the orchard's unplanned reclamation and Lyra's childhood insight repurposed. Tone is coherent—gentle wonder at emergent solutions—but remains static across turns; no modulation under pressure. The final paragraph asserts "accidental wisdom: to persist is not to resist" rather than letting the image carry tone. Present in setup (orchard as unintended consequence), middle realization, and thematic closure, but does not charge the final image through tonal shift or ironic reprise.</comment>
