<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent (honoring Hemlock's overlooked history), but her choices lack meaningful contradiction or cost. The reflective passages dominate—childhood memories anchor present beats without friction—yet no micro-choice forces her to renounce or sacrifice anything on the page. Internal conflict is absent; she moves from fragment to paintings to closure without struggle, rendering the journey observational rather than transformative under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern early (market, fragment, three paintings) and delivers Resonant Reconfiguration at closure when the fragment is placed in the frame—a ritual act that reweights prior material. Orientation anchors arrive by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The escalation reads as density increase across the three canvases, each hidden detail tightening the link between past and present, culminating in the shard's placement. Cost is conceptual and felt (permanent anchor for future seekers, transformation of the city's silent narratives), though the price to Elara personally remains oblique. One micro turn (fragment warms, shifts from glass to key) supports the final move without fragmenting the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The alchemist's market is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (captured moonlight, bottled echoes, comet dust) and anchors the opening. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The fragment itself functions as micro-setting: handled in multiple beats, its texture (cool, elusively tangible) and warmth shift constrain Elara's interpretation and charge the final image when placed in the frame niche. The market supplies the paintings as resources that directly affect the outcome, moving setting beyond backdrop into causal participation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (honoring Hemlock's overlooked history) is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through three paintings, each hidden detail tightening the resonance between fragment and memory. The fragment's warmth shift ("no longer just glass, but a key") is the sole reversal, narrowing options and enabling the final placement. Agency manifests as ritual attention rather than decision under friction—Elara does not forfeit or renounce a live alternative. The cost (permanent anchor, city transformed) is conceptual and felt but does not foreclose a personal path with on-page price to her.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme (overlooked histories given light, shadow holding the shape of light) emerges from the fragment, paintings, and Hemlock's whispered lesson without overt thesis. The final act—placing the shard in the portrait frame—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. However, the last two paragraphs drift toward thematic summary ("history breathes in hidden details," "every overlooked history found its light") rather than trusting the image alone, lowering the score from higher bands.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable single-focalization; perceptual signature is consistent (translator's eye for hidden details, anchors of intuition). Diction remains lyric and character-specific throughout, with purposeful compression that the piece teaches early ("elusively tangible," "anchors of intuition"). Free indirect style is clean. Dialogue (Cora's two lines) feels natural and advances the method. Psychic distance modulates intentionally during the memory beats. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense yet legible. However, overwriting appears in high-pressure beats: "eternal instant" recurs as a label without fresh embodiment, and the penultimate paragraph stacks metaphors ("layered with silent narratives," "whispers of forgotten hands") that blur rather than sharpen the closure image. Template cadence in the final two paragraphs (repeated "another... another... another") and paraphrase loops ("the market faded... but its purpose remained") flatten momentum. Cumulative artifacts in the ending third trigger penalty and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis (translator, fragment, paintings, hidden details as anchors) is specific and coherent. The alchemist's market and elusively tangible quality offer fresh inflection. However, the emotional arc (honoring overlooked histories, finding hidden knots and carved birds) follows a familiar template without transformation through conflict or moral calculus. The journey is observational rather than earned through struggle, and the final image's thematic weight is asserted in the last paragraphs rather than left implicit, reducing risk and ingenuity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her role (translator) frames the quest. She makes the final choice to place the fragment in the frame, participating in closure. However, her decisions are ritualistic rather than pressured; no earlier choice alters tactics or forecloses a path. Early signal, closure linkage, and two beats (handling fragment, studying paintings) support mid-band, but lack of causal pressure and visible cost caps the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse lens fragment is handled in multiple beats: retrieved from pocket, held to painted cliff, warms during second canvas, glows and cools in third, placed in frame niche at closure. Its elusively tangible nature shifts meaning (glass → key). Early signal, three-beat involvement, closure participation, and specificity (exact texture, warmth shift) drive the score into the 7+ band. Cost linkage is present but oblique (permanent anchor for future seekers rather than personal forfeiture), limiting higher reach.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Anchors of intuition" is signaled early ("subtle threads only a translator's soul could feel") and shapes the method: Elara's intuition snags on hidden details (knot, sparrow, constellation) across three beats. The concept enables her recognition and the final placement in the frame. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. However, the phrase itself functions more as thematic label than constraint; Elara never faces friction or cost tied to the concept's mechanics. Lyric reprise (first → last) reweights the stake, supporting mid-6 band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Elusively tangible" describes the fragment across multiple beats (solid enough to slice, ghost of salt spray, shifts from glass to key). The attribute is signaled early and its paradox enables Elara's interpretive work. However, it does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost—no choice hinges on the fragment's dual nature, and no tactic is altered because it is both present and absent. The trait enriches texture without pressing a decision, capping the score below 7.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Unfasten" appears twice: Elara unfastens her pouch to draw out the fragment, and the narration claims she "unfastened the sealed truth." The first is incidental (opening a pouch); the second is metaphorical summary rather than a dramatized action. No major turn traces to unfastening itself—removing the fragment from the pouch does not change tactics or cost. The action is swappable (she could simply "retrieve" or "lift" the fragment) without structural impact, placing it in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The method (hidden details in paintings) is signaled early by Cora ("Truth hides in the brushstrokes") and structures the entire middle: three paintings, each with a concealed anchor (knot, sparrow, constellation) that Elara's intuition detects. The method shapes her attempts across three beats and enables the final resonance when the fragment is placed in the frame. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. Causal pressure is moderate (the method guides rather than constrains under friction), but the mechanics matter throughout, supporting 7+ band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The alchemist's market is vividly described in the opening and frames the quest. It supplies the paintings (resources that directly affect outcome) and Cora's guidance. Early signal and closure framing are present. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics under pressure—Elara moves through it without spatial friction, and the market's height or moonlight lanterns do not matter to the beats. The setting functions as evocative backdrop rather than causal participant, capping the score near 6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The timeframe ("between childhood and now") is signaled early and structures the reflective beats: childhood memories (Keeper Hemlock, rope ladder, carved sparrow, pipe tobacco) anchor present discoveries across all three paintings. The dual timeline tightens the emotional resonance and primes the closure realization. However, no live clock pressures Elara's choices—she is not racing time or forced to decide before a deadline. The timeframe reweights meaning (setup → payoff) without constraining tactics, supporting mid-6 band with lyric allowance.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The motivation (to honor overlooked histories) is stated in the opening ("her purpose a quiet hum") and dramatized through the quest: seeking Hemlock's hidden details, feeling tears at the chipped sparrow, placing the fragment as "permanent anchor for future seekers." The desire is present across multiple beats and participates in closure. However, it is never conflicted—no want versus fear, no competing good. Elara's reverence faces no friction or cost, lowering the score from higher bands where motivation must wrestle with tradeoffs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Eternal instant" is stated as tone goal and appears explicitly in one beat ("time dissolved into an eternal instant") when Elara touches the painted star, merging childhood and present. The phrase recurs in summary ("she carried the eternal instant within her"). Tone is consistent and lyric throughout, modulating gently with the memory beats. The eternal-instant moment charges the closure conceptually (past and present collapse), meeting setup and payoff. However, the tone does not shift under pressure or constrain a choice, and the final reprise is asserted rather than embodied, capping near mid-6.</comment>
