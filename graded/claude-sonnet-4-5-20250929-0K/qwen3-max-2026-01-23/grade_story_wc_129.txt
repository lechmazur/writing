<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her arc from rootless to rooted is coherent, but her interiority leans heavily on abstract phrases ("luminescent ache," "bold sympathy") rather than embodied contradiction. The partnership with Kael feels telescoped—decades of his solitude dissolve in a single tear without visible struggle or cost that complicates the bond. The final choice to dedicate the arbor is signaled early and proceeds without friction, reading more as fulfillment than a decision under competing pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accrues through shared search and converges at the obsidian arbor discovery. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive clearly within the first paragraph. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara's dedication and Kael's acknowledgment ("The graft has taken root") crystallize belonging with felt cost (decades of solitude, her prior rootlessness). However, the cost is more asserted than dramatized—Kael's tear and Elara's kneeling are gestures, but no prior choice or renunciation on the page forecloses a live option or visibly alters tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard, crater, and obsidian arbor are vividly rendered with purpose-driven sensory detail (light, chime, volcanic glass). Spatial choreography is clean—Elara moves through the orchard, finds Kael, and they reach the clearing together. The setting contributes atmospheric pressure but does not constrain a tactical choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; the arbor is discovered, not used to solve a problem Elara helped create.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—grafting onto community—is signaled early and sustained. The search provides a goal, and the partnership with Kael adds relational texture. However, escalation is mild: the pair move side-by-side without meaningful opposition, and the arbor is found rather than earned through a choice that narrows options. The dedication gesture at the end fulfills the stated intent but does not foreclose a live alternative or impose a visible trade-off on tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of belonging and kinship emerges organically from Elara's search and Kael's guardianship, and the final image (reed arbor against obsidian) offers a quiet answer without moralizing. The intertwined-roots glyph and the "graft has taken root" line carry thematic resonance. Yet the emotional arc feels too tidy—solitude dissolves without ambiguity, and the orchard's "harmonious chord" at the end edges toward affirming sentiment rather than earned complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-person limited. Diction is lyric and elevated ("luminescent ache," "boldly sympathetic"), consistent with the setting's mythic tone, though it occasionally drifts into abstraction that flattens urgency. Dialogue between Elara and Kael is purposeful and carries subtext (hope, guardianship), but both characters speak in similarly formal, articulate registers without distinct idiom. Psychic distance remains controlled with no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often beautiful ("forged of solidified light," "liquid starlight"), but clusters heavily in descriptive passages without always advancing pressure. Minor paraphrase loops: "luminescent ache" recurs three times; "web" and "kinship" are restated across adjacent lines without added detail. Template cadence in the final section: "She placed… 'I dedicate…' The words wove… Kael covered… 'The graft has taken root…' As they rose…" reads as a sequence of declarative fulfillment beats with identical stems. These artifacts dull momentum at the closure and trigger the patterned-artifact penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The street-artist tag premise is familiar (urban legend pilgrimage), and the emotional arc—lonely seeker finds belonging—follows a well-worn template. The crystalline-orchard-at-crater's-edge setting adds vivid texture, but the core structure (search → find → dedicate) does not transform the premise through non-obvious moral calculus or lived friction. The Echo mythology and Kael's fifty-season vigil offer narrative color but remain background exposition rather than complicating forces.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara is the POV throughout and makes the decision to search and to dedicate the arbor. Her sculptor identity frames the arbor creation (setup), she offers partnership to Kael (middle beat), and the dedication anchors the ending (closure participation). However, her choices proceed without visible friction or trade-off—she does not renounce a competing path or alter tactics under pressure. The sculptor trait is present across beats but does not constrain with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The obsidian arbor appears as the search goal (setup via legend), is discovered in the clearing (middle beat), and Elara places her reed arbor at its base in the climax (closure linkage). Its volcanic-glass properties and etched glyph charge the final image with thematic resonance. The arbor is handled on the page and its discovery reweights prior material. Strong closure participation and beat involvement, though it is found rather than used to solve a problem it helped create.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Webs of kinship" is named early and recurs as a theme anchor ("enduring webs," "woven into the same web," "webs of kinship tightened"). It shapes Elara's motivation and the search structure (seekers become nodes), but does not constrain an on-page choice with visible cost—Kael and Elara's bond forms smoothly without a moment where kinship logic forces a trade-off or alters tactics. Present across beats but more thematic echo than causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Boldly sympathetic" is used twice as a label ("Elara's spirit was boldly sympathetic"; "A surge of bold sympathy"). It motivates her offer to search with Kael, which is an on-page action, but the trait does not constrain or impose visible cost—she extends partnership without friction or competing impulse. The attribute is told rather than dramatized through contradictory choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Dedicate" is signaled early (Elara's arbor "intended… for dedication"), revisited in dialogue ("if we find the place—a tribute"), and executed at the climax ("I dedicate this"). The action is the closure beat and redefines Elara's status from rootless to rooted. However, it fulfills stated intent without a turn—no prior complication or competing pressure makes the dedication a choice with visible trade-off. Strong closure linkage but limited causal friction.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The shared search for Echo's tag is present throughout: Elara follows "whispers," Kael describes his fifty-season quest, they scan together, and the tag is found. The search structures the middle beats and unites the pair. However, the mechanics are passive—they move and look, but no puzzle, obstacle, or cost shapes their attempts. The method is sustained but does not impose tactical friction or narrow options under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard is anchored early, described across beats (chiming branches, mossy path, amethyst bark), and the clearing where the arbor stands is the closure location. Vivid and purposeful, but the orchard does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it is traversed and admired rather than used. Postcard-level participation with atmospheric contribution but minimal tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Beyond the murmur of lost languages" appears once in the opening and Kael mentions "fifty seasons," anchoring the setting in a mythic or post-historical frame. Time does not tighten decisions—the search proceeds at a meditative pace with no clock or urgency. The timeframe colors tone but does not alter tactics or create pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elara's desire "to graft herself onto community" is named early, revisited in her offer to Kael, and fulfilled at the ending ("The graft has taken root"). The motivation drives the search and the dedication. However, it is not dramatized through friction—no competing want (autonomy, fear of rejection) complicates the choice. The motivation is clear and sustained but lacks internal conflict or visible cost in the moment of commitment.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Luminescent ache" is introduced early ("A luminescent ache bloomed within her"), recurs at Kael's climax ("the luminescent ache in his voice"), and implicitly modulates in the final beat ("no longer a void, but the warm pulse of connection"). The tone is consistent and coherent, supporting the story's mythic register. It charges the final image by transformation. However, the ache remains somewhat abstract—more label than embodied sensation—and the tonal arc from solitude to belonging is smooth without dissonance or risk.</comment>
