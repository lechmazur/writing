<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is visceral and embodied early ("soul-deep imperative," frantic heat of the stone), and the final choice to turn the stone inward rather than project outward shows agency under pressure. Internal contradiction is present (duty versus desperation), and the climactic act of listening rather than projecting is earned. However, the resolution reads as fairly tidy—the stone's "frantic buzz ceased" without much visible struggle or cost in the moment, and the tear at the end feels like emotional release rather than a complication that persists.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal with lyric patterning; the protagonist's descent, investigation of ice cracks, recognition of trapped silence, and use of the stone follow motivated linkage. The closure—bloom of hush expanding—is on the page with a decisive change (chaos to peace) and visible cost in the form of three days' ordeal plus the protagonist's exhaustion. Orientation is immediate (Kael, caves, post-arrival chaos). One meaningful tightening occurs when Kael finds the luminous fracture and acts. The cost is primarily retrospective (tension draining, weariness) rather than a live trade-off at the closure beat itself, which keeps this from the high 8s.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The harmonic caves, Glacial Heart ice, and echo chamber stone are all handled concretely and constrain the protagonist's choices (descent into cold, kneeling on stone, examining cracks). The "gently luminous" quality of the ice fractures directly enables discovery and charges the final image (concentric circles as new map). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (cold stone, dizzying light-dance, crack patterns as cartography). The stone's temperature shift (frantic heat → cool and still) tracks causally and brackets the arc.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reclaim foundational silence—is signaled in the opening third and pressure is sustained (frantic luminescence, weaponized storm, fraying hope). One meaningful tightening occurs when Kael places the stone on the nexus and shifts from projection to listening, narrowing options and risking failure. The bloom of hush provides a visible resolution with on-page consequence (peace restored, energy beings calmed). However, the opposition is environmental rather than agentic, and the stone's success feels smooth rather than fraught; no live cost or visible trade-off accompanies the act of listening, which keeps escalation from reaching high 8s.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—silence as foundation, chaos as crucible, listening as restoration—emerges through specific action (examining cracks, summoning silence) rather than statement. The final image (concentric circles in ice, "a testament to balance restored") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The phrase "hammered repose" recurs and reweights the stake, showing peace as earned rather than given. Minor slip: "carrying the quiet within him—a keeper of repose hammered true" in the final line edges toward thematic echo, though it remains imagistic rather than thesis-stating.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; distance is controlled and perceptual signature is consistent (sonic and cartographic lens, "scribe's reverence," "lacework of fractures"). Diction is elevated and poetic throughout, fitting the mapkeeper's voice. Under peak stress the prose remains ornate ("gently luminous pulse," "visual echo of displaced silence"), which is voice-consistent but risks slowing momentum. No dialogue is present. Filter use is restrained ("he knew," "certainty flooded"). The phrase "hammered repose" and "gently luminous" recur inways that feel pattern-taught rather than accidental.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but figurative language saturates nearly every sentence ("lacework of fractures," "dawn's inevitability," "healing persuasion," "crucible"), creating tonal uniformity that flattens urgency in peak beats (the stone placement and conjuring). The phrase "gently luminous" appears four times, becoming a verbal tic. Synonym churn is present: "hammered repose," "earned calm," "forged in chaos's crucible" all gesture at the same idea. Paraphrase loops: lines 213–217 restate "bloom of hush" without added pressure. Template cadence in the final third: "He had found… He had not defeated… He allowed…" These artifacts touch the closure sequence, lowering the score and disallowing 9+ globally per the Q7 rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of sonic cartography, trapped silence in ice cracks, and a stone that listens rather than projects is specific and non-obvious. The emotional truth—peace as earned labor rather than erasure—avoids generic resolution. However, the core structure (hero descends, finds clue, performs ritual, restores balance) is familiar quest logic with a meditative skin. The "gently luminous" motif and "hammered repose" phrasing, while thematically coherent, feel slightly self-conscious and over-polished, reducing felt risk. The piece commits fully to its premise but does not surprise within that commitment.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael is present throughout and makes key choices: descending to the Glacial Heart, examining cracks, placing the stone, turning inward to listen. These decisions create the story's two major turns (discovery of trapped silence, conjuring the bloom). Early signal is strong (opening paragraph). Specificity is high (mapkeeper role shapes perception and method). Causal pressure is clear. Closure depends on his final choice to listen rather than project.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The echo chamber stone is handled in multiple beats: clutched with frantic heat (line 84), placed on the nexus (line 172), used to listen (line 186), ceases buzzing (line 203), rests cool and still (line 337). Its state evolution (frantic → still) mirrors and enables the arc. Early signal (first third). Causal role in climax (the listening act). Closure linkage (final coolness). Irreplaceable properties (amplifies chaos, then channels silence). Visible cost tied to its use (protagonist's three-day ordeal, exhaustion).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The bloom of hush is the story's climactic event (lines 203–226) and shapes the dominant stake from the opening ("find the quiet in the storm"). It is named, foreshadowed ("fragmented lore," line 98), dramatized (wave of quiet expands), and alters outcome (caves restored). Early setup. Beat involvement: preparation, conjuring, result. Closure participation: the bloom *is* the closure action. Causal pressure: finding the method and enacting it drive the final third. Specificity: "visible distortion, gently luminous ripple" makes it concrete.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Gently luminous" describes the ice fractures (line 143), the bloom's ripple (line 213), the ice record (line 279), and the final shadows (line 345). It enables discovery (the luminous pulse reveals trapped silence) and charges the ending image (permanent glow as new map). Early signal (midpoint). Causal role in one key turn (recognition of trapped silence). Closure linkage (final map, shadows). However, it functions more as recurring description than as a trait that imposes visible cost or constrains choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Conjure" is the story's central action, named early ("ritual to conjure the bloom of hush," line 98), prepared for (descent, examination), and enacted (lines 186–203). It redefines options: Kael shifts from trying to project sound to summoning silence by listening. Early signal. Beat involvement: anticipation, preparation, execution. Closure participation: the conjuring produces the bloom and resolution. Causal pressure: the entire descent and ritual sequence exists to enable this act. Irreplaceable: swapping "conjure" for "create" or "release" would weaken the mystical, intentional quality.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Examining crack patterns in ice is introduced (line 107), enacted with sustained focus (lines 119–143), and yields the key discovery (luminous pulse in finest fissures). The method is specific (tracing lacework, following spirals, finding anomaly) and shapes the middle sequence. Early signal (first third). Beat involvement: the examination is one continuous dramatized beat that produces the turn. Causal role: discovery of trapped silence depends on this method. However, it does not reappear or constrain the final act (stone placement and listening), limiting its closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The harmonic caves are the story's entire spatial frame and primary stake (their equilibrium is shattered, restoration is the goal). The Glacial Heart as subzone provides resources (preserved memory in ice) and imposes conditions (cold stone, kneeling). Early signal (title, line 30). Beat involvement: setting pressure throughout (screaming vibrations, dizzying light, cold). Causal role: the caves' acoustic nature dictates the problem and solution. Closure participation: the caves "hummed with listening gratitude" (line 305), and the new ripple-mark map (line 279) redefines the setting's future state.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the energy beings arrive" is signaled early ("Three days ago," line 44) and establishes the inciting disruption. The three-day duration shapes Kael's exhaustion and urgency ("fraying hope," "three days' tension"). However, the timeframe does not tighten tactics during the climax; the descent and ritual sequence feel unhurried. Clock pressure is retrospective (endurance shown) rather than live (no countdowns or escalating deadlines within the final act). Present throughout but not actively narrowing options in peak beats.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"To find the quiet in the storm" is stated explicitly (line 72) and dramatized through Kael's choices (descent, examination, listening). The motivation is embodied ("visceral, soul-deep imperative") and tested (fraying hope, ignoring dizzying light, pouring identity into the stone). Early signal. Beat involvement: drives descent, search, and climactic act. Closure participation: finding the quiet is the resolution. Friction between longing and cost is present (exhaustion, kneeling on cold stone, three days' ordeal) but not deeply conflicted—Kael never doubts the goal, only the method.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Hammered repose" appears twice (lines 257, 363) and the concept threads through the ending third (peace "actively forged in chaos's crucible," "earned," "strong"). The tone modulates: frantic urgency in the opening (screaming luminescence, fractured roar), focused calm during examination, contemplative resolution in the ending. The final image (slow breath, weary smile, quiet air) embodies the tone. Early signal (implicit in "reverence that felt like grief"). Closure participation: the tone charges the final paragraph. However, the phrasing "hammered repose" feels slightly self-aware and label-like, reducing organic integration.</comment>
