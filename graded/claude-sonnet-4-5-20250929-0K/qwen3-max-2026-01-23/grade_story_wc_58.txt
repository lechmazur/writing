<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—understanding healing's geography—but her interior life remains largely abstract. The piece relies heavily on reflective summary ("she sought not death's record but life's quiet reckonings") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The final moment with Kael and the journal writing feel more like closure by assertion than earned transformation through dramatized struggle. Therapy-adjacent phrasing ("the geography of healing," "sacred geography") appears frequently without concrete anchoring in sensory or behavioral specifics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation adequately (who, where, when by ~120 words) and offers a Resonant Reconfiguration through Elara's understanding that absence can be "cultivated ground." However, the closure arrives via exposition and Kael's explanation rather than a dramatized turn. The dominant lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—density increase toward a thematic reweighting—but the final journal-writing beat summarizes rather than dramatizes cost. Cost is implied (Elara now "entrusted" rather than "stranded") but not visibly paid on the page in a concrete choice or forfeiture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The garden is vividly rendered with sensory specificity: "frost-kissed leaves crunched like shattered stained glass," "scent of damp soil and decaying roses." Spatial choreography remains clear throughout (bench, willow, pond, oak sapling, sundial, archway). The setting does constrain Elara's method—she must be present in the garden to "project presence"—and the oak sapling directly charges the closure moment when Kael points to it. Meets the 9+ gate requirement that environment charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding Isolde's absence—is signaled early but never tests Elara with a live choice or reversal. The trance sequence unfolds as a passive reception of images; Kael's arrival provides explanation rather than complication. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs because Elara never faces competing options or visible cost. The resolution is handed to her ("You carry the map now") rather than earned through protagonist agency under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges coherently: absence as cultivated ground, healing as topography. The oak sapling and forget-me-nots operate as recurring images that shift meaning. However, the final paragraph resorts to explicit thesis statements—"explained absences are holy spaces," "obituary... would be a compass"—that replace scene pressure with summary. The persimmon and thread do provide concrete anchors, but Kael's dialogue ("Healing isn't erasing the wound...") borders on overt moralizing that states rather than earns the theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice maintains a consistent lyric-literary register with strong perceptual signature: "twilight sealing solitude," "sorrow transforms into solace across landscapes of the soul." Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract elevation ("geography of healing," "silent communion") that feels more like authorial overlay than Elara's immediate perception under pressure. Kael's dialogue is distinct and grounded ("Her absence from the throne was her deepest presence here"), providing effective contrast to Elara's interior texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative language pervades almost every sentence, creating density without always advancing causality: "autumn had bled the maples bare," "bruised sky," "shattered stained glass," "geography of healing," "atlas," "pilgrimage," "map," "compass," "topography." The metaphor system (cartography of emotion) becomes repetitive and borders on overwriting, particularly in peak beats where clarity would serve better. Template cadence appears in the vision sequence: "She saw... She felt... The explained absence was revealed..." Paraphrase loops occur in the final third, restating that Elara now understands without adding pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The premise—obituaries for the living, projecting presence through an object—offers a fresh angle. The cartography-of-grief conceit is specific and sustained. However, the emotional arc follows a familiar template: solitary seeker receives mystical insight from wise elder, writes revelation in journal. The trance sequence and Kael's timely arrival feel arranged rather than earned. The piece commits fully to its lyric register and thematic lens, but the resolution's tidy satisfaction (all questions answered, all maps now carried) avoids messier emotional truth.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her occupation (obituary writer) frames her mission, but she makes no key on-page decisions that alter tactics or stakes. She kneels, focuses on the thread, receives visions passively, then accepts Kael's gift and writes. Observation dominates; agency is minimal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The crimson-gold thread appears in three beats: gifted by the maid (setup), held during the trance (middle use), pressed into the journal (closure). However, its specific properties do not constrain or enable choices—it functions as a symbolic key rather than a tactical object. Removing it would weaken thematic resonance but not break causality. Scores mid-band for presence across beats with charged reprise but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Explained absences" anchors the premise, shapes Elara's mission from the opening, and is explicitly resolved in the vision and Kael's dialogue ("Her absence from the throne was her deepest presence here"). The concept drives the central question and the final thematic repricing. However, it operates more as framing device than lived pressure—Elara never risks misunderstanding or faces competing explanations that would test her interpretation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Vividly descriptive" manifests in the prose texture (sensory specificity, figurative density) rather than as a character trait that constrains action. Elara's descriptive capacity enables her journal-writing closure, but no on-page moment shows a cost or tradeoff tied to this attribute—e.g., hyper-observation slowing decision, or description as a coping mechanism under stress. Present as prose mode, functional as职业 skill, but not dramatized as a trait with friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Intimate" appears as adjective ("intimate act: a silent communion") and method (kneeling, focusing inward, feeling presence). The trance sequence is central, but "intimate" as action remains abstract—it describes tone more than a specific physical or relational deed. Swappable with "meditate," "commune," or "attune" without major structural change. Mid-band for thematic fit but low causal irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Projecting presence" is named explicitly ("her method required intimacy; she would not summon ghosts but project presence") and the trance sequence enacts it. However, the mechanics remain vague—how does focusing on the thread enable vision? The method is signaled and attempted but not tested or complicated. It succeeds on first try without friction, limiting its causal weight. Functional presence in one extended beat.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The shadowed autumn garden is established early, provides sensory pressure throughout (frost, decaying roses, yew hedges, willow, pond, oak sapling), and directly shapes the closure—Kael points to the oak, the garden's layout encodes Isolde's healing path. Spatial elements (bench, sundial, archway) function as coordinates on the "map." The setting is indispensable to both method and meaning; removing it collapses the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After the last ship sails" is signaled in the opening line and reprised at the end ("wait for spring ships without fear"), framing Elara's isolation and her shift from "stranded" to "entrusted." The timeframe creates situational pressure (she is alone, cut off) but does not tighten tactics within the scene—no countdown, no urgency that alters her choices. Functions as atmospheric constraint and thematic bookend more than live clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"To understand the geography of healing" is stated early and sustained as Elara's explicit goal. The vision sequence and Kael's teaching deliver this understanding, and the journal-writing closure enacts it. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized—no on-page moment where competing desires (fear, doubt, impatience) create friction. The goal is pursued and achieved without visible cost or internal conflict that would elevate it from thematic frame to lived pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" is coherent throughout: solitary setting, lyric-elegiac diction, beauty laced with absence. Tone modulates subtly—opens with melancholy ("salt-thick twilight," "skeletal branches"), warms during the vision ("jasmine and beeswax"), and resolves with quiet triumph ("garden held its breath"). The final image of empathy across time charges the tone with purpose. Tone is consistent, purposeful, and integral to the thematic effect.</comment>
