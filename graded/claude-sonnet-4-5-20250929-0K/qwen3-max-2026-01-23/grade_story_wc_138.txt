<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation is told rather than dramatized through embodied choices under pressure. His interiority is abstract ("quiet, burning quest," "fragile ember") and relies on summary rather than concrete micro-decisions. The final transformation ("tears, the first in ten thousand years") feels unearned—no prior beats establish what specific internal contradiction this resolves. No secondary character appears on the page to test him, so all relationship and status bullets are inapplicable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (prismatic imagery, magnetic field metaphors, memory flashes). Orientation anchors appear early (who/where). However, closure arrives as told revelation ("This was the after") rather than a dramatized beat that reweights prior material. The amulet "dissolved," the tear "sealed," and Kaelen "stood again"—all passive summarized outcomes with no visible cost on the page. The "library woven from solidified light" is described but not tested; no choice is made there, no path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The escondite is vividly rendered with amethyst, citrine, bioluminescent fungi, and layered sensory detail. However, it functions as backdrop; the crystals do not constrain any choice. The spatial tear and library are told as spectacle without tactile interaction. Spatial choreography remains clear. The final image ("dawn's light filtered through the apex, casting rainbows") reprises the opening prismatic motif with reweighted warmth, narrowly reaching micro-setting qualification for a resonant close.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to discover what happens after goodbye"—is abstract and lacks on-page escalation. No reversal tightens options; the solar storm and amulet activation simply deliver the answer via portal. Kaelen steps through without cost, witnesses a repository, and returns unchanged in capability. No trade-off, no foreclosed path, no live price. The "spatial mutiny" and magnetic mechanics are ornamental metaphor rather than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme (remembrance as the after of goodbye) emerges through imagery rather than character conflict. The library of goodbyes is stated ("not oblivion, but a sacred repository") instead of shown through a specific memory that costs Kaelen something. The amulet fragment's curse is told ("betrayed god's final curse") without on-page consequence. The ending shifts from "boredom" to "purpose" via exposition, not earned insight. Subtext operates weakly; the final paragraph moralizes ("He had discovered the after") rather than trusting the image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("prismatic escondite," "non-Euclidean geometries," "compassionate delivery mechanism") that clashes with immediacy under stress. Filter verbs stack ("He felt," "He perceived," "He saw") in high-pressure beats. Perceptual signature is generic—"dimensional awareness" is told as a trait rather than shown through specific, character-bound observation. Dialogue is absent. Distance control is consistent but the voice lacks distinct texture; syntax is uniform and ornamental.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades: "profound silence," "impossible scale," "perpetual, silent aurora," "flawless, suffocating sheen." Mixed metaphors cluster ("visual monotony" paired with "shifting rainbows"; "fragile ember" that "burns"). Paraphrase loops: "spatial mutiny had commenced" / "reality peeled back" / "space rebelling" restate the same event. Template cadence: "He rose... He perceived... He floated... He emerged" across consecutive paragraphs. Key closure beat is summary ("Kaelen stood again... transformed") rather than propulsion. Artifacts touch the ending, disqualifying 9+ globally and capping this category.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Core premise (immortal seeks meaning of goodbye, finds cosmic repository) follows a familiar comfort-quest template without fresh moral calculus. The portal-to-enlightenment structure is stock; the library of memories reads as abstract allegory. Tone ("hushed thunder") is decorative rather than integrated. No risk-taking in structure or perspective; the narrative path is linear and predictable. Transformation test fails: swap names and the emotional arc is unchanged. Proximity to "bored immortal finds purpose" tropes is close.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Bored immortal is introduced early and frames the quest. However, Kaelen's immortality does not constrain any choice—no vulnerability, no trade-off. He steps through the portal without hesitation or cost. The trait is ornamental; mortality would not alter the plot. Present in setup and ending, but no middle development where immortality narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Cursed amulet fragment appears early ("resting on his palm"), activates the tear mid-scene, and dissolves at the end. Three beats, but its properties are vague ("faintly pulsing runes," "betrayed god's final curse"). No cost tied to carrying it; no choice about whether to use it. Swappable with any magical key. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met, but causal pressure is weak and specificity low.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny is declared ("A spatial mutiny had commenced") but not dramatized. The tear opens and Kaelen steps through; no rebellion mechanic, no spatial instability that forces choice. It functions as a portal descriptor rather than a stake-shaping concept. Present in setup and payoff, but no middle beat where spatial rebellion constrains tactics. Ornamental metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Dimensionally aware is told as a trait ("His dimensional awareness—a permanent lens") but never enables or constrains an on-page action. He "focuses his dimensional awareness on the anomaly" with no mechanical consequence. The trait could be omitted without changing any beat. Label-only mention; no cost, no visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Intrigue ("sharp as shattered glass") appears when the tear opens, motivating his step through the portal. However, it is a passive reaction to spectacle, not a decision that creates a turn. The same plot would unfold if he stepped through from curiosity, duty, or boredom. Present in setup and middle, but swappable with minor edits; no causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Through magnetic fields is signaled early ("magnetic fields—a method as old as cosmic magnetism itself") and mechanics appear mid-scene ("magnetic fields as luminous silken threads"). However, the mechanism is metaphor, not constraint; Kaelen does not manipulate or resist it. Present in setup, development, and payoff, but the method does not shape tactics or cost. Functional but replaceable with "spatial energy" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Prismatic escondite is vividly described in the opening paragraph, provides spatial anchor throughout, and reprises in the ending ("crystals now held soft internal luminescence"). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. However, it does not constrain choice; Kaelen leaves and returns without the setting altering his options. The final reprise reweights the image (warmer colors), pushing it into lyric-resonance range.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>During a solar storm is introduced early ("A solar storm of mythic proportions crested") and triggers the amulet's activation. However, no clock tightens decisions; the storm passes off-page without altering Kaelen's tactics. Setup and development gates met, but payoff is passive ("The solar storm had passed"). Time does not pressure choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>To discover what happens after goodbye is stated early ("His sole motivation") and answered at the end ("after goodbye came remembrance"). Setup and payoff gates met. However, the motivation is never conflicted on the page—no moment where he hesitates, no cost to pursuing it, no want-versus-fear friction. Told-only desire; no dramatized choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Hushed thunder appears as a phrase ("The hushed thunder of the mutiny," "The hushed thunder of his own heart") in setup and payoff, and tone is consistent—restrained, layered, metaphorically dense. However, the tone does not modulate with pressure; peak beats (stepping through the tear, witnessing the library) maintain the same register as exposition. Present across beats but static, without tonal escalation that charges the final image.</comment>
