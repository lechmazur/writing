<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is present but interiority remains abstract and label-heavy ("furiously tranquil," "unuttered truths"). The letter discovery triggers tears, but the emotional progression feels telescoped—sob to storm-washed peace within a few beats—without embodied contradiction acting in scene. Micro-choices (smoothing pages, breaking the seal) exist but her internal stance shifts via summary ("understanding dawning") rather than dramatized friction. The final writing act is told, not shown with visible cost or trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is late—who, where, and when coalesce only after several paragraphs of atmospheric description, though the pattern pays off at closure (−0.3 applied, Q3 capped at 7.0). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: storm imagery, darkroom metaphor, and scar cartography accumulate and reweight at the ending. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (vigil transforms from pause to purpose), but the cost is conceptual and asserted rather than felt—no visible forfeiture or trade-off anchors the shift. The letter acts as catalyst, but its mechanics (sealed decades ago by a vanished mentor) arrive late and resolve tension it did not help create.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Observatory, storm, and darkroom timer supply vivid sensory anchors (lightning tableaus, cold window, brass tick). The timer returns with reweighted meaning at closure, charging the final image. However, the setting remains more postcard than pressure—Elara's choices are not constrained by altitude, weather, or spatial logistics; the storm softens on cue without altering her tactics. Micro-setting (timer, cabinet, workbench) does more work than the grand locale.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding scar cartography—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the letter discovery and the sob as dam-break, a recognizable tightening. Yet escalation lacks visible cost: the tears and subsequent peace arrive without trade-off, Elara's writing resumes "steady for the first time in years" with no dramatized obstacle or forfeiture. The darkroom timer chime marks the moment but does not force a choice. Accumulative lens holds, but the deepening is asserted more than earned through on-page consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—scars as constellations, resilience through negative space—emerges through imagery (darkroom, cartography, storm) rather than direct statement. The letter's insight ("love persisted in negative spaces") tilts toward thematic echo, and the final paragraph moralizes lightly ("every scar a story, every silence a space waiting for light"). The ending offers a conceptual repricing but the answer is somewhat stated rather than purely resonant. Emotional honesty is present in the sob but the swift resolution to "storm-washed peace" softens ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, but diction drifts into elevated register inconsistent with a poet under duress ("rarefying memory into luminous truth," "sacred space between silence and song"). Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence carries metaphor—without pattern-teaching or pressure modulation. Perceptual signature is generic; the prose reads more like authored commentary than Elara's lived interior. No dialogue. The voice is coherent but lacks character-particular texture, especially under peak stress where compression or fragment would signal urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "rarefied essence of courage" echoes "rarefying memory into luminous truth"; "vigil in pause" / "vigil resumed" / "conducting one" cycle without added detail. Template cadence runs: "She had climbed… to understand… to trace…" / "She was no longer… she was conducting…" Multiple filter verbs cluster in high-pressure beats ("began to," "started to"). Mixed metaphors: "cartography of scars" as both map and constellation. These artifacts dull the closure image. Apply −1.2 in Q7; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Core premise—isolated poet in observatory receiving mentor's letter—leans on familiar beats (vigil, epiphany via artifact, resumed creativity). The scar-as-constellation metaphor and darkroom/negative-space imagery offer poetic texture but remain abstract rather than grounded in specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The storm and observatory setting feel chosen for symbolic resonance rather than causal necessity. Emotional arc (censorship → silence → cathartic tears → renewed voice) follows a template path without transformation through risk or surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Censored poet frames expectation early and her past censorship motivates the vigil. She makes two micro-choices (opening the cabinet, breaking the seal) but these are reactions to discovery rather than agency-driven turns. The final writing act is summary ("began to write") without dramatized cost or visible trade-off. Present in setup and closure, but swappable with "exiled artist" or "silenced writer" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Darkroom timer appears early (beat 1: "metallic tick"), returns at the emotional peak ("chime softly—a gentle bell"), and is invoked in the final paragraph ("its purpose fulfilled"). However, its function is metaphorical marker, not causal instrument—it does not constrain her choices or alter tactics. The timer's mechanics (why set? what exposing?) remain vague. Charged reprise reweights meaning but the object itself is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Vigil in pause" is named early and the story arc moves from suspension to resumption ("vigil transformed from pause to purpose"). This concept shapes the dominant stake and the ending image. Yet the mechanics of "pause" are told rather than shown—what specific action or choice does she suspend? The concept operates at thematic level without constraining on-page tactics. Signaled, developed, and resolved but remains partly abstract.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Furiously tranquil" is labeled early ("Her posture was furiously tranquil") and the mask is declared gone late ("The furiously tranquil mask was gone"). No on-page action or choice shows the cost or constraint of this state—how does maintaining tranquility under fury limit her options or enable a specific move? The attribute is asserted twice without causal pressure. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Rarefy" appears three times: air rarefies to clarity, censorship rarefies her voice, memory rarefies into truth. The verb colors the thematic progression but does not drive a major turn—it describes rather than enacts. Swappable with "distill" or "refine" without structural change. The action is metaphorical and accretive rather than causally decisive.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Sealed envelope wedged in bus timetable is discovered mid-story and delivers the mentor's letter, the key narrative catalyst. The method's mechanics (why hidden there? by whom?) are briefly noted but the timetable itself ("ghost of ordinary journeys") is ornamental. The envelope enables the emotional turn but arrives late (past 40% mark) and resolves a problem (voicelessness) it did not help create. Functional but swappable with any hidden-letter device.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stormlit observatory is anchored early and supplies vivid imagery throughout (lightning, cloud sea, curved glass, cold window). The altitude and storm serve as metaphorical backdrop and the final dawn "gilded the cloud sea" charges the ending image. However, the setting does not constrain Elara's choices—she could conduct this vigil anywhere isolated and high. Micro-setting (cabinet, workbench) does more causal work. Present across all three gates but more atmospheric than instrumental.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"When masks slip" is invoked once mid-story ("the precise timeframe she had dreaded and desired") and the mask metaphor recurs at the turn ("The furiously tranquil mask was gone"). Time itself is not tracked—no clock pressure or tightening window alters her tactics. The timeframe is thematic label rather than functional constraint. Present in development but vague and non-causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To understand the cartography of scars" is stated early and repeated in the letter and final reflection. This desire frames her climb and the closing verses chart "the ridge of a healed wound." Yet the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants—what does she fear losing by understanding? The letter satisfies the desire without visible cost or friction. Signaled, developed, and resolved but mostly at summary level.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Storm-kissed wonder" colors the opening and returns in the final paragraph ("lingering storm-kissed wonder"). Tone is lush and elevated throughout, modulating slightly (sob breaks composure, then "storm-washed peace") but remaining predominantly poetic and declarative. The tone charges the ending image but does not shift under pressure—Elara's interiority stays in the same register before and after the letter. Coherent but static.</comment>
