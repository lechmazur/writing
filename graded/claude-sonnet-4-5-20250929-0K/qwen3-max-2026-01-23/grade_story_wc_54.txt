<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's functionally creative attribute is shown through micro-choices (measuring angles with the sextant, redirecting water), and her motivation to puzzle out equations for hope drives the action forward. Her "stoic wonder" registers as embodied response ("breath caught," "tightened her throat") rather than diagnostic label. However, interiority leans abstract and lyrical—"mind that found poetry in stress calculations," "soul-stained boots"—without the contradictory impulses or genuine struggle under pressure that would push into higher bands. The final equation "hope equals creative intention multiplied by redirected flow" reads as thesis statement rather than earned discovery through dramatized conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraphs and maintains a single continuous scene with a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the shimmering constellation on the dome reweights the abandoned terminal's meaning through redirected flow. The causal chain—discovery of sextant fragment → measurement → channel clearing → water flow → light refraction—holds under a Causal lens with ellipsis that feels motivated. Cost is legible in the labor ("stone by stone," "rusted bolts") and the quiet pulse of renewed purpose forecloses pure abandonment. One meaningful tightening (hesitant trickle to constellation) is sufficient for this length. However, the closure image tilts slightly toward authored metaphor rather than stark dramatization, and the equation articulation in the penultimate beats borders on thematic summary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail: "cavernous silence," "collapsed directory pillar," "faded imprint of a carousel," dampness near Gate Seven. The sextant fragment—brass glint, celestial coordinates, etched edges—functions as micro-setting that constrains Elara's method (using it as protractor) and charges the final image (placed at water's source, bubbles dancing). Spatial choreography is coherent (directory pillar, maintenance hatch, fountain basin, oculus dome), and the setting guides choice through the blocked aqueduct and subterranean seepage. The oculus and fountain are not merely described but integrated into the climactic refraction beat, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—resurrecting purpose from abandonment through intelligent design—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure tightens when Elara discovers the sextant, measures angles, clears debris, and the water finally flows, narrowing options from abstract puzzle to concrete action. The "soft gurgle" micro-turn and the light refraction provide one meaningful escalation under the Causal lens. However, the opposition is environmental rather than interpersonal or internal conflict with contradictory wants, and the stakes remain somewhat abstract ("equations for hope") rather than viscerally felt. The cost (labor, time, solitary resolve) is present but not foregrounded as a trade-off that forecloses a live alternative path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme—hope as redirected flow, resurrection through creative intention—emerges from concrete actions (clearing debris, water flowing, light refracting) rather than pure assertion. The sextant's celestial coordinates and the liquid constellation on the dome offer non-literal resonance. Yet the final paragraph states the equation explicitly ("hope equals creative intention multiplied by redirected flow") and the penultimate beat ("She had not restored the past, but authored a new equation") leans toward thematic summary. The carnival-leaves-town frame is ornamental, not integrated into the thematic work. Subtext operates in gesture and image (placing the sextant at the water's source, bubbles dancing) but the piece does not fully resist articulating its own meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct lyrical register: "mind that found poetry in stress calculations," "whispered challenge across time," "liquid thread weaving through the stone maze." The prose modulates appropriately from quiet observation to focused labor to awed realization. Perceptual signature—engineer's eye for gradients, hydrological schematics, optimal angles—is character-specific. However, the diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("functionally creative attribute," "stoic wonder," "deep, resonant awe") that reads more like authorial framing than Elara's lived perception under pressure. Free indirect style is clean, no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. The final equation articulation feels slightly outside the established voice's grain.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance setting, action, or interiority. The prose is largely clean with vivid specifics ("tarnished fragment," "corroded bolts," "slanted light"). However, several template patterns recur: "Her [noun] [verb]" structures cluster in the middle third ("Her gaze caught," "Her functionally creative mind surged," "Her movements were reverent"), and synonym loops appear ("stoic determination," "stoic wonder," "reverent"). The bracketed cumulative word counts are generation artifacts but do not obscure causality. "Functionally creative" is used three times as a stock descriptor without fresh embodiment. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "liquid constellation" and "shimmering star chart" work, though "maze of intentions" in the premise paragraph is abstract. Apply −0.6 for template cadence and synonym churn per the artifact pack, disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of civil engineer intern, abandoned spaceport, sextant navigation tool, and water redirection is specific and non-obvious. The image of refracted light casting a liquid constellation on the dome is memorable and grows organically from prior elements. The carnival-leaves-town frame and "functionally creative" phrasing feel more prompt-driven than integral. Emotional truth—quiet determination, solitary labor, resonant awe—registers authentically. However, the equation metaphor ("hope equals creative intention multiplied by redirected flow") and the "maze of intentions" label tip toward abstraction rather than lived particulars. The piece commits fully to its premise but does not take bold structural or perspectival risks; the arc is linear and the resolution tidy. No close echoes of famous works detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's choices—kneeling to excavate the sextant, measuring angles, prying open the hatch, clearing debris stone by stone, placing the sextant at the water's source—create every key turn. Her observation is paired with decision and action throughout. The trait of curious civil engineer intern is demonstrated through hydrological schematics recall, gradient calculation, and protractor use. Present in setup, middle beats, and closure (placing the sextant anchors the new intention). The intern role is less causal than "civil engineer"; the curiosity is shown but not tested under friction. Specific cost: labor, time, solitary resolve. Strong integration, just shy of indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sextant fragment is discovered early (glint of brass), used functionally to measure optimal angle for water redirection, and placed at the water's source at closure where "bubbles now danced around its engraved edges." Three distinct beats with evolving use: discovery, measurement tool, symbolic anchor. Its celestial coordinates ("stars that guided pioneers") and geometry are specific and irreplaceable; a generic tool could not provide the navigation metaphor or precise angle. Closure linkage is strong but slightly ornamental—the sextant completes the thematic image rather than enabling the final hydraulic success. Visible cost: Elara's reverent labor honors "the sextant's implied flow." High integration, nearly indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"A maze of intentions" is introduced in the first third ("where arches once inspired awe, corridors channeled anticipation, and gates framed dreams") and echoed at closure ("anchored this new intention within the maze"). The concept shapes the setting's architecture and the protagonist's interpretive frame, but does not constrain tactics or create on-page friction. It remains thematic commentary rather than a causal element that narrows Elara's options. The actual maze she navigates is spatial (hatch, channel, basin) rather than intentional. Lyric reprise reweights the stake slightly but the concept is more ornament than engine. Mid-band for purposeful recurrence without pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Functionally creative" is introduced early ("Blessed with a functionally creative attribute") and applied three times: she sees latent potential, her mind cross-references schematics, and hope is measured via "functionally creative action." The trait enables her problem-solving but is label-only—never tested against a competing impulse or shown with visible tradeoff. She does not sacrifice accuracy for speed, rigor for intuition, or face a moment where creativity fails. The phrase reads as descriptor rather than constraint. Present in setup, middle reflection, and closure tag, but swappable with "resourceful" or "innovative" without structural loss. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Resurrect" is signaled in the motivation ("puzzle out new equations for hope... from abandonment") and executed through the water-flow restoration that creates the liquid constellation. The action defines the dominant stake and shapes the ending: "no longer merely a monument to absence; it held a quiet pulse of renewed purpose." Major turns trace to this action (discovery, measurement, clearing, flow, refracted light). Specific mechanics matter: Elara does not restore the past but authors new intention. Cost is legible in labor and the stoic awe. Strong integration across beats and closure, though "resurrect" itself does not appear as a verb on the page—the concept drives but is not named in peak moments. Essential but not quite indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Through redirected flows" is signaled early ("work through redirected flows, collaborating with the building's dormant essence"), shapes the method (clearing debris to guide water "not by force, but by gentle persuasion"), and defines the climactic image (refracted light from redirected water creates the constellation). The mechanics are specific: subterranean seepage redirected toward the dry basin via narrow channel. Present in setup, middle action, and closure; the method is irreplaceable—force or repair would contradict the thematic and tactical design. Cost: patient stone-by-stone labor over time. The ending equation restates it explicitly. Very strong integration, nearly indispensable; only the slight thematic over-articulation keeps it from 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport passenger terminal anchors every beat: cavernous silence, collapsed directory pillar, rusted hatch, hidden aqueduct, Gate Seven dampness, dry fountain basin, oculus dome. The setting supplies resources (aquifer via aqueduct, sextant fragment, maintenance hatch) and constraints (blocked flow, corroded bolts, debris). Micro-setting elements (brass glint, engraved coordinates, slanted light through oculus) charge the final image. Spatial choreography is coherent across moves. The setting is indispensable—story logic and closure image fail without this exact location. Present in setup, pressures middle choices (which hatch, which angle), and provides the refraction surface at closure. Exceptional integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After the carnival leaves town" is introduced in the opening ("vibrant chaos had vanished, leaving only ghostly traces—a single lost feather, the faded imprint of a carousel") but does not constrain Elara's choices or create urgency. No ticking clock, no decay accelerating, no return deadline. The carnival metaphor is ornamental mood-setting; time itself is elastic ("time dissolved into the rhythm of her labor"). The timeframe is present in setup and implied at closure (setting sun) but swappable with "years after abandonment" or "before demolition" without altering structure. Functional for atmosphere, replaceable for causality.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to puzzle out new equations for hope, mathematical proofs that purpose could be reborn" is stated early and drives the action: she seeks to resurrect purpose through redirected flow. Desire is dramatized in her labor (excavating, measuring, clearing) and rewarded at closure (liquid constellation, quiet pulse of renewed purpose). Friction exists between abstract aspiration and concrete obstacles (rusted bolts, debris, blocked flow). However, the motivation is never conflicted—no moment where she doubts the equation or confronts a cost that makes her reconsider. The final articulation ("hope equals creative intention multiplied by redirected flow") is triumph without ambiguity. Strong setup and payoff, but missing internal friction. One meaningful causal role in middle and closure; mid-upper band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Stoic wonder" is introduced as attribute and modulated throughout: "quiet" motivation, "stoic determination," "profound silence," "quiet hum of resolve," "stoic wonder, a deep, resonant awe that tightened her throat without a sound," "quiet pulse," "stoic wonder of this small victory." The tone is coherent across turns and intensifies at the climax (breath caught, throat tightened) without breaking into exuberance. It charges the final image (small victory, curious mind tracing the next equation) and reflects the character's engineer discipline. However, "stoic wonder" as a phrase is used three times, bordering on label rather than embodied modulation. Strong integration with pressure and closure, minor repetition friction. Essential to voice and ending.</comment>
