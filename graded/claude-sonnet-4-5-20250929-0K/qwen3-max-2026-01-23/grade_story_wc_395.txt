<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and motivated—her "brightly attentive nature" drives the investigation, and the choice to lie to Vance crystallizes under pressure. The final stance (guardian of intentional silence) is earned through escalating micro-choices. However, emotional embodiment is thin in peak beats; "tears traced Elara's cheeks" and "breath caught" feel stock rather than character-specific, and the shift from investigator to guardian lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene—she moves smoothly through discovery to acceptance without visible internal friction at the threshold.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Causal with accumulative layering. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Elara encrypts Psi, wipes logs, files a false report, and accepts guardianship as her calling; the cost is visible (she lies to authority, forecloses disclosure) and the final image recharges the patch and the archive motif. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly by line 26 (who, where, stakes). One pressure tightening occurs when Vance orders closure and Elara defies protocol, narrowing her options and raising stakes. Minor causality smoothness: the deprecated terminal's discovery feels convenient ("she'd discovered during system migrations") rather than earned through prior scene work, softening the escalation slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The archive setting supplies concrete details (filtered oxygen, humming silence, console, deprecated terminal) and the patch functions as micro-setting, handled in three beats and charged at closure. Sensory selection is purposeful and filtered through Elara's professional lens. However, the setting does not meaningfully constrain a tactical choice—Elara's access to the terminal and Psi feels frictionless, and no environmental obstacle alters her approach. The final image (patch catching light "like a promise") reweights the object but does not show the environment pressing against her decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (discover where deleted files go / solve the cold case) is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Vance orders compliance and Elara chooses defiance, narrowing her path and forcing the lie. The cost is legible on the page: she falsifies records, encrypts evidence, and accepts isolation as guardian. However, the escalation lacks a second pressure point—once she inputs the code, discovery flows without resistance; no lock, no failed attempt, no trade-off between options. The resolution traces to Elara's agency, but the final third coasts on revelation rather than further complication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (some absences are sacred spaces, truths require silence to survive) emerges from the patch, the recurring numbers, and Elara's shift from seeker to guardian without overt moralizing until the final third, where lines like "Some absences were not voids to fill, but sacred spaces to honor" and "keeper of echoes, guardian of intentional silence" edge toward thematic summary. The ending offers a resonant answer (the patch becomes compass/key/covenant, the archive a living tapestry) that reweights prior material. The specificity of the 7-19-42 sequence and Lena's staged crash ground the theme in concrete choices. Minor penalty for the explain-everything drift in the final paragraphs (lines 224–304), which tilts toward assertion rather than earned image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara; psychic distance tightens during peak beats (console discovery, video log). Perceptual signature is professional but not deeply idiosyncratic—"brightly attentive" is told more than shown through syntactic or rhythmic texture. Lena's video dialogue ("you are the keeper who listens to echoes") carries subtext but borders on thematic echo. The prose modulates with pressure (short clauses during defiance, longer reflection during closure) but does not exhibit a distinct rhythmic fingerprint. Filter verbs ("she'd scoured," "she found," "she vowed") are acceptable but cluster in exposition, slightly dulling immediacy in non-peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Clarity and momentum are generally clean, but paraphrase loops and template cadence appear in the final third: "Some absences were not voids to fill, but sacred spaces to honor" (224) closely mirrors "keeper of echoes, guardian of intentional silence" (269) and "Her official report stated the case remained unsolved, a respectful omission. The lie was now guardianship" (210) repeats the concept without added pressure. Sentence stems repeat: "She [verb]" opens six consecutive clauses in the middle section. Information density is high early but thins during the closure epilogue (lines 224–304), where summary restates the stance shift rather than charging a final image with new cost. Minor deduction for figurative muddle: "threads catching the low light like a promise" (218) mixes vehicle (threads as fiber) with tenor (promise as covenant) without clear coherence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise (digital sanctuary for dangerous truths, staged disappearance encoded in metadata) offers a fresh synthesis of cold-case mystery and corporate archive. The 7-19-42 signature and micro-etched patch key are specific, non-obvious choices. However, the emotional arc (seeker → guardian) and the final stance (some truths require silence) follow a familiar template without a bold turn; the resolution delivers exactly what the setup promises without complication or cost beyond the initial defiance. The piece commits fully to its premise but does not transform tropes—Elara's role as "memory keeper" and the archive-as-sanctuary metaphor read as competent execution rather than risk-taking that heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's role as corporate memory keeper frames her access, shapes her investigation tactics (scour archives, input deprecated codes), and drives the lie to Vance and the encryption of Psi. Setup by line 26, involved in inputting the code (middle), and present in the closure choice (encrypt, wipe logs, file false report). The profession is not ornamental; removing it would break the story's logic. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; swappability is low (a generic investigator would lack the archive expertise and ethical friction). Visible cost: she falsifies records and accepts isolation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The patch appears in three beats: pinned to console (setup, line 38), held by Lena in the video revealing the micro-etched key (middle, line 171), and returned to console with reweighted meaning at closure (line 218, "threads catching the low light like a promise"). It is causally active—the serial number becomes the encryption key for Psi—and charges the final image as "compass. A key. A silent covenant" (295). Removing the patch would collapse the code mechanism and the thematic reprise. High irreplaceability and closure participation; cost is tied to its symbolic and literal function.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cold case (Dr. Lena Petrova, crashed Odyssey mission) frames Elara's investigation from line 26, appears on her screen, and is resolved when she discovers Lena alive in Psi and chooses to leave the case officially unsolved (line 210). It shapes stakes (find the truth vs. obey Vance's closure order) and tactics (search metadata, input code). Setup early, drives the middle search, and participates in closure (the lie is a direct response to solving it). Swappability is moderate—any disappeared person could serve—but the spaceship crash and bio-engineer details anchor the 7-19-42 code and patch integration, lowering replaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Brightly attentive" is mentioned twice (lines 48, 239) but functions as label rather than constraint. Line 48 uses it to summarize archive absorption; line 239 ("now saw deeper") claims growth but does not dramatize a tradeoff where heightened attention costs her something (time, focus, social friction). No on-page moment where this trait enables a tactic under pressure or forecloses an option. Present but ornamental; removing the phrase would not alter any beat. Missing middle development and cost connection; setup and closure mentions are thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Elara's lie to Vance's assistant (line 106, "reporting no anomalies found") is the pivot that enables her to continue the investigation, input the code, discover Psi, and ultimately encrypt it and file a false final report (line 210, "case remained unsolved"). The action appears twice with escalating stakes and drives the closure choice—guardianship is "the lie...now guardianship" (210). Setup in the middle, causally active, and indispensable to the ending's logic and moral calculus. Removing the lie would collapse Elara's defiance arc and the Earned Stasis closure. High causal pressure, closure linkage, and felt cost (she violates protocol, risks discovery).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The recurring numbers (7-19-42) appear in timestamps, comment counts, waveforms (line 77), are identified as deliberate signature (line 83), and become the input code that unlocks Psi (line 115) and later the patch's serial encryption key (line 203). Setup by line 77, drives the middle unlock, and participates in closure (Elara uses the code to encrypt Psi). The method is signaled early, shapes Elara's tactics (recognition → input), and is causally irreplaceable—removing the sequence would break the unlock mechanism. Minor swappability: any code could serve, but the metadata embedding (timestamps, waveforms) ties it to the archive setting and Lena's intentional design.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The social network archive supplies the digital footprint Elara searches (articles, photos, playlists, timestamps) and houses the deprecated terminal and Psi directory. Setup by line 26, involved in the search and unlock beats, and reweighted at closure ("no longer just a repository, but a living tapestry," line 232). However, the setting does not constrain choices—Elara's access is frictionless, no firewalls or rival keepers resist her, and the archive functions as backdrop rather than tactical pressure. Micro-setting (console, terminal) is present but does not alter her approach. Closure participation is thematic (archive as sanctuary) rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Across the echo of forgotten songs" (title element, line 67) refers to Lena's curated playlists and the time spent searching them for patterns. It appears once in the search beat (line 67, "scoured Lena's digital footprint across the echo of forgotten songs") but does not function as a live clock or tighten decisions. No temporal pressure from the songs themselves; the phrase is metaphorical color rather than a constraint. Missing middle development (no second beat where song time affects tactics) and no closure participation. Swappable with "over weeks of search" without structural loss. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Elara's desire to discover where deleted files go (line 57, "convinced digital oblivion was a corporate myth") frames her investigation, drives her defiance of Vance's closure order, and is fulfilled when she discovers Psi ("not corruption, but sanctuary," line 135). The motivation is dramatized in the lie beat (she risks career to pursue the theory), tested when Vance orders compliance, and rewarded/complicated at closure when she becomes Psi's guardian rather than disclosing it. Setup early, causal pressure in two beats, closure participation (the lie and encryption). Visible cost: isolation, secrecy, ongoing vigilance. Strong irreplaceability—the motivation is the story's engine.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tone of "sensed absence" permeates the piece: filtered air and old secrets (line 1), Lena as "ghost" (line 26), "void" and "echo" (lines 57, 67, 127), the reveal that absence is "deliberate protection" (line 188), and the final image of "sacred space between" (line 304). Setup early, modulates with discovery (absence shifts from void to sanctuary), and charges the closure (the patch and archive as honored silence). Coherent through turns; the tone deepens rather than breaks under pressure. However, the final paragraphs (lines 224–304) risk over-explanation, slightly flattening the sensed quality into articulated theme. Strong integration but not indispensable—removing the "absence" framing would weaken resonance but not break causality.</comment>
