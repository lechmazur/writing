<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("tranquil blaze," "quiet urgency") rather than embodied contradiction. Her motivation to silence the prophecy is declared but never tested by a meaningful on-page trade-off or conflicting impulse. The final "deep satisfaction" reads as label-only resolution without visible cost or foreclosed path. No secondary character pressure exists to complicate her stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes who, where, and when by the opening paragraph (orientation satisfied). However, the closure—dissolving the prophecy by exhaling "smoothed hush"—lacks visible cost; Elara achieves her goal without forfeiting options or enduring friction. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (mapping silence as landscape, silvery ripples), but the final image offers satisfaction without reconfiguration or price. No meaningful tightening narrows her choices; the sequence flows and-then without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven (moss, brook, roots) is vividly rendered and sustains tone across the piece. The origami wing anchors several beats (held, pulsed, brought to lips, dissolved), charging the final image. However, the setting remains postcard-descriptive; no environmental constraint alters Elara's tactics or imposes a trade-off. Spatial choreography is static (she kneels, remains seated, rises) without movement-driven pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—hushing the prophecy—is signaled early but never escalates through reversal or meaningful opposition. Elara maps silence, locates the fracture, exhales the hush, and succeeds in a linear sequence without a tightening that narrows options. No on-page cost or trade-off is legible; the prophecy dissolves "like salt in water" without resistance. Agency is performed (she acts) but the act does not foreclose a path or force a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme—restoring clarity vs. erasing truth, community vs. isolation—is stated explicitly in the final third rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The crane's wing recurs across beats but its meaning does not shift; it functions as a tool, not a charged motif. The ending summarizes theme ("the most powerful magic lies in the courage to listen deeply") instead of offering a resonant, non-literal image. No plausible counter-reading exists; the moral is tidy and declared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (mapping silence as landscape) but diction drifts into elevated register ("terrestrially cosmic," "tranquil blaze") that feels ornamental rather than voice-rooted. Filter verbs ("she recognized," "she felt") cluster without serving immediacy. Elara's internal voice lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure; syntax and cadence remain uniform from calm to climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Template cadence pervades: "She [verb]" openers recur across the piece without purposeful variation. Paraphrase loops are frequent ("smoothed hush" appears five times with synonym churn: "pure silence," "clean, clear silence," "smoothed hush lingered"). Mixed metaphors ("tranquil blaze," "terrestrially cosmic") clash in register and vehicle logic. Figurative density stacks in peak beats without pattern-teaching or payoff, obscuring causal clarity. Sentence-level word counts in brackets [13, 14, etc.] are generation artifacts but do not obscure text; no penalty applied for their presence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise—summoner silences a coded prophecy by mapping silence—offers a fresh angle but executes via stock beats: locate threat, perform ritual, threat dissolves. The origami wing and "smoothed hush" are specific objects/concepts but their interaction is not transformed by character choice or world constraint. The prophecy's dissolution lacks hindsight inevitability; Elara succeeds on first attempt without adaptation. Emotional arc (weary → satisfied) is generic and could transplant unchanged to another magical-ritual plot.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and performs the ritual, but her choices do not create turns; she follows a single plan (map silence, hush prophecy) without reversal or adaptation. Setup and closure gates met; middle development weak (no decision alters tactics).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The crane's wing appears in five distinct beats (held, pulsed, brought to lips, unfurled/dissolved, memory at end), shaping the ritual and charging the closure image. Setup, middle use, and closure participation all met. However, its mechanics (why it pulses, how it channels the hush) remain vague; it enables but does not constrain. Swappable with another "tuned object" without major rewrite.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Smoothed hush" is named repeatedly and enacted (Elara exhales it, ripples flow outward). Setup and closure gates met. However, it functions as the solution rather than shaping tactics or creating friction; it resolves the problem on first use without cost. The concept is thematic but does not alter options mid-story.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Terrestrially cosmic" appears as a label twice (describing the haven and Elara's final state) but does not constrain or enable action. No on-page trade-off or cost tied to this attribute. Setup gate missed (appears mid-story); purely descriptive.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Flow" is signaled early ("She began the essential action: flow"), executed in the middle (awareness merges with brook's current), and shapes the ritual's method. Setup, middle, and closure gates met. However, the action could be swapped for "focus" or "attune" with minor edits; its unique mechanics do not redefine options or impose cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Mapping silence" is introduced early and executed across two beats (cricket's chirp as valley, falling leaf as plateau, dissonance as fracture). Setup and middle gates met; closure linkage weak (the hush, not the map, resolves the prophecy). The method shapes her search but not the final act. Mechanics matter but do not constrain.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven (brook, moss, roots) is established early and sustained through closure. Setup and closure gates met. However, the setting does not constrain choices or supply resources that alter outcome; Elara could perform the ritual in any quiet locale. Postcard description without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Amid whispered secrets" frames the opening but does not function as a timeframe that tightens decisions. The story spans dusk to dawn (orientation present) but no live clock pressures tactics. Setup weak (vague); middle and closure gates missed (time does not alter moves).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"To hush a prophecy spoken in code" is stated early and drives the plot. Setup and closure gates met. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants; no friction between desire and cost emerges. Elara pursues the goal without hesitation or trade-off. Functional but no internal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" is named three times and sustains a paradoxical tone (calm intensity). Setup and closure gates met. However, the tone remains static; it does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image through contrast. The oxymoron is decorative rather than functional, and diction uniformity flattens emotional progression.</comment>
