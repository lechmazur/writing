<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (grief-blocked creativity) is clear, but her agency consists almost entirely of a single passive ritual—tracing meteors while receiving insights. The "trapped creativity" is told rather than embodied in contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The final "release" arrives through memory floods and a whispered command ("Rest"), not a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. Interiority relies on abstract label-phrases ("profound silence," "fragile flame") and therapy-adjacent diagnostic language ("fear of the pain intertwined with beauty") rather than character-particular perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of sensory accumulation and lyric repetition by the first third. Orientation is anchored early (archway, aurora, astrolabe). However, closure as Resonant Reconfiguration is asserted rather than demonstrated with on-page cost: Elara "surrenders" and feels creativity "uncoil," but no concrete option is foreclosed, no visible price paid, and no tactic altered. The final walk toward village lights and promise of future charcoal work describes a change in emotional state without dramatizing the decisive alteration or renunciation that would earn the shift. Under the accumulative lens, a cadence break or charged image should reweight the stake with cost; here the ending diffuses into multiple restatements of the same epiphany.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The aurora-lit archway and astrolabe are vividly established and recur throughout. The archway constrains Elara's spatial frame and the astrolabe guides her ritual, both shaping the structure of the night's vigil. Sensory detail (cold air, emerald/violet light, aged brass) is filtered through POV and atmosphere is consistent. However, the setting does not meaningfully constrain a choice at closure—Elara could perform her ritual anywhere under the aurora—and the archway's "whispers of centuries" and "silent benediction" edge toward postcard lyricism without altering tactics or foregrounding a specific cost tied to place.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (freeing trapped creativity) is signaled early and pressure coheres through the ritual. One meaningful tightening occurs when remembered pain floods back and Elara recognizes the cage as self-made. However, escalation is passive: each meteor traced delivers memory rather than narrowing options or forcing a trade-off. The climactic "rest" is a surrender to insight rather than an active choice with visible cost, and coincidence (the aurora's timing, meteors appearing on cue) facilitates the resolution. No persistent constraint visibly alters tactics; the astrolabe and archway enable the ritual but impose no friction or price on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme—creativity flows from embracing shadow and light—emerges from the ritual and memory structure. "Remembered stardust" and "shadowed rapture" are repeatedly invoked as conceptual anchors, but they function more as lyric motifs than as earned discoveries arising from specific dramatic friction. The ending articulates the theme explicitly ("creativity flows from wholeness, embracing shadow and light") rather than allowing the final image to pose a non-literal answer. The piece resists simplistic binaries and maintains bittersweet complexity, but the abundance of direct thematic statements ("creativity is stardust, child; it cannot be trapped, only forgotten") in place of scene pressure lowers resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Single-POV third-person limited is stable with no head-hopping. Voice is lyric and elevated throughout, consistent with a moonstruck dreamer's register. However, diction frequently drifts into generic poetic language ("fragile flame against the vast darkness," "exquisite fusion of sorrow and joy") that could apply to any reflective protagonist, and perceptual signature is not character-particular. The attribute "hears unspoken words" is asserted in narration but not dramatized through distinct idiom or syntax that would make Elara's way of noticing selective and biased. Under peak emotional pressure (tears, catharsis), vocabulary remains uniformly elevated and abstract rather than compressing or fragmenting. No dialogue is present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade the text: "trapped creativity" is restated across at least six lines without added detail, and the closing paragraphs cycle through synonyms for the same epiphany ("quiet certainty," "bittersweet peace," "shadowed rapture"). Template cadence runs appear in the middle third ("She traced… floods of remembered stardust surged… vivid flashes"). Stock metaphor strings accumulate without fresh vehicles: "fragile flame," "wellspring of poetry," "river fed by remembered stardust," "tapestry where childhood joy bled into hospital-room sorrow." These artifacts cluster in the final third and dull the closure image. Figurative language appears in most sentences of high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching or payoff, violating density and coherence checks. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: baseline −1.0 for loops and stock strings, escalated to −1.4 because artifacts touch the closure beat, plus disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Core premise—grief blocks creativity, ritual under aurora restores it—follows a familiar template (solitary vigil, symbolic object, epiphany through memory). Tropes (moonstruck dreamer, ancient astrolabe, grandmother mentor, aurora borealis as witness) are present but not transformed through character-specific choices or non-obvious moral calculus. The ritual itself (tracing meteors with an astrolabe) is vivid but does not yield a fresh inflection in emotional arc or stakes; the resolution (accept pain as fuel, creativity returns) is emotionally honest but predictable. "Remembered stardust" and "unwritten calendar" are poetic coinages, yet they function as lyric labels rather than irreplaceable conceptual anchors that reweight prior material. Transformation test: plot and emotional arc would work unchanged with different mystical objects and settings.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her motivation (grief, blocked creativity) frames the vigil. However, her choices do not create key turns: she performs the ritual taught by her grandmother, receives memory floods passively, and "surrenders" to insight. The decision to lift the astrolabe and trace meteors is signaled early but does not narrow options or face a visible cost. The final walk toward village lights and promise of future work is consequence, not agency. Gates: setup (✓), development (passive ritual, not choice), closure (present but not causally active). Late-breaking caps do not apply, but swappability (a generic seeker could perform a similar ritual) and lack of causal pressure limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The astrolabe is introduced early, handled in multiple beats (clutched, lifted to eye, traced against meteors, lowered, felt different at end), and its family lineage adds specificity. It enables the ritual and returns with reweighted meaning ("not a burden, but a compass"). However, its unique properties do not constrain a choice with cost; any optical or symbolic tool could serve. Gates: setup (✓), development (✓ enabling ritual), closure (✓ reweighted in final paragraph). Present across beats, but swappable without breaking story logic. Score reflects beat involvement and closure linkage, minus replacability friction.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Remembered stardust" is introduced early as grandmother's last breath and recurs as a conceptual anchor throughout. However, it functions as theme label rather than a concept that changes options on the page: Elara does not face a choice between different interpretations of stardust or a tactic enabled by understanding it. The stardust "surges" within her as memory, but the mechanics are passive reception. Gates: setup (✓), development (mentioned but does not constrain choice), closure (thematically restated but not causally active). Lyric reprise present, but ornamental use and lack of causal pressure lower integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The attribute is introduced in paragraph 7 and asserted in narration ("the attribute of hearing unspoken words"). It is demonstrated once when stones "exhale" a phrase and again when aurora and meteors carry unspoken words. However, the trait does not enable a choice with visible cost or constrain her tactics; she hears but does not act differently because of it. No trade-off or friction arises from the gift being "burdensome." Gates: setup (✓ by ~25%), development (ornamental), closure (unspoken word "Rest" appears but does not alter action). Label-only mention without causal pressure; late signal and lack of cost cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Rest is introduced as thematic concept midway and named explicitly near the end as the climactic action: "she surrendered completely. This rest was not idleness, but profound acceptance." However, the act of resting does not drive a major turn through on-page choice—it is described as passive surrender following insight. The piece claims rest "unlocked the door," but no prior attempt to force the door is dramatized, so the contrast is told. Gates: setup (late, second half), development (✓ thematically central), closure (✓ named and explained). Causal linkage is weak (rest follows epiphany rather than creating it); late signal and summary-only treatment lower integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The method is signaled early ("lifting the astrolabe to her eye, she began tracing the path of falling stars") and its mechanics matter: each traced arc delivers memory and insight. The method shapes multiple beats (first trace → remembered stardust, subsequent traces → grandmother's voice, tapestry of childhood/sorrow, final meteor → "Rest"). However, the method does not present a cost or constrain tactics; tracing is always available and always successful. Gates: setup (✓), development (✓ repeated), closure (✓ final meteor payoff). Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, but no friction or specificity beyond "trace and receive." Score reflects causal presence minus cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The aurora-lit archway is introduced in the opening line, described vividly, and serves as the spatial anchor throughout. Its "shadow" and "whispers of centuries" are invoked, and Elara touches it near the end. However, the archway does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that affects outcome; she could perform the ritual in any open space under the aurora. Gates: setup (✓), development (static frame), closure (touched, but not causally active). Postcard description without tactical pressure; lyric reprise at end adds minor resonance but does not reach causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Unwritten calendar" is introduced midway as a metaphor ("a timeline measured in heartbeats, not dates") and recurs in the final third. However, it does not function as a timeframe that tightens decisions: no clock runs, no deadline pressures tactics. The vigil occurs "tonight" with no duration markers or urgency beyond Elara's interior resolve. Gates: setup (absent in first third), development (metaphor only), closure (✓ thematic reprise). Late introduction, ornamental use, and lack of temporal constraint result in low integration. The phrase reweights meaning slightly at closure (lyric callback), preventing the score from falling below 3.0.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation (free trapped creativity) is introduced early and remains the dominant stake throughout. It is dramatized through the vigil, memory floods, and final release. However, the friction between want and cost is largely told: "fear of the pain intertwined with beauty" is asserted rather than shown in contradictory choices. The motivation drives the ritual but does not face a concrete on-page test where Elara must choose between competing goods. Gates: setup (✓), development (✓ sustained pressure), closure (✓ addressed). Consistent presence and thematic centrality, but lack of dramatized friction and reliance on summary limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Shadowed rapture" is introduced late (paragraph 17 of 34) as a thematic label and recurs in the final line. The tone—bittersweet fusion of sorrow and joy—is coherent and modulates appropriately (cold vigil, memory pain, cathartic tears, quiet peace). However, the phrase itself is ornamental; removing it would not alter the tonal arc. The tone is consistent but static (elegiac lyricism throughout) without a decisive shift that charges the final image. Gates: setup (absent first half), development (tone present, label late), closure (✓ named). Late labeling and lack of tonal turn at closure prevent higher integration; lyric reprise at end provides minor charge.</comment>
