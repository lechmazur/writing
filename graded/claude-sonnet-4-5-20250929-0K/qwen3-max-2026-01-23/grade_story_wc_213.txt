<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's interior life is grounded in decades of meticulous observation, and her decision to remain silent carries visible cost ("breeding cynicism where trust should grow"). Her motivation to favor listening over noise is embodied in concrete micro-choices: touching the rope, tasting the air, watching ibex. Minor slip: the phrase "credibly curious mind" reads as a label rather than dramatized trait, and the backstory weight occasionally flatlines present pressure despite anchoring her stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Earned Stasis: Elara's refusal to ring the bell forecloses ritual adherence with felt cost (the Abbot's initial "stern worry," her own "release of decades of expectation"). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—decades of data reweight prophecy—held consistently to the ending. Orientation is prompt (Mount Aethel, dawn ritual, solstice context by line 4). One meaningful deepening: the zero-hour alignment crystallizes her choice with visible restraint. The piece teaches its reflective mode early and uses it to charge the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The windblown sanctuary and solstice stillness constrain choice: Elara reads frost-feather angles, barometric shifts, and ibex behavior to diagnose calm, all directly shaping her decision not to sound the alarm. The bell rope's pine-resin glue and the spire's shadow alignment are tactile, purposeful anchors. Spatial choreography (parapets, ridges, clouds below) remains coherent. Minor density: some phrases ("profound solstice hush," "sacred stillness") approach stock lyricism without fresh specificity, though they do modulate with pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—sound the alarm or trust her data—is signaled early and tightens at zero hour when prophecy and instruments collide. The escalation is clear: memory of past false alarm raises cost, the solstice alignment forces the choice, and her restraint forecloses ritual path with visible consequence (the Abbot's approval, legacy shift). Agency is decision with on-page cost. No reversal complexity, but one meaningful pressure point suffices at this length under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: frost angles, brass gauges, ibex calm, and the untouched rope all dramatize "listening over noise" without overt statement until the Abbot's whisper, which reads as recognition rather than sermon. The final image (wind whispers lesson) reprices silence as wisdom with undeniable cost (decades of expectation released, a legacy born of restraint). The piece resists tidy moral; the choice to remain silent carries ambiguity (what if she's wrong?) and rewards it with deeper peace.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with Elara's perceptual bias (storm-tang, ice-crystal chimes, resin texture) shaping every beat. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close at the rope, wider for the sunset reflection. Voice is distinct and controlled. One slip: "credibly curious" and a few phrases ("steadfast resolve," "conscious switch") drift toward elevated diction that feels slightly imposed rather than organically Elara's internal idiom under pressure. Dialogue (two brief exchanges) is natural and advances theme without exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high (most lines do double duty: setting + choice, memory + cost). Clarity is strong. However, three paraphrase loops appear: "solstice hush" recurs five times with minimal reweighting until the final third; "favor listening over noise" appears three times nearly identically; and "decades of expectation/meticulous data" cycles without added nuance mid-story. Template cadence in cumulative markers (e.g., "cumulative: X") are scaffolding tokens and ignored per rubric, but internal synonym churn ("profound solstice hush," "sacred stillness," "lingering solstice hush") within peak beats triggers −0.6. No figurative muddle. Strong propulsion overall, but the repetition dulls momentum slightly in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—storm siren tester chooses silence over prophecy—offers a fresh angle on ritual-versus-reason material, and the microclimate data versus ancient chronicle is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Emotional particulars (spilled ink, anxious glances, ibex grace) ground the turn. However, the broad arc (scientist trusts data over superstition, is vindicated, becomes legend) follows a familiar template without bold risk or surprising cost. The solstice + alignment + prophecy constellation reads somewhat stock; transformation is present but modest. The final legacy framing ("name became legend") edges toward tidy resolution that softens the ambiguity established earlier.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's choices create the key turn: she decides not to ring the bell based on her observations, altering the sanctuary's doctrine. Setup early (dawn ritual), middle development (checking instruments, recalling false alarm), and payoff (standing before the rope, choosing silence). Causal pressure is strong: her humility and decades of data enable the restraint. Cost is visible (release of expectation, legacy shift). Irreplaceable: swapping "humble storm siren tester" for "junior meteorologist" would weaken the ritualistic stakes. Two beats (instrument check, rope confrontation) plus closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The bell rope appears in setup (spliced with pine-resin glue), development (Elara touches the mended section at zero hour), and payoff (preserved behind glass as wisdom's emblem). Handled physically twice, charged symbolically at closure. Removing it would collapse the story's central image and the tactile cost of restraint. Specificity matters: the resin glue's dryness marks readiness, the untouched state crystallizes choice. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Three beats total.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Zero hour frames the prophecy, tightens the decision window (sun alignment), and crystallizes stakes at the climax. Setup (foretold cataclysm at zero hour), development (instruments confirm calm as noon approaches), payoff (zero hour arrives, Elara chooses silence). Shapes tactics: she waits, watches, listens. Cost is tied to it (decades hinge on this moment). Swappable with "critical moment" but the precision of "zero hour" adds urgency. Two beats plus closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Credibly curious" appears once as a label ("her credibly curious mind") in the opening without enabling a specific on-page action or tradeoff. It aligns with her method (tracking microclimates) but does not constrain a choice with visible cost. Setup is present, vague middle involvement (her data-gathering implies curiosity), no distinct payoff beat. Swappable with "observant" or "diligent." Ornamental use lowers the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Switch" appears metaphorically ("a conscious switch from ritual to reason") but is not dramatized as a distinct physical or verbal action. The decision to *not* pull the rope is the turn, but "switch" itself is summary rather than enacted beat. Setup (decision solidifies), weak middle (no discrete switching action), payoff (choice expressed as restraint). Swappable with "shift" or "choice." Summary-only use and late metaphorical arrival limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Tracking microclimate variations is seeded early (frost-feather angles, barometric shifts, wind language), shapes middle tactics (reading instruments, tasting air, watching ibex), and directly enables the climax decision (calm diagnosis vs. prophecy). Method is irreplaceable: swapping it for "consulting charts" would lose the embodied expertise. Three beats (dawn ritual, instrument check, zero-hour diagnosis) with strong causal pressure. Closure linkage: her method becomes sanctuary doctrine. Visible cost: decades of labor vindicated but also released.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The windblown sanctuary supplies resources (parapets for frost observation, spire for shadow alignment, ridges for ibex sighting) that shape Elara's diagnosis and choice. Setup early (granite spine, ancient stones), development (instruments on site, spatial anchors), payoff (spire's shadow marks zero hour). Environment constrains: the altitude and clarity enable microclimate reading. Irreplaceable: lowland monastery would not support the same toolkit. Two beats plus closure, strong causal role.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After the glue dries" marks readiness of the bell rope and signals that zero hour is imminent, but the timeframe itself does not tighten decisions dynamically. Setup (glue mentioned as dried), vague middle (noon approaches), payoff (zero hour arrives). The clock exists but is not a live pressure that alters tactics beat-to-beat; Elara's choice feels inevitable rather than racing a deadline. Functional but replaceable with "when the moment comes." One gate (setup) strong, payoff present, middle weak.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The motivation to favor listening over noise is seeded early ("deepest motivation"), dramatized in conflict (her data vs. prophecy, memory of false alarm), and crystallizes at closure (she listens, chooses silence, the Abbot honors it). Friction is visible: decades of expectation vs. present calm, duty to sound alarm vs. trust in observation. Cost is felt (release, legacy shift). Three beats (opening framing, zero-hour choice, final wisdom). Irreplaceable: swapping for "trust science" would lose the acoustic/restraint resonance. Strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Solstice hush is established early (sacred stillness, ice-crystal chimes) and modulates with pressure: deepens as noon approaches, breathes during the ibex watching, charges the final image (wind whispers). Coherent across turns and directly supports theme (silence as wisdom). Payoff strong: the hush is "cherished… as sacred language." Tone shapes the ending's resonance. Three beats, closure linkage clear. Irreplaceable: "quiet" or "calm" would lack the ritual/seasonal specificity that binds setting, theme, and choice.</comment>
