<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared ("to seed innovation within this constraint") but her internal conflict is thin—doubt appears as a formulaic coil, is defeated via mental checklist, then vanishes. The piece tells us she "prevailed over uncertainty" rather than dramatizing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Embodied emotion is sparse; the kingfisher reverence and data-gathering are exposition, not live choices under pressure. No visible cost forecloses a path; she arrives ready and remains ready.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural attempted but unearned. Orientation is anchored early (spire, lake, Elara). The closure unit is Charged Poise—hand poised above vellum, certainty crystallized—but no on-page cost is legible: no resource spent, no option foreclosed, no felt price in the final image. The "sustaining transformation had already begun" is asserted, not demonstrated. Three moons of preparation are summarized; the single on-page beat (doubt → certainty) lacks causal tightening because the data review simply reassures her without altering tactics or revealing new stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The obsidian spire, frozen lake, and drowned pines are vivid and consistent. The quill and lapis-infused water anchor the final image with purposeful specificity (invisible until warmed). The desk, vellum, and spatial choreography remain clear. However, the setting mostly decorates rather than constrains: Elara could perform this interior reckoning anywhere. The lake is gazed upon but does not pressure her choice, so Q3 cannot enter the 9-band despite solid descriptive work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early (break the frozen stagnation via predictive modeling), but no on-page escalation occurs. Doubt coils, she mentally retraces data layers, certainty settles—no reversal, no tightening that narrows options, no visible price paid. The atmospheric pressure system and fissure mechanics are exposition; we never see a live complication test her model or force a trade-off. Agency is renunciation of fear via internal review, but the reader cannot point to a sentence where cost lands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme (constraint as catalyst, innovation seeded by rigorous observation) emerges from the setup and is reinforced by the kingfisher emblem and predictive modeling. The final image (poised quill, invisible lapis) offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. However, the piece leans on prompt-adjacent phrasing ("groundedly imaginative," "sustaining transformation") and the conceptual cost remains abstract—no particular price reweights prior material. Subtext in the invisible pigment is elegant but not enough to lift the score past mid-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and lyric ("shard of solidified night," "sleeping giant awaiting the precise word"). Perceptual signature is consistent (reverence for natural data, precision). However, the elevated register never modulates under pressure—Elara's internal syntax remains formal even during doubt. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she saw") appear frequently but are voice-consistent. No dialogue to judge. The prose has texture but lacks the rhythmic shift or compression that high-band entries demand.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; imagery is vivid ("ice so thick and clear that drowned pines lay visible"). Information density is moderate—each paragraph advances setup or internal state. No loops or template cadence. However, scaffold phrasing appears: "Her method was predictive modeling, a disciplined fusion…" reads expository; "Doubt, cold as the lake's surface, coiled within her" is generic metaphor. The final third stacks filter constructions ("she lifted," "she dipped," "she poised") without propulsion. Artifact penalty −0.6 for scaffold + stock metaphor in peak beat; closure image is clean but the approach lacks high-density precision.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise (cartographer of ignorance writes the future via predictive modeling at a frozen lake) is concept-rich but the emotional arc and choice structure are template: protagonist doubts, reviews evidence, gains certainty, prepares to act. The kingfisher quill and lapis pigment are fresh details, but the story could function unchanged with a different tool and setting. No bold structural risk; the piece avoids middle-ground hedging in theme but does not transform its tropes through non-obvious character calculus or a turn that grows from lived particulars. Mid-band for vivid world-building without narrative ingenuity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Elara is named, titled, and her role ("ignorance cartographer") frames the premise. However, she makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or options—she reviews data, defeats doubt internally, and arrives at readiness. Observation without agency. Present throughout but ornamental to the single static beat. Cap 2.8 for missing closure participation; late-element and swappability penalties do not apply, but causal passivity does. Final 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The kingfisher quill appears in three beats: initial description (reverence, emblem), the dipping into lapis water, and the final poise above vellum. Setup and payoff gates clear; middle development is weak (the quill is handled but does not enable a choice under stress). Its symbolic properties (patience, fearless plunge) are told, not dramatized through Elara's use. Closure linkage is present but the quill's necessity is not proven—another tool could serve. Band guidance suggests ~5.8: shapes the final image but remains partly replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Writing the future" is the premise and frames all three acts: her title, the predictive model convergence, the poised pen. Setup early, developed via the modeling exposition, and present in the closure image (the future "waiting for its first sentence"). It shapes the dominant stake but does not constrain a middle choice with cost—it is thematic container rather than tactical pressure. All three gates met; causal work is moderate. Lyric reprise (blank page → fertile field) reweights meaning. Score ~6.2 for solid integration without deep causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Groundedly imaginative" is declared once ("She was groundedly imaginative; every vision anchored firmly in nature's immutable laws"). It describes her method but does not constrain or enable a dramatized action with visible cost—it is a label, not a lever. No middle beat demonstrates the trait forcing a tradeoff. Cap 3.4 for missing middle development; ornamental use and label-only penalties apply. Final 3.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Prevail" appears twice: "In this rigorous reckoning, she prevailed" (over doubt) and "Elara prevailed over uncertainty with informed hope" (final paragraph). Both beats are internal; the second is the closure moment. However, the action is asserted rather than shown through a concrete choice with cost—we are told she prevailed, not shown a decisive move that forecloses an option. Setup and payoff present; middle development absent. Swappable with "overcame" or "conquered" without structural change. Cap 4.9 for functional but replaceable and summary-only use.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Predictive modeling" is signaled early ("Her method was predictive modeling") and detailed mid-story (ice-core data, wind logs, star charts, atmospheric pressure convergence). It supplies the rationale for her certainty and is present in the closure (the model "was sound"). Setup and development gates met; closure participation is indirect (mentioned but not dramatized). The mechanics shape her internal stance but do not alter tactics under live pressure—no mid-scene complication tests the model. Band ~5.3: causal role in one major beat (the doubt-to-certainty turn) but not essential across beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The obsidian spire and frozen lake are vividly established in the opening and anchor the final gaze ("Gazing at the frozen lake, she saw…a sleeping giant"). Setup and payoff clear; middle development weak—the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource under pressure. It decorates rather than pressures. Swappable with another remote tower without breaking story logic. Cap 4.6 for missing middle development; ornamental penalty applies. Final 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The timeframe ("before the pen meets the blank page," "three moons" of preparation, "three days" until the pressure system, "this suspended breath before creation") is signaled early and recurs. It tightens the final moment (poise = threshold) but does not create tactical pressure mid-story—no clock forces a tradeoff. Setup and payoff met; development is thematic rather than causal. The ending image is charged by the suspension. All three gates; band ~6.7 for thematic constraint that shapes one key turn (the poised moment) without mid-story escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To seed innovation within a constraint" is declared early and repeated in varied phrasing ("offering not fantasy, but a single, achievable catalyst," "turned constraint into catalyst"). It frames her goal throughout. However, the motivation is told, not dramatized through conflicted choices—no friction between want and cost, no live tradeoff. Setup and thematic payoff present; middle dramatization absent. Lyric reprise without causal pressure. Band ~5.1: shapes the premise but remains summary-only at key beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Sustaining transformation" as tone is consistent: reverent, patient, forward-looking. The prose modulates slightly (doubt "coiled" → certainty "settled") but remains elevated throughout. The final image (poised quill, invisible promise) charges the tone with anticipation. However, the tone does not shift under peak pressure—no acceleration or compression when stakes would demand it. Setup and payoff present; development is static mood rather than dynamic modulation. Band ~5.4: coherent through turns but does not heighten pressure at closure.</comment>
