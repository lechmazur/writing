<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivations are clear but remain largely static. Her quest is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses; the internal arc moves from grief to acceptance via mystical intervention rather than choice under pressure. Embodiment is present ("fingers trailing hedges," "sob escaped") but peak emotional moments lean toward label-speak ("trembling reverie," "quaking in her soul transformed"). The final shift feels granted by the garden's magic rather than earned through on-page struggle with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and remain stable. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers sensory texture, mystical objects, and geometric imagery toward a final repricing where "time's texture" is felt. Closure occurs on the page—the halo fragment disintegrates, releasing memory—but the cost is conceptual rather than decisively felt; Elara's transformation is delivered by external magic, not protagonist agency. Causality is present but relies on mystical mechanics introduced and resolved in one extended sequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vivid, selective sensory detail throughout ("dew-kissed paths," "obsidian pond," "silvery radiance"). The living bridges, maze geometry, and natural elements anchor setting effectively. The halo fragment and photograph function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear across the nexus and pond. The garden's hyperbolic geometry constrains Elara's method and supplies the closure mechanism, elevating beyond postcard description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering time's texture and escaping retrocognitive trap—is signaled early. The tightening occurs when the fragment disintegrates, but escalation is driven by mystical mechanics rather than protagonist agency under pressure. Coincidence (the garden's inherent geometry) enables rather than complicates resolution. One meaningful deepening is present, yet the cost is more conceptual (release from grief) than a visible forfeiture that narrows options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—time's texture as forgiveness—emerges from image and action rather than stated moral, with the final bridge crossing offering non-literal resonance. The hyperbolic geometry and fading photographs serve thematic purpose. However, lines like "time's texture was forgiveness" and "The quest to discover time's texture ended not in science, but homecoming" edge toward explicit articulation. Subtext operates in gesture and image (willow sway, luminous threads) but the ending paragraph summarizes theme rather than trusting dramatization alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single POV with stable distance and consistent literary register. Perceptual signature reflects Elara's horticultural expertise and grief-laden focus. Diction remains elevated throughout ("retrocognitively trapped," "geodesics that diverged into infinity") with consistent voice. However, peak moments lean toward ornate phrasing ("quaking reverie," "trembling not with grief but connection") that abstracts emotion rather than embodying it. No dialogue present. Purposeful compression in the disintegration sequence is legible but borders on lyric inflation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence structure supports scene needs. Information density is high with integrated world-building. Several paraphrase loops appear: "texture of time" recurs five times; "trembling/quaking" and "reverie" cluster without added pressure. Template stems appear ("She'd spend," "She felt," "She was"). The disintegration sequence stacks metaphors ("gracefully unspool," "spiraling upward," "dissolving into morning air") with minor vehicle drift. Figurative density in peak beats approaches overwriting without full pattern-teaching. Clarity remains intact but propulsion dulls.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry as mystical mechanism offers conceptual freshness. Living willow bridges and fading photographs provide specific texture. However, the grief-to-acceptance arc via mystical object follows familiar template: mentor's death, decades of study, magical release at nexus. The core transformation (trapped by past → freed through surrender) reads derivative of many garden/memory fantasies. Elara's internal arc could transfer to a different setting with minimal change. Elevated prose and geometric specificity add texture but do not fundamentally transform the underlying structure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her horticultural expertise frames the setting. Her key choice is to perform the ritual, but this decision is reported as long-planned rather than dramatized under pressure. She enacts the method but does not face a mid-scene reversal that tests commitment. Present across all three gates (setup, middle action, closure) with modest causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The halo fragment is introduced early, handled in the ritual scene, and its disintegration drives the climax. It appears in at least three beats: introduction, placement on altar, disintegration sequence. Its specific properties (solidified moonlight, humming warmth, hyperbolic release mechanism) are irreplaceable. Causally active in closure and charges the final transformation. Strong integration across all gates.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Fading photographs frame Elara's retrocognitive trap and stabilize at closure ("photographs stabilized into a permanent tapestry"). They signal her condition early and their transformation marks resolution. However, mid-scene involvement is minimal—Elara places one photograph on the altar but its specific content does not alter tactics. Present in setup and payoff with thematic rather than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Retrocognitively trapped" is stated early and explained (spending hours tracing blank photographs, feeling absence). The trait motivates her quest but does not constrain an on-page choice with visible tradeoff. At closure she is freed from the condition, but the liberation is delivered by external magic rather than a decision shaped by the trap's pressure. Label-heavy with modest dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Disintegration is the pivotal action: the fragment "began to disintegrate—not shatter, but gracefully unspool." The extended sequence (luminous threads, spiraling geodesics, dissolving) occupies the climax and directly enables memory release. Signaled via Aris's instruction and executed through specific ritual. Irreplaceable; no other action could fulfill this exact story logic. Strong closure linkage and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry is introduced via Aris's notes, explained as the maze's recursive design, and explicitly invoked in the ritual ("letting space itself unravel the trapped moment"). It provides the method's unique mechanics. However, mid-scene tactical involvement is thin—Elara recites incantations and the geometry does the work. Present across all three gates with moderate specificity and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is established early and permeates every beat. The nexus location is chosen for "peak curvature," the obsidian pond serves as altar, and the maze's hyperbolic structure enables the ritual. The garden's whispers and non-Euclidean properties constrain method and supply resources. Willow bridges carry Elara through time's continuum at closure. Strong setup, development, and payoff with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to discover the texture of time itself" is stated early and frames Elara's forty-year study. It drives the ritual action and is fulfilled at closure ("time had texture"). However, the desire is primarily told rather than shown through conflicted choices. No on-page friction between wanting discovery and fearing its cost. Present across gates with thematic weight but limited dramatized tension.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Quaking reverie" appears explicitly twice and the tone—lyric, mystical, elegiac—is coherent throughout. Cadence modulates from reflective opening to charged disintegration sequence to peaceful resolution. However, the tone remains elevated and ornate even during the climax, lacking sharper contrast. The final image ("quaking reverie" reprise, "trembling not with grief but connection") charges closure but borders static lyricism. Coherent with modest modulation.</comment>
