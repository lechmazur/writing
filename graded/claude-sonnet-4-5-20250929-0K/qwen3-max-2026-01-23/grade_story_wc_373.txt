<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is concrete and rooted in her father's legacy, with internal contradictions (protect the truce vs. document its fragility) driving her choices. The three interventions show tactical intelligence and micro-choices under pressure. However, the embodied emotion remains somewhat thin—her grief and resolve are stated more than enacted through contradictory impulses in the moment. The final realization about mending trust arrives cleanly but feels slightly over-articulated for peak emotional stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative texture. The closure lands on-page with visible cost—Elara's recording captures both breaking and repair, reweighting her quest. Each false start causally narrows Silas's options until the truce shatters, then her evidence-based intervention rebuilds it. The two-shard structure (interventions, then climax) is clear. Minor issue: the "curious vow" framing at line 82 feels slightly expositional, but the closure unit itself is clean and earned.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The rotting pier, lantern light, and sea-glass details anchor the space vividly. The watch fob constrains Elara's goal (she must be present to record) and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the exact layout of stalls and Elara's movements occasionally blur during the three interventions. The blue-dye-on-cuff detail at climax is excellently specific and plot-relevant, lifting the setting's role in the resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: preserve the truce until dawn while capturing the fracture sound. The three false starts escalate tension through Elara's agency, each narrowing Silas's options with visible tactics. The climax tightening is strong—Silas's patience snaps because prior options are exhausted. Cost is legible: Elara risks exposure and invests hours of tactical effort. The resolution hinges on her forensic evidence and authority, though the ink-forgery reveal arrives conveniently late in her awareness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—trust's fragility and the choice to mend it—emerges organically from the watch-fob quest and the truce interventions. The final realization that repair matters more than documentation is earned by the action sequence. However, line 293 ("only to learn its true lesson") edges toward explicit statement rather than letting the image carry full weight. The "comforting unease" motif recurs purposefully but borders on over-naming the effect rather than embodying it through perception.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Elara throughout. Voice is distinct—"whisper carrying like stone on water" and "woven from shared secrets"—with purposeful lyric compression. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Elara's lines at climax are declarative and authoritative, fitting her role. Minor register drift: "sonic fracture of trust breaking" (line 68) and "fragile anatomy" (line 267) feel slightly elevated beyond her embedded perspective during action. Perceptual signature is clear but could deepen under peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well; no template cadence runs. Information density is high in the intervention beats. However, lines 70 and 82 contain paraphrase loops ("not vengeance but understanding" restated as "dual vow"). "Comforting unease" recurs four times, risking synonym fatigue. Line 267 ("thwarted betrayal through false starts, preserving peace while capturing its fragile anatomy") summarizes rather than advancing, a scaffold line. The closure image itself is clean. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "weaving the hush back" works, though "quilted from shared secrets" (implied at line 30) and "anatomy" at 267 strain slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—recording trust's sonic fracture at a pirate market truce—is fresh and specific. The watch-fob recorder is inventive, and the blue-dye forensic detail is a strong particular. However, the three-intervention structure feels somewhat formulaic (accidental distraction, rumor plant, urgent news), and the final forensic reveal arrives as a prepared trump card rather than emerging from prior tension. The transformation of Elara's goal (capture breaking → witness repair) is thematic but predictable. Risk-taking is moderate; the piece commits fully but does not surprise in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's choices drive all three false starts and the climactic intervention; without her decisions, the truce collapses. She appears in setup (line 43), middle interventions, and closure. Her agency is causal and specific.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The watch fob is introduced early (line 56), handled during the climax (line 188 recording), and pocketed at closure (line 260) with reweighted meaning (break + repair). It enables the quest but does not constrain a mid-scene choice; its primary function is thematic payload at the end. Two beats plus closure presence, but causal pressure on tactics is minimal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Truce of hush" is named in the opening, shapes all three interventions (preserve it while Silas threatens), shatters at line 176, and is rebuilt by line 243. It defines the dominant stake and alters Elara's tactics throughout. The concept is indispensable to story logic and closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Curiously steadfast" is attributed at line 82 and demonstrated through Elara's dual commitment (protect + document). It justifies her refusal to abandon either goal under pressure, enabling the final synthesis. However, the trait is more stated than tested with visible cost; her steadfastness does not foreclose an alternative path on-page. Present in two beats (setup, interventions) but lacks sharp constraint or tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Thwart" drives all three false-start interventions (lines 105, 119, 133) and the climactic evidence confrontation. Each thwarting act narrows Silas's options causally. The action is signaled early (line 91) and integral to escalation and closure. Swapping it would require full structural redesign.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"False starts" is signaled at line 91 and named again at line 267. The three interventions (sea-glass crash, rumor, scouts) are mechanically distinct attempts that preserve the truce temporarily, fitting the "false start" pattern. The method shapes Elara's tactics and the story's rhythm. Slightly ornamental label at 267, but the mechanic is weight-bearing across the middle third.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The pirate market beneath a rotting pier anchors the opening and provides the physical space for all action. The "truce of hush" rule is market-specific, and the blue-dye inkwell detail (line 230) is a setting resource that solves the climax. Spatial details (stalls, sea-glass crate, ledger) enable tactics. The setting constrains Elara's movements and charges the atmosphere throughout.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Until sunrise" is established early (line 30), tracked at midnight (line 133), and met at closure (lines 164, 243, 275). The time limit pressures Silas's impatience and Elara's endurance. The clock is live and shapes the escalation, though not every beat explicitly references elapsed time. Strong causal role in the snap at line 164.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—capture the sound of trust breaking—is stated at line 68, held through the interventions, and fulfilled at line 188. It conflicts with her secondary goal (preserve the truce), creating friction. The final reweighting (line 293) completes the arc. However, the motivation is more narrated than shown through embodied desire under pressure; it drives the plot but lacks moment-to-moment friction in her interiority.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Comforting unease" is named four times (lines 30, 151, 250, 309) and evoked through the market's atmosphere. The tone modulates—opening whisper, tightening tension, relieved murmur, final homecoming—tracking pressure. The repetition of the exact phrase borders on over-labeling, but the tonal arc supports the closure image and thematic shift from fragility to resilience.</comment>
