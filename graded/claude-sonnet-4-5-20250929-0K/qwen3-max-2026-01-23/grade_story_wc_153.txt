<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation (seeking healing for unspoken regret) is clear and consistent, but his interiority leans heavily on stock phrasing: "noose of pride and fear," "decade of grief." The pivotal moment—witnessing Lena's forgiveness in the condensation—feels more told than earned through prior contradictory impulses acting in scene. Elara functions primarily as a guide rather than applying secondary pressure; her presence channels rather than complicates. The ending grants Kael healing without visible cost or path foreclosed on the page, reading as relief rather than renunciation or trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates atmosphere and motifs (spirits, shard, condensation) toward a final reweighting. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. Closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (emotional healing via witnessed forgiveness), but the cost is abstract—"weight vanished" without a visible forfeiture or path foreclosed. The shard's mechanics (heals in moonlight, evokes memory) are asserted rather than demonstrated through on-page constraint or trade-off. One meaningful deepening occurs (vision of Lena's waiting love), sufficient for length, but the "already forgiven" revelation arrives without prior friction or protagonist agency driving the turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth and Elara's hut are vividly rendered with specific sensory detail (phosphorescent spirits, cypress stilts, damp wood/sage). Spatial choreography remains clear across moves. However, the environment does not constrain Kael's choices or alter his tactics; it functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than active pressure. The shard, though handled twice (placed on windowsill, given to Kael), does not materially shape his decision—it serves as lens and talisman without limiting options. Micro-setting allowance met, but closure charge from environment is decorative rather than causal, capping high-band entry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding healing for unspoken apology) is signaled early. One meaningful deepening occurs when Elara evokes the memory-vision, narrowing Kael's emotional stance. However, escalation is driven by Elara's ritual rather than Kael's agency—he is passive recipient of the vision. The "already forgiven" resolution arrives without visible cost or trade-off on the page; Kael does not renounce pride, forfeit a path, or make a choice that forecloses an option. The ending grants relief without a price that alters later tactics or crystallizes consequence. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens but lacks the felt cost required for high bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (love transcends silence, forgiveness exists beyond communication) emerges from particulars—spirits as witnesses, condensation messages, the unsent letter. Subtext operates in the vision of Lena smoothing the crumpled draft. However, the final paragraph leans into explicit statement: "Love transcends silence," "fierce tenderness." The shard's symbolic charge (gargoyle healing) is asserted rather than discovered through dramatic action. The ending offers a clear thematic answer but edges toward moralizing summary rather than resonant image alone. No severe thematic echo penalty, but the articulation reduces ambiguity and lowers band potential.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV held throughout; no head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric, elevated register consistent with the mangrove mysticism. Elara's dialogue ("You carry the silence of words unspoken") reads slightly stilted but fits the cryptic-medium archetype. However, diction drifts into abstract elevation during peak beats ("healing washed over him," "burden dissolving"), reducing embodied specificity under pressure. Perceptual signature is present (Kael's focus on regret, touch of letter) but not character-particular enough to distinguish from generic lyric fantasy voice. Compression at closure is acceptable, but the lack of textural specificity under stress limits high-band entry.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Significant density and figurative language pervade high-pressure beats without clear pattern payoff: "noose of pride and fear," "hinge—the moment before deciding," "burden dissolving in moonlight." Multiple paraphrase loops: paragraph recounting Kael's regret echoes earlier exposition; "fierce tenderness" recurs four times without evolving. Template cadence in the final third: "The mangrove labyrinth, once... now..."; "Above, the moon poured..."; "He finally understood..." Filter-verb reliance ("saw his younger self," "saw Lena") stacks in the vision sequence. Stock metaphors ("sharp" fear, "soft" luminescence) and therapy-speak ("decade of grief," "healing washed over") reduce precision. Artifacts touch closure beats, triggering accumulation penalties and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact-penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Core premise (medium helps protagonist witness unspoken forgiveness via mystical vision) follows familiar template: guilt-ridden seeker, cryptic guide, magical object, revelatory healing. The mangrove-spirits setting offers atmospheric specificity, but the emotional arc (regret → vision → relief) does not transform the template through non-obvious moral calculus or lived-in world logic. The shard and condensation mechanics function as conveniences rather than constraints with trade-offs. "Fierce tenderness" as tone and the "moment before deciding" frame gesture toward freshness but remain abstract labels. No close proximity to famous work, but the synthesis reads derivative of mystical-healing narratives without a sharp inflection that redefines expectations.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara appears early (setup gate met) and drives the middle ritual beat (development gate met). She places the shard on the windowsill and traces condensation to evoke the vision—two distinct touches. Her actions enable Kael's healing, shaping the ending (payoff gate met, all three present). However, her role is facilitative; she does not make a choice that narrows options or imposes cost. Removing her exact archetype (cryptic medium) would require restructuring, but swapping for another mystical guide would work with minor edits. Functional across beats but replaceable in specificity; causal pressure is moderate. Band: 4.8 (functional, essential enabler, but lacks irreplaceability and protagonist-level agency).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The shard is introduced early (Elara cradles it, setup gate met), used twice (placed on windowsill to "heal in moonlight," given to Kael at the end, development and payoff gates met). Its properties (channels rain, heals, acts as lens) are asserted and it participates in the closure image ("pulsed with gentle warmth"). However, its mechanics do not constrain choice or impose cost—it functions as ambient enabler rather than tactical necessity. Swapping for another mystical artifact (crystal, talisman) would require minor descriptive edits but leave structure intact. Present across beats and charged at closure, but lacks irreplaceability. Band: 5.9 (shapes one key turn and returns with meaning, but swappable).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Unsent letters frame the premise (Kael's letter in pocket, jars of letters in Elara's hut, setup gate met). The concept shapes the dominant stake (unspoken apology) and drives the ritual's focus ("evoke the precise moment before you decided not to send the letter," development gate met). The ending hinges on the realization that "the unsent letter was never a barrier," reweighting the premise (payoff gate met, all three gates present). However, the letter itself remains static in Kael's pocket; its physical handling does not constrain tactics or create visible cost. The concept is thematic backbone but does not force trade-offs on the page. Strong thematic and structural presence but moderate causal pressure. Band: 6.7 (shapes one key turn and is essential to the ending's charge, but tactical constraint is limited).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The attribute "heals in moonlight" is mentioned twice: Elara places the shard on the windowsill "where moonlight would soon bathe it," and the ending notes "moonlight poured healing light." Setup and payoff gates met; middle development weak (the shard glows but does not demonstrably heal via moonlight on the page—emotional shift occurs during the vision, not the moonlight exposure). The trait does not constrain choice or create a trade-off; Elara and Kael do not wait for moonlight or adjust tactics around its arrival. Label-only integration. Swapping "moonlight" for "dawn" or "ritual focus" would require minimal edits. Band: 4.2 (present and logically consistent, but ornamental; no visible cost or constraint).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Evoke" is the central action: Elara's goal ("evoke the precise moment before you decided not to send the letter") and her method (tracing condensation, "evoking messages"). Setup and development gates met. The vision that results drives Kael's emotional turn, shaping the ending (payoff gate met, all three gates present). However, the action is Elara's, not Kael's—he is passive receiver. Removing "evoke" and replacing with "reveal" or "summon" would require minor synonym edits without structural change. The action is load-bearing for the ritual beat but swappable in exact verb choice. Strong thematic fit, moderate causal irreplaceability. Band: 6.3 (shapes one key turn and the ending, but swappable and not protagonist-driven).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Method introduced mid-story when Elara traces condensation on the fogged windowpane to evoke messages ("Remember the rain. Remember her waiting hands."). Setup gate missed (not present in first third); development and payoff gates met (the condensation messages trigger the vision and the final "You are forgiven" message appears in condensation). The method is specific and participates in two beats, but it arrives late and resolves a problem (how to access the memory) it did not help create earlier. Swapping for another medium (mirror, water bowl) would require moderate edits but leave structure mostly intact. Late first appearance (−0.4), resolves without priming (−0.7). Band: 5.7 (shapes one key turn with closure linkage, but late and somewhat replaceable).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Mangrove labyrinth with singing spirits is vividly established in the opening (setup gate met). The spirits' "constant, gentle chorus" recurs and Elara invokes them as witnesses (development gate weak—they do not constrain tactics). The ending notes "the spirits wove a new melody of peace," participating in the final image (payoff gate met, two of three gates present). However, the setting functions as atmospheric container rather than active pressure; removing the mangrove and spirits and placing the scene in a forest shrine or mountaintop hut would require moderate atmospheric edits but leave causality intact. Lyric reprise reweights mood but does not alter options. Band: 4.6 (purposeful early setup and final reprise, but functionally replaceable and no tactical constraint).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Timeframe ("the space where an apology waits unspoken") is announced mid-story by Elara and frames the ritual's goal (setup missed in first third, development gate met). The vision explicitly seeks "the suspended space where apology waits" and the ending claims understanding of "the moment before deciding" (payoff gate met, two of three gates present). However, time as constraint is abstract; no live clock tightens tactics, and Kael does not race moonrise or wrestle duration. The timeframe is thematic rather than tactical. Swapping for "the moment of regret" or "the threshold of forgiveness" would require synonym edits. Lyric resonance present but no causal pressure. Band: 5.2 (shapes thematic frame and ending, but lacks tactical constraint and is somewhat swappable).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Motivation ("to find the moment before deciding") is stated explicitly by Kael early ("sought the cryptic medium") and reiterated by Elara and in the ending reflection (setup, development, payoff gates met). The vision dramatizes this desire when Kael sees "the hinge—the moment before deciding," and the ending confirms "he finally understood the motivation." However, the motivation is told more than conflicted on the page; Kael does not wrestle competing wants or face a trade-off between seeking healing and accepting loss. The desire drives the plot but is not dramatized through friction or cost. Strong thematic presence, moderate causal pressure. Band: 6.1 (shapes the arc and ending, but lacks on-page friction between wants and costs).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Tone label "fierce tenderness" recurs four times: in the description of Elara's gaze ("fierce yet tender"), her voice ("fierce tenderness"), the shard's promise, and the final truth. Setup and payoff gates met; development gate weak (the tone is asserted in dialogue tags and summary rather than modulating through syntax or image under pressure). The pairing is distinctive but becomes a repeated label rather than an enacted tonal shift. Removing "fierce tenderness" and replacing with "compassionate strength" would require synonym edits but leave emotional arc intact. Lyric reprise present but static rather than dynamic. Band: 5.4 (purposeful reprise and closure linkage, but label-reliant and somewhat swappable).</comment>
