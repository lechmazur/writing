<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior is richly drawn with embodied contradictions—the fever-sharpened perception versus her engineered fault-tolerance creates genuine tension. The shift from arrogant oracle to grief-aware witness is earned through the smudge discovery, though the final transformation reads slightly too complete for the compressed timeframe. Micro-choices (leaning close, breath fogging the page, the tear falling) effectively anchor abstract remorse in physical action. The "swallowed truth" metaphor does some heavy thematic lifting that borders on diagnostic label-speak but remains grounded in her profession.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: perception fragments accrue density until the smudge revelation reweights the dominant stake (guilt over Kael's death). Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Elara's acceptance of the margin, transformed fault-tolerance, and embodied grief constitute a stance crystallization with felt cost (the stone of remorse becomes an anchor). Orientation anchors promptly (weather station, post-fever dawn, alone). The causality is clean: fever strips certainty → peripherally aware gaze finds smudge → memory surfaces → tear clarifies hidden bud → aurora witnesses transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mountain weather station supplies concrete constraints: frost-rimed anemometers, barometer needle tremor, oak desk, and the logbook all participate in action rather than postcard description. The fever-thin air and melting ice drip create sensory anchors filtered through Elara's sharpened state. The aurora at closure charges the final image with "auroral sorrow," converting setting into emotional witness. Spatial choreography is clean (cabin interior, window, approaching squall) and the professional idiom (sensor failures, pressure dip, atmospheric chaos) reads plausible without over-exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—locating the weight of a swallowed truth—is signaled early and tightens through the smudge discovery, which narrows options from abstract guilt to concrete recognition. The piece delivers one meaningful deepening: Elara's realization that her fault-tolerance failed Kael by tolerating her own pride. The auroral witness and final window moment crystallize her transformation with felt cost (humility, ongoing grief as anchor). Agency is clear: she chooses to lean close, to not look away, to trust the margin—all renunciations of her prior arrogance that foreclose the path of flawless oracle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the smudge as physical correlate: imperfection as guide, margins as truth-site, swaying certainties as living texture rather than flaw. The botanical illustration's "deliberate flaw" and Kael's marginalia ("Truth roots in the unseen") avoid overt thesis statements by remaining object-bound. The aurora functions as Conceptual Repricing—"sorrowful emerald and violet light" reframes loss as "love persisting through collision," charging the ending without moralizing. The final whisper ("I trust the margin now") stays concrete, a vow rather than a lesson, and the piece resists tidy resolution by keeping grief as an active anchor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with controlled psychic distance; Elara's perceptual signature (peripherally aware, margins-first) is distinct and consistent. Diction occasionally elevates beyond her immediate crisis register ("the beautiful, aching recognition of love persisting through loss"), though the elevated moments align with post-fever clarity. Free indirect style is clean, and no head-hopping occurs. The prose successfully modulates from fever-drift fragility to firmer resolution without voice rupture. No dialogue is present; judgment limited to narrative voice, which remains coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high and rhythm varies purposefully (short declaratives during memory flash, longer accumulative sentences during aurora witness). However, several lines border on overwriting: "the swaying certainties of the world were not a flaw to correct, but the very texture of a living truth" and "a river of sorrowful emerald and violet light bleeding across the star-dusted sky" stack metaphor without adding plot pressure. Minor paraphrase loop: "swaying certainties" appears three times with slight variation. The smudge mechanics are legible, and peak beats (tear falling, aurora rising) remain clear. No scaffolding or template cadence detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The peripherally aware oracle and margins-as-method premise offers a fresh synthesis of fault-tolerance metaphor and grief processing. The smudge as teaching device (deliberate flaw revealing hidden form) feels earned rather than convenient. However, the weather-station-as-isolation-crucible and guilt-over-dead-mentor beats are familiar in literary fiction; transformation here is moderate—the auroral witness and botanical-illustration vehicle elevate but don't fully escape the template. The piece commits to its premise and follows implications without hedging, but the emotional arc (arrogant expert humbled by loss) is well-trodden territory given specific new texture rather than reimagined structure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara as fault-tolerant oracle is seeded early (engineered to absorb sensor failures), drives the middle turn (her algorithms swallowed Kael's warning), and shapes closure (transformed tolerance now holds grief). Her professional identity directly creates the guilt stake and her renunciation of flawless-record pride. Three-gate presence with causal pressure and closure linkage. Moderate irreplaceability: another expert role could serve, but fault-tolerance metaphor tightly braids with swaying certainties and margin method.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The botanical illustration appears in two distinct beats: initial discovery (meticulous ink, patient observation) and post-tear clarity (hidden bud visible, smudge as lesson). It returns with reweighted meaning at closure ("no longer a symbol of broken perfection, but a map of resilience"). Early signal, middle involvement (smudge discovery triggers memory), and closure participation (she closes the logbook gently, integrating its lesson). Strong specificity: Glacier Lily rendering with sepia smudge is irreplaceable, and the hidden contour mechanic directly enables the grief resolution.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Swaying certainties is named in paragraph four, recurs as fever-effect ("swaying certainties where bedrock conviction once stood"), and returns explicitly near closure ("The swaying certainties of the world were not a flaw to correct"). It shapes the dominant stake (lost certainty motivates the search for truth's weight) and alters final stance (acceptance of swaying as living texture). However, much of its work is thematic echo rather than on-page constraint; it does not narrow a tactical choice in real time. Mid-band for stake-framing and closure participation, but limited causal pressure during beats.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Peripherally aware is embodied early (awareness of drip, tremor, ghost-scent; gaze avoiding overwhelming center) and directly enables the smudge discovery (oblique light reveals hidden contour). The method constrains her perception throughout, shaping how she processes grief. Appears in closure beat ("the humility of being peripherally aware of grace"). Two-gate presence with moderate causal pressure: the trait enables the key discovery and colors the resolution. Swappable to some degree (another perceptual mode could serve), limiting top-band eligibility.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The smudge is the hinge object: Elara's tear falling onto it darkens the hidden shape into clarity, which crystallizes her recognition and transforms her guilt into anchor. The smudge mechanic (sepia ink blurring lower margin, hiding a second closed bud) is specific and irreplaceable—removing it breaks the discovery logic and the deliberate-flaw teaching moment. Present in setup (noticed on page), development (she leans close, breath fogs), and closure (smudge as final lesson). High causal pressure and specificity; strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Occupying margins is seeded early ("to find clarity not by confronting the center, but by occupying margins"), demonstrated in the smudge discovery (oblique light, peripheral vision discerning hidden contour), and voiced at closure ("I trust the margin now"). The method shapes her tactical approach (whitespace between data points, silence between radio bursts) and the peak beat's mechanics. Three-gate presence with moderate causal pressure. Slightly abstract—could read as thematic gloss rather than embodied constraint—but the oblique-light technique and marginalia attention give it concrete footing.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The mountain weather station supplies professional context (anemometers, barometer, pressure dip, sensor failures) and isolation that frames the internal reckoning. The oak desk holds the logbook, and the observation window stages the aurora closure. Setting enables oracle identity and provides the descent path where Kael died. Two-gate presence (setup anchor, closure window) with moderate tactical participation—isolation allows uninterrupted reflection, though another remote station could substitute. Does not tightly constrain a mid-scene choice; functions more as coherent backdrop than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Post-fever timeframe is anchored at opening ("The fever released Elara at dawn") and colors her perception (limbs leaden, mind adrift, sharpened sight). The timing enables her vulnerability and heightened state but does not create a ticking-clock pressure; the piece unfolds in psychological time rather than urgent tempo. One-gate presence (setup only); no middle or closure participation. The fever aftermath is functional but replaceable—another catalyst (insomnia, isolation, anniversary) could serve. Trend mid-band for setup contribution without escalation leverage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Finding the weight of a swallowed truth is the explicit dominant stake ("Her motivation now was not to forecast the next squall, but to locate the precise, physical weight of a truth"), dramatized through the smudge investigation, and resolved when "the weight of that swallowed truth settled upon her chest—a cold, dense stone of remorse." The motivation drives every beat: gaze settling on logbook, leaning close, memory surfacing, tear falling, final acceptance. Three-gate presence with high causal pressure and closure linkage. Strong irreplaceability: the swallowed-truth metaphor braids tightly with fault-tolerance and the stone/anchor imagery.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Auroral sorrow is embodied at closure ("a river of sorrowful emerald and violet light") and defined on the page ("not despair; it was the beautiful, aching recognition of love persisting through loss"). The tone suffuses the piece—fever-drift melancholy, quiet grief, peripheral tenderness—and modulates from numbness to active sorrow to grounded acceptance. The aurora charges the final image and converts setting into emotional witness. Two-gate presence (development tone, closure image) with strong thematic coherence. Slight over-articulation ("auroral sorrow was not despair; it was...") edges toward telling, but the river image grounds it.</comment>
