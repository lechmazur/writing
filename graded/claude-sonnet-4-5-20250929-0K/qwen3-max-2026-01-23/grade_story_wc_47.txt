<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (grafting new meaning) is present but interiority relies heavily on therapeutic abstraction ("raw, exposed nerves," "to graft new meaning onto old wounds"). The micro-choice—placing the pendant—is dramatized, but internal conflict remains declarative rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The cost (leaving the pendant) reads as symbolic release more than a foreclosed path with visible consequences. Embodied emotion is gestural ("thumb traced," "knelt") without visceral particularity under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The icicle pattern guides the ritual act, creating a single meaningful tightening when Elara places the pendant. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis via ritual renunciation), but cost remains oblique—the pendant's loss is more symbolic than a felt forfeiture that alters options. Orientation is clear early. The lens holds, but the final image ("honeyed hush followed her") abstracts rather than charges with undeniable pressure. One distinct deepening suffices at this length, yet the ending reads as thematic summary more than on-page reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The moss garden setting is vivid and filtered through Elara's watchful attention ("emerald moss carpets," "honeyed shafts"). The icicle pattern on concrete constrains her ritual path, guiding the pendant placement. The environment charges the final act—moss as altar—though the setting functions more as backdrop to internal work than as a force that narrows tactical options. Micro-setting (the moss circle) participates in closure, lifting the score.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: healing from public exposure of regret. One meaningful tightening occurs when the icicle pattern leads to the moss circle, prompting the pendant's release. Agency is renunciation, but the choice lacks a visible trade-off—no live alternative is foreclosed, and the viral storm remains external backdrop. Pressure is more atmospheric than escalating; the ritual deepens her stance but doesn't force a costly decision between competing goods.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (transformation through patient release) emerges from the moss garden and icicle metaphor. The final image attempts resonance ("wounds could become waypoints"), but the last five paragraphs summarize theme rather than letting the moss-circle image speak. "Honeyed hush" recurs but risks becoming a label. The pendant's release offers a concrete particular, yet the thematic answer is stated ("healing was not passive waiting") instead of embodied solely through action and image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice is controlled and lyric, with a distinct textural signature ("honeyed hush," "crystalline cartography"). Psychic distance is stable throughout. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that slightly exceeds the immediate perceptual frame ("gratted new meaning," "palpable acceptance"). No head-hopping. The prose maintains rhythmic coherence, and compression (the ritual sequence) is purposeful. One minor slip: "grafted" as verb feels slightly imported rather than organically Elara's lexicon under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, repeated abstract phrases ("honeyed hush" appears five times, "quietly proactive" twice, "watchful dreamer" thrice) create minor synonym loops. The final third summarizes rather than propels ("She would return tomorrow…"). Template cadence in the closing sequence: "The watchful dreamer smiled… Her quiet proactivity… And in that protected vulnerability…" These runs of declarative thesis statements dull momentum. No causality breaks, so penalties remain in Q7. Figurative language is consistent but occasionally stacks without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The moss-garden-as-healing-space and ritual-offering frame are familiar; the icicle pattern adds a fresh detail but doesn't transform the template. Emotional arc (regret → acceptance) and symbolic closure (pendant left behind) follow predictable beats. The combination of elements is competent but offers no non-obvious synthesis or bold structural risk. Transformation test: swap names and setting details, and the arc remains largely unchanged. The piece executes a recognizable prompt formula without a distinct artistic risk or surprise that elevates it above the template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elara's watchfulness is present throughout (tracking the icicle pattern, observing moss). Her decision to follow the pattern and place the pendant constitutes agency, shaping the middle beat and closure. However, observation dominates over choice—she enacts a pre-formed plan rather than making a turn under pressure. Present in setup, middle action, and ending, meeting all three gates, but causal pressure is modest.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The amber pendant is introduced early (setup), handled in the ritual sequence (middle: "unclasped," "pressed into soil"), and charges the closure image ("amber gleamed, a silent promise"). It appears in three distinct beats with evolving significance (regret anchor → offering → waypoint). The pendant's release forecloses retrieval and symbolizes cost, though the cost is conceptual rather than tactical. Strong closure linkage and irreplaceability elevate the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Honeyed hush" recurs as atmospheric descriptor and thematic motif but does not constrain choices or alter tactics. It frames the garden's tone (setup) and returns in the final image, creating a lyric reprise. However, it remains primarily tonal rather than causal—Elara's actions would proceed identically without it. Present in opening and ending (two gates), but lacks middle development as a pressure element. Lyric allowance lifts it modestly.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Quietly proactive" is labeled twice and dramatized once (seeking the garden, performing the ritual rather than waiting for outrage to fade). The trait enables the plot's central action but is articulated more than it constrains a choice with visible cost. Setup and middle presence are clear; closure linkage is implicit (the ritual completes her proactive stance). Functional but somewhat label-reliant; the story tells us she is proactive rather than showing a hard trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Proffer" (offering the pendant) is the story's central action, signaled early, executed in the middle ritual sequence, and directly shaping the closure image. The act is specific and irreplaceable—the story's structure depends on it. However, the gesture is more symbolic than a turn that redefines options; it enacts a predetermined plan rather than a choice made under pressure that narrows live alternatives. Strong beat involvement and closure participation; swappability is low.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The icicle drip pattern is introduced at the midpoint ("delicate roadmap left by… thawing icicles"), guides Elara's path to the moss circle (middle use), and implicitly shapes the closure (the pattern's lesson: "water, drop by drop, reshapes stone"). It constrains her ritual choreography and carries thematic weight. Missing early setup (introduced ~40% in); late arrival and primarily metaphorical rather than tactical use lower the score. Two gates met (middle, closure), but setup is absent.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned data center / moss garden anchors every beat: it frames the opening, supplies the icicle pattern and moss circle that structure Elara's ritual, and charges the final image. The setting is specific (server racks, skylights) and participates causally—the moss circle becomes the altar for her offering. Strong setup, middle involvement, and closure participation. The garden constrains the ritual's form and provides the resources (moss, light) that make the moment resonate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the confession goes viral" is present in the opening and motivates Elara's retreat, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or track duration. The viral storm remains distant backdrop; no live clock pressures her ritual. Setup only (gate met), but missing middle development and closure linkage. The temporal frame is functional context rather than a constraint that alters tactics or escalates cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To graft new meaning onto old wounds" is articulated early, drives the pendant-offering ritual (middle), and is thematically restated at closure. The motivation is somewhat told ("her quiet mission") but is also enacted through the ritual. Present in all three gates, but the desire lacks internal friction—no competing want or fear complicates the choice. The motivation is unified rather than conflicted, which limits its causal charge. Solid integration, modest pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Protected vulnerability" is introduced early ("sanctuary of protected vulnerability") and recurs in the closing lines ("in that protected vulnerability, she found… courage"). Tone is coherent and modulates slightly as Elara moves from raw exposure to fortified acceptance. However, the tone is more static label than dynamic shift—it describes her state rather than charging the final image with undeniable pressure. Lyric reprise (early–final) meets two gates; missing middle modulation under stress. The phrase risks becoming a thematic tag rather than felt tonal texture.</comment>
