<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (to hush guilt) is stated clearly, but her interior experience relies heavily on label-speak and abstract emotional landscapes rather than embodied contradiction. The niece backstory arrives late and is told rather than dramatized, weakening the earned quality of the final reconciliation. The translation attribute reads more like a stated skill than a lived competence under pressure; we never see her struggle with ambiguity or cost in deploying it. The final choice—humming the sonic translation—feels ordained rather than wrestled from conflicting impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story commits to an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure (guilt softened into guiding star). Cost is implied through the amber cooling and the phrase "hard-won understanding," but the exact price paid on the page remains oblique—no concrete forfeiture or altered option is visible. The Orientation Test is waived; who/where/when are anchored early through vivid detail. Causality is present but soft: the letters prescribe the solution, and Elara executes without meaningful friction or failed attempt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The laboratory of lost sounds is anchored with vivid, purposeful detail: reversed clocks, ozone mingling with rain, the Chippendale desk, and the amber on the console node. The amber's warmth and the wasp's silent witness across millennia constrain the tether action and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean. The setting shapes the tactic (placing amber on the node) and recurs meaningfully at closure, satisfying the 9+ gate for this category.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—hushing the dissonance of guilt—is clear and present throughout. However, escalation is thin: Elara discovers the letters, reads the prescription, and follows it without complication, failed attempt, or mid-course adaptation. The humming "translation" constitutes a single meaningful action, but no reversal or tightening forecloses a live option. The cost is asserted ("hard-won understanding") rather than shown as a trade-off that narrows her choices on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (unheard cries, preservation vs. entrapment, reconciliation across time) emerges from image and action rather than statement, with the amber and wasp serving as a charged motif. The final paragraph edges into thematic summary ("some sounds are not meant to be lost, only translated") that verges on moralizing but stops short of full sermonizing. The constellation-as-guide metaphor recurs purposefully, and the ending reweights prior material without overt thesis. Subtext operates cleanly in the wasp's "silent witness" and the layered cry.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (ink-stained fingers, constellation mapping) but not deeply idiosyncratic. Diction is lyric and elevated throughout, with phrases like "meteor hush" and "sticky resin capturing the wasp's final beat" that read as poetic rather than character-filtered. Under peak stress (the humming climax), the prose remains ornate and distanced rather than compressing into urgency. Filter verbs ("she saw") are used purposefully in the time-tapestry vision, so no penalty there.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often lovely ("needles of pure sorrow," "tapestry of time") but appears in nearly every sentence, creating a uniform lyric texture that flattens propulsion. Several beats loop conceptually: "profound meteor hush descended" and "awe-filled silence" restate the same effect. Template cadence appears in the vision sequence: "She saw… She saw… She saw…" across three lines. The bracketed word counts ([8, [10, etc.) are generation artifacts and ignored per the Text Artifact Screen, but the ornamental density and synonym churn ("hush," "silence," "ceased," "softened") in the final third trigger cumulative deductions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of constellation tattooist, baby-cry translator, and time-folding laboratory is specific and non-obvious, with the amber-as-capacitor mechanism offering fresh detail. However, the emotional core—guilt over an unheard cry—is a familiar template, and the resolution (humming understanding) arrives without complication or counter-pressure. The piece commits fully to its lyric premise, but the protagonist's path feels pre-charted by the letters rather than discovered through risk. No close echoes of famous lines, and the wasp-across-millennia image is memorable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and makes the final choice to hum the translation. She appears early (setup ✓), her attribute enables the climax (development ✓), and she acts at closure (payoff ✓). However, her decision is largely prescribed by the letters; she does not adapt, fail, or wrestle with alternatives. The role shapes one key beat (the humming) but is otherwise observational. Score: setup +0.5, one beat +0.4, causal pressure (modest) +0.3, closure linkage +0.7, but swappability (another empath-type) −0.6, ornamental description of her tattooist work −0.4. Lands mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The amber appears early in her pocket (setup ✓), is placed on the console node (development ✓), glows during the climax, and is lifted cooled at closure (payoff ✓). It constrains the tether action and charges the final image. Specific properties (warmth, prehistoric wasp, capacitor function) are irreplaceable. Score: setup +0.6, three beats (pocket, node, cooled) +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.6, minus late introduction of capacitor rule −0.3, minus the wasp serving more as symbol than functional constraint −0.3. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The haunted firmware is named early and provides the distorted infant's wail that drives the stakes (setup ✓, development ✓). It emits the "single, pure chime" at closure (payoff ✓). However, it functions more as atmospheric backdrop than as an agent that narrows Elara's options; the letters tell her what to do, and she does it. Score: setup +0.5, two beats (wail loops, chime) +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, but swappability (any haunted machine) −0.6, ornamental tech-mysticism −0.4. Functional but mid-replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The cry-translation attribute is introduced early (setup ✓), enables the climax translation (development ✓, payoff ✓). It narrows her path—only she can perform this—and the cost is her confronting the niece's cry. Score: setup +0.6, two beats (recognizing loneliness, humming translation) +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, cost connection +0.4, minus label-only description ("precise emotional landscapes") −0.5, minus no visible struggle or error in use −0.4. Solid integration with minor execution debt.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Tether" is prescribed by the letters (setup ✓), enacted when she places the amber (development ✓), and completes at closure when "folded time smoothed" (payoff ✓). The action is central but follows instruction rather than improvisation. Score: setup +0.5, two beats (placing, smoothing) +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, minus resolves-problem-it-didn't-create −0.9 (the letters introduce the solution), minus swappability (another binding metaphor) −0.5. Functional, not transformative.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The handwritten letters are discovered in the Chippendale desk early (setup ✓), prescribe the action (development ✓), and are referenced in the climax ("The handwritten letters had promised this") (payoff ✓). They shape her method but also eliminate friction—no trial, error, or adaptation. Score: setup +0.6, two beats (discovery, climax reference) +0.9, causal enabling +0.8, closure linkage +0.5, minus ornamental antique-desk framing −0.4, minus swappability (any instructional artifact) −0.6, minus reduces protagonist agency −0.6. Mid-functional.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The laboratory anchors the entire piece (setup ✓), supplies the console node and firmware (development ✓), and the "profound meteor hush descended" describes its transformation at closure (payoff ✓). The space constrains her to this location and provides the tools. Score: setup +0.7, three beats (console, wail loops, final hush) +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, specificity (lost sounds, reversed clocks) +0.6, minus generic "laboratory of [concept]" framing −0.5. Strong but formulaic in naming.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Time-folding is described early and atmospherically (clocks ticking in reverse, ozone mingling with rain) (setup ✓). It justifies the tapestry vision and the smoothing at closure (payoff ✓), but does not constrain Elara's choices in the middle—no ticking clock or narrowing window. Score: setup +0.5, closure linkage +0.8, minus no middle pressure −0.7, minus ornamental/atmospheric use −0.6, minus swappability (any temporal anomaly) −0.5. Present but decorative.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The guilt motive is stated in the opening, revealed as tied to the niece in the middle, and resolved ("guilt's sharp edges were hushed") at closure (all gates ✓). It drives her willingness to act. Score: setup +0.7, three beats (opening, niece revelation, final softening) +1.4, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +1.3, cost connection +0.5, minus told-backstory rather than dramatized −0.7, minus "dissonance of old guilt" reads abstract −0.4. Solid but execution is summary-heavy.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" appears as a descriptor late ("profound meteor hush descended") and again in the final image ("new constellation of peace"). Tone is lyric, reverent, and consistent throughout. Score: closure linkage +1.0, coherent modulation +0.8, charges final image +0.9, minus late explicit mention (final third) −0.7, minus static mood (no contrast or tension) −0.5, minus phrase feels ornamental rather than urgent −0.4. Purposeful but not dynamic.</comment>
