<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's internal state is coherent and embodied: "her breath clouding before her face," "fingers trembled...not from cold, but from the weight." The arc from guilt to responsibility is earned through concrete action (unweaving the rope, pressing the card). Minor slip: the grandmother's deathbed instruction feels like convenient backstory scaffolding rather than a live obstacle, and the "technically gentle hands" phrase recurs as a label without showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in a high-pressure beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered images (bells→wax→rope→light→sound) and the closure reweights the dominant stake (preservation of names) with visible cost ("carrying something heavier than guilt: responsibility"). The final image—Mira walking out "carrying seventeen voices home"—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with felt cost. Minor deduction: the "three years since" opening delays present anchoring slightly, though it recovers quickly; the causal chain from rope reconfiguration to sound emergence is compressed and borders on convenience, but the pattern is taught early enough to remain legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum is vividly realized: "ice walls catching green and violet light," "frozen rope...its three braids frozen stiff with age." The aurora functions as an active agent, responding to the rope reconfiguration and enabling the punched card to activate. Spatial choreography is clear (kneeling, approaching the pillar, pressing card against ice). The setting constrains choice (cold preservation vs. heat destruction) and charges the final image. Minor note: the "technically gentle hands" filter slightly distances some tactile moments, but sensory hierarchy remains coherent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving the seventeen names—is signaled early and tightens through the rope reconfiguration. The rope "resisted at first, then yielded" provides one meaningful reversal; the aurora responding and names emerging deepens pressure under the Accumulative lens. The closure forecloses a path: Mira commits to casting new bells and teaching the pattern, accepting "something heavier than guilt." Minor slip: the names emerging feels slightly inevitable once the rope is reconfigured; no live obstacle tests her commitment after the sound begins, reducing the final cost's sharpness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars: "forgiveness...was not forgetting. It was choosing to move forward while carrying what remained." The lost-wax metaphor, punched-card absence, and rope reconfiguration all embody preservation-through-void without overt statement. The final image—"carrying seventeen voices home"—reweights prior material (fire/ash/silence → bronze/sound/continuation) with resonance. The "dead asked only to be remembered" line borders on thematic summary but is brief and image-adjacent rather than sermonic. No forced motif checklist; each recurrence (bells, names, light, absence) constrains or accumulates.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance; no head-hopping. The perceptual signature is filtered through Mira's technical knowledge: "lost wax casting worked the same way," "the strange alchemy of light becoming sound becoming name." Diction remains character-bound and purposeful. Minor deduction: "technically gentle hands" recurs as a narrator descriptor rather than felt interiority, creating slight filter distance in peak beats. Free indirect style is clean; no dialogue present (non-applicable). Rhythm modulates well from reflective opening to kinetic rope scene to quiet resolution.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences layer action, metaphor, and theme. Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the rope scene ("The rope resisted...something hummed. / The aurora above responded") and breathing at closure. Minor deductions: "technically gentle hands" appears twice as scaffold without added pressure; "something hummed" and "something older" are vague intensifiers; "understood—she pressed" uses a dash-link that slightly shortcuts causality. The "seventeen names" list ("Keth Vothmar. Senna Vothmar. Urrin of the Long Winter") provides vivid specificity. No major loops or template cadence, but small filter stacks ("understood," "recognized") dull immediacy in two beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of lost-wax casting, punched-card memory, and ceremonial rope is specific and non-obvious. The "transcribed memory...punched into paper" and "absence became the mold" conceits feel fresh. The piece avoids template reconciliation arcs by grounding Mira's transformation in technical process rather than epiphany. Minor cap: the "icebound sanctum under aurora" and "protagonist seeks redemption through ancient ritual" frame are familiar in speculative literary fiction; the execution elevates but does not fully transform the template. Risk-taking in the rope-light-sound mechanism is purposeful and coherent, earning +0.3 within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's choices (approaching the rope, unweaving it per the pattern, pressing the card against ice) create the key turn: sound emerges, names are heard, and she commits to casting new bells and teaching the pattern. Present in setup (kneeling, spreading satchel), middle (rope work), and closure (gathering things, walking out with "seventeen voices"). Causal pressure is clear: her actions enable the transcription. Cost is felt ("something heavier than guilt: responsibility"). Scores in the 6.8–7.4 band for driving two beats and shaping the ending, though her agency in the climax is primarily enactment of a taught pattern rather than a choice under conflicting options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The punched card appears in setup ("street organ punched card scrap, its paper edge torn and yellowed"), middle (grandmother's recognition, "pattern of holes as something older than entertainment"), and closure (pressed against ice, light streams through, names emerge). It constrains the method (light + absence = sound) and enables the climax. Reweighted meaning: from "abandoned musician's cart" curiosity to active vessel of ancestral memory. Essential across beats and ending; removing it breaks the closure mechanism. Scores solidly in the 7.0–8.4 band for driving two beats and closure participation with specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Transcribed memory" shapes stakes (preserve names), tactics (rope reconfiguration, card use), and closure (Mira becomes "another form of preservation"). It is dramatized through three concrete mechanisms: lost-wax casting ("absence became the mold"), punched card ("sound could be preserved in absence"), and rope braids ("voice, memory, and continuation"). The concept constrains on-page action: Mira must use the card's pattern to activate memory. Present in setup, middle logic, and closure commitment. Scores in the 7.0–8.4 band for being causally active and indispensable to the ending.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Technically gentle" appears twice: opening ("technically gentle hands") and closing ("the same technical gentleness she brought to all her work"). It is labeled rather than shown through a visible tradeoff or constraint. The trait is meant to signal earned skill and contrast with past "carelessness," but no on-page beat shows gentleness enabling a delicate move or costing time under pressure. Lyric reprise (first paragraph → final third) reweights the trait slightly (destruction → restoration), reaching the 5.5–6.3 allowance, but the lack of mid-scene causal pressure caps it near 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Illuminate" drives the climax: light pours through ice walls, refracts, activates the punched card, and produces sound ("Light poured through...the entire sanctum began to illuminate from within"). The action is signaled early (aurora catching ice), enabled by rope reconfiguration (middle), and delivers closure (names emerge, Mira hears them). Removing illumination breaks the transcription mechanism. Specificity is high: light streaming through punched holes translates absence into sound. Scores in the 8.5–10.0 band for being causally indispensable, driving two beats, and shaping the ending with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The method is signaled in setup (rope hanging from pillar, "three braids representing voice, memory, and continuation"), taught in middle (grandmother's deathbed sequence: "Unweave the left. Thread it through the center. Bind the right around both"), and executed on-page ("She worked slowly...the braids shifted into their new configuration, something hummed"). The reconfiguration enables the aurora response and sound emergence. Cost is present: "The rope resisted at first, then yielded." Essential to closure; swapping this method for generic "ring a bell" would eliminate the story's core mechanism. Scores in the 7.0–8.4 band for driving two beats and closure participation with irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sanctum supplies resources (ice walls refract light, cold preserves rope, ceremonial space houses the pillar) and pressures choices (Mira must travel there, work in extreme cold). It is present in setup ("sanctum breathed beneath the aurora"), middle (ice walls activate during illumination), and closure (she leaves it to return to her foundry). The setting's micro-properties (ice as lens, glacier preservation vs. foundry heat) constrain the transcription method. Removing the sanctum would require a new mechanism. Scores in the 7.0–8.4 band for being causally active across beats and shaping the ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After forgiving yourself" is present in setup ("three years since the foundry fire...forgiveness...was not forgetting") and closure framing (she has forgiven herself and now carries responsibility forward). The timeframe is static background rather than a live constraint; no on-page clock tightens decisions. The element is thematically relevant but does not alter tactics or enable a beat. It shapes emotional stance but not plot mechanics. Scores in the 4.0–5.9 band for functional presence without causal pressure or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The desire to preserve names drives setup (spreading satchel contents, recalling the bells' silenced voices), middle (working the rope, listening to names emerge: "Mira wept as she listened"), and closure (committing to cast new bells, teach the pattern, ring names every solstice). Friction is dramatized: the weight of guilt vs. the heavier weight of responsibility, the rope's initial resistance. Cost is visible: she accepts a lifelong duty. The motivation is embodied in action and choice rather than told-only. Scores in the 7.0–8.4 band for driving two beats, closure participation, and felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Snowmelt ardor" is not a conventional idiom but reads as purposeful: cold + thaw + fervent devotion. Tone is coherent across turns—reverent, mournful, quietly determined—and modulates with pressure (trembling approach to rope, weeping during names, calm gathering at end). The final image ("walked out into the aurora's glow, carrying seventeen voices home") charges the tone with earned warmth after cold. Minor slip: the tone is somewhat static; emotional peaks are labeled ("wept") rather than shown through syntactic or rhythmic breakdown. Scores in the 6.1–7.9 band for coherence and a charged final image, but lacks the intensification or modulation under peak stress that would reach ≥7.0.</comment>
