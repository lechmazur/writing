<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Sirel's interiority is concrete and specific—mercury-glass skin, substituted memories, the decades-long avoidance—and her final choice to remember is earned by the feather trigger and prayer inscription. The embodied vision gift turned inward shows contradictory impulses in action. Minor deduction: the weeping moment leans slightly toward performed emotion rather than fully contradictory embodiment, and the grandmother's hands vision arrives without prior setup that would make it land harder.</comment>

<comment>Closure is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to active stance): Sirel moves from nightly substitution to deliberate remembering with visible cost (the decades of forgetting now undone, tears seeding the stone). Orientation anchors by ~100 words (mountain, bookstore, Sirel's role). The causal chain—feather recognition → stone reading → prayer unlock → vision gift restored—holds under a Causal lens with one meaningful tightening. Cost is legible: "she would not substitute reality tonight" forecloses the old escape with felt weight.</comment>

<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The labyrinthine bookstore (phosphorescent moss, folded staircases, eastern wing) and the volcanic glass stone are vividly specific and constrain Sirel's long avoidance. The feather—soft, memory-weight, crest-wing species—charges the final turn by making substitution impossible. Spatial choreography is clear (desk, stone, eastern wing). Minor gap: the mountain's appetite for libraries is atmospheric but does not constrain a choice or charge the closure image directly.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—whether to remember or continue substituting reality—is signaled early and tightens when the feather makes avoidance impossible. Agency is renunciation: Sirel stops nightly erasure, reopening the wound of her lost village with visible cost (weeping, the prayer's warmth). One meaningful reversal: the texture of the feather breaks through her decades-long refusal. The final choice to teach others narrows her future path and forecloses retreat.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Theme—home as carried geometry of love and language, not place—emerges from the prayer inscription and Sirel's realized talent without being stated as a moral. The feather, stone, and vision cohere to answer the central question (how to carry home) through image and action. The ending resists tidy closure: Sirel will teach, but the loss remains. The prayer's return from childhood to the present reweights prior material with quiet, earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "mercury-glass," "vision turned inward," "hidden thunder." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the feather moment, pulling back for the mountain's groan). Minor slip: "She had come to the mountain to forget, and the mountain had been generous" drifts briefly into summary-tell that slightly flattens immediacy. Reflection is anchored to present stimuli (feather, stone) and alters stance on the page.</comment>

<comment>Prose is vivid and propulsive with strong images ("tears seeded the stone," "suppressed visions," "calcified"). Rhythm varies and information density is high. Deductions: "She could not substitute this reality away" is a near-paraphrase of the prior substitution explanation (−0.2). "Something happened that she had not expected" is scaffold phrasing (−0.2). One metaphor—"hidden thunder"—is named in the prompt and does atmospheric work, but "vision turned inward" repeats conceptually across beats without evolving texture (−0.2).</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The combination of mercury-glass seer, nightly memory substitution, and lost language stone feels specific and non-obvious. The feather as trigger (texture-based recognition) is a fresh synthesis. Risk: the mountain-bookstore and forgotten-language setup echo fantasy templates, but the earned-stasis-to-teaching arc and the prayer's simplicity ("Let me understand the shape of home") transform the frame into something emotionally particular. The turn is inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Sirel's choices drive two key beats: the decades-long substitution ritual (establishes her avoidance) and the climactic decision to read the stone and remember (closure). Her agency—renunciation of substitution, acceptance of vision—shapes the ending's charge. Early signal, middle constraint (refuses to read the stone for years), and closure participation all present with causal pressure and felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The stone appears early (on her desk, untouched for years), returns at the feather-triggered turn (she carries the feather to it), and is handled at closure (fingers trace the inscription, tears seed the channels, warmth spreads). It enables the prayer revelation and unlocks her vision gift. The stone's volcanic-glass materiality and carved script constrain her avoidance and then enable transformation with visible cost. Three beats, causal pressure, closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Buried talent (vision turned inward, then cracked open as true sight) shapes two beats: nightly substitution and the climactic stone-reading vision. The concept drives her avoidance tactic and the closure reversal. Setup is clear, development constrains middle action (refuses to read), and payoff lands when the gift "crack[s] open at last." The reversal from inward to outward sight reweights the premise. Causal pressure and closure linkage present; swappability is low.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>"Substitutes reality nightly" is enacted on the page (palms to temples, invented dreams) and constrains her years-long avoidance of the stone. The ritual's cessation at closure—"she would not substitute reality tonight"—carries visible cost (loss of escape mechanism, forced remembering). Early signal, middle constraint (the habit keeps her from reading), closure reversal. The trait enables and then forecloses a path with felt price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>"Seed" appears in the climactic beat: "Her tears seeded the stone, filling its ancient channels with light." This act triggers the stone's glow, the vision, and the thematic revelation ("Home was not a place"). The action redefines options—Sirel moves from avoidance to teaching. Late arrival (final third) but transformative with high specificity. If removed, the closure image loses its causal hinge. Causal pressure and closure linkage strong; late penalty applied.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>"Via the texture of a feather" is the specific means: "Via the texture of that feather—the impossible softness, the memory-weight of it—she understood something had changed." The method is signaled and its mechanics (texture as memory trigger) matter, breaking through her substitution defenses. The feather's properties (crest-wing, gray-barred, softness) are specific and irreplaceable. Setup late (scholar visit), but the method shapes the key turn and closure participation is strong. Lyric reprise with reweighted meaning.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>The labyrinthine bookstore (endless corridors, folded staircases, eastern wing, phosphorescent moss) provides spatial anchoring and houses the stone. It supplies the seer role and the decades-long forgetting context. The setting enables Sirel's isolation and the scholar's visit (feather delivery). Two-gate presence: setup and middle. Closure participation is weak—the mountain "groaned softly" but does not constrain the final choice. Functional but not indispensable to the ending turn.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>"After remembering becomes painful" is backstory context ("time moved differently inside the mountain, and Sirel had stopped counting years after remembering became painful"). It frames her avoidance but does not tighten present decisions with a live clock. The timeframe is established early but remains static—no escalating pressure from elapsed time. Development and closure participation are absent; the element contextualizes rather than constrains.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>"To understand the shape of home" is the prayer Sirel reads and the thematic spine. It is dramatized in her avoidance (refuses to read the stone for years, substitutes memory), the feather trigger (crest-wings nested in mother's house), and the closure vision ("Home was not a place. Home was a shape she carried inside her"). The motivation shapes two beats and the ending realization. Setup, development (refusal costs her), and payoff all present with felt cost and causal linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>"Hidden thunder" is embodied: "the language rushed through her like hidden thunder, a storm that had been building for decades behind the walls of her forgetting." The tone—suppressed power, long-building pressure—modulates across the piece (quiet substitution → feather trigger → storm release) and charges the final vision beat. Coherent through turns, with a cadence shift at closure. The metaphor is specific to Sirel's gift and stakes. Payoff is strong; tone heightens the ending image.</comment>
