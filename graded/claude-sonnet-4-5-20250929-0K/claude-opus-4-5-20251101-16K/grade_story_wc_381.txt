<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The summoner's motivation is clear and her gift—mapping silence—is specific, but interiority remains largely abstract ("quiet intensity," "fierce purpose") without embodied contradiction under pressure. The protagonist's choices are contemplative rather than agonized; she executes her working smoothly without meaningful internal friction or foreclosed paths. The crane's wing functions as talisman but her relationship to it lacks visceral cost when it fades to "ordinary paper." The final victory feels assured rather than hard-won, limiting the sense of genuine struggle required for high-band characterization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of silence-mapping that deepens across the vigil, and closure arrives on-page when the prophecy fragments and the summoner rises with "footprints in the dew-soft grass and a peace that would echo." Cost is legible—the wing's power is spent, her joints are stiff—but remains modest and primarily physical rather than foreclosing future options in a felt way. Orientation anchors clearly (solitary summoner, starlight, brook's edge) within the opening lines. One meaningful tightening occurs as she connects mapped silences into a "greater river," yet the escalation reads as execution of known technique rather than a discovery or trade-off that reweights stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: the brook's "living stillness," the hollow oak, spider's web, and fox's breath all serve the summoner's silence-mapping. The nocturnal haven constrains her choice of location and the brook acts as conduit for her magic, directly shaping tactics. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("spaces between sounds, the architecture of emptiness"). The micro-setting (brook, starlight, dew-soft grass) charges the final image when her peace "would echo through the brook's song for centuries." One small slip: "dissolving darkness" in the final line is slightly generic for an otherwise precise texture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—hushing the prophecy before it completes—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs when she maps silences and weaves them into a "smoothed hush," interrupting the prophecy's transmission. However, the escalation is largely internal and technical; no external complication arises, no tactic fails, and the summoner's method succeeds on first attempt without visible friction. The resolution is earned by her sustained effort, but the cost (spent talisman, stiff joints) is modest and does not foreclose a live option or force a trade-off that charges the ending under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—silence as power, the mapping of absence—emerges organically from the summoner's gift and her confrontation with the prophecy. The crane's wing and brook function as motifs that shift meaning: the wing arrives charged and departs ordinary, the brook's song will carry her peace forward. The final image offers a resonant answer without moralizing: "silence, properly mapped and woven, could be the most powerful incantation of all." Minor slip: the phrase "terrestrially cosmic" in paragraph three feels like a prompt echo, slightly elevated beyond the otherwise grounded diction, and "tranquil blaze" is stated rather than fully embodied in the prose's rhythm.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable and close, with a distinct perceptual signature: the summoner hears "spaces between sounds, the architecture of emptiness." Diction is controlled and lyric without obscuring clarity. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the working ("Hours passed in measured breaths"). Two brief slips: "terrestrially cosmic" and "tranquil blaze" read as externally imposed descriptors rather than organically arising from the summoner's idiom. Filter verbs ("she perceived," "she felt") appear but remain voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clear and lyric, with varied sentence rhythm and strong specificity ("crane's origami wing," "the held breath of a sleeping fox"). Information density is high; lines often do multiple jobs. However, several paraphrase loops and template stems appear: "The brook whispered…and in that gentle murmur, she could hear" is restated conceptually in the next paragraph's "Where others heard the brook's flow, she perceived the negative spaces." The phrase "smoothed hush" recurs without reweighting, and "tranquil blaze" is told rather than shown through syntax. Minor scaffold: "This was her peculiar gift" and "This was the smoothed hush she had learned" use identical stems within three paragraphs, creating a slight instructional cadence that dulls momentum. Apply −0.8 for loops and template cadence per the artifact pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The premise—a summoner who maps silence to counter a prophecy—offers a fresh angle on magic-as-craft. The crane's origami wing and the method of connecting "pockets of stillness" are specific and non-obvious. However, the emotional arc and plot structure (recognize threat, execute solution, succeed cleanly) follow a familiar template without transformation. The summoner's victory is assured and the prophecy dissolves off-page in village squares; no on-page complication or counter-pressure tests her method. The final image ("footprints in the dew-soft grass and a peace that would echo") is evocative but leans toward lyric closure common in contemplative fantasy. Solid execution within a recognizable frame; insufficient risk-taking for high-band originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The solitary summoner is present throughout, frames the opening and closing images, and her core choice—to weave silence and interrupt the prophecy—drives the central working. Setup is immediate, development occupies the middle vigil, and payoff arrives when she rises with the prophecy unmade. However, her decision-making is largely contemplative and assured; no on-page moment forces a tactical shift or visible trade-off. The choice to spend the crane's wing is implied rather than dramatized as a dilemma. Causal pressure is moderate: she executes known technique without friction. Cost is legible (spent wing, stiff joints) but modest in scale and does not foreclose a future path. Integration is solid across all three gates, but swappability is moderate—another solitary magic-worker with similar interiority could occupy the role with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The crane's origami wing appears early (setup clear), is handled physically ("trembled in her palm, sensing the disturbance"), participates in the working ("grew warm against her skin"), and its spent state is noted at closure ("faded to ordinary paper"). Three distinct beats with causal involvement. However, its role in the actual magic remains vague—it senses and warms but does not visibly constrain or enable a specific tactic. The summoner tucks it away "regardless" after it fades, which undercuts irreplaceability; a different talisman with similar properties could substitute without breaking story logic. Cost connection is present (power spent) but the narrative does not dramatize a moment where the wing's unique properties alter a choice under pressure. Strong setup and payoff, moderate causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Smoothed hush" is signaled early ("the smoothed hush she had learned to create") and names the magic's effect during the working. It shapes the dominant stake: her method is to surround the prophecy with stillness "so profound" that its whispers lose momentum. Setup and development are clear. At closure, the hush "would linger in this nocturnal haven, a lasting sanctuary." However, the concept is described more than enacted—on-page mechanics remain abstract ("let the mapped silences flow together"), and no moment shows the hush constraining a specific choice or forcing a trade-off. It functions as thematic label and stated outcome rather than a visible pressure point. Moderate causal pressure; solid lyric reprise at the end.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Terrestrially cosmic" appears once in paragraph three as a descriptor for the crane's wing: "grounded in mortal craft yet resonant with forces that stretched beyond the atmosphere." It is told rather than shown, and no on-page action or trade-off hinges on this dual quality. The wing's cosmic resonance is asserted but never constrains or enables a specific tactic; its mortal craft (teacher's folding, silver ink) is noted but does not create friction or cost. Label-only mention, no causal involvement, absent from closure. Apply ornamental and late-middle appearance deductions.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Flow" appears in multiple forms: the brook's flow, the summoner letting "mapped silences flow together," and the closing promise that peace will "echo through the brook's song." Setup is immediate (opening paragraph), development occurs as she connects silences "like tributaries feeding a greater river," and payoff arrives in the final image where the brook's altered music will carry her work forward. The action is central to her method and shapes the working's structure. However, on-page mechanics remain abstract—flow is metaphorical and atmospheric rather than a visible constraint or enabler of tactics. The prophecy fragments off-page in distant villages; no moment shows flow creating friction or forcing a choice under pressure. Strong thematic and lyric integration, moderate causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Mapping silence" is signaled clearly ("she began her work by mapping silence. This was her peculiar gift"), developed through the vigil ("cataloging every pocket of stillness within a mile's radius"), and its success is noted at closure ("the dangerous pattern had been unmade"). The method is specific and differentiates her magic from generic summoning. However, the mechanics remain told rather than shown: we see her "awareness expand" and hear the result, but no on-page beat dramatizes a mapping decision that constrains or alters her tactics. The method succeeds on first attempt without friction or adaptation. Strong setup and thematic coherence, moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The nocturnal haven beside the quiet brook is established in the opening line, chosen explicitly for its "particular quality of quiet," and used throughout as the summoner maps stillness and channels intention through the water. The brook acts as conduit ("its currents carrying her intention into the wider night") and the haven's residual peace will linger "for centuries." Setup, development, and payoff are all present. The setting directly enables her method and charges the final image. Minor limitation: the brook's role is atmospheric and symbolic rather than creating a tactical constraint or friction point—no moment shows the setting forcing a choice or trade-off. Strong integration with method and tone, solid causal contribution.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Amid whispered secrets" frames the timeframe abstractly. The prophecy "had begun to spread" three nights prior and moves "like infection." The summoner's vigil unfolds over hours ("Hours passed in measured breaths") until dawn approaches. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency—no on-page moment shows time pressure altering her tactics or forcing a choice. The prophecy's spread is off-page and its completion threshold is vague. Setup is present, development is functional (vigil duration tracks), but payoff does not hinge on time. Moderate causal role; lacks the urgency or constraint needed to reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The motivation—to hush the prophecy before it completes—is signaled early ("Her motivation burned with quiet intensity"), anchors the dominant stake, and drives the entire working. The summoner's desire is specific: prevent the sleeper beneath the mountains from waking. Her actions (mapping silence, weaving stillness) directly pursue this goal, and closure arrives when "the dangerous pattern had been unmade." Setup, development, and payoff are all clear. Minor limitation: the motivation is stated more than dramatized through conflicted choice. No on-page moment shows a want competing with a cost or fear; she executes her plan without friction or trade-off between competing goods. Strong causal through-line, but lacks the internal conflict or visible price that would elevate to the highest bands.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" is named once in paragraph seven: "The tone of her magic was a tranquil blaze: peaceful in its manifestation yet burning with fierce purpose beneath the surface." The diction attempts to hold both calm and intensity, and the prose maintains a measured, lyric rhythm throughout the vigil. However, the tone is asserted rather than modulated under pressure—sentence rhythm and diction remain steady from opening to closure without a cadence shift that reflects escalation or cost. The final image is quiet and affirming, consistent with the tranquil surface but not charged with the "fierce purpose" the label promises. Setup is clear, development is functional, but payoff does not reweight or charge the ending in a felt way. Moderate coherence; lacks the dynamic range to reach higher bands.</comment>
