<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's internal arc from drunk and bridge-burner to sound-collector is told rather than dramatized on the page. The girl's visit provides a micro-choice (accepting the jar) but no conflicting impulse acts simultaneously in the present scene. Interiority leans toward retrospective summary ("she had discovered this calling") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final choice to continue her work reads as continuation, not a path foreclosed with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Maren's commitment to her archive work is reaffirmed through the girl's visit and the final image of writing. However, the cost is implied rather than viscerally legible on the page—we see her continue, but no option is foreclosed in this moment. The piece teaches its accumulative lens early (jar collection, music box ritual), but the ending deepens tone more than it tightens stakes. Orientation is prompt (protagonist, loft, dawn) by the opening lines.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The loft's sand-sifted planks and warped shelves anchor the setting early and recur throughout. The glass jars function as micro-setting, shaping Maren's daily ritual and constraining the grandmother's jar placement at the end. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("dawn's earliest whistle," "sand-crusted windows"), filtered through Maren's reverent attention. The environment charges the final image of Maren surrounded by captured voices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving vanishing voices—is signaled early and remains coherent. The girl's arrival provides one meaningful deepening (new jar, grief layered onto Maren's purpose), but no reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off with visible cost. The resolution affirms Maren's existing path without dramatized escalation or sacrifice in this scene. Pressure accumulates texturally rather than causally, fitting the inferred Accumulative lens, yet the ending reconfigures tone more than options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of gleaned redemption emerges organically from Maren's jar archive and her transformation from vagrant to translator. The music box's "positively wistful" melody and the phrase "lonesome splendor" anchor the thematic question without stating a moral. The ending image—future listening beneath sand and silence—offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Minor slip: "gleaned redemption, earned not through grand gestures but through patient, daily acts" edges toward explicit summary in the penultimate paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable; Maren's perceptual signature (sound-focused, reverent) is consistent. Dialogue with the girl feels natural and goal-driven, advancing the archive's purpose. Some filter verbs ("she could almost hear," "seemed to glow") dull immediacy in reflective passages. Diction occasionally elevates beyond Maren's vagrant idiom ("positively wistful," "lonesome splendor" read as authorial rather than character-particular). Narrative stance modulates appropriately with the girl's arrival.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several phrases loop thematically without adding pressure: "captured fragment of the world's vanishing voice" / "capturing what was scattered, preserving what was fading" near-paraphrase the same idea. "Positively wistful" appears twice in close proximity without reweighting. Figurative language ("dunes breathed like sleeping giants") is vivid but occasionally stacks in reflective beats. No major clarity breaks, and the final image propels cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The vagrant poet archiving sounds in jars offers a specific angle on preservation-and-redemption premises. The music box's arrival via dead woman's coat and the girl's recorded grandmother add texture. However, the emotional arc—broken person finds purpose through ritual collection—follows a familiar template without a sharp inflection that grows from prior particulars. The closure reaffirms rather than transforms. Maren's voice and the loft's specificity elevate the piece within its band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maren (vagrant penny poet) is present throughout, but her key choice—accepting the girl's jar—reads as continuation rather than a decision that alters tactics. Her past transformation is summarized; the on-page action is ritualistic repetition. The character shapes tone and theme but does not drive a reversal or foreclosure in this scene.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The music box appears in three beats: backstory restoration, morning ritual opening, and the penultimate paragraph where its melody "fills the loft" again. It charges atmosphere and anchors the "positively wistful" tone, but it does not constrain a choice or return with reweighted meaning at closure. Functional across beats yet not causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Gleaned redemption" is named explicitly and structures Maren's backstory arc (drunk to archivist). It appears as theme in the reflective passages but does not shape an on-page choice or alter tactics in the present scene. The concept is told more than dramatized with cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Positively wistful" describes the music box melody twice and colors tone throughout. It does not constrain an action or create a visible tradeoff; it remains a label for mood rather than an attribute that enables or limits a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Sweeten" recurs in "seemed to sweeten everything it touched" (music box) and "seemed to sweeten the bitter truth of mortality." The verb enriches tone but does not drive a major turn. Easily swappable with "transform" or "soften" without altering structure or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Capturing sounds in glass jars is signaled early (paragraph two), drives Maren's daily method, and shapes the girl's offering. The jars line the shelves and anchor the closure image. The mechanics (opening jar to morning, sealing with wax, whispering poem) matter and pressure Maren's ritual. Essential to the story's logic and setting.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The feral loft beneath dunes is established in the opening line, recurs in sensory detail (sand through planks, buried walls), and houses the jar archive. It provides spatial pressure (abandoned, precarious) and charges the final image. The setting constrains Maren's existence but does not alter a tactical choice in this scene.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"At dawn's earliest whistle" anchors the timeframe in paragraph two and recurs in "dawn light strengthened" at the end. Time is tracked loosely as a ritual window rather than a ticking constraint. It frames rather than tightens decisions; no live clock alters moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maren's motivation (translator between generations) is stated explicitly and demonstrated through the jar archive and her promise to the girl. It shapes her daily work but is not conflicted or tested by a competing want in this scene. The desire is told and affirmed rather than dramatized with friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" is named once and permeates tone: isolation transformed into privilege, scarcity into grace. The tone modulates subtly from reflective solitude to the girl's grief to the charged final image of future listening. It coheres through turns and elevates the ending without becoming static.</comment>
