<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's pragmatic choices under pressure are consistently rooted in forty-seven years of care and the specific contradiction between institutional metrics and garden knowledge. Her decision to deceive and the three-year preparation show embodied stakes with visible cost ("deception, even necessary deception, carries weight"). The polishing ritual and marble-cracking commemoration create a concrete hierarchy of values. Minor slip: the inspector's instant conversion feels slightly unmotivated given the established system's power, though his observational shift is dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The inferred lens is Situational with accumulative texture: Mara's stance crystallizes through her confession and the inspector witnesses the maze's responsiveness, creating a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Orientation anchors quickly (vine dresser, maze, dawn, luck-meters as premise). The cost is legible: Mara admits manipulation and risks demolition; the inspector's decision to lose the order forecloses bureaucratic certainty. The three-year backstory thread is purposeful, priming the present confrontation, though the inspector's turn could sustain one more beat of resistance to fully earn the shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The maze functions as active setting: hedges lean inward, roses turn, vines brush her shoulders, and the withered section regenerates under her touch—all constraining the inspector's meter-based worldview and charging the closure image. Spatial choreography (central fountain, eastern hedge, green corridors) remains clear. The luck-meters and marbles are handled objects that recur with shifting meaning. The setting directly pressures Chen's institutional certainty and enables Mara's proof, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment constrain choice or charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—survival of the maze against demolition—is signaled early and tightens when the new chief inspector arrives citing "irregularities." Mara's agency is clear: she manipulated sensors for three years and now confesses, forecloses deception as a tactic, and stakes everything on the garden's visible responsiveness. The inspector's meter readings conflict with what he sees, forcing his choice. The escalation is accumulative and situational: pressure builds through the confession beat and the on-page demonstration of the hedge regenerating, with cost legible in Mara's admission and the inspector's professional risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—recognition versus measurement—emerges through concrete action: manipulated sensors, the maze's response to Mara's presence, cracked marbles as private record, and the inspector's meters flickering in confusion. The ending offers a resonant answer without moralizing: "gardens remember, even when inspectors forget" is delivered through image and the inspector's immobility rather than assertion. The marbles' evolving role (official instruments → broken commemorations → teaching tool) reweights prior material. No thematic echo in the final paragraph; the closure image (inspector learning "what numbers could never teach") stays concrete and active.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited on Mara, stable psychic distance with perceptual bias toward garden texture ("yellowed leaves," "hedges leaned slightly inward"). Diction remains voice-consistent: "wisely pragmatic," "eternal cycles of becoming and unbecoming" fit an aging gardener's lexicon. Dialogue is sparse but functional: Chen's "The readings don't match what I'm seeing" and Mara's confession carry subtext and advance plot. Filter verbs ("She had done something she still couldn't name aloud") are rare and voice-motivated. The prose modulates appropriately under pressure, tightening during the confrontation without losing the contemplative texture established early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is generally strong with purposeful rhythm variation and high information density ("She had deceived them" as a standalone paragraph creates emphasis). Sentence openings vary and spatial choreography tracks cleanly. Minor artifact cluster: "The maze knew different truths" and "gardens know their gardeners" edge toward abstract assertion rather than staying fully concrete, and "blooming and withering happened simultaneously" is echoed three times across the piece (two in the final section), creating a mild template effect. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks; proofreading is clean. The polishing action and marble handling are textured and propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The luck-meter premise offers a fresh angle on institutional quantification versus embodied knowledge. The cracked marbles as counter-archive and the specific detail of manipulating sensor timing provide non-obvious synthesis. The inspector's conversion is a familiar beat but executed with the concrete image of regenerating hedge and flickering meters rather than pure epiphany. Risk: the piece commits to a quiet, accumulative escalation and trusts the garden's responsiveness to carry thematic weight. Mild derivative echo: the "gardens remember" motif recalls general nature-versus-technology templates, though the specific mechanics (sensor manipulation, commemorative cracking) add particularity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara (withered vine dresser) is present throughout, makes the key confession choice that forecloses deception and stakes the maze's survival on visible proof, and her forty-seven years of experience and trembling hands anchor both her pragmatic wisdom and the story's time depth. She drives at least three beats: the opening reflection, the polishing ritual at the fountain, and the confrontation with Chen. Her choice to confess rather than perfect the lie is causally rooted in "three years preparing...not by perfecting her lies, but by proving the truth beneath them." The final image shows her walking deeper into the maze after the small victory, a renunciation of further deception with visible cost (ongoing vigilance). Setup early, middle ritual, closure participation via confession and acceptance; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cracked marbles appear in at least four beats: pocket mention (early), the collection and cracking ritual explained, the polishing at the fountain (middle), and the handoff to Chen (closure). Each crack commemorates a saved plant, making them a counter-archive to the official luck-spheres. The handoff to Chen is causally active: it teaches him and he accepts the deeper knowledge they represent. The marbles' transformation from official instruments to broken records to teaching tools reweights their meaning across the arc. Strong setup, middle development (polishing as ritual), and closure linkage; specificity (smooth perfection → fractured commemoration) is irreplaceable. Could score higher if the marbles directly constrained a middle tactical choice beyond serving as mnemonic and symbol.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mended deception is the spine: Mara manipulated sensors ("moving the sensors during flowering season, timing the inspectors' visits") for three years, and the inspector's arrival signals the deception's test. The confession beat ("I manipulated your instruments. I lied. But I lied to protect something real") is the story's hinge, forecloses continued lying, and stakes everything on the maze's visible proof. The three-year window bought time for the garden's recognition to manifest. Setup by paragraph three, middle pressure (inspector's irregularities claim), closure pivot (confession and inspector's decision). Causal and thematic: the deception shaped Mara's tactics and the inspector's epistemic crisis. Strong integration but not fully indispensable—the core could survive as "institutional skepticism overcome by embodied proof" without the deception layer, though it would lose moral texture.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Wisely pragmatic is demonstrated early ("her mind remained wisely pragmatic about what could be saved and what must be released") and again in the confession choice: she does not perfect the lie but pivots to proving the underlying truth, a pragmatic calculation of long-term survival over short-term cover. The trait constrains her approach—she manipulates minimally and prepares for exposure rather than doubling down. The trait enables the confession with visible cost (risk of demolition). Setup, one middle callback (the three-year preparation framing), and closure linkage via the confession's tone. Solid integration but overlaps with "experienced gardener" baseline; not wholly irreplaceable as a distinct attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Polish appears twice with purpose: the fountain scene ("She began to polish them now, cloth moving in circles over fractured surfaces. The action soothed her") and implicitly in the marbles' smooth state after "years of handling." The polishing is both ritual preparation for the confrontation and a physical embodiment of her care. It does not drive a major turn but it anchors the middle beat and primes the handoff: the oldest marble is "polished smooth" when given to Chen. The action is character-specific (commemorative maintenance) and tonally consistent. Setup in the ritual paragraph, middle use, closure participation via the handoff; replaceable with another tactile ritual but well-integrated within the marble motif. Mid-high band: shapes one key moment and charges the closure object.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Commemorating small victories elaborately is the method behind the cracked marbles: each crack marks a saved plant or survived blight, and tonight she will crack another for the inspector's decision. The mechanics are signaled mid-story ("her private ritual, her rebellion recorded in broken glass") and shape her stance—she measures success in small, defiant increments against the institutional metrics. The method enables the marble collection's existence and its counter-archive function. The method is present in thought and action (polishing, the plan to crack another tonight), frames her attitude, and participates in closure via the teaching gesture to Chen. Setup, middle explanation, closure echo; causal role in creating the marbles' meaning. Strong integration, though the elaborateness is more told than shown in granular detail.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The garden maze is indispensable: it is the spatial frame, the object of institutional threat, the proof Mara stakes on, and the active agent in the closure (hedges lean, roses turn, vines brush, withered section regenerates under her touch). The maze pressures Chen's meter-based epistemology and supplies the resources (visible responsiveness) that alter the outcome. The maze's "eternal cycles of becoming and unbecoming" reject the inspectors' demand for "permanent flourishing," a conceptual constraint on institutional logic. Spatial choreography (central fountain, eastern hedge, familiar paths) is clear and lived-in. Setup immediately, middle ritual and navigation, closure demonstration; irreplaceable. The maze is both micro-setting (body-scale corridors and fountain) and macro-frame (the entire institution under threat), meeting the Q3 9+ gate that setting constrain choice or charge the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>After luck becomes measurable frames the premise: luck-meters were installed, then three years of manipulation passed, and now the new inspector arrives. The timeframe creates the institutional pressure (the bureaucratic system exists and has been fooled) and tightens decisions (today is the confrontation, tonight another marble will be cracked). The "three years" window is causally important—it bought time for the garden to prove itself—but the time is more backdrop than live clock. The story does not track hours or use a countdown that alters moment-to-moment tactics. Setup early (luck-meters installed, three years of deception), middle framing (inspector's scheduled visit), closure participation (the decision marks a temporal threshold: survival for another span). Functional and thematically resonant but not a moment-by-moment constraint; solid mid-high integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>To prove that gardens know their gardeners is Mara's explicit motivation: "The garden knows who tends it. That knowledge makes its own fortune." The desire drives her three-year deception (buying time for recognition to manifest), her confession strategy (staking survival on visible proof rather than continued lies), and the confrontation beat where the maze responds to her presence in front of Chen. The friction is clear: institutional metrics versus embodied recognition, with demolition as cost. The motivation is dramatized through action (manipulation, polishing, confession, the hedge regeneration) and conflicted (she must lie to protect the truth she believes in, carrying weight). Setup early (the maze's nature versus inspectors' misunderstanding), middle development (preparation to prove it), closure fulfillment (Chen witnesses it and concedes). Strong causal and thematic integration; one more beat of Mara doubting whether the garden will respond in time could deepen the friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Blooming withering as tone is woven throughout: "blooming and withering happened simultaneously—new growth emerging from dying branches, decay feeding fresh roots," "eternal cycles of becoming and unbecoming," and the final image where "the hedges bloomed and withered in their eternal dance." The dual rhythm modulates with pressure: the opening's withered leaves and Mara's shaking hands set decay, the middle ritual balances care and entropy, and the closure demonstration shows both processes at once, charging the inspector's epistemic shift. Tone supports the theme (recognition of natural cycles versus static metrics) and tensions the institutional demand for "permanent flourishing." Coherent through turns, purposeful in the final image, and distinct from generic pastoral or elegiac modes. The repetition of the blooming-withering phrase three times across the piece is purposeful rather than template churn, though one instance could be varied for texture.</comment>
