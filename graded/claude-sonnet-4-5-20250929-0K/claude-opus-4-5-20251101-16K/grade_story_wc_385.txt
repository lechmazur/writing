<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to understand echoes is clear and her perceptual gift is established early, but her internal experience remains somewhat abstract—"richly perceptive" functions more as a label than a lived constraint that forces difficult micro-choices. The confrontation with the Keeper delivers exposition rather than embodied conflict; Mira's decision to sing feels inevitable without visible cost or internal contradiction acting in the moment. The grandmother's final whisper offers closure, but Mira's arc from questioning to understanding lacks a dramatized renunciation or stake that she visibly forecloses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when clearly within the opening paragraphs and maintains spatial coherence throughout. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: details about echoes, the nexus, and Mira's investigation build density toward the chorus moment, which reweights the Keepers' control claim. However, the Keeper's flight and the chorus's emergence lack a visible cost that Mira pays on the page—the revelation arrives as a gift from the dead rather than a choice that forecloses an option. The closure reconfigures understanding but the felt price remains oblique, capping the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The serpentine nexus under starlight is vividly rendered with "seven canyon paths converged beneath a ceiling of infinite stars" and the hum of wind through passages creating the cosmic frequency. Sensory detail is filtered through Mira's perceptual bias (residue of conversations, emotional weight in stone, subharmonics in rock). The nexus functions as a natural amplifier that enables the climactic chorus, directly constraining the Keeper and charging the final image—the setting's acoustic properties shape the outcome and resonate with the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—why some people echo—is signaled early and sustained. The confrontation with the Keeper offers one meaningful turn: the revelation that echoes are choices, not accidents. However, escalation relies on exposition rather than pressure forcing Mira into a trade-off; she sings without visible cost, and the Keeper flees without testing Mira's commitment. The dead choose Mira rather than Mira earning access through sacrifice, reducing agency at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—agency after death, the power of chosen memory—emerges organically from the shell, the echoes, and the Keepers' false control. The final insight that "the dead chose who heard them" reweights prior material without overt moralizing. The grandmother's closing whisper offers a resonant answer: echo when ready, not before. Minor deduction for the Keeper's "preserve them / for profit" exchange, which edges toward binary thesis-antithesis rather than letting ambiguity breathe, but the ending image recovers complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "a sound like reeds blown by autumn wind, full of melancholy" and "richly perceptive in ways that unsettled ordinary people" establish tone and diction. POV remains stable in third-person limited; psychic distance is consistent. Dialogue serves subtext (the Keeper's defensive "for survival" versus Mira's "for profit"), though the exchange leans expository. Perceptual signature is character-specific—Mira hears subharmonics and residues—but under peak stress the prose maintains its elevated register without compression, which slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is generally coherent ("broken curve of nacre," "walls bloomed with voices"). However, several lines carry minor scaffold: "This was what Mira needed to understand" reads as stage direction rather than embodied urgency, and "the webs of intrigue that had brought her here revealed their final strand" summarizes rather than dramatizes the revelation. Stock phrases ("canyon walls bloomed," "pulsing with their own ancient frequencies") appear in non-peak beats but do not obscure closure. Information density is strong; minimal loops detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The canyon-singer premise and echo-as-choice mechanic offer a fresh angle on haunting and memory. The nexus as acoustic amplifier and the shell as anchor are specific to this world. However, the Keepers' role as villain and the "preserve vs. profit" debate follow familiar antagonist templates, and the climactic chorus—voices rising to defeat the thief—echoes genre patterns without a sharp counter-inflection. Emotional specificity in the grandmother's voice and Mira's perceptual gift provide authenticity, but the conceptual synthesis remains mid-band original rather than transformative.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira is the POV throughout and makes the key choice to sing, which triggers the chorus and drives the Keeper away. She appears early, is involved in every beat, and her action at closure (raising the shell and singing) is causally active. However, the decision feels under-pressured—no visible cost or renunciation accompanies the act, reducing necessity. The dead empower her rather than her earning access through sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The seashell half is introduced in the opening beat ("half a seashell pressed against her heart"), functions as the container for the grandmother's voice and the hidden map (two distinct uses), and Mira raises it to her lips in the climactic beat. It returns with reweighted meaning in the grandmother's final whisper. Closure participation is strong; however, the shell does not constrain Mira's choice with visible cost—it enables without friction.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Webs of intrigue" is mentioned once as a summary phrase ("had pieced together webs of intrigue through progressive disclosure") and gestures toward the investigation backstory (rumors, coded messages, map). It does not shape on-page tactics or constrain choices during the confrontation. The Keepers' presence complicates the scene, but the "webs" themselves remain offstage context rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Richly perceptive" is introduced early and colors Mira's narration throughout (she hears residues, feels emotional weight, senses subharmonics). It enables her to piece together clues and hear the map's frequency. However, it functions as an advantage without visible tradeoff; no scene shows perception overwhelming her or forcing a costly decision. The trait is present across beats but does not constrain with friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Ensure" appears once in Mira's dialogue ("I need to ensure I understand") and drives the exposition exchange with the Keeper. That conversation yields the key revelation (echoes are choices), which reframes the story's question and primes the closure. However, Mira could have asked "I need to know" or "confirm" with minimal structural change—the verb itself is not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Progressive disclosure" is named once in backstory summary ("pieced together webs of intrigue through progressive disclosure over months") and structures the investigation's offstage arc (rumors, coded messages, map in the shell). The map's reveal matters for how Mira reached the nexus, but the method does not constrain on-page choices or alter tactics during the confrontation. Present in setup and referenced at closure (the map led her here), but not causally active in the middle.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The serpentine nexus is introduced in the opening line, anchors every beat spatially, and its acoustic properties (natural amplifier, seven canyons feeding into one point) enable the climactic chorus that defeats the Keeper. Setting directly shapes outcome: without the nexus's amplification, Mira's song would lack the power to awaken the dead. Starlight provides atmospheric continuity. The nexus is indispensable to closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"While the universe hums its secret song" is framed as the temporal marker in the prompt, but on the page it appears as continuous background ambiance ("the universe hummed its secret song around her," "beneath a canopy of starlight, the dead chose Mira"). It does not create urgency or tighten decisions; no clock runs. The hum charges atmosphere but does not function as a timeframe that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mira's desire to understand why some people echo is stated early ("This was what Mira needed to understand") and drives her journey to the nexus and her question to the Keeper. The Keeper's answer (echoes are choices) satisfies the question and reframes the grandmother's presence. However, the desire is pursued through asking rather than a choice with visible cost—friction between want and obstacle is minimal on the page. Present in setup, middle conversation, and grandmother's closure whisper.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Reed-blown melancholy" is embodied in the Keeper's laugh ("a sound like reeds blown by autumn wind, full of melancholy") and sustained through diction ("broken curve of nacre," "murmuring fragments of lullabies," "endless, patient hum"). Tone modulates with pressure: the confrontation sharpens into urgency ("walls bloomed with voices"), then softens into the grandmother's whisper. The final image ("patient hum of everything that had ever chosen to remain") charges closure with quiet, resonant sorrow.</comment>
