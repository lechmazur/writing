<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's sharp-eyed skill is established early and her internal drive to decode belonging shapes her actions, but the peak choice—leaving the chip for the next pilgrim—feels slightly convenient rather than earned through prior struggle. Internal conflict exists (three generations searching, her grandmother's deathbed wish) but remains mostly summarized rather than dramatized in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The renunciation at the end carries thematic weight but lacks a visible cost that forecloses a lived path; we don't see what she sacrifices by sharing rather than hoarding.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds through layered discovery (dried flowers → journals → star trails → armillary alignment → coordinate realization → fresh flowers → chip placement) with a clear tightening as Mira moves from searching to understanding to sharing. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): she walks away "no longer a stranger," having found coordinates and chosen to pass them forward—a stance crystallization with conceptual cost (renouncing sole possession). Orientation is anchored early (observatory, dusk, three days after pilgrim). One pressure point: the ellipsis from "she began to understand" to full revelation feels slightly under-dramatized, but the accumulative design holds and the final image reweights the opening's "desperate hope" into "bridge of accumulated revelation."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The observatory's crumbled dome, tarnished bronze armillary sphere, and marble floor are vivid and purposeful. The sphere itself constrains the climactic choice: Mira pulls the central ring, aligns the chip's holes with stars, and the new configuration reveals the coordinate—environment as tool. "Brilliant dimness" suffuses the space and modulates with the discovery beat. The recurring dried/fresh flowers anchor the pilgrim frame. Spatial choreography is clean (steps to platform, descent, chip on ledge). Micro-setting (the chip against the sphere) charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: decode the frequency of belonging. The story tightens once—Mira moves from searching to aligning the chip with the sphere, which narrows her question into a coordinate answer. The resolution (leaving the chip) is her choice, but it's not tested by opposition or a competing desire; the pilgrim who left flowers and the one arriving after are offstage. Under the Accumulative lens, the deepening (understanding → sharing) shifts her stance with conceptual cost (no longer hoarding). One meaningful pressure point is present, sufficient for this length and lens, though a second micro turn or visible tradeoff would elevate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—belonging as a coordinate rather than a static identity—emerges organically through the armillary sphere, star trails, and the succession of pilgrims. The final image (placing the chip for the next seeker) offers a non-literal answer: belonging is directional and cumulative, not solitary. "Frequencies weren't meant to be hoarded" risks a thematic statement but is immediately enacted by her leaving the chip, which redeems it. The "missing pieces" motif works as fragments of understanding rather than objects, charging the conceptual repricing. Minor slip: "perpetual displacement" in the penultimate beat edges toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mira; distance modulates appropriately (close during discovery, slightly wider at the framing beats). Perceptual signature is present: "sharp-eyed," trained to track minute movements, she notices star trails and alignments. The prose texture is consistent and slightly elevated ("brilliant dimness," "celestial fire") without breaking POV lexicon for a pilot with archival research background. One filter-verb stack in the reflection paragraph ("had thought," "had discovered," "had searched") slightly dulls immediacy but doesn't rupture voice. No dialogue to judge. Psychic distance shifts are intentional and serve the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; most sentences advance discovery or image. Clarity is strong through the alignment sequence. However, the reflection block ("She had thought the old woman delirious. But then she'd discovered...") is ~15% of the text and edges toward summary; it anchors in the present (pulling the chip from her pocket) but flattens momentum slightly. Minor paraphrase loop: "missing pieces" appears three times without added pressure each time. Stock phrase: "gathering dark" in the penultimate paragraph. The opening and closing images are strong. No major artifacts touch closure, so non-closure accumulation cap at −0.8 applies (reflection drag + minor loops).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—coordinate as belonging, star trails as cipher, armillary sphere as key—feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The succession of pilgrims (dried flowers, Mira, fresh flowers) adds a temporal layer that transforms the lone-hero trope into a relay. However, the core frame (ancient observatory holds secret knowledge, protagonist decodes via artifact) is a widely used template; transformation comes through the "frequency of belonging" specificity and the choice to share rather than hoard. Risk: the piece commits to its lyric-accumulative design and follows through. The "coordinates written in her bones" phrase is strong but "genuinely other" and "somewhere else" trend generic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's sharp-eyed skill is seeded early (tracking movements across vast distances) and enables the climactic alignment: she sees star trails "curving in impossible ways" and notices how chip holes align with sphere stars. Her decision to leave the chip is a key turn. Present in all three gates (setup, middle discovery, closure choice). However, "sharp-eyed" mostly enables observation; the decision to share is not constrained by this trait—any protagonist could make that choice. Two beats of involvement (observation, alignment) + closure linkage, but swappability lowers the band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The chip appears in four beats: pulled from pocket, examined for star trails, held against the armillary sphere (alignment enables the revelation), and placed on the ledge for the next pilgrim. Setup early, middle use (alignment is the causal hinge), and closure participation (leaving it reweights "missing pieces" into shared bridge). Irreplaceable: its specific geometry (holes aligning with stars) matters. Cost connection: renouncing it forecloses sole possession. Strong integration, though the chip could be described more tactilely during handling.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Missing pieces" is seeded early (grandmother's phrase), drives Mira's search (journals, star charts, half-finished calculations), and is reweighted at closure: not physical objects but "fragments of understanding." It shapes stakes (decode what's missing) and the final tactic (add her understanding to the relay). Present in all three gates. However, it functions more as thematic frame than constraint on action; Mira's tactics (climb, align chip, pull ring) would work identically if the stake were phrased differently. Lyric reprise with thematic reweighting, but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Perpetually surprised" appears twice: "perpetually surprised by how these ancient builders had understood" and "perpetually surprised to find fresh flowers." Both are observations, not constraints on action. No cost, no tactic enabled or foreclosed. The trait could be cut without altering any beat. Ornamental use; setup and closure cameo but no middle development or causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Pull" is the hinge action: Mira pulls the armillary sphere's central ring, it moves, clicks into new configuration, and reveals stars/coordinate invisible before. This turn unlocks the resolution. Setup (sphere described early), middle (the pull itself), and closure (the revelation enables her final choice to share). Causal and irreplaceable: no other action (observe, align chip) completes the discovery. High integration, though the ease of the pull ("surprising ease, as if someone had maintained it") slightly undercuts the cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Following star trails" is seeded on the chip and sphere, used in the middle discovery ("By following star trails... Mira began to understand"), and enables the coordinate revelation that charges the closure. The method is specific (trails etched on chip align with sphere trails) and irreplaceable. However, the mechanics are slightly vague—what does "following" mean in action? She aligns, then pulls; the "following" is more interpretive than procedural. Present in all three gates, causal role, but moderate specificity drag.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The observatory at dusk is anchored early and saturates the piece. Dusk's "brilliant dimness" modulates with discovery and charges the closure image. The crumbled dome exposes the sphere to dying light, enabling the star-trail visibility. The bronze sphere is the tool Mira manipulates to decode. The marble floor and worn steps guide spatial choreography. Fresh flowers at the entrance reweight the opening's dried petals, completing the pilgrim frame. Environment supplies the cipher and pressures the timeline (dusk → "deepening night"). Strong causal and atmospheric integration across all gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After the pilgrim arrives" sets the frame (dried flowers three days old, Mira's arrival, fresh flowers at the end). The succession of pilgrims brackets the action and charges the relay theme. However, "three days before" and the dusk timeline don't constrain Mira's choices or alter tactics; she could decode at any point. Present in setup and closure (fresh flowers), but no middle pressure. Temporal frame without tightening effect; functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Decode the frequency of belonging" is Mira's stated goal (grandmother's deathbed wish, three generations searching, family's "perpetual displacement"). It drives her search and is answered at closure: the frequency is a coordinate, a direction home. The desire is dramatized through her climb, alignment, and revelation, and conflicted subtly—she feels the pull but chooses to share rather than hoard. Present in all three gates. However, the friction between want and cost is conceptual (hoarding vs. sharing) rather than viscerally enacted on the page; we don't see her hesitate or weigh the choice. Strong thematic role, moderate embodied pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Brilliant dimness" appears three times: opening (suffuses everything), middle (caught between day and night), and is implied in "deepening night" at closure. The tone is coherent—liminal, twilight, suffused—and modulates with discovery (the middle instance ties to her internal alignment). It charges the final image (walking into night with new eyes). However, the tone is more atmospheric descriptor than pressure modulator; it doesn't tighten or release with beats. Lyric reprise with thematic resonance, but static mood rather than dynamic charge. Purposeful early-to-final arc, but mid-band for limited modulation under pressure.</comment>
