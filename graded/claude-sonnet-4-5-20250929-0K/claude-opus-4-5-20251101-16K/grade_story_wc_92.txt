<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's core trait ("calmly inventive") is asserted but her on-page choices feel more procedural than genuinely constrained—she unlocks doors in sequence without visible cost or internal friction. Her motivation for the revolution is told ("imagining a different world") rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. The final lie to the warden carries some weight, but the competence never wobbles under pressure, flattening the arc. No embodied emotion or contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal with some Accumulative texture (the lanterns, sundial). Closure lands: Mira returns to her post, the mission succeeds, and she lies with "perfect calm"—a Charged Poise moment where options are crystallized and cost is felt (she must continue the deception). Orientation anchors early (luminous fort, lock sentinel, blackout). The because/therefore chain holds: blackout enables escape, Mira unlocks cells, prisoners follow the route, engineers restore light. One meaningful tightening occurs when the engineers find the severed lines and the window closes. Cost is legible but muted—no on-page consequence threatens Mira's safety or deepens her stakes beyond the initial plan.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The luminous fort, battlements, harbor, corridors, alcove, sundial pedestal, arrow slit, cliff stairs, and waiting boats are all named and spatially coherent. The sundial as micro-setting object does constrain a choice (Mira adjusts the gnomon to signal "tonight") and the thousand lanterns frame the opening and close the story, charging the final image with irony. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (golden light, darkness, stone wall, bronze face). The blackout setting tightens the window and shapes Mira's tactics. No deep occupational texture (lock mechanics, guard rotations) but the length permits the omission.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: free seventeen prisoners before the engineers restore light. The blackout creates a live clock, and the engineers' discovery tightens the window once. Mira's agency is execution of a pre-planned mission; no on-page reversal forces her to adapt tactics or pay a visible price. The prisoners escape off-page, the warden's question is deflected with a line, and no loss or forfeiture alters later options. Escalation is present but minimal—one turn (lights return) rather than a deepening that narrows choices with cost. The final moment crystallizes her ongoing deception but does not foreclose a path or charge the stakes with new friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the Cradle of Sparks conceit and the parable of friction birthing light, integrated into the blackout and the sundial's coded angles. The ending image (thousand lanterns blazing, "triumphant and oblivious") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of silent revolution. Subtext operates in Mira's final line ("Only darkness, sir. Only darkness and time") and the empty quill holder ready for new names. No overt moralizing. One slip: "stories and philosophies that no lock could truly contain" tilts toward prompt-echo abstraction rather than earned particulars, and "The Cradle of Sparks had kindled its first flame" lands close to a thematic summary statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with clean focalization through Mira. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("sleeping secret," "winking hush," "silent as smoke"). Perceptual signature is present: Mira's vigilance, her knowledge of the sundial's code, her calm under pressure. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Psychic distance is consistent. One register slip: "intellectuals and teachers and writers whose only crime was imagining a different world" reads slightly elevated and abstracting compared to the tactile texture elsewhere, but the effect is minor. Dialogue is minimal (one exchange with the warden) and functional. Narrative voice modulates with emotional intensity appropriately.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, sentence openings are diverse, no paraphrase loops. Information density is high in the middle (sundial mechanics, escape route, Cradle of Sparks parable). Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Minor scaffold: "Each key hung from her belt like a sleeping secret" and later "her belt heavy with forty-seven keys" feels like a held-back detail released for thematic echo rather than causal need. "The intrigue had been building for months" is a summary placeholder that could be cut. One template-cadence slip: "Whispered conversations in the laundry. Documents passed through the kitchen slop. A network of servants..." uses parallel fragment structure across three beats without variation. Clarity and concision are strong overall; no grammatical errors or pronoun ambiguity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise (lock sentinel enables prison break during blackout) is functional but not novel; the sundial code and "Cradle of Sparks" name add specificity. The silent-revolution frame and the thousand-lanterns irony offer a fresh inflection on familiar material. Emotional specificity is present in Mira's calm competence and the final lie. The transformation test is borderline: the plot and arc would work largely unchanged with different names and a different fortress. No close echoes of famous lines. The piece commits to its premise and follows implications without retreat, but the core template (insider-saboteur frees prisoners) is widely used and the story does not transform it through a non-obvious moral calculus or deeply particular lived detail. Risk-taking is moderate; the structure is conventional and the ending is competent but safe.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira (vigilant lock sentinel) frames the opening, unlocks forty-seven doors (the central action), adjusts the sundial, and delivers the final lie to the warden. Her choices create the key turn (prisoners escape) and the closure moment (return to post, deception continues). She is present in all three gates: setup (first paragraph), development (unlocking sequence), and payoff (final exchange). The role is essential; no other character could execute this specific plan. Cost is muted—her vigilance and calm are asserted but not tested on the page with a visible tradeoff. She enables rather than decides under friction, so causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The bronze quill holder appears twice: Mira touches it mid-mission ("In her pocket, her fingers closed around a bronze quill holder") and it presses against her thigh at the end, "empty now but ready to carry new names." Setup is clear, payoff is present, but middle development is absent—it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic during the escape. The object's hollowness and the list of names inside are told rather than shown in use. The ending reprise reweights meaning (cycle will continue) but the object itself is ornamental in the middle beat. Swappable with any concealable document container; no unique properties matter on the page.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The Cradle of Sparks is named and explained via the parable ("gentle friction of ideas rubbing together in darkness until light had no choice but to emerge"). It shapes the thematic stakes (silent revolution, seeds planted) but does not constrain on-page tactics or alter Mira's choices. The concept is present in setup (exposition paragraph) and closure (thematic summary: "The Cradle of Sparks had kindled its first flame"). No middle beat where the concept changes options or forces a decision. It reads as a thematic label rather than a dramatized pressure. Mostly ornamental; the escape would proceed identically without the name or parable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Calmly inventive" is asserted early ("Mira had been calmly inventive since childhood, solving problems others couldn't see") but never tested on the page with a visible tradeoff. Her calm is mentioned at the end ("perfect calm") but no on-page action demonstrates inventiveness under friction—she executes a pre-planned sequence. The trait is label-only; it does not enable or constrain a choice. Setup is present, development and payoff are absent. The attribute could be removed without altering plot or closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Intrigue (the revolution's covert operation) is the core action. Setup is thorough (blackout, network, whispered conversations, documents passed). Development is the unlocking sequence and escape. Payoff is the return to normalcy and the promise of future operations. The intrigue drives at least two beats (the escape itself and the final deception) and shapes the ending's charge (silent revolution has begun). Removing intrigue would collapse the plot. Specificity is moderate—the mechanics (severed oil lines, coded sundial, smuggled diagrams) are particular enough to feel lived-in. Cost is implicit (ongoing risk) but not dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The half-painted sundial appears in setup (alcove scene, "coded angles... a message system") and Mira adjusts the gnomon by three degrees to signal "tonight." This one action enables the escape by coordinating the conspirators. The sundial returns at closure ("its coded angles reset to innocence") as a charged image. Middle development is thin—the sundial does not constrain Mira's tactics after the initial signal. The mechanics are told ("The finished hours pointed to cell numbers. The bare bronze reflected the twilight sky in ways that indicated timing") rather than demonstrated. Setup and payoff gates are met; causal pressure is moderate. Swappable with any covert signaling device; the sundial's specific properties (half-painted, bronze face) do not matter beyond description.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The luminous fort at twilight anchors the opening ("thousand lanterns that crowned its battlements each evening, casting golden light") and closes the story ("The fort blazed again with its thousand golden lights, triumphant and oblivious"). The blackout created by cutting oil lines enables the entire escape, so the setting supplies the core resource. Spatial choreography (battlements, corridors, alcove, arrow slit, cliff stairs, harbor, waiting boats) is coherent and constrains Mira's route. The twilight timing matters—"The bare bronze reflected the twilight sky" ties the sundial mechanics to the setting. All three gates present; the final image recharges the opening. Micro-setting (alcove with sundial) alters tactics. Cost is implicit (time pressure from engineers) but felt.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The unexplained blackout is the inciting pressure. Setup is immediate (opening scene). The timeframe tightens Mira's window: "They had perhaps twenty minutes before the engineers discovered the sabotage" and later "The engineers had found the severed lines." This clock shapes tactics (Mira works cell by cell, returns "just as the lanterns flickered back to life"). Closure directly invokes the timeframe (lights restore, normalcy resumes). The blackout is indispensable; removing it collapses the escape opportunity. Cost is legible—Mira must finish before discovery. One weakness: the twenty-minute estimate is asserted but not tracked on the page; no mid-sequence moment where the ticking clock forces a harder choice.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation ("to spark a silent revolution") is stated and thematically reinforced ("intellectuals and teachers and writers whose only crime was imagining a different world," "stories and philosophies that no lock could truly contain"). Setup is clear, and the motivation drives the escape. Payoff: "The Cradle of Sparks had kindled its first flame. More would follow." The motivation is present in all three gates. Weakness: the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses or a visible cost. No on-page friction between Mira's revolutionary aim and a personal want or fear. The motivation reads as a given rather than a tested stake. Swappable with any ideological cause; no character-specific texture distinguishes this revolution from a generic "freedom" drive.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Winking hush" is a distinct tonal choice signaled early: "A winking hush had settled over the fort." The tone coheres through the piece—Mira's calm competence, the guards' uncertainty, the silent prisoners, the final ironic return to normalcy. The tone modulates subtly: tension during the unlocking sequence, irony at closure ("triumphant and oblivious"). The phrase itself recurs implicitly in Mira's "perfect calm" and the ending image. The tone charges the final beat by contrasting the fort's blazing lights with the silent success. All three gates present. The tone is purposeful and supports the theme. Minor weakness: "winking" as a descriptor is slightly arch and the tonal register is uniform rather than dynamically shifting under pressure.</comment>
