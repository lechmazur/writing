<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's internal arc from forcing capture to inviting presence is coherent, with the seven-year gap motivating her transformation. The final choice—gifting the pocket-sun to Cass—emerges from prior reflection and earns its moment. However, interiority leans heavily on abstractions ("density of presence," "geometry's love letter to time") that label rather than embody, and Cass's faith as the missing "color" reads more as thematic assertion than dramatized pressure. The "palette of resolve" metaphor remains ornamental rather than constraining on-page choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (alchemist, ember nexus, twilight return after seven years). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through reflection, the columella curl recurs with reweighted meaning, and Cass's whispered secret ("I always knew you would") functions as a cadence shift that steadies Mira's hands and completes the pocket-sun. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the successful pocket-sun and the gift crystallize the revalued relationship with felt cost (vulnerability, acknowledgment of dependence). One weakness: the secret's four words do not alter tactics on the page; they affirm what reflection already established, so the closure effect is more confirmatory than transformative.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ember nexus provides vivid, purposeful sensory grounding—threads of residual flame, ancient stone pillars, twilight deepening—and the setting anchors Mira's failure memory and present attempt. The nautilus shell columella curl functions as micro-setting, charged with prior meaning and visually present at key beats. However, the nexus does not constrain choices (Mira could perform this alchemy elsewhere) and the spatial choreography of her kneeling, Cass's arrival, and the final palm-held exchange lacks tactile specificity. The setting supports atmosphere more than it pressures action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Mira succeeding where she failed seven years ago—is clear and focused. Pressure tightens through her realization that "presence could not be captured by force, only by invitation," shifting her method from glass vessel to crystallized intention. Cass's arrival and whispered faith supply the missing element, enabling success. The cost is legible: Mira must accept dependence on another's belief, foreclosing self-sufficient mastery. One limitation: the tightening is reflective rather than driven by on-page obstacles; Mira's new approach works immediately without friction or setback, so escalation reads as deepening rather than contested narrowing of options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The theme—presence as shared rather than captured, growth requiring patience and faith—emerges organically from the alchemy work and the Mira-Cass bond. The nautilus shell's spiral and "geometry's love letter to time" recur with shifted meaning at closure, and the final realization ("It's not capturing presence...it's honoring it") reweights prior material. However, the closing lines over-articulate the theme: "some pocket-suns were never really about light at all" and "the shade of someone else's faith, given freely in a whispered secret" read as thematic summaries rather than trusting the image. The "palette of resolve" metaphor is asserted but never dramatized as a constraint.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable, and Mira's voice carries a consistent scientifically romantic filter ("geometry's love letter," "directed spontaneity"). Diction at peaks—"crystallized intention," "architecture of the nautilus spiral"—fits her alchemist idiom. Cass's brief dialogue feels natural and goal-driven. One weakness: perceptual signature flattens under pressure; Mira notices ember-light and her materials but does not degrade or narrow focus as stakes rise. The final paragraph's recursive phrasing ("She had returned differently. She had been revalued.") and the explanatory coda dilute momentum rather than sharpening the ending image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and most sentences advance character or atmosphere. Strong moments: "It was smaller than her old ambition. It was infinitely more true." However, pervasive figurative density—nearly every paragraph stacks metaphors ("threads of amber light," "tapestry that shifted and breathed," "architecture of the nautilus spiral," "mathematically precise and achingly alive")—creates tonal uniformity without pattern-teaching or payoff. The final third recycles stems: "She had returned differently. She had been revalued." "Some things required..." × 3. Paraphrase loop: "Light was not something to be trapped; it was something to be asked" is restated as "presence was not something you captured, but something you shared." Template cadence and filter-verb stacks ("She had known," "She breathed," "She had returned") reduce immediacy in peak beats. Apply −0.9 for patterned artifacts across the piece and −0.3 for loops touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The alchemy premise and "scientifically romantic" idiom offer fresh texture, and the nautilus shell's golden ratio grounds the abstract stakes in a concrete object. The realization that faith from another completes the work is specific and earned in hindsight. However, the mentor-gift-after-failure and return-to-site-of-trauma beats follow familiar arcs without transformation, and the "palette of resolve" remains a label rather than a lived constraint. The whispered secret as climactic catalyst reads as a convenient final ingredient rather than a synthesis of prior particulars. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies moderately: the template is partially transformed but not enough to escape mid-band placement.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira frames expectation (returning differently, compressing starlight) and her decision to shape the vessel from crystallized intention rather than glass drives the successful creation. She is present at closure, gifting the pocket-sun to Cass. However, her key choice—accepting faith as the missing element—is reactive (Cass provides it) rather than agentive. Two beats (old failure recalled, new attempt) plus closure participation, but causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The nautilus shell appears early (Cass gave it after the failure), recurs visually when it catches ember-light mid-attempt, and spirals "like a promise" at closure. Its golden ratio explicitly informs the new vessel's architecture. Three beats, charged reprise, and causal linkage to method. Not fully indispensable—Mira could invoke the spiral concept without the physical shell—but strong integration across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "palette of resolve" appears in narration ("Her palette of resolve had been incomplete") and is explained as needing "the shade of someone else's faith." It names the theme but does not constrain on-page choices or alter tactics; Mira never weighs which "colors" she has or tests their sufficiency before the realization. Present as concept, functional as theme claim, but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Scientifically romantic" is defined early ("finding poetry in formulas") and shapes Mira's idiom and perceptual filter throughout ("geometry's love letter," "mathematically precise and achingly alive"). It colors voice and worldview but does not constrain a specific choice or create visible tradeoff. Present across beats, voice-consistent, but not causally essential.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Revalue" is signaled early ("by returning differently, one could revalue what had been lost"), drives the middle reflection (seven years of revaluing her methods), and lands at closure ("She had been revalued" and the four words that "revalued everything"). The action is specific to Mira's process and irreplaceable; swapping it for "reconsider" or "transform" would dilute thematic coherence. Three beats, causal pressure, closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Returning differently" is taught in the opening third ("by returning differently...she was not returning the same") and Mira explicitly invokes it at Cass's arrival ("I had to return differently"). The method shapes her approach (new materials, new mindset) but the mechanics—what "differently" entails—remain abstract. Two beats, thematic reprise, but tactical specificity is low.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The ember nexus is anchored early (twilight convergence of dying fires, ancient stone pillars) and provides the raw material—threads of residual flame—that Mira shapes into the pocket-sun. It is the site of her original failure, charging the return with memory. Two beats (failure memory, present attempt), setting supplies resources, and it is present at closure. Does not constrain choices (she could attempt this elsewhere) but participates causally in the alchemy.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The timeframe—"in the moment a secret is whispered between friends"—is signaled and occurs on the page when Cass whispers "I always knew you would." That moment steadies Mira's hands and completes the pocket-sun, linking setup to closure. However, the "moment" is brief and does not tighten tactics or create a live clock; the alchemy could succeed at any point in the conversation. Lyric reprise with moderate causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mira's desire "to capture the density of presence" is introduced early (what she tried to achieve with the failed pocket-sun) and drives her seven-year quest. The realization that "presence could not be captured by force, only by invitation" and the final shift to "honoring it" reweight the motivation at closure. Desire is dramatized across multiple beats and conflicts with her old method, creating friction. Strong thematic and causal integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Directed spontaneity" is defined mid-opening ("each movement deliberate yet flowing, rehearsed yet responsive") and describes Mira's physical approach to the alchemy. The tone modulates subtly—reflective in memory, focused during creation, warm at closure—but the phrase itself does not recur or charge the final image. Present, voice-consistent, but not structurally essential.</comment>
