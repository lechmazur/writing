<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's prosopagnosia is well-established and shapes her artistic practice concretely. The interior journey from "capture the surface, never the soul" to understanding she must "touch rather than see" is earned through the coin discovery. Her decision to pocket the coin and walk toward the studio carries visible cost (leaving the library to fall) and forecloses her old method. Minor: the epiphany moment leans slightly abstract ("souls weren't visible. They were felt") but is anchored by the tactile coin experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation is clean within 120 words (Mira, library, final hour). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through nested backstory (Vane's technique, Mira's limitation, the mentor's clue) that converges on the coin's tactile pattern, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Mira's realization reweights her constraint as doorway rather than barrier; the cost is legible in her acceptance of the library's destruction and commitment to a new method. The closure crystallizes options with undeniable pressure even as the physical choice (leaving) is quiet.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tree trunk library is vividly particular (bark-lined walls, hollowed ancient oak, alcoves) and the demolition timeframe pressures Mira's search. The coin's faint indentations function as micro-setting, constraining her discovery method (touch rather than sight) and charging the final image in her palm. Spatial choreography is clean (third alcove, eastern trunk, exit path). The morning light at the end and the groaning timbers provide sensory closure that mirrors her internal shift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find Vane's technique before demolition) is signaled early and tightens through the search. The coin discovery reverses Mira's understanding: her limitation is redirection, not absence. This tightening forecloses her old portrait method with visible cost (she must learn faces through touch, a slower and more intimate process). The demolition deadline creates urgency, and her choice to leave rather than linger adds weight. One meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens; escalation reads as density increase that reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme (constraint as doorway to infinity) emerges organically from Mira's prosopagnosia, Vane's mirrored skies, and the coin's fractal indentations. The final image—"carrying infinity in her pocket"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The concept of "accepting walls to mirror the sky" integrates with closure: Mira must embrace her limitation to unlock her gift. Subtext operates through the parallel between Vane's condition and Mira's, revealed through discovery rather than statement. Minor: "The limit was the doorway. It always had been" edges toward on-the-nose articulation but is brief and earned by prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and perceptually precise: "fractally precise patterns of pores," "faint indentations forming a pattern so complex it spiraled inward forever." Diction matches Mira's artist's eye without register drift. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance contracts during the epiphany ("And suddenly she understood") without head-hopping. No dialogue present. Minor: a few filter verbs ("feeling the centuries," "thought of the portraits") are voice-appropriate but could be tighter under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high (nested backstory integrates smoothly). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Clarity is strong throughout. Minor deductions: "heightened stillness" and "breathless moment" in the penultimate act are near-synonyms for the same atmospheric beat (−0.2 for proximity). "Distant thunder" as a simile for the collapse is serviceable but leans stock (−0.2). Overall propulsion is clean; the coin's tactile discovery is concrete and memorable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of prosopagnosia, fractal craft, and the "limit as doorway" premise is specific and non-obvious. Mira's realization that "souls were felt" rather than seen transforms the face-blind artist trope through tactile craft. The coin as proof-object is fresh. Minor: the parallel between Mira and Vane (both face blind) is neat but earned in hindsight. The demolition deadline is a familiar pressure device but well-integrated. No close echoes of famous lines; the final image feels inevitable rather than convenient.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present from the opening; shapes the search (she seeks a technique for capturing souls, which her condition blocks). Her tactile discovery of the coin and decision to adopt touch-based portraiture are key turns. The character is indispensable: remove prosopagnosia and the story's logic collapses. All three gates (setup, development, payoff) are met with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Appears in the second act (mentor's clue, discovery in alcove). The safe yields the coin and parchment, enabling Mira's realization. It does not recur or reshape later beats; its function is single-use delivery. Setup and payoff are present, but middle development is thin. Swappable with any hidden compartment without major edits (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Frames the story from the opening ("discovering her limits") and drives the climax ("she was discovering her limits, and they were not barriers"). Mira's realization that limitation is redirection alters her tactics (touch-based craft) and charges the ending. Present in all three gates with strong causal pressure and closure participation. The concept is the story's spine.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Fractally precise" describes both Mira's perceptual strength (pores, wrinkles) and the coin's indentations. It enables her recognition of the pattern and links her method to Vane's. Present in setup (her detailed observation) and payoff (the coin's infinite detail). Middle beat is observational rather than action-driving (−0.3), but the specificity is high and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Craft" appears in Mira's portrait work, Vane's murals, and the coin's creation. It shapes her goal (to craft portraits with souls) and the resolution (touch-based craft). Present in all three gates, but the action itself is broadly defined; "paint" or "create" could substitute with minor edits (−0.5). Closure linkage is solid but specificity is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The coin's faint indentations are discovered in the middle act and provide the key insight: touch reveals infinite detail. Mira traces the pattern twice, and the method (tactile learning) defines her new approach. Present in development and payoff with strong causal pressure. Setup is implicit in her existing tactile skill (−0.2), but the method is indispensable and charges the final image ("the coin warm against her palm").</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The tree trunk library frames the opening and provides the alcove, book safe, and demolition deadline. It pressures the search timeline and supplies the sensory closure (groaning timbers, collapse). Present in all three gates with clear spatial choreography. However, the library could be replaced with another condemned building without breaking logic (−0.6); the scholar's guild backstory enriches but does not constrain choices.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Within the hour" is stated upfront; "minutes now" and the final timber crack track the clock. The deadline tightens Mira's search and her choice to leave rather than linger. Present in setup and payoff with clear escalation. Middle pressure is implied rather than dramatized (−0.4), but the timeframe shapes tactics and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Vane's desire to "mirror the sky inside walls" is backstory that illuminates Mira's parallel quest (to capture souls within portraits). The motivation is thematic but not dramatized as Mira's lived conflict; her own want is to transcend her limitation, which is enacted. Vane's motivation informs the resolution but does not create on-page friction (−0.8). Lyric resonance lifts it slightly.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Heightened stillness" is established in the opening ("breathless moment") and modulates through the search (tactile focus, dim light) to the final exit (morning light, patient giants). Tone charges the closure image: Mira's calm acceptance amid the groaning library. Coherent through turns and integral to the Accumulative lens. Minor: "heightened stillness" and "breathless moment" are near-synonyms in one beat (−0.2), but overall control is strong.</comment>
