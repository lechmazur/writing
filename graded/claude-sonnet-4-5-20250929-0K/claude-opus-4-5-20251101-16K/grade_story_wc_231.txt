<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's eccentric gift—absorbing borrowed memories from objects—is shown through embodied perception ("held it now, turning it in the lamplight") and drives the key choice to conceal the truth. Internal contradiction is present: she investigates what she cannot explain and ultimately chooses silence over transparency. The stranger remains a device; his backstory arrives via memory-vision rather than on-page pressure, which limits relational crucible work. Maren's final act (pinning the boutonniere, closing the drawer, deciding to withhold) forecloses transparency with visible cost to her isolation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Maren resolves to keep their secret and tell authorities nothing, forecloses transparency with felt cost ("witnessed isolation"), reweighting her role from investigator to keeper of their love. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: sensory details (opal dock, mist, dried flower) accrue pressure and the final image (pinning boutonniere, closing drawer) reweights the dominant stake—solving the mystery versus honoring it—with cost (deeper solitude). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the borrowed memory reframes the stranger's journey, narrowing her options to silence or exposure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The opal dock is vividly particular ("pearlescent compound...shimmered through the mist like something half-remembered") and constrains her nightly ritual of investigation. Setting details filter through Maren's professional priorities (lighthouse mechanisms, brass, great lens) and her solitary lifestyle. The drawer functions as micro-setting, supplying the photograph that charges the closure and altering her understanding of the stranger's gesture. Nautical twilight and mist create coherent atmosphere that mirrors and supports her isolation without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: decoding the stranger's final gesture versus leaving it unresolved. One meaningful tightening occurs when the borrowed memory reveals the woman he sought was the previous keeper, narrowing Maren's choice to exposure or silence. Agency is renunciation—she chooses to withhold the truth from authorities—with visible cost (deeper isolation, "witnessed isolation of her tower"). The resolution is earned by her method (observing gaps, absorbing borrowed memories) and her character trait (eccentric by necessity). No antagonist required; pressure coheres through accumulative mystery and the weight of two strangers' unclosed love.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—what we choose to keep versus what we reveal, and the solitude of bearing others' unfinished stories—emerges through the boutonniere, the drawer, and Maren's decision to become custodian of their secret. The final image (pinning the flower above the photograph, closing the drawer) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in "witnessed isolation," "borrowed memories," and "some gestures could only be decoded by those willing to observe what was missing." The Edelweiss shifts meaning from alpine token to returned promise to sacred relic, charging the closure without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during memory-vision, wider during scene-setting). Perceptual signature is distinct: Maren notices absences ("gaps," "no supplies," "no salt stains") and material details (brass mechanisms, pearlescent planks) filtered through her lighthouse-keeper lens. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("softly persistent," "witnessed isolation," "borrowed rather than possessed"). No dialogue present; interior voice remains coherent under pressure. Brief purposeful compression ("His final stillness") fits the accumulative mode and does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Information density is high; nearly every sentence advances mystery or character ("His boat had no supplies...suggesting he had rowed only this once"). Rhythm varies naturally and accelerates during the memory-vision beat. Minor template cadence appears in the reflection passage ("She could not truly read minds...Instead, she absorbed impressions...The memories were always incomplete") but remains legible and voice-motivated. No paraphrase loops or figurative muddle in peak beats. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line ("as love that outlasts its own forgetting") recharges prior motifs without overt moralizing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis—lighthouse keeper with borrowed-memory gift investigates a stranger's final gesture and discovers a predecessor's unfinished love—is specific and non-obvious. The Edelweiss as returning token transforms the trope of the mysterious stranger through concrete world logic (alpine flower, dried preservation, three-mile row). Risk-taking in choosing an interior, reflective arc over confrontation heightens stakes without gimmickry. The ending's renunciation (silence over exposure) feels inevitable in hindsight and avoids the explain-everything trap. Minor proximity to "keeper of secrets" archetypes prevents higher band entry.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's eccentric nature (observing gaps, absorbing borrowed memories) frames the investigation early, constrains her method throughout, and drives the closure choice to keep their secret. She decides to withhold truth from authorities, forecloses transparency, and accepts deeper isolation—visible cost. Appears in setup, middle (memory-vision beat), and ending (pinning boutonniere, closing drawer). Irreplaceable: no generic investigator could access borrowed memories or make this renunciation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The Edelweiss is handled in three distinct beats: pressed into her palm at the stranger's death, examined on the opal dock triggering borrowed memories, and pinned above the photograph at closure. It enables the memory-vision that reframes the mystery, constrains her choice (return it symbolically versus destroy/report it), and charges the final image. Specificity matters: alpine flower, dried preservation, "brittle as old paper." Swapping for any other keepsake would break the geographic and thematic logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Borrowed memories are signaled early ("her particular gift"), explained via interiority, and enable the pivotal memory-vision that reveals the previous keeper's connection to the stranger. The concept alters Maren's options: without it, she cannot decode the gesture or choose silence over exposure. Present in setup (gift described), middle (memory-vision beat), and closure (informs her decision to keep their secret). Cost: the borrowed impressions deepen her isolation and obligate her to custodianship. Moderate swappability: another divination method could serve similar function with edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Softly persistent" appears three times: describing the woman's hope across decades, Maren's nightly investigations, and the final image's tone ("softly persistent as the tide"). The trait constrains Maren's method (repeated dock visits) and charges the closure by linking her endurance to the lovers' endurance. Visible tradeoff: persistence deepens her isolation and binds her to their secret. Present in setup (introduced via memory), middle (her investigative ritual), and ending (final line). Specificity elevates it above label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Investigation is the spine: Maren returns nightly to the dock, observes gaps (no supplies, soft hands, intact flower), and this method leads to the memory-vision that reframes the mystery. The action shapes two beats (physical investigation on dock, handling the boutonniere) and directly enables closure (understanding allows her to choose silence). Causal: without investigating gaps, no borrowed memory; without memory, no informed renunciation. Present throughout; swapping for passive waiting would collapse the arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Observing gaps is signaled early ("She observed gaps. She studied absences"), demonstrated in the dock scene (cataloging what the stranger lacked: no supplies, no salt stains, soft hands), and its mechanics matter—absence-focus primes the boutonniere as key object. The method enables the memory-vision (holding the flower lets borrowed impressions come) and shapes her final stance (honoring what's missing rather than exposing what's found). Present in setup, middle investigation, and thematically at closure. Specificity: this negative-space lens is character-particular and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The opal dock is vividly particular (pearlescent compound, shimmering through mist) and provides the ritual space for nightly investigation. It supplies the stranger's collapse site, anchors the memory-vision beat, and is reprised in the final image ("The mist persisted softly over the opal dock"). Micro-setting function: constrains her investigation to this liminal zone between sea and lighthouse. Present in setup, middle, and ending. Moderate tactic impact: setting charges atmosphere but does not materially alter her options compared to a generic dock.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Nautical twilight is named once in the opening ("At nautical twilight, when the horizon dissolved") and establishes atmospheric timing but does not tighten decisions or track elapsed time across beats. The story spans three days since the stranger's death, yet no clock pressure or urgency emerges. Timeframe supports tone (liminal, dissolving light) but remains ornamental to escalation. Present in setup only; absent from middle investigation and closure. Swappable with other twilight or dawn without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Decoding the stranger's final gesture is the dominant stake, signaled when he presses the boutonniere into her palm and reinforced by her nightly returns ("she could not have explained to anyone what she sought"). The desire drives investigation, memory-vision, and the closure choice: once decoded, she must decide whether to expose or honor the secret. Friction between understanding and revelation creates cost (she gains knowledge but accepts deeper isolation). Present in setup, middle (memory unlocks meaning), and ending (she chooses silence). Irreplaceable: no other motive fits the eccentric keeper or the borrowed-memory mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Witnessed isolation" is coherent throughout: Maren lives alone, investigates alone, absorbs others' memories without companionship, and the final image places her in "the witnessed isolation of her tower." Tone modulates with pressure—calm observation on the dock, intensity during memory-vision, quiet resolve at closure—and charges the ending by linking her solitude to the lovers' separation. The phrase itself appears only at closure but the feeling saturates every beat. Specificity: "witnessed" (by the lighthouse beam, by the reader, by the ghosts of the lovers) elevates it beyond generic loneliness. Irreplaceable.</comment>
