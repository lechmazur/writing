<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena's interior life is concrete and embodied through gesture ("furiously tranquil," handling objects, reading aloud with a cracking voice). The transformation from passive exile to active poet is earned through the discovery of Mira's envelope and proceeds through micro-choices: opening the timetable, setting the timer, reading aloud, picking up the pen. Internal contradiction operates throughout—compliance mask versus authentic voice—and the final resumption of writing forecloses the safe exile path with visible cost (future risk of Ministry action). Minor deduction: the brother's vanishing and grief cartography are told rather than shown affecting a present choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Elena, observatory, three months in, tonight) land early. The story accumulates pressure through layered images (storms, Mira's relics, the forbidden poem) and shifts cadence at the envelope discovery, then again when Elena reads aloud and begins writing anew. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to Charged Poise): the vigil transforms from pause into purpose, and the final image of resetting the timer with new poems charges prior material with conceptual cost—she accepts future danger. One meaningful deepening is present and the lens holds. Small penalty: the leap from reading to "by year's end, perhaps, words passed hand to hand" stretches causality slightly, though it reads as projection rather than summary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The observatory above cloud line, violet lightning, rarefied air, and storm-thinning sky are vivid and selective. The darkroom timer, envelope, and bus timetable function as micro-setting that constrains and charges the final choice: Elena resets the timer to measure "resurrection," and the timetable's obsolescence mirrors the Ministry's failed erasure. The reflection in observatory glass serves as a spatial anchor for the mask-slip moment. Sensory detail is filtered through Elena's professional and emotional priorities (celestial distances, storm light, thin air). Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. All elements converge at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: reclaiming her silenced voice versus maintaining safe exile. The envelope discovery reverses her passive vigil; reading the forbidden poem aloud is the first meaningful tightening (risk escalates); picking up the pen and writing new poems is the second, which narrows options and forecloses safe compliance. The cost is legible: future Ministry scrutiny and the end of her "grateful exile" mask. Agency is Elena's throughout. No coincidence resolves the conflict. Slight limitation: the storm operates more as atmosphere than external antagonist, so pressure is largely internal, but this fits the lens and the piece earns its escalation cleanly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—scars, erasure, and the persistence of voice—emerges organically from the darkroom timer (images needing time to resolve), the poem mapping grief's topography, and the vigil's transformation. The final image (timer ringing, Elena resetting it, writing on) answers the thematic question without stating a moral: some vigils never end, they become work. Subtext operates in the Ministry's redactions as literal black wounds, Mira's hidden message as resistance across time, and the storms as externalized silenced voices. The cartography metaphor threads through without becoming allegorical. No sermonizing; the ending reweights the scars-as-map conceit with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and close; psychic distance tightens at key beats (the envelope, the mirror reflection, the first new line). Narrative certainty matches Elena's knowledge; the past (Mira's work, the interrogations) is anchored in objects and memory cues. Diction fits an educated poet in isolation: "rarefied," "topographical," "cartography," "atlas." Sentence rhythm accelerates during the reading-aloud passage and slows for the final paragraphs. Minor slip: "something inside her burns with the intensity of the lightning below" is slightly generic; "furiously tranquil" is stronger. Perceptual signature is consistent (celestial, linguistic, interior), though occasional phrases ("storm-kissed wonder") edge toward authorial voice rather than Elena's.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong images: "the Ministry's black lines turned stanzas into wounds," "lightning walks across cloud-tops like something searching," "timer ticks its patient count, measuring not exposure now but resurrection." Rhythm varies and information density is high. Deductions: mild paraphrase loops appear ("the woman who believed words could map the unmappable, who thought naming wounds might begin their healing" restates the cartography idea without new pressure), and "furiously tranquil" is asserted twice without fresh embodiment the second time. "Storm-kissed wonder" in the penultimate paragraph feels elevated and slightly formulaic. No major artifacts touch closure, so penalties remain modest.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of censored poet, darkroom timer as resurrection metaphor, and vigil-as-pause transforming into work is specific and coherent. The envelope-in-timetable device is fresh, and the cartography-of-scars conceit is developed with consistency. The piece avoids template exile narratives by grounding transformation in tactile objects and micro-choices. Risk: the lyric, reflection-heavy mode could flatten momentum, but the piece teaches its pattern early and pays it off. Mild limitation: the storm as externalizing "voices of all the silenced" edges toward overt symbolism, and the final paragraph's summary of future poems ("by next month, a collection") is convenient projection rather than earned surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena (censored poet) is established early and drives every major turn: she opens the envelope, reads the forbidden poem aloud (first defiance), writes new lines (resumption of voice). Her choices create the escalation and closure; she is causally active in at least four beats and the final image hinges on her decision to continue writing. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The darkroom timer appears in paragraph two, is set in paragraph eight ("twenty minutes... every image needs time to resolve"), rings and is reset twice in the final third, and the final line measures "resurrection" instead of exposure. It shifts meaning across three distinct beats and charges the closure image. Strong causal work and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"A vigil in pause" is signaled early ("her life suspended like developing fluid") and shapes the dominant stake: Elena has been waiting in exile. The discovery and reading shift the vigil from pause to active purpose, altering her tactics. The concept drives the transformation and is named again in the final paragraphs. It could be more irreplaceable—"waiting" would serve similarly—but it does reweight at closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Furiously tranquil" is introduced in paragraph five and embodied there: "outwardly still, moving through her duties with mechanical precision, while something inside her burns." It constrains her tactics (she has worn the mask of compliance) and the mask slips when she reads aloud. It reappears in the penultimate paragraph. The trait is visible in two beats but could press harder; the cost is implied rather than explicit.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Rarefy" appears twice: the rarefied air strips Elena's defensive layers (paragraph four), and isolation rarefies her thoughts. It enables the mask-slip and the decision to read aloud, but the air's effect is asserted more than dramatized. The action is thematically apt but not mechanically indispensable; "thin" or "sharp" air could substitute with minor edits. Mid-range integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The sealed envelope wedged in the bus timetable is found in paragraph six, opened in paragraph seven, and delivers the forbidden poem and photograph that reverse Elena's passivity. It is the sole mechanism for the poem's return and drives the reading-aloud and writing beats. The timetable's obsolescence mirrors the Ministry's failed erasure. Strong causal pressure, early signal, closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory above clouds is established in the opening line and recurs throughout: violet light, rarefied air, reflection in the glass during the mask-slip, storm thinning to reveal stars at closure. The altitude and isolation enable Elena's transformation, and the clearing sky accompanies her resumption of writing. The setting pressures and charges multiple beats and the final image. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"When masks slip" is framed in paragraph eight ("This is when masks slip") and dramatized in the reflection scene where Elena sees "the woman who believed words could map the unmappable." The timeframe tightens the decision to read aloud and write. It is signaled and paid off but does not impose a live clock or urgent deadline. Solid thematic integration, moderate tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To understand the cartography of scars" is introduced in paragraph seven (Elena wrote the poem "attempting to understand the cartography of scars") and returns in the final section: "The scars have their map now," "The scars will have their atlas." The motivation is embodied in the choice to read and write, and the cost (future danger) is tied to it. It drives the resumption of voice and charges the closure. Strong thematic and causal work.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Storm-kissed wonder" appears explicitly in the penultimate paragraph and is embodied throughout: the violet lightning, the storm "responding with bass notes," the clearing sky revealing stars. Tone modulates from suspended quiet to charged defiance and resolves in quiet determination. The phrase itself is slightly elevated, but the tone supports the transformation and charges the final image. Coherent and purposeful.</comment>
