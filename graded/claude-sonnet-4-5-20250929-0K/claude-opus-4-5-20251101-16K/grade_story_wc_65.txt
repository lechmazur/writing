<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior life is present but abstract; her "paralyzed for three winters" stasis is told rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The tension between imagination and pragmatism remains a declared trait rather than a dramatized contradiction forcing micro-choices. Her final understanding ("the greater failure was silence") arrives as epiphany without embodied cost or visible foreclosure of a live option. Emotional states are labeled ("afraid," "understood") more than enacted through perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Mira's internal reflection deepens until the final decision to write. However, the closure unit—her pen descending—occurs off-page; we do not see the seven words or witness the decisive change, only the approach to it. The cost (three years of paralysis, risk of wrong words) is discussed but not paid on the page at the moment of closure. The inferred lens holds, but the closure reconfiguration is asserted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The obsidian spire, frozen lake, and fractal ice patterns are vivid and purposeful, filtering through Mira's professional lens. The kingfisher nib and the lake's thaw bookend the piece with resonance. However, the spire and lake remain largely atmospheric; they do not constrain a tactical choice or alter the path to closure—Mira's decision would unfold identically in any setting. Sensory detail is selective and tone-appropriate, but setting functions as backdrop rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—choosing seven words to guide humanity—is signaled early. However, no on-page escalation occurs; Mira's internal state shifts from paralysis to acceptance without a discrete reversal or tightening choice that narrows options. The predictive models and probability cascades are described but do not complicate or deepen the conflict. The piece accumulates reflection without a pressure point that forces a trade-off or forecloses a path. The resolution (deciding to write) is announced rather than tested under new pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—sustaining transformation, the ignorance of "how to change while remaining whole"—emerges clearly from the premise and Mira's reflections. However, thematic insights are stated rather than earned through concrete action: "Victory was naming the ignorance that made perfection impossible" is an articulated thesis, not a non-literal final image. The piece resists overt moralizing in the final beat (sunrise, thaw, pen descending), but the prior paragraph directly explicates the theme. Subtext is present in the feather inheritance and ice metaphors, yet the central question is answered in exposition rather than dramatized particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout; perceptual filtering is consistent (Mira's professional cartographer lens). Diction is elevated and mostly voice-appropriate, though some phrasing verges on prompt-echo ("groundedly imaginative—that was what the elders called her, and what she called her curse"). No dialogue appears. Psychic distance is controlled, though the reflective mode dominates with minimal on-page micro-choices to anchor the present. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping or tense drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied. Some scaffold persists: "She saw futures where…She saw futures where…She saw futures…" is a mechanical three-part list; "sustaining transformation" appears as both a phrase Mira surfaces and the prompt's tone element, creating a faint echo of thematic ventriloquism. Figurative language (fractal ice, kingfisher iridescence) is vivid but does not cluster densely in peak beats. No major loops, but paragraph cuts in the middle third would not materially change knowledge or pressure. Information density is moderate; several beats restate the same paralysis without new detail.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—mapping ignorance rather than knowledge—offers a fresh conceptual angle, and "ignorance cartographer" is a specific invented role. However, the execution leans on familiar tropes: a solitary scholar in a tower, a ritual object (the quill), the frozen world as metaphor for stasis, and the sunrise-as-renewal closing image. The core turn (choosing to write imperfectly rather than remain silent) is a recognizable arc. Transformation test: the emotional journey and thematic question would function with a different object, setting, or profession. No close echoes of famous lines, but the synthesis does not feel inevitable or irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and her role as ignorance cartographer frames the stakes. However, her choices are minimal on the page: she reflects, observes models, recalls history, and finally decides to write—but that decision is narrated in approach rather than executed. The setup and middle reflection are clear, but closure participation is weak (pen descends, no written words shown). Functional integration with some causal pressure, but easily swappable with "scholar," "prophet," or "archivist" roles.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The kingfisher feather quill appears in paragraph two (setup), is mentioned again as Mira lifts it ("Her fingers lifted the kingfisher nib"), and closes the piece ("The nib descended"). Three touches across setup, middle, and closure satisfy the gate model. However, the nib's specific properties (iridescent blue, carved bone, familial inheritance) do not constrain a choice or enable a tactic—any pen would serve the same plot function. The reprise at closure reweights meaning through the dawn-light/feather color parallel, offering lyric resonance. Mid-band: present across beats with charged closure linkage, but swappable without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Writing the future" is signaled early (paragraph one: "tonight would determine," "charter for the next generation's inquiry") and shapes the dominant stake: choosing seven words to guide humanity. The concept drives Mira's internal conflict (fear of wrong words, three years' paralysis) and the closure image (pen descending). It appears in at least two beats—setup and closure—with causal pressure on tactics (what to write, whether to write). However, the mechanics remain abstract; we never see the seven words or how they functionally "write the future." Strong setup and closure linkage, moderate irreplaceability (the premise could be "prophecy" or "manifesto" with minor edits). Solid integration shy of indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Groundedly imaginative" is named explicitly in paragraph six as both elder praise and personal curse. Mira's imagination/pragmatism tension is discussed at length but not dramatized in a discrete choice with visible cost. The trait is label-only: we are told "Her imagination soared; her pragmatism dragged it down" without seeing contradictory impulses act simultaneously in a scene. No middle beat where this trait enables or constrains a tactic. Functional presence in setup and thematic closure framing, but replaceable and not causally active. Cap at 3.8 for swappability and label-only use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Prevail" is invoked directly in paragraph nine: "Mira understood what it meant to prevail. Victory was not finding the perfect future. Victory was naming the ignorance…" and implicitly in the closure (she writes, humanity has "prevailed regardless"). The action is conceptual—prevailing by naming ignorance rather than guaranteeing salvation. Setup is present (humanity's need to prevail), middle reflection defines it, and closure enacts it (decision to write). However, the action is abstract and told; the moment of prevailing (writing the seven words) occurs off-page. One gate weak (closure participation is approach, not execution). Mid-band for thematic presence without on-page dramatization of the action itself.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Through predictive modeling" appears in paragraph four: "she had spent decades identifying the specific ignorances…Through predictive modeling." The models are described (probability cascades, hovering light) and Mira uses them to see futures in paragraph eight. Setup and middle beats are clear. However, the mechanics never constrain a choice or alter tactics on the page—Mira's decision to write "sustaining transformation" arises from insight, not from model output. The method is functional scene dressing but does not drive escalation or closure. Introduced late (second paragraph mention, functional use in paragraph eight), no closure participation. Cap at 4.6 for late arrival and lack of causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The obsidian spire by a frozen lake is anchored in paragraph one and recurs throughout (window views, dawn light refracting through ice, the spire's volcanic history, the lake's thaw at closure). Setup, middle reflection (seventeen villages, ancient failures), and closure participation (sunrise strikes spire, lake begins to thaw) are all present. The setting supplies thematic resonance (frozen world, thaw as transformation) and historical depth (failed cartographers). However, it does not constrain a tactical choice or supply a resource that alters Mira's decision—she would write the same words in any location. Lyric reprise with charged closure image, but no causal pressure on action. Solid thematic integration shy of necessity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "before the pen meets the blank page" is signaled in the title-implied frame and reinforced throughout: "tonight would determine," "Her task tonight," "this moment before the pen meets the blank page," and the final beat ("The nib descended toward the waiting page"). Setup, middle urgency, and closure participation are all strong. The constraint tightens Mira's internal pressure (decision must be made now) and the entire narrative arc unfolds within this single pre-writing moment. The clock is implicit but legible; time shapes the stance crystallization and charges the final image. High causal integration and closure linkage; the story's structure depends on this exact temporal frame.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To seed innovation within a constraint" is stated explicitly in paragraph five: "To seed innovation within a constraint demanded precision she no longer trusted herself to possess." The desire drives Mira's paralysis (fear of wrong words) and her final insight (constraints as "architecture of freedom"). Setup and closure framing are clear. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized in conflicted choices; we do not see Mira wrestle with competing desires in action. The friction between wanting perfect words and accepting imperfection is discussed but not enacted as a micro-choice with visible cost. Thematic presence with moderate closure linkage, but no on-page tradeoff moment. Mid-band for articulated stake without embodied conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Sustaining transformation" surfaces as Mira's core insight in paragraph ten: "Sustaining transformation. The phrase surfaced like bubbles from deep water." It shapes the thematic question (how to transform without breaking) and the closure tone (lake's "slow, inevitable thaw," change that "would never need to end"). Tone is consistent—reflective, elevated, meditative—and modulates subtly as Mira moves from paralysis to resolve. However, "sustaining transformation" also reads as prompt-label ventriloquism; the phrase is too neat, too close to the required element itself. The tone charges the final image and integrates across beats, but the on-page articulation of the theme diminishes its emergence as subtext. Strong thematic coherence with minor authenticity friction.</comment>
