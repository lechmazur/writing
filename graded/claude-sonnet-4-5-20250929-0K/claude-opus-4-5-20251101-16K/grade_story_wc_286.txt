<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira is given clear, character-specific interiority through her potter's lens ("centers clay… accepting the chaos"), and her motivation to understand fractures drives on-page choices. The work of sensing, kneeling, and throwing pots embodies agency. Minor slip: the final departure feels slightly inevitable rather than a choice with visible trade-off, but the stance crystallization—shouldering the wheel and seeking other fractures—reads as earned endurance with cost (leaving the oasis's layered possibility behind).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation is swift (who/where/when by the opening ridge descent). Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density builds through layered images (thrum, faded glass, phototropic leaves) and the closure reconfigures the oasis from wound to teacher via the potter's final act and departure. Closure form is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mira accepts contradiction, makes offerings, and walks back into the scorched world with the lantern glass and expanded mission. Cost is legible in the choice to leave rather than stay. One meaningful deepening (discovery of fractured timelines → throwing cracked pots → departure as itinerant fracture-seeker) tightens the dominant stake under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The oasis anchors early with vivid, selective detail (ash-colored earth, bleached hives, dust-thick cottage). The faded lantern glass functions as micro-setting, constraining perception and charging the final image when hung at Mira's belt. Phototropic vegetation and the thrum are specific to this place and pressure Mira's choices (kneeling, gathering clay). Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The chimney smoke and sun patterns guide both time and method, and the setting's contradiction (green against wasteland) mirrors the thematic question.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding why places resist change) is signaled early and tightens through discovery (glass reveals timelines) → embodied action (throwing cracked pots) → renunciation (departure). Agency is protagonist-driven: Mira chooses to kneel, throw, and leave offerings, altering her mission from single-site inquiry to itinerant practice. The cost is visible: she forgoes staying in the layered refuge and commits to seeking more fractures in the scorched world. One meaningful tightening (realizing the oasis holds contradiction → making vessels that do the same) suffices under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (holding contradiction without breaking) emerges organically from potter's practice, fractured timelines, and cracked vessels that seal under gentleness. The final image—Mira walking with the lantern glass and wheel—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the practice is portable, the spin seeks center everywhere. No moralizing; the questions posed by the vessels remain open. The oasis as metaphor for centering clay avoids allegory by grounding in tactile action. Subtext operates in silence (thrum, phototropic turn toward kindness) and the recurring wheel.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and the perceptual signature is character-specific: Mira filters the world through potter's craft (glazes, spin, centering). Diction remains consistent ("sharp gentleness," "thrum," "fractures") and voice modulates purposefully between observation and interiority. Psychic distance is controlled; reflection anchors in concrete stimuli (glass, clay, hives). One brief elision (teacher's fracture teaching) is referenced without disrupting momentum. No dialogue; internal voice is distinct and purposeful throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings differ; information density is high (most lines advance setting, character, or theme). Minor pattern slips: "She saw it… She saw it… She saw it" is functional but template-like in the glass-vision beat, and "Somewhere… Somewhere… Somewhere" at closure reads intentional but edges toward parallelism overuse. No paraphrase loops or stock phrasing; figurative language (glazes, spin, thrum) is consistent and voice-motivated. Clarity and propulsion remain strong; the loop check passes except for the noted parallelism, which serves cadence but risks mild repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of zen potter + fractured timelines + phototropic oasis is specific and non-obvious. The core conceit (places that hold all outcomes) transforms familiar post-apocalyptic and time-divergence tropes through embodied craft practice. The cracked pots that seal under gentleness offer a fresh inflection on kintsugi without naming it. Risk-taking in structure (reflection-heavy, minimal overt conflict) succeeds because the lens is taught early and closure lands. Transformation test passed: plot and arc would fail with generic protagonist or setting.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira (zen-minded potter) is present throughout; her potter's perception frames all beats. She makes three on-page choices: descending to the oasis, kneeling to press palms and understand, throwing pots with fractures, and leaving offerings before departure. The final choice (shouldering the wheel and seeking other fractures) is causally earned and alters her mission. Early signal, beat involvement (descent, kneeling, throwing, departure), and closure linkage (walks back with wheel and glass) all present. Cost is visible (leaving the oasis). The character's decisions create key turns under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Faded lantern glass is introduced mid-story (cottage table), used twice (holding it to see timelines, placing it before the wheel by starlight), and returns at closure (hung at her belt). The glass enables the pivotal perception (seeing three states) and charges the final image (she carries the lens forward). Early signal is late (second third), but beat involvement (vision, work, departure) and closure linkage are strong. Cost connection: the glass becomes tool for future fracture-seeking. Swappability is low (faded/clouded surface matters). Cap at mid-7s due to late intro; causal pressure and closure linkage elevate within that band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Fractured timelines are named and shown (glass reveals three states: lush, burning, abandoned). The concept shapes Mira's understanding and her choice to make cracked pots that hold contradiction. It drives one major turn (realization → throwing) and informs the final image ("All of it was true"). Early signal (teacher's "fractures" reference), development (glass vision), and payoff (pots and departure) all present. Causal pressure is moderate; the concept enables rather than constrains. Cost is conceptual (accepting contradiction). Specificity is high (timeline layering as glaze metaphor). Mid-band score: concept is essential to theme and closure but does not narrow options in a high-pressure beat.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Phototropic to kindness: vegetation turns toward Mira "not when she moved, but when she felt tenderness." The trait appears once (mid-story) and informs her kneeling choice but does not constrain later action or return at closure. Setup present, development weak (one beat), no closure participation. The trait is specific and memorable but swappable (any responsive-environment marker could serve). Cost connection is absent. Causal pressure is minimal. Mid-band cap applies (setup + development but no payoff ≤6.0); lyric resonance is insufficient to elevate.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Thrum: a vibration Mira hears on arrival, intensifies when she kneels, and implicitly continues as "the wheel hummed" during her work. Present in three beats (arrival, kneeling, throwing). Early signal, beat involvement, and implicit closure linkage (wheel hum echoes thrum). Causal role: the thrum prompts her to kneel and understand, which leads to the pot-making. Cost connection is indirect. Specificity is high (thrum as memory-of-bees or cross-timeline resonance). Swappability is moderate (any ambient sign could serve, but thrum is vivid). All three gates met; causal pressure is moderate; score in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>By following sun patterns: mentioned once ("following sun patterns as her teacher had taught—noting where light fell longest, where shadows suggested doorways"). The method appears in one beat (mid-story observation) and does not shape a key choice or return at closure. Setup is present (teacher reference), development is minimal (one observation), no payoff. The method is described but not used to solve a problem or enable a turn. Swappability is high. Functional but replaceable; cap at ~4.6 for missing closure participation, adjusted down slightly for ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Abandoned beekeeping oasis in scorched wasteland: setting is present from the opening and pressures every choice. The oasis supplies clay, thrum, glass, and the contradiction (green vs. wasteland) that drives Mira's inquiry. It constrains her work (gathering clay "from the oasis edge") and charges the final image (she leaves it to seek other fractures). Early signal, beat involvement across all major turns (descent, discovery, work, departure), and closure linkage (leaving the oasis is the cost). Causal pressure is strong; specificity is high (beekeeping oasis with hives, cottage, phototropic plants). Irreplaceable: the setting is the story's co-protagonist.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>As chimney smoke flattens: timeframe markers appear three times (opening "sun hung low… hour between," mid-story "smoke flattened further, spreading into night," closure "at dawn" and "morning, when chimney smoke rose sharp and straight"). Time anchors the work (throwing pots "by starlight") and structures the arc (arrival at dusk → work through night → departure at dawn). Setup, development, and payoff all present. Time does not tighten decisions under stress (no live clock threat) but does provide rhythm and closure cadence. Causal pressure is mild; the time window enables rather than constrains. Score in low-6s: all gates met, but time is atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>To understand why some places resist change: motivation is stated early ("She had come to understand why some places resist change") and drives Mira's descent, investigation (glass, kneeling), and final realization. The desire is dramatized through on-page action (sensing, throwing pots) and conflicted by the cost of leaving. The motivation shapes two major turns (investigation → understanding, understanding → itinerant practice) and informs the closure (expanding her mission). Early signal, beat involvement, and closure linkage all strong. Cost is visible (leaving the oasis). Specificity is high (this exact question ties to potter's practice). Friction: the motivation is more reflective than goal-pursuit under pressure, keeping it out of the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sharp gentleness: tone is coherent throughout, balancing precise observation ("ash-colored earth," "bleached white by years") with tender acceptance ("sharp gentleness," "heart soften"). The tone modulates under pressure (kneeling realization intensifies without melodrama) and charges the final image ("shouldered her wheel and walked back"). Syntax and diction support the tone (short declaratives, soft connectives, no histrionics). Consistency is high; the tone does not waver. Closure linkage is strong (tone pervades the final beat). Specificity: "sharp gentleness" is named once but enacted throughout. Score in mid-7s: tone is essential and well-executed but does not create a decisive pressure shift at closure.</comment>
