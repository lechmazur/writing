<question>1</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Mira's interiority is consistent and embodied—"weight of an ocean pressing," "dappled resolve strengthening"—and her shift from passive indexer to active truth-keeper is earned through the blackout's revelation. The "reclaimed stillness" moment credibly catalyzes her perceptual change, enabling the discovery of the stamp's purpose. Internal contradiction is present: she has lived seventeen years in mechanical rhythm without recognizing the drowning out of her own heartbeat, a credible professional blind spot. Minor slip: the final choice to write feels slightly telescoped; one more micro-hesitation or competing impulse would deepen the cost.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira crystallizes her purpose to document truth with visible cost—she may not survive, but she leaves a trail. The lens reads Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: the blackout enables algae glow → perceptual shift → stamp discovery → hypothesis pivot, then accumulates density toward the decision to write. Orientation is clean within the opening paragraph (who: Mira, where: Archives inside sunken city, when: blackout arrival). One meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes inconsistencies were intentional, narrowing her hypothesis and raising the stakes from clerical error to buried atrocity. Cost is felt in "If she survived…If she did not," though slightly implied rather than viscerally paid in the final beat.</comment>

<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The sunken library's pressurized dome, dormant bioluminescent algae, and antique stamp are anchored early and constrain choices: the blackout removes fluorescent glare, enabling new perception; the algae provide the "dappled" light that lets her notice layered pages. The toolkit and locked drawer seed the stamp's presence credibly. Spatial choreography is clear—Mira at her work station, algae behind glass walls, dome overhead—and the setting charges the final image: "Somewhere above, an ocean pressed down." Minor gap: the mechanics of the desalination pumps and generators are mentioned but never pressure a choice, reading as atmospheric padding rather than tactical constraint.</comment>

<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake—trace honest origins—is signaled early and tightens through one major reversal: the inconsistencies shift from assumed errors to intentional alterations, reweighting the entire archive and Mira's mission. The blackout functions as coincidental complication, not resolution; Mira's agency drives the discovery (noticing thickness, cross-referencing with "desperate precision"). Cost is legible: she may drown with the truth, and her choice to write forecloses the safer path of waiting for rescue. Pressure coheres under the Hybrid lens and escalates through the perceptual breakthrough. Minor wobble: the stamp's purpose is grasped instantly ("Now, holding it against a layered page, she understood") without a beat of confusion or failed attempt, slightly softening the escalation curve.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—truth buried by power, recovered by patient craft—emerges through particulars: the stamp's hidden trail, Mira's seventeen years of indexing, the algae's "ancient glow, indifferent to human tragedy." The final image answers the thematic question without moralizing: she presses the stamp to a fresh page and writes, becoming the next link in the chain of witnesses. "Reclaimed stillness" and "tranquilly perceptive" operate as grounded motifs rather than labels, charging the closure. No thematic echo or sermon; subtext operates in the parallels between the original betrayal and Mira's solitary vigil. The piece resists neat resolution—"If she survived…If she did not"—embracing meaningful ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>POV is stable third-limited, anchored to Mira's professional lexicon ("logical page indexer," "alternative hypothesis," "cross-referencing with desperate precision") and her perceptual signature: notice of mechanical rhythms, texture of pages, dappled light. Diction remains controlled, though phrases like "dappled resolve" and "tranquilly perceptive" edge toward prompt-fulfillment language that slightly strains naturalism. No head-hopping. Distance modulates purposefully: tighter during the discovery sequence, pulling back slightly in the final paragraph to achieve lyric resonance. Minor wobble: "she felt the weight of that trust settle across her shoulders" is a filter-verb construction that dulls immediacy in a peak moment; "the weight settled" would sharpen.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies well across the piece, with strong propulsion in the discovery sequence and lyric breath in the opening and closing. Information density is high—every paragraph advances knowledge or pressure. Minor loop: "The blackout arrived without warning" and "Every light extinguished simultaneously" restate the same event across adjacent sentences without added detail (paraphrase-loop check, −0.2). Template cadence surfaces briefly in the final third: "She did not know…What she knew…" and "If she survived…If she did not…" runs parallel stems across multiple beats, though the effect remains legible and voice-consistent (−0.3 cumulative). No major figurative muddle or register drift. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The sunken-library-archivist premise is familiar, but the stamp-as-hidden-trail device and the bioluminescent-algae catalyst provide a fresh synthesis. The blackout enabling perceptual breakthrough (darkness → old light → new sight) is a strong, non-obvious turn. Emotional specificity—Mira's seventeen-year deafness to machinery's heartbeat—grounds the revelation. Minor derivative note: the "lone scholar uncovers buried atrocity" template is visible, and the piece does not fully transform it; the stamp mechanism and algae detail elevate but don't fundamentally disrupt the arc. Risk is present in the quiet, open ending and the refusal to dramatize rescue or doom, trusting resonance over spectacle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Character "logical page indexer" signals early, shapes the middle discovery (noticing thickness, cross-referencing, hypothesis pivot), and is present in the closure decision to "properly catalog" and write. Her training enables the perceptual breakthrough and the methodical proof-building. Three beats, causal pressure, closure linkage. Specific cost: her logic finally serves "its highest purpose," reweighting her seventeen years of work.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Object "antique ink stamp" appears in beat one (discovered three weeks ago), beat two (held against layered page, reveals purpose), beat three (picked up, pressed to fresh page at closure). Three-beat involvement, causal (unlocks the trail), closure linkage (she uses it to write). Irreplaceable: the circle-within-triangle seal is the key to the hidden system. Minor cap: introduced "three weeks ago" in reflection rather than on-page discovery, slightly weakening setup immediacy.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Concept "reclaimed stillness" is named early ("allowing herself to feel what she could only describe as reclaimed stillness"), shapes middle perception (the quietness lets her notice thickness, work differently), and charges the final paragraph ("She had spent seventeen years…Tonight…she had finally found something"). Three-gate coverage. Causal: the stillness enables discovery. Closure linkage: "tranquilly perceptive" and "reclaimed stillness" frame the ending. Moderate deduction: the phrase trends lyric-label rather than enacted constraint; the silence does the work, "reclaimed stillness" names it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Attribute "tranquilly perceptive" appears twice as a label ("tranquilly perceptive in ways the fluorescent lights had never allowed," "tranquilly perceptive, her hands steady") but does not demonstrably constrain or enable a distinct choice with cost. The perception shift is dramatized through noticing thickness and the stamp's function, yet "tranquilly perceptive" itself reads as descriptor rather than lever. Lyric reprise at closure, but ornamental. Setup + closure only, missing middle development as active trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Action "readjust" is explicit and central: "Mira had to readjust everything she thought she knew." It triggers the major turn from error-hypothesis to intentional-alteration, driving all subsequent beats (cross-referencing, documenting, decision to write). Causal pressure high, closure linked (her index becomes a counter-narrative). Irreplaceable: swapping to "reconsider" or "revise" would weaken the totality of the cognitive shift. Three-beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Method "alternative hypothesis" is named early ("Her original hypothesis…But an alternative hypothesis emerged"), shapes the middle reasoning (cross-referencing stamped pages, reading them together), and justifies the closure decision (complete the index as counter-evidence). Two-beat involvement, causal, closure-relevant. Specific mechanics: hypothesis testing through stamp-matching and pattern recognition. Minor deduction: the method is professional idiom rather than irreplaceable; "new theory" or "revised reading" would function similarly with edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>Setting "forgotten library inside a sunken city" is established in the opening line, pressures every beat (ocean overhead, dome, pumps failing, algae behind glass), and charges the closure image ("Somewhere above, an ocean pressed down. Somewhere below, buried in forgotten manuscripts, truth waited"). The setting supplies the blackout as complication and the bioluminescent algae as resource. Three-gate, high causal involvement, closure indispensable. Irreplaceable: the underwater pressure and burial metaphor are structural.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Timeframe "during the blackout" is the inciting pressure, tightens every choice (emergency power nonexistent, rescue uncertain, pumps may not restart), and frames the closure urgency ("She did not know how long the blackout would last"). Live clock without explicit countdown. Three-gate, causal (blackout enables algae glow and removes distraction), closure-shaping (survival uncertain). Cost tied to time: she may run out. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Motivation "to trace honest origins" is signaled early ("she had been trying to trace honest origins for months"), drives the middle discovery (hunting inconsistencies, testing the stamp hypothesis), and culminates in the closure decision to document and carry truth to the surface or leave a trail. Three-beat involvement, causal, closure-critical. Visible cost: she risks death to complete the index. Friction between want (truth) and survival is present but slightly muted; one more moment of temptation to abandon the work would sharpen.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Tone "dappled resolve" appears as a phrase once ("dappled resolve strengthening") and is enacted through the "dappled and shifting" algae light and Mira's steady final actions. The tone modulates from disorientation (blackout) to perceptual calm to determined purpose. Coherent through turns, charges the final image with "hands steady in the reclaimed stillness." Setup + closure; lyric reprise functional. Deduction: "dappled resolve" as phrase trends ornamental; the tone work is done by "tranquilly perceptive" and the light imagery, with "dappled resolve" as a late label summarizing rather than driving.</comment>
