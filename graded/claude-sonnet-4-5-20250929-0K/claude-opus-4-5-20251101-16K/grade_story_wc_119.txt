<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mei Lin's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with clear professional identity as a former operative turned fortune writer. The accidental prophecy trait creates genuine internal tension, and her final self-directed fortune shows contradictory awareness. However, the piece leans heavily on reflective summary rather than dramatized micro-choices under pressure; the night's work unfolds without on-page resistance or trade-offs that would test her values in real time.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with lyric elements. Orientation anchors cleanly (lighthouse keeper, post-midnight work session). The closure attempts Conceptual Repricing via the self-written fortune and lighthouse metaphor, but the cost remains abstract—she writes one more fortune for herself, a gesture without visible foreclosure or tactical consequence. The midpoint reflections on accidental prophecy deepen texture but don't tighten options or produce a decisive on-page turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting is vivid and purposeful: the beam's rotation becomes a recurring time-marker and thematic anchor, the lamp room frames her dual work, and the rocky isolation underscores her fixed-point metaphor. Sensory detail is selective (rice paper, magnifying loupe, waterproof case) and filtered through professional routine. The setting charges the final image effectively, meeting the 9+ gate's constraint test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear—encoding intelligence while maintaining accidental moral impact—but pressure remains static throughout. No reversal or tightening occurs; she completes twenty-three fortunes without friction, complication, or trade-off. The retrospective examples (suicidal man, job offers) are told rather than dramatized, and the present work proceeds smoothly. One meaningful escalation or choice-point that narrows options is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the lighthouse-as-dual-beacon conceit: codes become prayers, lies become truths, fixed points mean different things to different travelers. The "open secrets" motif (surveillance specs known to all yet circulating in shadow) integrates well with her personal enigma. The final fortune avoids overt moralizing and leaves resonance through image. Subtext operates effectively in the microdot/fortune pairing and the beam's patient rotation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled; psychic distance modulates purposefully between close interiority and distant observation. Diction fits the intelligence-analyst background ("assets," "extraction," "threat assessments") without register clash. The perceptual signature—dry, cataloging, metaphor-aware—is consistent. Minor issue: some reflective passages edge toward essay voice ("This was the familiar enigma of her existence") rather than embodied thought under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with purposeful rhythm and strong clarity. Information density is high in the microdot paragraph and fortune examples. However, several scaffold patterns appear: "She had been many things" / "She had been accidentally prophetic"; "The beam swept past" / "The great beam above her continued"; metaphor stacking in the transposition paragraph without fresh vehicles. Template cadence in the resolution sequence ("Tomorrow it would mean nothing. Or everything.") feels algorithmic. No loops directly obscure closure, but cumulative artifacts lower momentum slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse-keeper-as-fortune-writer premise is fresh and the dual-current metaphor (cold river of espionage, warm tide of hope) feels earned. The "open secrets" integration—surveillance tech circulating as known-yet-unacknowledged—offers a non-obvious angle on spy-trade material. The accidental prophecy complication transforms the stock "retired spy" trope. Risk is present in the lyric closure and the refusal to dramatize a confrontation, though the piece stays safely within contemplative literary mode.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mei Lin is present throughout and her choices (encoding fortunes, writing the final self-fortune) frame the piece. However, her decisions don't create reversals or alter tactics; she executes routine work without friction. Early setup is strong, middle development is passive (reflective rather than choice-driven), and the ending gesture (folding the fortune into her pocket) is present but low-stakes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The microdot film specs appear early (setup), drive the encoding work (middle beat), and are implicitly present in the mailing decision (closure participation). Two distinct beats: receiving from the fisherman, encoding the fortunes. However, the specs themselves are handled generically—sealed case, surveillance equipment—without unique properties that constrain her method or shape the final image beyond their thematic function.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Open secrets structure the entire premise: surveillance tech "known to all intelligence services but never acknowledged," circulating while "diplomats smiled for cameras." The concept shapes her encoding choices (what to hide, what's already visible) and charges the thematic layer. Three beats: microdot arrival, fortune encoding, final self-reflection. The ending reweights it by making her own dual nature an open secret to herself.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Accidentally prophetic trait is seeded early and recurs in three examples (job offers, lovers, suicidal man at crossroads). It creates internal tension ("she'd stopped keeping count") and the final fortune tests whether she can prophesy for herself. However, the examples are summarized rather than dramatized on the page, and no visible cost or constraint emerges from the trait during the present action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orchestrate appears as verb choice throughout: "orchestrating safe passage," "orchestrating more than intelligence now," the beam "orchestrating" ship flow. The action frames her work method but doesn't drive a key turn; it's more thematic gloss than plot engine. Easily swappable with "coordinate," "guide," or "direct" without structural loss. Present in setup and ending, but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Directing flow is mentioned in the opening (lighthouse "directing flow of ships") and echoed in the orchestration language, but the mechanics never matter on the page. Her actual method—encoding via fortune text—is distinct from "directing flow." The means appears as metaphor rather than dramatized process. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mysterious lighthouse on a rocky island is established in the opening line and threaded throughout: spiral stairs, lamp room, beam rotation as time-marker, the isolation that enables covert work, rowing to mainland for mailing. It pressures her existence (fixed point, visible yet misunderstood) and the final "became the lighthouse herself" image crystallizes theme. Essential across three beats and the ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>After last orders is signaled in the opening and repeated in the penultimate paragraph ("After last orders, in the quietest hours"). The time frame enables her covert work (village emptied, road silent) and creates the liminal atmosphere. However, no ticking clock or time pressure shapes her choices; the work simply occurs during night hours. Functional for tone, but doesn't tighten decisions.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>To transpose life into a new key is explicitly stated midway ("She had wanted to transpose life into a new key") and recurs in the "minor chords of betrayal" metaphor. It motivates her career shift and informs her dissatisfaction with playing "both melodies simultaneously." The desire is present but more told than dramatized; no on-page choice directly enacts or costs her this transposition during the present action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Familiar enigma tone is sustained throughout: the doubled meanings (fortune/code, lies/truths, light/darkness), the patient lighthouse rhythm, the neither-threatening-nor-triumphant close. Tone modulates subtly—dry professionalism during the encoding, lyric reflection in the transposition passage, quiet resolve in the final fortune. The ending crystallizes the enigma without resolving it, charging the image effectively.</comment>
