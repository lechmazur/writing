<question>1</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Elena's interiority is specific and embodied through her professional lens ("cataloguing the ancient wounds"), and the sand grain micro-choice carries weight. However, the final choice to witness and document reads more as observation than agency under pressure—she arrives already committed, executes without meaningful internal conflict, and the "soft, almost golden" melancholy at closure feels aesthetically calibrated rather than contradictory. The professional-personal tension (career dedication vs. personal inheritance) exists but never forces a dramatized trade-off that would elevate the ending.</comment>

<question>2</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Orientation anchors cleanly by the second paragraph (who, where, when). The accumulative lens holds: photosensitive paper, sitting through darkness, dawn arrival, and final departure form a coherent arc. Closure qualifies as Charged Poise—the crater remains whole for one last morning, she has borne witness, and the cost (impending erasure, her solitary vigil) is legible on the page. The tightening from moonlit arrival to dawn's cresting is clear, though the stakes never shift tactics or narrow options within the vigil itself.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The moonlit summit, photosensitive paper, and dawn light constrain her method and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through professional attention ("silver and shadow," "thin air," "cold stone"). The crater's ancient depth and the mining consortium's arrival anchor temporal pressure. Micro-setting (her equipment, the sand grain vial, the papers laid in a grid) functions as both tool and symbolic recursion without becoming ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—preserving the crater's final hours—is signaled early and sustained. The tightening occurs once: laying photosensitive paper is the committed act, and dawn's arrival completes the record. However, Elena's agency operates primarily as execution of a pre-formed plan; no on-page reversal or complication tests her resolve. The cost (solitude, melancholy, the crater's erasure) is visible but arrives as a condition she endures rather than a price extracted by a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges through the hourglass grain, the chemical-reaction method, and the crater-as-archive motif: witnessing as temporal rebellion, measurement vs. forgetting. The final image ("she had been there to see it") offers resonance without stated moral. Yet "small rebellions against entropy" and "particular sadness of witnessing endings" veer toward abstraction and gentle philosophizing that slightly undercuts the earned particulars. The space-age frame and nightwatch inheritance provide thematic texture, though the nightwatch parallel is more poetic than structurally generative.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>POV distance is stable; Elena's perceptual signature (professional cataloguing, temporal reverence) is consistent and voice-specific. Diction stays within her lexicon ("dawning hush," "epochs," "reverence") without jarring register shifts. The photosensitive-paper beat and hourglass-grain recursion anchor thought in present stimuli. Minor slip: "the dawning hush deepened, that impossible silence before the world remembered how to breathe" repeats the hush concept within two sentences, a small loop that doesn't obscure but slightly dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>Prose is clear, rhythmically controlled, and free of major artifacts. Sentence variety supports the contemplative pacing. Information density is high in the photosensitive-paper setup and the hourglass backstory. Small deductions: "dawning hush" appears three times with similar phrasing ("the dawning hush began to settle," "the dawning hush deepened"), creating a minor template echo. The line "small rebellions against entropy" and "the particular sadness" lean slightly toward stock phrasing. No loops obscure causality, and the final image is propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The photosensitive-paper method and the hourglass-grain inheritance offer specific, non-obvious synthesis. The crater-inspector premise is fresh, and the space-age frame provides temporal irony. However, the emotional arc (melancholic witness to impending loss) follows a familiar template, and the resolution—she documents, she witnesses, she leaves—feels predetermined rather than transformed by on-page pressure. The timed-message career detail is inventive but underused in the closure; it appears as background rather than a live constraint that shapes the final choice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>6.2</grade>
<comment>Elena's role frames the entire piece and drives the photographic mission. However, her "choices" are execution of a pre-formed plan rather than on-page decisions under friction; she arrives committed, lays the papers, waits, and departs. The crater-inspector identity enriches setting and theme but does not force a turn. Present across all beats, shapes closure participation, but lacks mid-story agency that would push higher.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>The sand grain appears three times (breast pocket, held between fingers, pocketed at end) and carries thematic weight (time measured, inheritance, witnessing). It reweights the hourglass/nightwatch motif at closure. However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—it remains symbolic rather than causally active. Lyric reprise qualifies it for mid-band, but absence of functional pressure caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>4.1</grade>
<comment>"Dawning hush" is named three times and described ("that particular silence," "impossible silence"). It sets tone and anchors the temporal transition, but it does not shape stakes or alter Elena's options—she waits regardless. The concept enriches atmosphere without constraining action; it operates as theme echo rather than tactical element. Functional presence but replaceable with "pre-dawn silence" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>"Purposefully curious" is named twice (opening, near end) and shown through her career of "digging deeper" and "outlast the darkness itself." It motivates her presence but does not constrain an on-page choice with visible cost—she arrives already curious, executes her plan, and departs. The trait enriches voice and backstory but lacks a moment where curiosity forces a trade-off or narrows options under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>"Outlast" structures the entire vigil: outlasting darkness, outlasting forgetting, being present through the night. The word appears explicitly ("outlast the darkness itself," "outlast that forgetting") and drives the temporal stake—she must remain until dawn. The final paragraph confirms success ("she had been there to see it"). This action defines the challenge and the closure, though it operates more as endurance than decisive turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Chemical reactions for timed messages appear in backstory (warnings in dew, color-change signals) and structure the photosensitive-paper method that will "develop itself over hours." The method is signaled early, used on the page (laying treated papers), and shapes the temporal tactic (capturing transition, not a single moment). However, the outcome is described rather than shown developing, and the method does not face friction or alter mid-course. Strong setup and development; closure participation is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The moonlit summit provides spatial anchor, access to the crater view, altitude ("thin air"), and tactical advantage for the photographic grid. It pressures her physically (cold stone, scree climb) and enables the final witness. The setting is present early, shapes the method (papers on the rim), and charges the dawn image. Environment constrains her body and her method, meeting the high-band test for micro-setting that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>5.1</grade>
<comment>"During the space age" frames the piece and provides thematic irony (crater inspectors are rare, satellites blink overhead). It appears in the opening and closing, enriching context. However, it does not tighten decisions or create a live clock—the six-hour/six-month/six-year countdown is mentioned but does not alter Elena's tactics on the page. The timeframe is atmospheric and thematic but not mechanically active in escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The desire to photograph "the last of something precious" is named early, dramatized through the photosensitive-paper preparation, and sustained through the vigil. It drives her presence and her method. Friction exists (melancholy, the crater's impending erasure) and is felt at closure. However, the motivation is never conflicted—she arrives resolved and executes without wavering. Strong setup, clear cost, but lacks internal friction that would push into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Melancholy is named ("the melancholy that settled over her was soft, almost golden") and embodied through the vigil's solitude and the crater's final wholeness. The tone modulates from moonlit reverence to dawn's arrival and remains coherent. "Dawnlit" reads in the final paragraph's light imagery. However, the tone descriptor feels applied rather than emergent from pressure, and the "soft, almost golden" phrasing edges toward aesthetic calibration rather than cost-driven emotion.</comment>
