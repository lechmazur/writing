<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's reluctance to descend and her ritual use of tools embody a competent caretaker whose choices are constrained by the curse. Internal conflict surfaces in her determination to save strangers while protecting them from inheriting her burden, and the final tableau of waiting among cursed trees carries earned endurance with visible cost. The backstory about fifteen years learning the blueprint's logic anchors her expertise without pausing action. Minor limitation: her emotional register remains consistent but could show more contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The story operates under a Causal lens with accumulative texture: Maren's decision to descend is motivated by the frost deadline, her method is established through the blueprint's logic, and the closure—her return to the orchard with three saved lives and continuing curse—lands with felt cost. The orientation is swift (orchard, curse, labyrinth) and the single-scene descent with flashback anchors holds spatial coherence. One meaningful tightening occurs when she assembles the final marker at the seven-path junction, reweighting the travelers' fate. The cost is legible in the final image: "tomorrow the orchard would demand its due," an Earned Stasis that forecloses escape.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cliffside labyrinth with mechanical birds supplies a vivid, purposeful environment that constrains Maren's path and charges the ending image with "brass feathers ringing like distant bells." Sensory detail is selective—copper-scented fruit, moss-covered walls, frost crystals—and filtered through Maren's practitioner priorities. The nut's warmth and the blueprint's yellowed edges function as micro-setting objects that constrain her method and guide action. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the descent and marker placement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—guide travelers before frost—is signaled early and tightens through the six-hour clock and Maren's careful marker placements. Escalation is causal: her descent costs "time she needed for the trees, warmth she couldn't spare," and the final assembly at the seven-path junction narrows options to one correct path. Agency is decision and renunciation; she withdraws without revealing herself to avoid binding them to the curse. The resolution is earned by her expertise and sacrifice, with visible cost in the orchard's continuing demand.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the curse-as-inheritance motif and Maren's choice to bear it alone, refusing to pass the burden. The nut carrying "seed-memory from before the blight" and the forgotten blueprint's underlying logic anchor the piece in concrete particulars rather than abstractions. The final image—hands "still smelling of the small nut's peculiar hope"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of endurance and cost without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and silence: Maren's method of "leaving impressions without touching" embodies her renunciation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and controlled, with Maren's perceptual signature evident in phrases like "offhandedly exact ghost" and "graceless beauty." Diction remains within her lexicon—practitioner-specific without academic drift—and psychic distance modulates purposefully between close interiority and the labyrinth's broader tableau. The prose carries a distinct texture in word choice ("copper and regret," "sculptures of terror") and rhythm that reflects her focused, solitary mindset. No dialogue appears, which fits the story's isolation and her method of non-contact guidance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Rhythm varies naturally with no template cadence, and figurative language ("rot through stone," "maze's throat") is purposeful without overwriting. Minor scaffold appears in "She gathered her tools" followed by a list, but it's functional exposition. The opening line anchors voice and stakes cleanly, and the final line recharges the nut motif with "peculiar hope." No loops, paraphrase cycles, or filter-verb stacks detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of cursed orchard, mechanical labyrinth, and self-imposed isolation offers a fresh angle on the reluctant savior trope. The "forgotten blueprint" and "leaving impressions without touching" method are specific, non-obvious choices that shape tactics and theme. Risk-taking is evident in the piece's commitment to a solitary protagonist with no dialogue and an Earned Stasis closure that refuses rescue from the burden. The mechanical birds and seed-memory nut feel integrated rather than ornamental, and the emotional truth of endurance without hope of escape avoids generic templates.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren as reluctant orchard caretaker frames the story, drives the descent decision, and anchors the closure image. Her reluctance ("had not asked to inherit") is dramatized through cost ("every descent cost her something"), and her final return with continuing curse demonstrates Earned Stasis. The character participates in setup, middle descent, and ending tableau with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The small nut appears in three beats: gathering from the tree (warmth established), placement at the junction (glows with memory), and the final line (hands smelling of "peculiar hope"). Its specific property—containing "seed-memory from before the blight"—enables the marker assembly and charges the closure. Causal and irreplaceable; removing it would collapse the guidance method.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The forgotten blueprint shapes Maren's expertise ("fifteen years learning to read its underlying logic") and guides her marker placements. It appears in setup, informs the middle action ("the mathematics had to be perfect"), and enables the final assembly where "the labyrinth remembered what it was supposed to be." Causal pressure is clear: without it, she cannot navigate or mark the shifting maze.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Offhandedly exact" describes her marker placement method ("three fingerwidths from each corner, exactly seventeen steps") and appears in the phrase "offhandedly exact ghost." The trait constrains her work—precision is required or "the labyrinth would swallow her signs whole"—but the cost is implicit rather than dramatized as a tradeoff in a peak beat. Present in setup and middle; linked to closure success.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Assembling the final marker at the seven-path junction is the story's climactic turn: Maren arranges the nut and discs, the path illuminates, and the travelers escape. This action is prepared by prior marker-laying beats and directly enables the closure. The assembly beat redefines the travelers' options from "all identical, all wrong except one" to a glowing correct path. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Leaving impressions without touching" is signaled early ("to do so would bind them to the curse"), demonstrated in the middle (brass rod arrows, copper disc circles), and thematically charges the ending where she withdraws "into the shadows" as they follow her markers. The method shapes all her tactics, constrains her approach, and embodies the theme of solitary burden. Present across all three gates with causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cliffside labyrinth patrolled by mechanical birds supplies the dominant constraint: the birds track Maren but threaten strangers, the maze's shifted walls demand the blueprint's logic, and the frost deadline creates urgency. Setting participates in setup, middle pressure (seven-path junction), and ending image (birds settling as frost forms). Environment alters tactics and charges the final tableau.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The six-hour frost deadline is established early ("the night frost would form in six hours"), tightens Maren's choices during the descent ("the descent took an hour"), and lands in the closure ("the sky purpled toward frost," "first ice crystals formed"). Time pressure is legible and shapes urgency, though the exact clock is not tracked beat-by-beat. Present in setup, middle, and ending.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Maren's motivation to guide lost travelers is dramatized through her reluctant descent despite cost, her careful marker work, and her withdrawal to avoid binding them. Internal conflict surfaces in "every descent cost her something" yet she goes anyway. The motivation drives the central action, is tested by the curse's price, and anchors the Earned Stasis closure. Friction between desire to save and cost to self is palpable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Graceless beauty" is introduced with the mechanical birds ("lovely in the way a blade is lovely: precise, cold, indifferent") and reprised in the ending image ("graceless and beautiful in the dying light"). The tone of solitary competence amid decay is coherent throughout, modulates with the descent's urgency, and charges the final tableau where beauty and curse coexist. The oxymoric tone reweights the premise at closure.</comment>
