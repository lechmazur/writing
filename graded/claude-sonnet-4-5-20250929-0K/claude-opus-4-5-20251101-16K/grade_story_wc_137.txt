<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elena's arc from skeptic to attendant is clearly motivated, with embodied contradictions ("courageously kind" translated into concrete witnessing rather than dismissal). Her decision to transcribe despite exhaustion shows cost and value hierarchy. However, interiority occasionally drifts toward abstracting states rather than showing them through micro-choices under pressure ("she understood something her skepticism had always resisted" tells rather than dramatizes the shift).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Elena transforms the tower into a "library of souls" and commits to continuing the work, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with visible cost (weeks of emotional labor, exhaustion). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pattern and density build toward a cadence shift in the final image. One meaningful deepening occurs when she understands the tile as a resonance device, narrowing her options from skepticism to witness. Cost is legible in "worked through exhaustion" and the choice to continue despite the whales' departure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tower setting constrains choice: its archive provides the journals, its pedestal holds the tile, and its open platform frames both whales and stars as witnesses to Elena's work. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (whale songs "too low for human ears," obsidian glass, coastal cliffs). The body and tile function as micro-setting that charges the final image when she picks up her pen.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—honoring entangled memories—is signaled early and tightens through Elena's commitment despite exhaustion. One meaningful turn occurs when she picks up the tile a second time and "let the memories come," a decision that forecloses retreat and commits her to the transcription work. The whale migration provides a visible deadline that increases pressure as "their songs growing distant." Agency is clear: her choice to transcribe carries on-page cost (weeks, exhaustion, emotional labor).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: attention and transcription as acts of care, memory as a shared inheritance requiring witness. The final image—"ready to sculpt space for whatever memories might come"—reweights the opening skepticism without moralizing. However, the closing paragraph edges toward explicit statement ("Some truths don't require belief. They only require attention") rather than letting the image carry full weight. The tile and whale migration function as thematic anchors without becoming heavy-handed.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person close, with perceptual signature rooted in Elena's scientific skepticism ("a sympathetic skeptic, cataloguing phenomena"). Diction remains controlled and purposeful, modulating effectively between technical precision (neural frequencies, geometry) and lyric compression ("unheard symphony," "library of souls"). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The grandmother's voice in the journal entry is distinct and anchored in concrete stimulus.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean with strong rhythm and varied syntax. Information density is high: most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or conflict. Minor issues: "courageously kind, her grandmother's phrase" is slightly hedged exposition; "She still didn't call it magic" in the penultimate section is a small paraphrase loop of earlier framing. No muddy metaphors or template cadence. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharge motifs effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of grief-work, memory technology, and constellation mapping through a magic square offers a fresh angle. The tile as "resonance device, tuned to human consciousness through geometry" transforms the trope beyond fairy-tale magic. However, the frame (skeptic learns to honor mystery) and the grandmother's tower archive lean toward familiar templates. The emotional calculus and specific world logic elevate execution above derivative, but the core arc remains recognizable.</comment>
