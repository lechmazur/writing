<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ezra's motivation is coherent—escape inherited disbelief—but his interiority tilts abstract ("sins heavy enough to warrant return," "legacy...stillborn into a world"). The piece establishes his contradiction (truthful son of a liar) yet the final choice feels inevitable rather than contested; no on-page moment forces him to weigh staying against fleeing. Embodied emotion is sparse; the copperlight and mirror work harder than Ezra's body or gesture. The backstory about the father anchors motive but occupies ~15% without altering a present micro-choice until the confessional speech begins.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Ezra steps through, sealing the labyrinth behind him, foreclosing return with conceptual cost—mainland will tell the wrong story forever. The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens by midpoint (copperlight→amber→bronze, mirror logic, hush as accretion) and holds it through the ending image. Orientation anchors who/where/when by ~80 words. One tightening occurs when the lattice hovers and carves clarity, narrowing Ezra's path to the final threshold. Cost is conceptual and legible: he becomes vanished, his story unheard in the mainland world, paying with permanent exile to gain belief elsewhere.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse-prison on jagged reef, chapel, lower cells, and mirror-salt labyrinth are vividly anchored. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly: spiral corridors, narrow door, descent to core. The confessional lattice (an object functioning as micro-setting tool) constrains choice—it casts geometric shadows that "bend the labyrinth's logic" and hovers ahead, carving pathways. The copperlight→amber→bronze color shift modulates with descent, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective (salt-crusted windows, wet stone, scuff-worn threshold) and filtered through Ezra's urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: escape the narrative cage before investigators' bodies are found. One meaningful tightening occurs when the lattice begins to hover and Ezra's confessions ("I am not my father," "I have never lied") open corridors, narrowing options to one final threshold. The timeframe (before dawn boats arrive) applies distant pressure but does not visibly alter tactics on the page. Agency is present—Ezra speaks truth into the hush and steps through—but the labyrinth's acceptance feels assured rather than contested. Cost is conceptual (permanent exile, mainland misnarrative) and legible in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—inherited accusation versus earned identity—emerges through Ezra's father's wolf-cry legacy, the confessional lattice as architectural confession, and the hush as space where "words are weighed before judgment." The ending offers a non-literal answer: Ezra gains belief by abandoning the world that refused it, reweighting the premise with visible exile cost. No overt moralizing; the final image (labyrinth sealing, copperlight streaming through salt windows) resonates without stating a thesis. Subtext operates in "the boy whose truths arrived stillborn," the scuff-worn threshold as prior passage, and the mainland's inevitable false story.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; psychic distance is close and consistent. Perceptual signature is present but muted—Ezra notices scuffs, copperlight warmth, geometric shadows—yet diction occasionally drifts elevated ("sustained impossibilities," "sacred space between words") in a way that reads slightly above the focalizer's established idiom under peak stress. The confessional speeches ("I am not my father") feel voice-motivated and legible. Syntax modulates with emotional intensity: short declaratives during confession, longer suspended clauses during labyrinth descent. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the labyrinth descent (mirrors, lattice mechanics, color shifts). However, minor loops appear: "chasing the hush" / "toward the hush" / "into the hush" across three paragraphs; "finally" appears twice in the final two paragraphs without reweighting. The phrase "sustained impossibilities" recurs without added pressure. Figurative language is controlled and apt ("finger pointing accusation," "truths arrived stillborn"), though "copperlight" and "hush" carry symbolic weight without overt forcing. No major clarity breaks, but synonym churn ("stillborn...disbelief," "legacy...accusations") edges toward paraphrase in the opening. One template stem: "They would find...would find" in adjacent clauses.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse-prison, confessional architecture, and inherited-liar premise feels specific and non-obvious. The labyrinth where "confessions take architectural form" and the lattice as both key and truth-caster are fresh applications of familiar elements. The wolf-boy backstory risks cliché but is transformed through the "stillborn truth" conceit and the hush as willing silence. Tone (copperlight repose) coheres and modulates, charging the ending image. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows implications (three unexplained bodies, Ezra's permanent vanishing) without hedging. Risk-taking in the mirror-salt logic and the quiet, exile-paid closure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ezra (cry-wolf boy's son) is present throughout and his inherited-liar legacy shapes the dominant stake. Setup is immediate (opening paragraphs). Development: his decision to chase the hush and confess through the lattice (~middle third) alters tactics. Closure: he steps through the threshold, sealing his choice with permanent exile. His choices (prying the lattice, speaking confessions, stepping through) create the key turns. Not ornamental; the premise would collapse without this exact character. Causal pressure is moderate—his identity constrains options—but the labyrinth's mechanics do equal work.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The confessional lattice is introduced early (first third), handled in two distinct beats (pried from booth, held before labyrinth), and returns with reweighted meaning when it hovers and casts geometric shadows that "bend the labyrinth's logic." Setup, development (opens corridors via shadow geometry), and payoff (settles against the final door) all present. Removal would break the mechanics of Ezra's passage and the architectural-confession conceit. Causal pressure is strong; cost is tied (lattice as key to exile). Specific properties (crosshatched wood, shadow-casting) matter and are irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Chasing the hush" is introduced early and frames Ezra's goal. The hush is described as "absence of accusation...sacred space...where a man's voice was taken at its weight alone." Setup clear; development occurs when Ezra descends toward the hush and speaks into it (~middle to end). Payoff: the hush "welcomed him...as a man speaking truth." The concept shapes stakes (finding a listener) but does not constrain tactics on the page—Ezra's path feels assured once he enters the labyrinth. Swappability is moderate; "sanctuary" or "belief" could replace "hush" with minor edits. One causal link (hush accepts confessions) but no visible friction or cost tied uniquely to the hush itself.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Sustains impossibilities" is introduced early ("This place sustained impossibilities") and demonstrated: investigators die without cause, the lattice hovers, mirrors bend logic. Setup and development present. Payoff: the labyrinth seals "keeping its impossibilities close." The attribute enables Ezra's passage (hover, mirror corridors) and constrains the mainland (bodies without explanation). Causal work is present but the attribute feels closer to setting-rule than character-trait-with-tradeoff. Removal would require rewriting the labyrinth mechanics, suggesting moderate irreplaceability. Cost connection is indirect—impossibility permits exile, but no on-page trade-off tied uniquely to "sustaining" is dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Hover" is introduced mid-piece ("The confessional lattice began to hover") and marks a key turn: the lattice is "lifted...by whatever forces the lighthouse sustained," drifting ahead "like a lantern casting...clarity, carving through the maze's deceptions." This action enables the final approach to the door. Setup is late (~50% mark), development immediate (carving pathways), payoff present (settles against door). Removing hover would require rewriting the lattice's mechanics and Ezra's passage method. Causal pressure is moderate; the hover is specific but not the sole means. Swappability is low—"float" or "drift" are synonyms, but the exact term matters less than the weightless-key conceit.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Through the scuffs on a narrow door left ajar for decades" is signaled early ("scuffs on a narrow door...grooves into the threshold...hung open just wide enough"). Ezra follows the scuffs in the first third. Development: he passes through the door twice (entering the labyrinth, then the final threshold beyond). Payoff: "stepped through the scuff-worn threshold one final time." Setup, development, and closure all present. The method shapes his route (follows prior passage) and the scuffs imply others have fled before, adding thematic weight. Causal work is moderate—scuffs guide but do not constrain. Specificity is high (decades-worn grooves), but removal would require only minor rewrites (e.g., "followed marks").</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lighthouse prison on jagged reef is introduced in the opening line and anchors throughout. Setup immediate. Development: the abandoned chapel, lower cells (bodies), spiral corridors, and mirror-salt labyrinth all constrain Ezra's path and supply the mechanics (confession architecture, impossibility-sustaining space). Payoff: "copperlight of morning streaming through salt-crusted windows" in the final lines. The setting enables the entire closure (labyrinth as escape route, reef isolation as timeframe pressure). Removal would collapse the story. Causal pressure is strong; the lighthouse's decommissioned-yet-active state and its labyrinth are irreplaceable. Two-gate minimum met; all three present.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Before they find the bodies" is introduced early ("bodies...in the lower cells," "find the bodies by morning," "mainland boat would return"). Setup clear. Development: the timeframe motivates Ezra's urgency ("Before that happened, he needed to chase the hush"). Payoff: "dawn would bring boats and uniforms." The clock is stated but not dramatized—no on-page moments where time visibly narrows options or forces faster choices. The timeframe shapes motive but does not alter tactics; Ezra's labyrinth passage unfolds at meditative pace. Swappability is moderate; any external discovery deadline would serve. Cost is conceptual (permanent misnarrative) but not tied uniquely to the time pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To thread a labyrinth with your own story" is introduced mid-piece ("thread this labyrinth with his own story, to finally speak words that something, somewhere, would believe"). Setup ~40% mark; late but within tolerance. Development: Ezra's confessions ("I am not my father," "I have never lied") enact the threading. Payoff: "Ezra's story—finally, impossibly—would be his own to tell." The motivation drives the confessions and the final threshold crossing. Desire is dramatized through speech-acts that open corridors, showing friction between inherited accusation and earned belief. Cost is legible (exile to gain listener). Swappability is low—"escape," "find belief," or "speak truth" are close but lack the labyrinth-threading specificity.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Copperlight repose" as tone is introduced early ("copperlight from the dying sun") and recurs with color modulation ("softened to amber, then bronze"). Setup immediate. Development: the tone remains meditative and elegiac through high-pressure moments (discovering bodies, entering labyrinth), never spiking into panic or action-thriller register. Payoff: "copperlight of morning streaming through salt-crusted windows" charges the final image with continuity and calm acceptance. Tone coheres across turns and modulates subtly (copperlight→amber→bronze descent, then return to copperlight dawn). The repose quality supports the theme (hush, belief, exile) without flattening urgency. Closure linkage is strong; removing the copperlight imagery would dilute the ending's visual and emotional anchor.</comment>
