<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is consistently filtered through her grief and developed through purposeful reflection that anchors in the present (dust patterns, the button). Her motivation to "magnify small kindnesses" remains abstract and told rather than tested through contradictory impulses or difficult choices. The backstory about her daughter is integrated as a concrete cue that tilts present stance, but the character never faces a decision that forces her to choose between competing values with visible cost. The final beat is an open continuation rather than a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: Maren's work collecting artifacts accumulates meaning through patterned repetition. Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph. However, closure fails the cost test—the ending is a loop back to the same work without a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing that reweights prior material. The final image ("The work continued. The dust rose and settled.") restates the premise rather than charging it with new pressure or foreclosing a path. Without legible cost or closure under any valid form (DC/RR/CR), the piece reads as a vignette rather than a complete narrative arc.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The file room is established early with vivid, selective detail (metal shelves, water-stained ceiling, fluorescent hum) that creates atmosphere without catalog. The dust patterns function as both setting texture and a method that guides Maren's choices. The button as micro-object charges the middle beat and the final paragraph's tab-marking. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The setting constrains and enables her work, meeting the 9+ gate requirement, but the final image does not fully exploit the room's accumulated specificity to charge closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Maren's need to bear witness and preserve kindness—is signaled early and remains coherent. The button discovery provides one meaningful deepening that reweights her project's emotional texture. However, no on-page reversal narrows options or forces a trade-off with visible cost. The escalation is atmospheric accumulation rather than pressure that crystallizes agency. The ending returns to the same task without a tightening or foreclosed path, preventing entry into higher bands despite clean execution of the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the button, dust patterns, and Maren's grief cohere around the question of whether small kindnesses endure. The piece resists overt moralizing and uses concrete artifacts to explore loss and witnessing. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("small kindnesses waited to be found") rather than letting the image speak. The ending restates the central question without offering a resonant, non-literal answer or reweighting prior material, preventing 9+ eligibility.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and controlled throughout. Maren's perceptual signature—reading history through dust, seeking hidden kindnesses—is distinct and consistent. Diction remains within her register, blending tenderness with archival precision. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, especially in the daughter reflection. However, the final paragraph's syntactic repetition ("A handwritten note. A pressed flower. A button") and the cadence of "The work continued. The dust rose and settled" drift toward template rhythm that slightly flattens the voice under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with strong verb choices and purposeful detail. The opening establishes rhythm and tone effectively. However, the piece contains several paraphrase loops: "unknown histories" appears three times across adjacent paragraphs without added pressure; "small kindnesses" recurs four times with synonym churn ("quiet heroism," "hidden threads"); the final paragraph stacks list-like fragments that feel scaffolded rather than propulsive. These loops accumulate to −0.6 in Q7. The middle beats maintain clarity and density, but the ending's repetitive cadence dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The archivist-as-witness premise is familiar literary territory but executed with care through specific detail (dust patterns, the button, the colored tab system). The piece transforms the trope through Maren's grief-driven motivation and the tactile particularity of her method. However, the frame lacks a fresh inflection or turn that would make it feel inevitable in hindsight. The ending's open continuation rather than a decisive reconfiguration keeps the piece in competent-but-conventional territory. Removing Maren's name and substituting another archivist would leave the emotional arc largely unchanged, signaling insufficient transformation of the template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Maren is present throughout and her choices drive beats (pulling the file, photographing the button, marking with a tab). However, these are observational and cataloging actions rather than decisions that alter tactics or foreclose options with cost. She faces no meaningful conflict or choice that tests her role or changes her approach. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but without causal pressure or closure participation beyond continuation of her routine.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The button appears in setup (discovered mid-story), drives the emotional center beat (connection to Thomas and his father), and is present in the closure paragraph ("A button from a dead soldier's uniform"). It is handled twice (unwrapped, then returned with a tab) and its meaning is developed from artifact to emotional anchor. However, it does not constrain a choice or alter Maren's tactics—she continues the same work. Strong beat involvement and closure presence, but lacks causal pressure that would push it into the 8.5+ band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Unknown histories" is signaled early ("Most dated back to when children aged out..."), frames Maren's project throughout, and appears in the final lines. The concept shapes her daily stakes (which files to open, how to read them) and her personal database project. It is woven into every beat and charges the ending's image. However, it does not force a difficult choice or narrow options with cost—it remains the thematic container rather than a driver of on-page conflict. Meets setup, development, and closure gates with thematic resonance but lacks the causal pressure for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Tactfully hopeful" is told once in a single sentence ("She was tactfully hopeful about such discoveries") without further dramatization. It does not constrain or enable an action, create a tradeoff, or appear in multiple beats. The trait is asserted rather than shown through contradictory choices or modulated behavior under pressure. Label-only integration without setup reprise or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Unfurl" is used literally when Maren opens the 1943 file ("she began to unfurl the yellowed documents inside"). The action is central to the discovery of the button and frames her investigative method. It recurs conceptually in the final beat ("she opened it with the same careful hope"). However, the action could be replaced with "open," "spread," or "examine" without structural loss. Present in setup and ending with thematic charge, but swappable and not causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The dust-pattern method is signaled early ("Through accumulated dust patterns, she could tell which files had been touched recently") and used to select the 1943 file ("The thickest dust gathered on the oldest files"). It appears again in the penultimate beat ("reading the dust before she even touched the folder"). The method enables her choices and provides texture, but does not constrain tactics or create friction—any selection method would serve the same function. Present across three beats with modest causal work, but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The file room is anchored early with specific detail (metal shelves, water-stained ceiling, fluorescent lights) and remains the spatial container throughout. The setting provides resources (files, dust patterns) that enable Maren's work and her personal database project. The colored tab she uses is setting-specific. However, the room does not pressure her choices or create obstacles—it is a stable workspace rather than a crucible. Strong setup and atmosphere with modest enabling function, but lacks the constraint or friction needed for 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"After the emancipation" is mentioned once in exposition ("Most dated back to when children aged out of the system—'emancipated,' the paperwork called it") and contextualizes the files' origin. It does not tighten decisions, impose a deadline, or shape tactics. The timeframe is static backstory rather than an active constraint. Present in setup with thematic relevance but no causal work or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's desire "to magnify small kindnesses" is stated early and frames her project (the personal database, the colored tabs, the careful documentation). It motivates her choice to pull the old file and her emotional response to the button. It recurs in the ending ("small kindnesses waited to be found"). However, the motivation is never conflicted or tested—she faces no friction between this desire and a competing cost or alternative. Present across setup, middle, and ending with consistent thematic presence, but lacks the on-page friction or tradeoff needed for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Examined unknown" as tone is established early through Maren's investigative, reflective narration and sustained through the careful, tender reading of the file. The tone modulates slightly when the button is discovered (emotional deepening) and in the final paragraph (quiet return to ritual). However, the tone remains largely static rather than intensifying or breaking under pressure. It coheres and supports the premise but does not charge the final image with new pressure or shift cadence at closure. Consistent execution without the dynamic range for 8+.</comment>
