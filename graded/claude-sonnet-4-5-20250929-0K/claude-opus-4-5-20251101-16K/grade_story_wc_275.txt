**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural. The story layers images, motifs, and quiet revelations toward a crystallized stance rather than causal plot turns.

**Closure Unit:** Earned Stasis — Mira's deliberate renunciation of violence and commitment to cultivation crystallizes in the final image, foreclosing her father's path with implicit cost (fragility of her project against ongoing collapse).

**Dominant Stake:** Whether deliberate meaning-making can sustain continuity against entropy in a post-collapse world.

<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Mira's identity as bounty hunter's pacifist daughter is clearly drawn, and her perceptive nature is embodied (sensing rootlet tremors, chemical whispers). However, her central contradiction — blade-carrier who won't strike — was resolved before the story begins. She's never truly tested in the present; the stranger arrives peacefully, asks nothing difficult. Her character confirms a settled stance rather than discovering or earning one under pressure. The stranger is purely functional, offering no resistance or complication.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Orientation is clean by the second sentence. Under the accumulative lens, the pattern builds — roses, blade, ballast, teaching — but no genuine tightening occurs. The stranger's arrival creates no friction; the ballast scrap is given freely. The Earned Stasis closure is legible ("She would never hunt"), but the cost proof is weak: the world's continued collapse makes her project fragile, yet this reads as declared fragility rather than felt price. The time-jumps (summer passes, others come) compress without earning their transitions.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Desert heat pressed against transparent walls like a living thing" and the dome's acoustic properties ("Sound behaved differently inside — softer, rounder, held") are strong, POV-filtered details. The setting genuinely constrains — the dome enables cultivation in hostile terrain, creates sanctuary. The ballast scrap's tactile density is well-rendered. Some descriptions edge toward the decorative ("silence held its shape like something carved from crystal"), but the setting functions as more than postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (cultivation vs. entropy) is signaled early but never materially tested. No one challenges Mira's method with real consequence; the stranger's mild skepticism ("Plants can't learn values") is immediately answered. The blade at her hip is a Chekhov's gun that deliberately doesn't fire — thematically intentional but generating no on-page tension. Under the accumulative lens, there's no pattern break or cadence shift that genuinely reweights the cost. Stakes remain ambient radiation throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The ballast-as-balance metaphor earns its resonance through specificity and father-connection. However, the final paragraph is explicit sermonizing: "She would never hunt. She would never harvest violence. She would only grow what deserved to outlast her" states the thesis directly. "Everything learns what we repeat" functions as a moral delivered through dialogue. "Quiet rebellion against entropy" names the theme rather than letting it emerge. The thematic echo penalty applies to this closure paragraph (−0.6).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited throughout with a consistent lyric register that mirrors Mira's careful temperament. The perceptual signature is specific — she notices root tremors before footsteps. Dialogue is sparse but functional, though the stranger's voice barely differentiates from narration. Psychic distance is well-controlled. The voice occasionally slides into workshop-polished prettiness ("inheritance of rejection") but maintains coherence throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Strong individual lines ("the chemical whisper of a leaf detecting blight") compete with paraphrase loops: "Ballast. / Balance. / The thing that kept you level" restates one idea three times. The closing paragraph stacks synonymous declarations ("never hunt / never harvest violence / only grow"). Template cadence in short-fragment sequences throughout fragments momentum. "Weight against wind. / Continuity against chaos" is near-duplicate phrasing. These artifacts appear in the closure beat, lowering the final image's impact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The quiet-gardener-in-post-apocalypse is a well-established archetype (Station Eleven territory). "Inculcating plants with values" is a genuinely unusual conceit, and repurposing ballast scrap into seed-tray covering is specific. But the transformation test reveals the emotional arc would survive transplantation to different specifics. The derivative premise guardrail applies: the template isn't substantially transformed through non-obvious moral calculus or structural innovation.</comment>
