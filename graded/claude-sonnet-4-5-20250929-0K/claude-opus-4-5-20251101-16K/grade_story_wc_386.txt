<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is consistently rooted in salvaging innocence from wreckage, and her method of weaving truth carefully shapes her approach throughout. Her embodied choices—recording nightmares, analyzing dream appearances, deciding to carve into ice rather than confront survivors—demonstrate clear agency under pressure. The ghost Elsa shows contradictory emotional states (confusion, hunger, innocence) that feel earned rather than performed. Minor slip: Harald Varen's grief is told rather than shown, reducing the father-daughter conflict to backstory summary rather than on-page friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal with accumulative texture: Mira's investigation (dream cataloging) causes her to determine Henrik Moss's guilt, which enables her to absolve Elsa, leading to the ghost's dissolution and Mira's choice to carve the truth into ice. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Mira renounces confronting the living in favor of glacial permanence, foreclosing rehabilitation among survivors with visible cost (the father's ongoing misbelief). Orientation anchors are clear by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elsa's edges sharpen at the revelation, narrowing from accusation to exoneration. Cost is legible: Elsa dissolves, and Mira commits to a memorial only the glacier will preserve.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The glacier shrine is specific and constraining—candles burn "despite physics," ice cracks like breathing, and the environment charges the final carving act. The melted snow globe's warped glass and fused figures anchor the retrieval concretely. Spatial choreography is clean: descent through fissure, shrine's edge, ice walls for carving. The glacier's permanence versus human forgetting directly shapes Mira's final choice, making the setting indispensable to closure rather than decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: absolving Elsa of false blame. The tightening occurs when Mira delivers the evidence (Henrik Moss in four dreams, Elsa innocent in twelve), which sharpens Elsa's form and forces the question of exposure. Mira's final choice—carving into ice rather than seeking living vindication—narrows options with visible cost (Harald's grief remains unreached). The escalation is clean but relies heavily on told investigation rather than on-page reversals; the nightmare analysis happens off-stage in summary, reducing immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: borrowed light, warped beauty, glacial memory versus human frailty, the calcification of guilt onto the vulnerable. The melted snow globe image recurs with shifted meaning (damage that preserves beauty), and the final carving offers a resonant answer to salvaging innocence without stating a moral. "Borrowed starlight—reflected, refracted, not its own. But beautiful still" crystallizes the theme without didacticism. No thematic echo or sermon in the ending; the choice to trust ice over people carries quiet weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mira with a distinct perceptual signature: "borrowed light," "rope fibers," "windows of connection" reflect her dual vocations. Elsa's voice "from everywhere" is handled cleanly. Diction remains controlled and purposeful throughout. Minor slip: "weaves truth carefully" in paragraph five shifts briefly into narrator commentary rather than dramatized interiority, and the phrase "calcification of guilt" feels slightly elevated for mid-crisis thought, though it aligns with Mira's professional remove.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, information density is high, and clarity remains strong. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line ("Mira began to carve") resolves by action that recharges the salvage motif. Minor issues: "This was the window Mira needed—the windows of connection" is a paraphrase loop (−0.2); "This was her method, her survival mechanism" feels like scaffold explanation rather than dramatized action. No other loops or template cadence observed. Figurative language (borrowed light, rope fibers, blue ice) is purposeful and coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The wreck-diver/ghost-whisperer synthesis is fresh, and the dream-cameo investigation method offers a non-obvious angle on ghost stories. The glacier shrine and melted snow globe are specific rather than generic. The choice to carve into ice rather than confront the living transforms the expected vindication arc. However, the core emotional beat—innocent child falsely blamed by grieving parent—is familiar territory, and the resolution (absolving the ghost, letting the living remain ignorant) follows a recognizable pattern. Transformation is present but not radical.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira as wreck-diver ghost whisperer drives every key turn: she retrieves the snow globe (beat 1), analyzes dream cameos to determine truth (beat 2), delivers exoneration to Elsa (beat 3), chooses glacial memorial over living exposure (beat 4). The dual vocation is causally necessary—wreck-diving provides objects, ghost-whispering enables communication—and her final choice to carve rather than expose is irreplaceable. Early setup, causal pressure across beats, closure participation all strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The melted snow globe appears in beats 1 (retrieval), 2 (sits between palms during conversation), and 4 (lifted to catch candlelight before carving). Its warped state mirrors Elsa's distorted memory and charges the "beautiful still" theme. However, the object enables rather than constrains—Mira could theoretically summon Elsa through any retrieved artifact. It participates in closure imagery but does not shape the final choice itself (carving vs. exposing). Solid integration but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Windows of connection" shapes the investigation method: Elsa's dream intrusions create the window that lets Mira trace truth backward. The concept appears explicitly ("This was the window Mira needed—the windows of connection") and implicitly structures the middle section. However, it functions more as exposition of method than as an on-page constraint that alters tactics under pressure. The concept enables the plot but does not force a difficult choice or narrow options visibly.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>"Weaves truth carefully" is dramatized on the page: Mira withholds full truth ("too much truth delivered too quickly could shatter them into nothing"), then delivers it in measured beats ("Your father dreams of you standing near the lantern. But three other survivors dream of a different figure"). The trait constrains her method and shapes the conversation's pacing. It appears early, drives beat 3, and ties to the closure choice (carving a permanent truth vs. risking volatile living exposure). Visible tradeoff: care costs time and acceptance of incompleteness.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Expose" appears as a question Elsa asks ("Will you expose him?") and Mira's answer defines the resolution: she refuses exposure among the living, choosing instead to carve into ice. The refusal is a key turn, but the action itself (exposing or not) is more conceptual than dramatized—we see neither the attempt nor its consequences, only the renunciation. The element shapes the final choice but is not irreplaceable; Mira could choose silence without framing it as exposure-declined. Middle development and closure participation present, but causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dream-cameo method is signaled early ("By analyzing cameo appearances in strangers' dreams, Mira could trace the truth backward") and supplies the key evidence: Henrik Moss in four dreams, Elsa in twelve, always innocent. It enables the absolution and constrains Mira to this indirect mode rather than direct testimony. However, the mechanics are told in summary—"two weeks interviewing...recording their nightmares, cataloging"—rather than shown on the page. It shapes the investigation's structure and outcome but does not force an on-page tactical adjustment under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The glacier shrine provides the meeting space, and its ice "cracks—a sound like breathing" responds to emotional shifts, charging the atmosphere. The candles that burn "despite physics" anchor the otherworldly logic. Crucially, the ice becomes the medium for the final act: Mira carves Elsa's innocence into it, and the choice to trust glacial permanence over human memory depends on this setting. Early setup, atmospheric pressure in the middle, and indispensable to closure. The shrine is micro-setting that constrains the final choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to salvage something pure from the wreckage" is stated early and dramatized throughout: Mira retrieves the snow globe, seeks to clear Elsa's name, and ultimately chooses glacial preservation as salvage when living vindication proves unreachable. The motive shapes every choice and the final renunciation carries cost (abandoning Harald). The tension between "something worth saving" and "the living rarely listened" creates friction. The final carving literalizes the salvage desire. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Borrowed starlight—reflected, refracted, not its own. But beautiful still" charges the final third, tying to borrowed light (candles), the warped snow globe, and Elsa's damaged-yet-pure innocence. The tone is elegiac and quiet, modulating through investigative calm (dream analysis), spectral encounter (Elsa's hunger), and tender absolution. It coheres across turns and intensifies at closure without breaking into sentimentality. The metaphor reweights prior material and supports the theme of salvaged beauty. Not indispensable to plot mechanics but essential to emotional resonance.</comment>
