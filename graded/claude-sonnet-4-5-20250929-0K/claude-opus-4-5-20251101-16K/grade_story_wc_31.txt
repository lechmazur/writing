<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's interior life is concrete and character-particular ("I like the quiet" as a locked door), with embodied grief driving his descent. The promise to Marina motivates his twenty-three-year search with visible cost. However, the final shift from searching to "completing the library" feels summarized rather than tested; we don't see him wrestle with whether to finish another's work or continue his own path. The micro-choice to "finish the thesis" lacks visible friction or trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly by ~80 words (lamplighter, pier, twenty-three years). The accumulative lens holds: the descent, jar discovery, and surface return build toward the Resonant Reconfiguration that Marina asked him to keep searching, not find an answer. Closure lands with felt cost—he accepts the question as permanent work. One structural gap: the "someone else had sought this same impossible thing" realization arrives via exposition rather than dramatized discovery, softening the turn's immediacy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sunken library is vivid and specific—water-warped spines, kelp-like tissue pages, jars sealed with wax—and directly enables the climactic realization. The pier lamps frame the opening and return at the end, subtly altered by his new perception. Spatial choreography across descent and ascent is coherent. The amber shimmer when he opens the jar charges the moment with sensory specificity. Minor: the harbor town's broader geography remains generic; we get "harbor floor" but no anchor for depth, distance, or dive logistics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—fulfilling Marina's luminous vow—is signaled early and drives the descent. The jar discovery meaningfully tightens his understanding: the color of sound is the act of searching, not a destination. Agency appears in his decision to complete the library's thesis, though the choice feels more accepted than wrestled with. The cost is legible but subtle: he commits to "tomorrow's descent," binding himself to perpetual work. Under the accumulative lens, one deepening reweights the premise with felt cost, meeting the baseline for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the jars, the promise, and the final realization that Marina asked him to live inside the question. "Luminous vows" recurs purposefully, binding not to reason but longing. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the color of sound is "listening with your whole self until the world revealed its hidden correspondences." One slip: "Somewhere beyond the meteor hush... he felt certain Marina knew" edges toward thematic summary rather than trusting the image alone. The phrase "hidden correspondences" risks abstraction but is anchored by the jar's amber shimmer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "truth can be a room with locked doors," "kelp-like tissue," "meteor hush." POV remains stable in close third, with perceptual signature ("flashlight cutting through particulate darkness") rooted in Elias's work. Distance modulates purposefully during the jar-opening beat. Free indirect thought is clean. Minor: "The collector had failed to finish, he realized" uses a mild filter at a peak moment, slightly dulling immediacy. Diction stays within the lamplighter's idiom; no corporate or academic drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "Marina had pressed it into his palm the night she made him promise" delivers object, backstory, and emotional anchor in one). Opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharge the lamp motif effectively. Two friction points: "By wandering purposefully through the drowned corridors, flashlight cutting..." front-loads a gerund phrase that slightly slows the beat's propulsion. "Meteor hush" recurs three times without sufficient variance, risking phrase fatigue. No loops or scaffold detected; clarity holds throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The jars-of-sound concept is a fresh, specific synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The lamplighter/diver pairing is purposeful rather than quirky. Emotional truth—grief as perpetual work rather than resolution—avoids template arcs. However, the core premise (deceased loved one sets impossible quest; protagonist redefines success as the journey) leans on familiar emotional territory. The piece transforms it through the sunken library's particulars and the shift from "find" to "finish another's thesis," but the moral calculus remains in well-trodden ground. Risk-taking is moderate; structure and voice are confident but not boldly unconventional.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elias lights lamps (opening and closing), descends to dive, opens a jar, and decides to complete the library's thesis. His occupation frames the story and provides the "luminous vows" anchor, but the lamplighter role itself doesn't constrain a key turn—he could be any solitary worker. The decision to finish the thesis is his, but the lamplighter identity doesn't enable or restrict that choice. Present in setup, middle dive, and ending (lighting lamps), but the specificity of "late-shift pier lamplighter" doesn't prove irreplaceable. Solid functional integration; swappable with "night diver" or similar role with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The key tag appears in three beats: Marina's deathbed gift, bumping his chest during the jar discovery, and warming against his skin at the ending. It's handled on the page and carries emotional charge as a talisman of the vow. However, it doesn't constrain a choice or alter tactics—Elias would dive and realize the same insight without it. The tag's "number long worn away" detail is evocative but ornamental. The ending warmth is metaphorical assurance rather than causal payoff. Present across beats with thematic resonance, but not indispensable to plot logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Luminous vows" is defined early ("promises made in lamplight... tied not to reason but to longing"), frames Marina's promise, and returns implicitly in the sky lantern scene ("each one a luminous vow drifting"). The concept shapes Elias's stake—he's bound by a vow that defies rational completion. It doesn't constrain a tactical choice on the page, but it reweights the ending: his commitment to the library is another luminous vow, perpetuating the form. The concept is woven through setup and closure, altering the story's emotional logic. Not fully indispensable, but integral to thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Hides behind truth" is illustrated once: "I like the quiet" is honest but incomplete, a room with locked doors. The trait is labeled but not tested under pressure. We don't see Elias deploy partial truths to evade a question or choice during the dive or ending. The attribute is present in setup and explains his isolation, but it doesn't enable or constrain an on-page action with visible cost. Swappable with "prefers solitude" without structural loss. Functional but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"Signify" appears in the jar labels: the collector tried "to signify their essence in glass." This realization is key—Elias understands someone else pursued the same goal—but the action "signify" itself is passive and historical, belonging to the absent collector. Elias doesn't signify anything on the page; he catalogs, opens, and decides to finish. The word anchors the thematic turn but isn't enacted by the protagonist. If "signify" were replaced with "capture" or "preserve," the beat would function identically. Present in one key turn but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Wandering purposefully" is defined mid-story ("moving without destination but never without intent") and attributed to Marina's teaching. Elias explicitly uses the method: "By wandering purposefully through the drowned corridors... his feet brought him to a section he'd never noticed." The method enables the jar discovery, the story's pivotal beat. It's signaled, enacted, and tied to a key turn with visible payoff. However, the method doesn't recur or shape the ending choice—once the jars are found, the method's work is done. Present in setup (Marina's lesson) and middle (discovery), with strong causal pressure in one beat.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sunken library is introduced early (years of cataloging establish it), supplies the jars that trigger the climactic realization, and shapes the ending commitment (he'll return to finish the thesis). The setting is specific—tilted shelves, wax-sealed jars, cramped script labels—and irreplaceable: no above-water library could deliver the preservation trick or the drowned isolation that mirrors Elias's grief. The setting constrains (he must dive to access it) and enables (the jars exist only there). Present in setup, drives the middle turn, and charges the ending. Essential across beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The Sky Lantern Festival frames the story: Elias descends "tonight" during the festival and surfaces while "the sky still glowed with ascending lanterns." The timing provides atmospheric resonance (lanterns as luminous vows) but doesn't tighten a decision. He could dive any night and reach the same realization. The festival enriches tone and theme but is functionally replaceable. Present in setup and ending with thematic payoff, but no tactical pressure from the timeframe itself.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Marina's dying request—"Find me the color of sound"—is introduced early, drives the twenty-three-year search, and is reframed at closure: she asked him to keep searching, not to find an answer. The motivation is embodied (he carries the key tag, dives repeatedly, catalogs the library) and tested (he weeps when he understands the jars). The final choice to complete the thesis flows directly from this reframed desire. The motivation shapes setup, middle discovery, and ending with visible cost (perpetual work). Friction between "find" and "live inside the question" charges the closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" is defined as "when even the sea holds its breath" and recurs three times: the festival moment, the library dive's "particulate darkness," and the ending's "beyond the meteor hush." The tone is coherent—quiet, suspended, luminous—and modulates subtly (from collective ritual to solitary dive to distant assurance). It charges the final image by framing Marina's awareness. However, the phrase risks becoming a decorative refrain rather than a pressure-bearing element. The tone supports but doesn't constrain choices. Present across beats with thematic resonance; charged reprise at closure elevates it into the mid-6s.</comment>
