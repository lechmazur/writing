<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's internal contradiction—constitutionally opposed to belief yet compelled to pursue the ephemeral compass—drives the arc effectively. The embodied grief and joy in the laugh at closure ("a wet, broken sound, halfway between grief and joy") earns the shift. Minor deduction for the phrase "gloomy cheerfulness of someone who had finally stopped running," which edges toward label-speak rather than pure embodiment, though the prior beats support it. Her renunciation of debunking is motivated by the accumulated particulars and forecloses her old identity with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mira accepts the mystery she cannot solve and walks away transformed, foreclosing her myth-buster identity with felt cost. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—cello-memory fragments, the glowing seashell, and the star's pulse layer to reweight her stance. Cost is legible in "the only myth that ever mattered" and her departure from the cliff. Minor deduction: the early metaphor "magic was merely misunderstood physics" and Farrell's satellite dialogue introduce slight causal scaffolding that could tighten, but escalation through reimagined conversations is coherent and the ending image reconfigures prior material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory's stripped dome and half-finished cello anchor the setting vividly and constrain Mira's method (she uses the cello's resonance to reimagine conversations). The cliff at dawn bookends the piece with purposeful contrast. Minor slip: "salt-thick air" and "the skeletal remains of someone's abandoned research" are evocative but slightly generic; the micro-setting (cello, seashell, rotating dome slot) does more to charge the ending than the broader cliff locale.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding the ephemeral compass riddle—is signaled early and tightens as Mira's reimagined conversations overlap and the seashell glows, pointing toward the star. The escalation operates under the Accumulative lens: each cello-memory reweights the question until the answer crystallizes ("the space between"). The snapped string and departure foreclose her debunker path with visible cost. One meaningful deepening (the riddle shifts from external object to internal realization) is sufficient for this length and drives the closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the cello-memory particulars and the seashell's glow: "Some riddles...were not meant to be solved. Only lived." The final image—Mira descending with the cooling shell—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question (what is the ephemeral compass?) without stating a moral. The piece invites reflection on the limits of rationalism and the value of irreducible mystery. Minor proximity note: "halfway between grief and joy" and "gloomy cheerfulness" echo similar emotional-balance phrasing, though the effect supports the bittersweet tone rather than flattening it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent, with Mira's perceptual signature—debunker-turned-believer—filtering sensory detail and reflection. The cello-memory dialogue (Nana, Farrell) differentiates speakers through idiom and stakes. Minor deduction for slight filter-verb density in the opening paragraph ("had spent," "had belonged," "had dismissed") and the phrase "retell them to herself as though they were happening fresh," which edges toward explanation rather than dramatized perception. Psychic distance modulates appropriately during the cello scene, tightening as pressure rises.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and propulsion is strong through the cello scene. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or the riddle. Deductions: "salt-thick air" is vivid but generic; "the skeletal remains of someone's abandoned research" uses "skeletal" metaphorically when literal debris would be sharper. The phrase "the gloomy cheerfulness of someone who had finally stopped running" stacks two abstract modifiers and edges toward telling. The opening's filter-verb cluster ("had spent," "had belonged," "had dismissed") slightly dulls immediacy, though the effect supports retrospective framing. No loops or template cadence; clarity remains high throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of myth-buster protagonist, cello-memory method, and ephemeral compass concept feels specific and non-obvious. The piece transforms the "skeptic finds magic" trope by embedding the compass as a realization rather than an object, and the cello's resonance as a quasi-magical tool rooted in Mira's professional skill. Risk-taking in the overlapping voice-memories and the abstract riddle answer elevates without obscuring clarity. Minor familiarity: the arc of the debunker who finally believes has precedent, though the particulars (painted seashell, cello hums, cosmic background radiation) render it memorable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's choice to accept the mystery and walk away drives the closure and forecloses her debunker identity. She appears in all three gates (setup, middle cello scene, ending descent) and her decisions—playing the cello faster, following the seashell's direction, laughing and tucking the shell—alter tactics and stakes. The final renunciation is causally earned by the accumulated reimagined conversations.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The painted seashell appears in the opening (Nana's gift), glows and points mid-scene (guiding Mira's gaze to the star), and is tucked away cooling at closure, reweighted as a talisman of acceptance rather than senility. It constrains Mira's choice to follow its direction and charges the final image. Three beats with causal pressure and closure linkage; irreplaceability is high (the golden spirals and glow are specific to this object).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ephemeral compass shapes stakes and tactics: Mira seeks to decode it, Farrell's satellite data references it, and the seashell's glow enacts it by pointing "just for the whisper-length moment." The realization that it "marks where you already stood" reweights the premise and drives closure. Setup and payoff are strong; middle development is thematic rather than choice-constraining, limiting causal pressure slightly.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Reimagining past conversations via cello resonance is dramatized on the page: Mira draws the bow, hears Nana and Farrell speak, plays faster to overlap voices, and the method enables her to decode the riddle. The trait constrains her approach (she cannot solve the riddle through debunking alone, only through this synesthetic memory-retelling) and the snapped string signals cost. Three beats with visible tradeoff; irreplaceability is high.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Retelling past conversations through the cello is the method that drives escalation: Mira retells Nana's riddle, Farrell's satellite claim, and overlapping voices that converge into the answer. The action is present in setup, middle, and closure (the string snaps as the riddle resolves). Causal pressure is strong, though the action blends with the "reimagines past conversations" attribute, slightly reducing standalone necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The half-finished cello is discovered among observatory debris, its taut strings produce resonant hums that Mira uses to reimagine conversations, and the snapped string at closure marks the end of the decoding attempt. The method shapes tactics (playing faster to overlap voices) and charges the final image. Three beats with causal and closure linkage; mechanics are legible and specific to this tool.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The abandoned observatory provides the cello and the open dome slot through which Mira sees the pulsing star; the cliff location supplies the "salt-thick air" and the dawn descent at closure. The setting enables key beats but does not constrain choices as sharply as the cello or seashell. Setup and closure linkage are present; middle pressure is indirect (the observatory houses the tool rather than imposing its own obstacle).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Inside the whisper of closing pages" appears as metaphor in Nana's riddle and the final realization that the compass exists only "for the whisper-length moment before the pages closed." The timeframe is conceptual rather than a live clock, shaping theme more than tightening tactics on the page. Setup and payoff are clear; middle development is thematic, limiting causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mira's desire to decode the universal riddle is dramatized in the opening (she sits with the seashell "trying to decode"), drives her cello-memory method, and culminates in the realization and renunciation at closure. The motivation is conflicted (she's "constitutionally opposed to belief" yet compelled to pursue the riddle) and the cost is visible in her departure from myth-busting. Three beats with friction and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Gloomy cheerfulness is embodied in the "wet, broken sound, halfway between grief and joy" and the phrase "the gloomy cheerfulness of someone who had finally stopped running." The tone modulates from skeptical resignation (opening) through urgent accumulation (cello scene) to bittersweet acceptance (closure), supporting the Earned Stasis effect. Coherence across turns is strong; the final image is charged by the tone's duality.</comment>
