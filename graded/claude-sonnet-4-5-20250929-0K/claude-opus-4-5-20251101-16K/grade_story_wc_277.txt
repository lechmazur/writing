**Drive Lens:** Causal — because/therefore linkage drives the story (call → reflection → proof by contradiction → pen examination → discovery → decision to publish).

**Closure Unit:** Decisive Change — Viola transitions from passive avoidance to active intervention, calling Marcus to publish the evidence. Cost is implied (ending isolation, entering dangerous territory with a senator's network) rather than viscerally felt on the page.

<question>1</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Viola's motivation is clear and her astronomer-heiress identity informs her reasoning style, but the internal conflict between hiding and confronting truth is largely told rather than dramatized through simultaneous contradictory impulses. "Devotedly observant" appears twice as a label rather than being shown through distinctive perception. The final decision is motivated but arrives without genuine internal resistance—she moves from discovery to action with little friction or felt cost in the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Orientation anchors land cleanly within the first lines. The causal chain holds (call → proof → pen → scroll → decision), but the pen's secret compartment after 15 years of possession strains credulity—the story tries to justify this but the convenience remains. Backstory runs ~35-40%, exceeding the 30% expanded ceiling; it's reasonably anchored in the present (pen in hand, observatory setting) and interleaved with micro-choices, but the proof-by-contradiction section reads more essayistic than dramatic. Closure lands as DC but cost is implied/future rather than paid on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The observatory above clouds is vivid and thematically functional—isolation mirrors avoidance. The rosewood pen catching starlight is a strong micro-setting detail that constrains the key discovery. Sensory range is mostly visual/tactile, and the dome echoing, clouds beneath, wind humming are effective atmospheric touches. Setting constrains choice (her remoteness from earthly truth) and supports the thematic architecture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (discovering truth about her father's death) is signaled early, but there is no genuine opposition or difficulty within the scene. The proof by contradiction proceeds without friction; the pen yields its secret with one press; Marcus conveniently provides all the external information needed. No on-page cost is paid—the danger of confronting a senator's network is entirely theoretical. Tension exists at the thematic level but not at the scene level.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The stars-vs-earthly-truth thematic architecture is coherent and the "light from dead stars" / "truth hidden in a pen" juxtaposition works. However, the final paragraphs moralize heavily: "Some orbits decayed. Some stabilized. And some...could finally break free. Viola Ashford was done circling her regrets." This is explicit thematic statement replacing scene pressure (−0.6). The mother's deathbed line ("stop looking at the stars and start looking at the ink") is similarly blunt. Theme is coherent but over-articulated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited is stable throughout. Voice has some distinction through astronomical vocabulary and analytical framing (proof by contradiction suits an astronomer). Dialogue is minimal but functional—Marcus's brief lines are goal-driven, Viola's response carries the right weight. "Something like solemn playfulness" is telling rather than showing tone. The "devotedly observant" repetition reads as forced element-insertion rather than organic voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Template cadence in the proof-by-contradiction section (three "If...then..." iterations) slows momentum despite being somewhat pattern-taught (−0.5). "Devotedly observant" repeated twice as near-identical label (−0.3). Many single-sentence paragraphs create a fragmented rhythm that feels mannered rather than purposeful. Some effective lines ("the stars were sharpest," "a forgotten thought") offset weaker passages, but the final astronomical tricolon and closing declaration are clichéd rhetoric rather than fresh image-work.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Hidden-document-in-secret-compartment is a well-worn thriller trope; the corrupt-senator-killed-the-whistleblower premise is equally familiar. The proof-by-contradiction framing provides modest structural freshness, and the observatory setting is distinctive. But the core emotional arc (recluse discovers truth, decides to act) follows a standard template. The astronomical metaphor system is pleasant but doesn't transform the underlying genre machinery into something surprising. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies partially (−0.5).</comment>
