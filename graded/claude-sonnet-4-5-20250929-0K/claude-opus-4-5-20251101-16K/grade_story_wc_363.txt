<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and her willingness to trade memories is embodied through concrete losses (taste of cherries, sound of mother's voice). The amber bead memory grounds her emotional stakes. However, the crucial final choice—sending the bead through—lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; she proceeds with grief but without visible internal conflict that might fracture the decision. The cost is narrated rather than dramatically tested in the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story builds through layered images (puzzle, amber, orchard) toward a final Charged Poise moment where Mira pushes the bead through and commits to waiting. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly in the opening paragraphs. The closure reconfigures her stance from searching to ritually sending with undeniable cost (hollow selfhood), and the lens holds. One meaningful deepening occurs when the puzzle configuration activates and she gives her voice. Cost is legible in "hollow enough for Lien's response to fill her completely."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The forgotten orchard and bamboo forest create a liminal setting that pressures the action; the moss, wild apples, and seasonal blur anchor the ritual space. The puzzle pieces on moss and the amber bead function as micro-setting objects that constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mira's weaver's perspective (threads, unraveling, weaving intention). Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reaching Lien—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira decides to give more than prior memories, escalating to her voice. The cost of becoming hollow is legible and forecloses future wholeness. However, the piece lacks a complicating reversal or obstacle; Mira's agency is renunciative endurance rather than a decision forced by new pressure. The escalation is internal and accumulative, fitting the lens, but the ritual proceeds without friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—love as sacrificial weaving across distance—emerges organically from the loom-spinner premise, puzzle-as-fracture metaphor, and memory-trade mechanics. The amber bead with the trapped fly seeds the motif early and returns reweighted at closure, carrying the message and embodying irreversible cost. The final image of Mira waiting to become hollow offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of maternal devotion without stating a moral. "Still spinning, still sending, still willing to sacrifice everything" risks summary but stays anchored in prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is strong: weaving metaphors ("raveling silence," "unraveling tapestry," "throw across impossible distance") filter consistently through Mira's craft identity. Diction remains within her register. No dialogue, so subtext operates through gesture and image (amber to lips, whispering into the bead). Minor filter-verb density ("understood," "could hear") in the middle slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in key beats (puzzle mechanics, amber memory, the sending ritual). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "Not weaving cloth anymore, but weaving intention" echoes the opening's loom-spinner renunciation; "raveling silence had begun" and "silence finished raveling" bookend without adding new pressure. "Stoically sparkling" appears twice with identical phrasing (bead description, sky), reading as synonym churn. The closure image is clear, but scaffold ("The wistful loom spinner had learned...") in the penultimate paragraph externalizes theme rather than trusting the dramatization. Apply −0.6 for loops and template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—puzzle pieces as dimensional fractures, memory-trade for messages—offers a fresh synthesis of separation-quest and magical cost. The loom-spinner's pivot from cloth to intention weaving is purposeful. However, "mother searching for lost child through magical means" is a widely used template, and the story does not transform it through unexpected moral calculus or a non-obvious turn; Mira's choice is noble and foreseeable. The "raveling silence" and amber-fly specifics add texture but the arc remains familiar. Transformation is partial; apply −0.8 for derivative premise with moderate freshening.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Wistful loom spinner: Present early (paragraph 1), frames her renunciation and ritual expertise. Her decision to "give more" and push the bead through drives the final beat. However, "wistful" as attribute is asserted more than enacted in choices; her actions read as determined grief rather than wistful longing modulating decisions. Two-gate presence (setup, payoff) with modest causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tree sap amber bead: Introduced early with backstory (Lien made it, trapped fly, love vessel), handled in the middle (lifted from neck, held to lips), and pushed through puzzle at closure, carrying her voice. The bead's symbolic charge deepens across three beats and its use is irreplaceable (the fly and Lien's making justify its selection). Strong setup-development-payoff. Causal pressure is moderate; the bead enacts the sending but does not constrain tactics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Raveling silence: Described atmospherically ("coming undone, thread by thread") and provides mood texture. It "finished raveling" to reveal Mira's heartbeat, but this does not narrow options or alter her choice. The concept ornaments the setting without constraining action. Present in setup and closure mention, but no middle beat where it pressures a decision. Two gates, ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Stoically sparkling: Applied twice (amber bead "stoically sparkling even in shadow," sky "stoically sparkling with emerging stars") as descriptive label. Does not enable or constrain action; the bead's function derives from its history and contents, not this attribute. No tradeoff or cost tied to the trait. Label-only, ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Recommence: Signaled early ("prepared to recommence the work she'd abandoned"), enacted in the middle (fitting puzzle pieces, preparing the bead), and implied ongoing at closure ("recommence this ritual as many times as necessary"). The action structures the entire arc and her repetitive commitment defines the stakes. Three gates with strong thematic linkage. However, the mechanics are not differentiated from prior sendings; swapping "recommence" for "continue" would not break logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Through jigsaw puzzle edges found in a rummage sale box: Introduced in paragraph 2, explained as fracture-map in paragraph 4, assembled and used in paragraphs 6–7 to create the doorway through which the bead passes. The method shapes the ritual's mechanics and is irreplaceable (no other tool would create this dimensional effect). Three gates. Specificity is high but the puzzle does not constrain her tactics; she assembles it successfully without friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Forgotten orchard deep in a bamboo forest: Established in paragraph 3 as a liminal pocket where boundaries thin, enabling the ritual. Mira returns there deliberately because "here, the boundaries grew thin," so setting enables the action. The wild apples and moss provide stage elements but do not pressure choices. Setup and closure presence with enabling logic but no micro-tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Through the hush of time's unraveling tapestry: Appears once as atmospheric description of the orchard ("existed through the hush of time's unraveling tapestry, a pocket where seasons blurred"). Does not create a ticking clock or deadline. The phrase enriches tone but does not tighten decisions. Setup only, ornamental timeframe.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>To carry a message across impossible distance: Stated explicitly and dramatized through the memory-trade (prior words "safe," "waiting," "home"), the whispered message into the bead, and the final sending. The desire drives all three structural beats and the closure hinges on it. Friction between the want (reaching Lien) and cost (becoming hollow) is legible and sustained. Strong causal pressure, three gates, cost connection clear.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Latent sacrifice: Introduced in paragraph 5 ("The latent sacrifice of this method") and enacted through enumerated losses (cherries, mother's voice, rain) and the escalating gift of her voice. The tone modulates from preparation through the ritual to the charged waiting, and the final image ("hollow enough for Lien's response to fill her completely") crystallizes the sacrificial cost. Coherent across turns, charges closure, though "latent" itself is stated rather than purely shown.</comment>
