<comment>Vesper's borrowed-personality trait is established but manifests primarily through exposition rather than visible internal contradiction acting in scene. The morning mathematician's grief is told ("had worn his anguish like a coat, felt the precise geometry of his loss") without embodied cost or a micro-choice that reveals competing impulses. By the ending, her uncertainty about whether feelings are borrowed or her own hints at internal friction, yet this realization arrives as summary rather than dramatized struggle that forecloses a path. The final choice to continue printing is consistent but lacks a visible trade-off or renunciation that would charge it with felt cost.</comment>

<comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the first 120 words. The piece infers an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through vanishing stars and pamphlet production, aiming for a cadence shift or pattern break at closure. However, the ending offers continuity ("continued her impossible arithmetic") rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration; no visible cost appears in the final image, and no tightening narrows Vesper's options on the page. The conceptual premise (mapping emotion to save stars) is asserted but not tested by a turn that reweights stakes or forecloses a path, leaving closure more as stasis-by-declaration than earned reconfiguration.</comment>

<comment>The topaz workshop is vividly rendered with selective, purpose-driven detail: crystalline walls catching starlight, the press's clank and hum, and the skylight framing vanishing stars. The halo fragment functions as both tool and micro-setting element, handled twice (above type cases, pressed against heart) and charged with borrowed light that constrains Vesper's method. However, the environment does not visibly alter a choice or tactic on the page; it enriches atmosphere and tone but remains largely backdrop to the exposition-heavy action, preventing it from reaching higher bands.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—mapping emotion to prevent cosmic forgetting—is signaled early and remains coherent. Four stars vanish across the narrative, suggesting accumulation, but no on-page reversal or tightening narrows Vesper's options; she begins printing and ends printing with identical intent. Lumen's question "Why do you do this?" and Vesper's answer function as exposition rather than pressure that forces a trade-off. The ending lacks a visible price or tactical shift; the claimed ache "like topaz fracturing" is asserted but not dramatized through a choice that forecloses a path, leaving escalation minimal under the inferred Accumulative lens.</comment>

<comment>Theme—empathy as mathematics, the cost of borrowed identity—emerges from concrete particulars (the press, transposed grief, the halo fragment) rather than sermon. The closing uncertainty ("couldn't tell anymore if the feeling was borrowed or her own") offers a non-literal answer to the story's central question and reweights the transposed-empathy premise without stating a moral. However, the lack of a visible choice or renunciation at closure limits resonance; the theme remains more asserted through reflection than tested by dramatized conflict, preventing full thematic integration with the protagonist's arc.</comment>

<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>POV remains stable third-person limited with a distinct, elevated register ("lucid turbulence," "fractured amber patterns") that suits the conceptual premise. Vesper's perceptual signature—geometrizing emotion, filtering sensation through crystalline and mathematical metaphor—is consistent and voice-particular. Dialogue (Lumen's two questions, Vesper's cryptic answers) carries subtext and fits character but is sparse and expository. The prose maintains distance control and avoids head-hopping, though the heavy reliance on abstract language ("celestial mathematics unwinding") in peak beats tilts toward telling over embodied perception under stress.</comment>

<comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence structure shifts between short declaratives and longer, layered constructions. Information density is high, with many lines advancing concept, character, and atmosphere simultaneously. However, several phrases loop conceptually: "vanishing stars" recurs without tactical variation, and "borrowed" appears in multiple synonymous constructions ("borrowed light," "borrowed personalities," "borrowed soul") within tight proximity, creating mild synonym churn. The metaphor "sharp crystalline ache, like topaz fracturing" is vivid but arrives late without prior setup, and "lucid turbulence" is asserted rather than demonstrated through syntactic or tonal modulation in the prose itself, reducing line-level propulsion in peak beats.</comment>

<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>The synthesis—letterpress operator using transposed empathy to combat cosmic forgetting through emotional mathematics—is specific and non-obvious, avoiding stock fantasy frames. The topaz workshop, halo fragment, and vanishing stars create a coherent aesthetic that feels purposefully strange. However, the emotional core (identity dissolving through repeated empathy) has close thematic relatives in speculative fiction, and the ending's continuation without transformation or visible risk limits bold stakes. The piece commits fully to its premise but does not follow implications into a decisive choice or renunciation that would charge the synthesis with higher originality.</comment>
