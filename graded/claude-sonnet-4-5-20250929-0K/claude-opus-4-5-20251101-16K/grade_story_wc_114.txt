**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural. The story builds through layered imagery, recurring motifs (margins, instruments, peripheral awareness), and density increase toward a closure that reweights the dominant stake.

**Closure Unit:** Decisive Change with Resonant Reconfiguration — Mira descends the mountain after 17 years, moving truth from periphery to center, with visible cost (abandoning the station, confronting avoided knowledge).

**Dominant Stake:** Mira's reckoning with Lena's departure and the hidden truth encoded in margins.

<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Contradictory impulses are present and legible — wanting to know vs. not looking directly, loving vs. avoiding — and the final choice to descend is earned through the accumulation of micro-choices (picking up the illustration, smudging). However, the epiphanic realization about Lena's queer love leaps somewhat beyond what the evidence dramatizes, and "The weight of a swallowed truth, Mira realized, was not measured in grams or atmospheres" approaches diagnostic label-speak at a peak beat. Embodied emotion (trembling hands, pressure against ribs) grounds the interiority well enough to counterbalance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Orientation anchors solidly by ~60 words (Mira, weather station, post-fever). The accumulative lens holds cleanly through closure. Causality chain — fever clears perception → notices hidden writing → smudges → reads "Forgive" → understands → descends — is coherent, though the inferential leap from one word and a date to fully understanding Lena's queer love and parental rejection stretches plausibility slightly. Cost is legible in the final image: 17 years of anchoring forfeited. Closure lands with felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The weather station is rendered with tactile specificity (recording drum's scratch, frost-laced window, barometric pressure) and meaningfully constrains the narrative: isolation enables avoidance, instruments provide the certainty/probability thematic framework, and elevation creates the physical descent that mirrors the emotional one. "Colors too tender for the cold they illuminated" is excellent. The auroral dawn charges the climactic understanding. Minor deduction for some atmospheric passages verging toward decorative rather than pressure-building.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The smudging constitutes a genuine tightening — once "Forgive" is revealed, Mira can no longer maintain peripheral distance. This forecloses a live option (remaining in comfortable avoidance). The descent forecloses return. Under the accumulative lens, the cadence shift from peripheral to central is the decisive intensification. However, opposition is entirely internal with no competing external pressure, and the escalation is gentle rather than forcing a sharp trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The thematic architecture is genuinely layered — weather as probability, margins as both wisdom and avoidance, fault-tolerance as love and denial. But the final third undermines subtext with explicit moralizing: "The weight of a swallowed truth…was not measured in grams or atmospheres" directly echoes the prompt's language, and "Some truths weighed nothing until you finally held them. Some weighed everything" is aphoristic summing-up that replaces scene pressure. The final sentence itself is strong and non-moralizing, but the preceding paragraphs over-state the thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person close with a clear perceptual signature — Mira notices through measurement and edge-detection. "Something swallowed. Something with weight" demonstrates excellent compression and voice control. Rhythm modulates effectively between contemplative and urgent. Minor weakness: some late-story sentences ("fault-tolerant love that kept functioning even when the heart's data made no sense") feel more authorial-aphoristic than character-filtered, slightly breaking focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Many lines achieve high information density — the opening paragraph simultaneously establishes setting, character, and theme. "Something swallowed. Something with weight" is masterful compression. However, the final third contains paraphrase issues: the "weight of a swallowed truth" passage restates earlier imagery less effectively, and the two-sentence "Some truths weighed nothing/Some weighed everything" pattern is near-redundant. Metaphor density in the auroral paragraph crowds without adding proportional clarity. The final line is strong and image-driven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The "fault-tolerant oracle" concept is genuinely original, and the synthesis of weather prediction with emotional truth-avoidance is specific and fresh. The graphite-rubbing technique for revealing hidden writing is a nice particular. However, the underlying arc — isolated person discovers hidden message from estranged relative, descends to reconnect — is familiar literary territory. The queer revelation encoded in botanical art, while handled with restraint, is a recognizable contemporary literary trope.</comment>
