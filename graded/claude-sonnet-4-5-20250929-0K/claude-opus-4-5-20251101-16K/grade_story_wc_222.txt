<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's journey from arrogant thief to purposeful seeker shows clear arc, but the interiority leans heavily on received wisdom ("apprentice of wonder," Aldric's teachings) rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The throat-tightening at the emissary's revelation and her descent with "nothing but purpose" register emotionally, yet the transformation feels more told through the emissary's speech than earned through on-page struggle. The choice to offer everything and embrace the unknown carries cost, but the tension between her guilt and her thief's identity never complicates the path forward.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (icebound spire, pocket sundial, wrong sky) and the causal spine is clean: guilt motivates the meeting, the chess exchange dramatizes penance, the emissary's message reweights Mira's role. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—"Be the compass you could not return"—with the cost of perpetual service replacing possession. The inferred lens is Causal with Accumulative layering (the sundial, chess pieces, and compass motif build pressure). One meaningful tightening occurs when the emissary reveals the scholar's transformation, narrowing Mira's path from seeking absolution to becoming the solution. The cost is felt in her descent "carrying nothing but purpose," though the final image could press harder on what she's forfeiting.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The icebound spire, crystalline frost, and observation deck ground the exchange spatially. The pocket sundial lid recurs with purpose (truth-lens, offering, final touch). The wrongness of the sky and the emissary's liquid-starlight fabric create atmospheric specificity. The chess pieces function as micro-setting, constraining the ritual and charging the final image when they remain "black and white together." The cold is mentioned but doesn't constrain a choice. Sensory selection is good (wind-chime laugh, fogging breath), though the spire's physicality—how Mira ascends or descends—remains abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—amending a violation of the Guild's sacred code—is signaled early and tightens when Mira admits the compass was lost, forcing her to offer everything else. The emissary's revelation that the scholar transformed through grief is a meaningful reversal that reweights Mira's penance from returning an object to becoming one. Agency is clear: Mira's choice to offer service and embrace the unknown forecloses her prior identity as a possessive thief. The cost is visible in her descent "carrying nothing but purpose." One persistent constraint (the irretrievable compass) shapes the entire negotiation. Pressure coheres under the causal lens and the final act—running toward the corrected sky—charges the ending without relying on coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the chess exchange and object motifs: wonder as becoming rather than possessing, service as compass. The emissary's line "wonder is not about possessing marvels... it is about becoming one" risks stating the theme, but it's earned by the prior action and Mira's embodied response. The pocket sundial (revealing truth through illusion) and the irretrievable compass both charge the closure without shouting. The final image—"ran toward it with cautious abandon, into the unknown"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The "apprentice of wonder" frame could feel more discovered than received, but the thematic arc from theft to service is clear and specific to Mira's choices.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds steady with strong perceptual anchoring ("the sky was wrong," "her soul crack"). Diction remains controlled and voice-distinct, though phrases like "liquid starlight" and "something like prayer" drift toward stock lyricism. Dialogue is minimal but functional; the emissary's speech carries subtext and the exchange advances plot. The retrospective framing (three years ago, "the method had been established") creates minor distance wobbles but doesn't break POV. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at key beats (the scholar's weeping, Mira's throat tightening). Free indirect style is clean. No head-hopping. The final paragraph's "cautious abandon" phrase works harder than the rest of the diction to embody the tonal oxymoron.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well; sentence openings shift; information density is strong in the chess-exchange sequence. The opening "The sky was wrong again" anchors voice immediately. Minor overwriting appears in paired modifiers ("chivalrous thieves," "sacredly playful") and stock metaphors ("soul crack," "liquid starlight"). One paraphrase loop: "She had come as a thief seeking absolution. She left as an apprentice of wonder" restates the arc without added pressure. The final image "cautious abandon" lands cleanly. No major loops or scaffolding. Clarity and propulsion remain high throughout; the retrospective exposition block (~20% of text) is anchored to present choices and doesn't flatten momentum. Grammar and tense are clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The chivalrous-thief frame and Guild of Veils add specificity, but the core premise—redemption through symbolic exchange—is familiar. The chess-piece method and icebound spire offer fresh texture. The turn (scholar transformed by grief, thief must become compass) feels earned in hindsight. The oxymoron "cautious abandon" and "sacredly playful" Guild rituals show tonal ingenuity. Emotional truth (Mira's soul cracking, her months composing an apology) grounds the arc. The synthesis of theft-as-grace and wonder-as-becoming is thoughtful but not entirely non-obvious; the emotional specificity and world detail elevate it above template execution. One risk: the emissary delivering the thematic payoff rather than Mira discovering it herself.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's choices create all key turns: she initiates the meeting, admits the compass is lost (forcing the pivot), offers her service, and runs toward the unknown at closure. Present by paragraph one, involved in setup (arranging chess pieces), middle negotiation (offering secrets), and ending (descent with purpose). Her agency drives escalation and the final image. High causal pressure and closure linkage. Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The sundial lid appears in three beats: opening (reveals stars where sun should be), mid-exchange (placed as offering on the board), and the emissary's touch near the end. Its truth-revealing function primes Mira's stance and the emissary's recognition of her willingness to see truly. Present early, reweighted at closure ("wonder is not about possessing marvels" + touch). Functional but the middle use is static description; it doesn't constrain a choice during the negotiation itself. Lyric resonance is strong but causal work is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Apprentice of wonder" is named early, explained by Aldric's teaching, and restated in the penultimate paragraph. It frames the thematic arc (from possessing marvels to becoming one) but doesn't alter on-page tactics; Mira already knows the code she violated. The concept shapes stakes thematically and the closure reweights it (she finally understands), but the middle beats are driven by the chess exchange and her guilt, not by apprenticeship constraints. Present in setup and payoff; limited middle pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Sacredly playful" is introduced as a label for Guild rituals and echoed once ("game that was also a ceremony"). The chess exchange embodies the trait, but the descriptor itself doesn't constrain a choice or enable a tactic with cost. The oxymoron charges tone but remains more thematic color than causal element. Appears in first third and is implied at closure, but no visible tradeoff tied to the attribute itself. Functional but replaceable; could swap for "ritually symbolic" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Amend" is the story's engine: Mira's goal to mend her violation frames every beat, from arranging the chess pieces (penance fragments) to the emissary's test to the final transformation. The entire negotiation hinges on whether her offering suffices. Present in paragraph three, drives the middle exchange, and the emissary's directive ("Go, be the compass") redefines amendment as perpetual service. Removing "amend" collapses the stakes and closure. Indispensable across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The chess-exchange method is signaled in paragraph five, executed in the middle sequence (each piece swapped holds a fragment of penance), and the final image shows pieces "black and white together now, their secrets freed." The mechanics matter: hollow pieces contain scrolls, the emissary studies each, one makes her laugh. The method shapes the negotiation's form and charges the closure image. Present early, involved in two beats, and closure-linked. Specificity is strong (hand-carved, white/black, eight pawns with apology fragments). Near-essential.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The icebound spire anchors the setting from paragraph two onward. Its isolation and the frozen observation deck create the ritual space; the ascent/descent frame the arc. The crystalline frost is described but doesn't pressure a choice. The spire's altitude ("above the clouds") matters for the sky-wrongness signal and the barrier-thinning that enables contact. Present early and at closure (descent as light breaks), but the environment supplies context more than constraint. The cold is mentioned but never complicates action. Good integration, moderate causal work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"When the sky is wrong" is the opening hook and the condition that enables the emissary's arrival. The wrongness recurs (stars where sun should be, rippling sky, dawn correcting itself) and brackets the exchange. Time isn't tracked as a ticking clock, but the arrival of "real dawn" closes the window and prompts Mira's descent. Present in setup and ending, moderate pressure in middle (the game must finish before dawn). The timeframe enables the story but doesn't tighten tactics beat-by-beat. Solid integration, one step short of indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Embrace the unknown with open arms" is stated explicitly in Mira's offer and invoked in the final line ("into the unknown that had always been calling her name"). The motivation is present but more asserted than dramatized through conflicting wants. Mira's willingness to offer service without knowing the task shows the trait, but no on-page friction tests her openness—she never hesitates or weighs the cost of surrender. Present in middle and ending, thematically coherent, but the lack of visible struggle or competing desire keeps it from higher bands. Functional reprise, moderate cost linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Cautious abandon" is named only in the final sentence, but the oxymoron is enacted throughout: Mira's careful ritual preparation (arranging pieces, composing apology) paired with her willingness to offer everything and run toward the corrected sky. The tone modulates from reflective guilt to tense negotiation to released purpose. The emissary's wind-chime laugh and Mira's throat-tightening embody tonal complexity. The final image charges the phrase with prior particulars. Not taught early by name, but the emotional texture is coherent and the ending reprise reweights the arc. Strong lyric integration.</comment>
