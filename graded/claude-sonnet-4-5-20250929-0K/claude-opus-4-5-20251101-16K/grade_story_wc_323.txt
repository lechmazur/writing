<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent—her balancedly curious nature drives her desire to learn celestial navigation alongside edge geometry. Internal texture is present in her relationship to her grandmother's anchor link and her reverence for old methods. However, the character remains observational through most of the piece; agency manifests only in the final scene where she traces star patterns, with no on-page choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The "learning to find her way home" realization feels label-like rather than earned through dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is established cleanly in the opening (who/where/when within the first paragraph). The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens, building density through the rising journey and star revelation. The closure unit reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final moment crystallizes Mira's relationship to old and new navigation with the anchor link gesture. However, cost is primarily conceptual and implied rather than dramatically visible on the page; no prior option is foreclosed, no tactic altered. The "unfolded horizons" image at the end reweights the premise but lacks the sharp edge of sacrifice or constraint that would lift it higher.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The benthic city setting is vivid and purposeful—"constellation of bioluminescent spires," "three kilometers of Pacific darkness"—and the pressure-sealed environment frames Mira's isolation from stars. The ascending chamber and surface platform create spatial stakes. The anchor link functions effectively as micro-setting, handled twice (worn at the neck, then held toward the horizon) and charged by starlight in the final image. Sensory hierarchy is strong in the star-revelation beat ("black velvet," "eyes burned with tears"). The setting constrains choice (no stars below) and charges the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate test for environment-as-pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Mira's desire to learn true celestial navigation—is signaled early and coherent throughout. The Visitors' archive discovery provides a tightening that grants access to the surface platform. However, escalation is minimal; the journey upward encounters no reversals, and the star-viewing itself is granted without complication. The final tracing of constellations is observation, not a choice under pressure. No live option is foreclosed, no visible price paid; the piece deepens understanding but does not narrow tactics or force a trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the anchor link, edge geometry, and starlight—old and new navigation as partners rather than opposites. The "unfolded horizons" concept charges the final image without overt statement, and the piece resists a tidy moral. "Wonder required expansion—the willingness to let vastness exist without reducing it" walks close to thematic echo but remains tied to the concrete star-viewing experience. The somber marvel tone supports the thematic weight. The ending offers a resonant answer (both methods are true) through image rather than sermon, though the line "Mira was finally learning to find her way home" skirts label-speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; distance and focalization are consistent. Diction is controlled and slightly elevated but remains within Mira's plausible register as an instructor steeped in old texts. The perceptual signature is character-specific—she notices the "corroded surface" of the link, the "patient mathematics," the "wandering red eye of Mars"—filtering details through her navigation lens. No dialogue appears. Under peak emotional pressure (seeing stars), syntax compresses appropriately ("Stars. Thousands upon thousands") without register drift. Minor filter-verb stacks ("she saw," "she held") in the climax are acceptable for clarity but nudge the score slightly below high-band entry.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Clarity and momentum are generally strong; sentences advance story and atmosphere. Information density is solid in the opening (benthic city, navigation training, Visitor context) without exposition drag. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "beautiful in its alien architecture, yet eternally sunken" restates the prior image; "But starlight unfolded them—revealed the true vastness" repeats the unfolding metaphor without added pressure. Template cadence in the final third ("There was Orion. There was the wandering red eye. There was the faint smudge") becomes rhythmically predictable. Stock phrase "eyes burned with tears" and "ancient light still traveling" lower texture specificity. Apply −0.6 for loops and template stems, preventing 9+ eligibility.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The benthic city + celestial navigation frame offers a fresh synthesis, and the Visitors' own archive of pre-fold navigation is a non-obvious turn. The anchor link as inherited object is emotionally specific rather than generic. However, the core arc—character isolated from nature rediscovers it and gains insight—follows a familiar template without sharp transformation. The "old ways vs. new technology as partners" resolution is thoughtful but well-trodden. Emotional honesty is present, but the final realization lacks the surprise or risk that would push originality into higher bands. The piece executes its premise competently without bold structural or perspectival choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira as navigation instructor shapes setup (teaches edge geometry and old methods) and payoff (traces constellations, commits to teaching both). Her profession enables the archive discovery and frames her motivation. However, her choices do not create key turns; the Visitors grant access, and she observes rather than decides under pressure. Present in all three gates but causal pressure is limited to observation. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, but ornamental final action (tracing stars) −0.5, no narrowing choice −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The anchor chain link appears in three distinct beats: opening (worn, cold against chest), midpoint (remembered grandmother's words), and ending (held toward horizon under starlight). It carries symbolic weight tied to memory and continuity. The final gesture reweights its meaning (once held ships, now holds her to memory) and charges the closure image. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.4, but the link does not constrain a choice or alter tactics −0.8, swappable with any heirloom object −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Unfolded horizons" is introduced early as contrast to edge geometry's folded space and returns in the final line. It frames the thematic question and charges the closure image. However, it operates primarily as metaphor rather than shaping on-page stakes or altering tactics. Early signal +0.5, closure linkage +1.0, but ornamental use (does not narrow options) −0.8, swappable with similar metaphors −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Balancedly curious" is labeled early ("remained balancedly curious—fascinated by the new without abandoning the old") and informs her teaching both methods. It explains her motivation but does not constrain an on-page choice with visible cost. The trait is told rather than dramatized through a conflicted decision. Early signal +0.4, one beat (teaching description) +0.4, but label-only −0.6, no visible tradeoff −0.7, swappable with "open-minded" −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Expand" appears in the Visitors' announcement ("opening their archives, sharing... an expansion—not of territory, but of understanding") and returns thematically ("wonder required expansion"). It enables the archive discovery that grants surface access, a key turn. The word itself is present but the action is granted by others, not driven by Mira's choice. Early signal +0.5, one beat (archive discovery) +0.4, closure linkage +0.8, but swappable with "share" or "reveal" −0.6, summarized rather than dramatized −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Edge geometry is introduced early as the new navigation method and contrasted with starlight throughout. It shapes Mira's teaching and frames the thematic question. However, its mechanics are never detailed on the page, and it does not constrain or enable a specific choice in the plot. Early signal +0.5, thematic contrast +0.4, but ornamental (never used in action) −0.8, swappable with any advanced tech −0.5, summary-only −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Bathys-7 benthic city is established in the opening and frames Mira's isolation from starlight ("no one had seen unfiltered starlight in two generations"). The pressure-sealed environment motivates the surface journey. The ascending chamber and surface platform provide spatial stakes for the climax. Early signal +0.7, two beats (observation dome, ascending chamber) +0.9, closure linkage (surface vs. depths) +1.0, causal pressure (depth prevents stars) +0.8, but could be any underwater/underground setting −0.5, descriptive rather than tactically constraining −0.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the Visitors came" and "after first contact" establish the timeframe in the opening. The post-contact era enables edge geometry and the archive discovery. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency; decades have passed, and no clock pressures Mira's choices. Present in setup but absent from escalation and closure. Early signal +0.4, one beat (context) +0.4, but no live clock −0.9, swappable with any post-contact era −0.5, ornamental context −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira's desire to learn celestial navigation is stated early, dramatized through her teaching and archive search, and realized in the final star-tracing. It drives the archive discovery and surface journey. The motivation is consistent and shapes the ending. Early signal +0.7, three beats (teaching, archive, star-tracing) +1.4, closure linkage +1.4, causal pressure (quest drives plot) +0.9, but friction between want and cost is minimal (desire is granted, not tested) −0.8, told more than shown in conflict −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Somber marvel" is coherent throughout: the opening's melancholy beauty of the benthic city, the reverent discovery in the archives, and the tearful awe at seeing stars. Tone modulates appropriately—reflective in the opening, anticipatory during ascent, emotionally heightened at the star revelation. The phrase "somber marvel of it overwhelmed her" directly names the tone, which is a minor slip, but the execution through "eyes burned with tears" and "patient distance" embodies it without relying on the label. Early establishment +0.6, modulates with pressure +0.8, charges final image +1.2, coherent across beats +0.9, but one label moment −0.3, slightly static (reverent throughout) −0.4.</comment>
