<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vera's interior is specific and grounded ("sharply observant eyes," methodical reconstruction work), and her professional identity shapes perception throughout. The final turn—understanding that the survivors weaponize myth—reads as earned by her investigative journey, though the shift from debunker to silent collaborator could show more internal friction or cost. Elka's revelation "We knew" lands with weight, but her motivation for disclosure to Vera remains slightly opaque. Minor deduction for the ease with which Vera accepts the reversal without visible struggle over her journalistic ethics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal. Orientation anchors clearly (Vera at orchard perimeter, post-liquidation wasteland). The reconstruction of shredded documents creates a clean because/therefore chain: discovery of stillpoint science → understanding of corporate cover-up → confrontation with survivors → revelation of their tactical myth-maintenance. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: "truth was just another tool" reweights Vera's entire debunking premise with visible cost (she packs evidence but won't publish). The cost is conceptual and professional—her silence forecloses her career mission—and the final image of the orchard "keeping its secrets" charges the ending cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The wasteland/orchard binary is vivid and purposeful: dust devils dying at the perimeter, corrugated shelters, "instrumentation grooves cut into the pillar." Spatial choreography tracks cleanly (fence → admin building half-mile into dead zone → return to orchard). The stillpoint functions as micro-setting, constraining both corporate and survivor choices. The cracked diamond's "fatal flaw" and "scientific precision masquerading as sacred geometry" charge the final image when Elka touches it. Strong sensory economy throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Vera's mission to expose the curse as fraud. Pressure tightens when she discovers the geomagnetic truth, then deepens when Elka reveals the survivors' pragmatic adoption of the lie. The escalation is causal (each discovery narrows her interpretive options) and culminates in a trade-off: publish the corporate malfeasance or protect the orchard's tactical myth. The cost is clear—she packs evidence but leaves it unexposed—and forecloses her debunking purpose. One meaningful tightening with visible professional sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the flawed diamond as both scientific instrument and protective myth, "truth was just another tool," the layered conspiracy (corporate greed / myth / survivor pragmatism). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—Vera's silence becomes complicity, reweighting her career premise without moralizing. The final image of the orchard "keeping its secrets in the shadow of a flawed diamond" charges the thematic question of when lies serve justice. No overt thesis statements; complexity arises from Vera's choice to protect the exploited rather than expose the full truth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Vera; perceptual signature is sharp and professional ("sharply observant eyes," "noted that too"). Dialogue is spare and functional; Elka's "We knew" and "The curse keeps us safe from them" carry subtext and goal. Narrative distance is consistent, though a few filter verbs ("she saw now") slightly dull immediacy. Diction fits Vera's investigative register ("geomagnetic anomaly," "calibration tool") without overreach. Minor deduction for occasional filter stacking in the reconstruction scene.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is clean and propulsive with high information density ("shredded documents," "bags of paper strips," "geological survey"). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening/closing images frame the orchard's impossibility effectively. Minor loop detected: "sharply observant eyes" appears twice with near-identical phrasing. A few filter verbs cluster in the lantern-lit reconstruction passage ("she noted," "she began to intuit"). No major scaffolding or cadence runs, but the slight repetition and filter density prevent entry to the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The layered conspiracy (corporate → mythic → pragmatic survivor defense) offers a fresh angle on the "debunker meets real magic" premise by inverting it: the magic is fake, but the survivors choose the lie strategically. The stillpoint as geomagnetic anomaly rather than supernatural force is specific and grounded. However, the core structure—investigator uncovers hidden corporate malfeasance in a wasteland—reads as familiar dystopian-thriller territory. The ending's moral calculus (silence as protection) is thoughtful but not wholly unexpected. Solid synthesis without high risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera drives three key beats: entering the dead zone, reconstructing letters to discover the stillpoint science, and confronting Elka with the truth. Her decision to pack evidence but leave it unpublished directly shapes closure. Present early, causally active in middle discovery, and her silence is the final cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The diamond appears in three beats: initial description with curse warning, Vera's realization of "instrumentation grooves" and "artificially created" flaw, and Elka touching it in the final scene while explaining the tactical lie. Its dual identity (scientific marker / protective myth) charges the closure image. Reweighted meaning across all three appearances.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The stillpoint is the story's hinge: corporate secrecy around it caused the disaster, its properties protect the orchard, and survivor knowledge of it justifies their myth-maintenance. Shapes Vera's investigative goal, the middle discovery (geomagnetic anomaly), and the ethical choice at closure. Indispensable to plot logic and theme.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Sharply observant" is demonstrated twice on-page: tracking dust devils' behavior at the perimeter and noticing instrumentation grooves on the pillar. Enables middle discovery but does not constrain a choice with visible cost; her observation skill never fails or creates a trade-off. Functional but lacks tradeoff pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Vera intuits the stillpoint concept after piecing together memo fragments ("began to intuit the shape of something larger"). This action drives the middle turn (understanding corporate strategy) and sets up the final confrontation. Present in one decisive beat; somewhat swappable with "deduce" or "reconstruct," but the gradual assembly process justifies the verb.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Reassembling shredded letters is signaled early (abandoned admin building), staged across a full scene ("spread them across her workstation," "strip by strip," "hours passed"), and produces the key discovery (stillpoint science, corporate cover-up). The method's manual labor and patience reflect Vera's investigative identity. Mechanics matter and shape the middle turn; removal would break the discovery logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The orchard setting supplies three pressures: impossible life signals the mystery, dust storm boundary demonstrates the stillpoint effect, and the survivors' dependence on the location stakes their myth-defense. Appears in opening, middle (admin building "half a mile into the dead zone"), and closing image. The wasteland/orchard contrast charges every beat and the final image of green impossibility.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the liquidation" frames backstory (three years ago, corporate flight, declared uninhabitable) but does not tighten present decisions. The timeline supplies context for the curse myth's invention and Elka's prior discovery of papers "years ago," yet no present clock pressures Vera's choices. Functional context; lacks urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vera's drive to "excavate truth from comfortable lies" is dramatized early (career summary, debunking viral hoaxes/cults), tested in the reconstruction scene, and friction emerges at closure when she chooses to preserve the survivors' lie. The final cost—packing evidence without exposing it—directly conflicts with her stated mission. Want versus ethical cost is legible.</comment>
