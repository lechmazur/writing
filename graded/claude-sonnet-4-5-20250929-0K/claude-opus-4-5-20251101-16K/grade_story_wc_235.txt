<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied jealousy toward past selves that drives her isolation to the cabin. The chronicler discipline provides a credible lens for her detachment. However, the emotional arc flattens in the middle third—jealousy is declared and analyzed but not tested by a concrete choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The ending gesture ("soared into sleep like falling upward") feels more lyric than earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens inferred as Accumulative/Textural: the piece accumulates reflections on temporal fracture and feral nostalgia, building toward the final image of soaring into sleep. Closure reads as Charged Poise—Mira crystallizes her stance as chronicler despite the headstone, choosing to continue the work with "jaded wonder." Cost is oblique but legible: she accepts permanent chronological confusion and the loss of certainty about which life is real. The escalation is textural rather than causal; the piece deepens rather than tightens, which fits the lens but limits urgency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cabin and birch bark scroll are handled purposefully, anchoring early and returning at closure. The frost-touched window, wood stove, and mountain wind supply concrete sensory grounding filtered through Mira's chronicler perspective. The scroll constrains her method and charges the final image—she waits for the narrative to "write itself through her dreaming mind." Spatial choreography is clear throughout the single-location scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Mira must make sense of feral nostalgia and the headstone without losing her chronicler discipline. The piece deepens rather than escalates—jealousy is analyzed, not tested by a decision that narrows options. The resolution is a recommitment to her practice, but no visible trade-off or foreclosed path appears on the page. The textural lens allows this, but the lack of a concrete choice under pressure keeps the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the birch bark method, temporal fracture, and "jaded wonder" without thesis statements. The final image—"soared into sleep like falling upward"—offers a non-literal answer to the question of how to live with chronological confusion: accept the discipline and continue. "Feral nostalgia" as a concept is vivid and particular. No moralizing; the piece trusts ambiguity and specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is strong: Mira's chronicler lens colors every observation, from "clinical even now" to "jaded wonder." Diction remains consistent—controlled, reflective, with purposeful compression ("fire invented, fire worshipped, fire forgotten"). No head-hopping. Minor filter-verb density in reflective passages ("she could feel," "she felt") slightly dulls immediacy but fits the contemplative mode. Voice is distinct and stable under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme. Minor scaffold appears: "The feeling wasn't grief, exactly" is a small hedge, and "Perhaps tonight…Perhaps she would" loops slightly without adding pressure. "Fire invented, fire worshipped, fire forgotten" is vivid but the appositive structure recurs ("clinical even now," "officially deceased"). No clarity breaks; propulsion is steady but not urgent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Feral nostalgia" and the lucid dream chronicler are fresh syntheses; the birch bark scroll method is specific and non-obvious. The headstone premise risks familiarity but is transformed through Mira's chronicler discipline and temporal fracture. The final image—soaring into sleep while a younger Mira "almost saw her watching"—feels earned in hindsight. Risk-taking is present (temporal confusion, reflective density) but the middle third leans toward contemplation over confrontation, limiting boldness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lucid dream chronicler shapes Mira's lens and method throughout. Present in setup (birch bark scroll), middle (recording jealousy), and ending (waiting for narrative to write itself). Drives two beats: the decision to record feral nostalgia clinically and the choice to sleep and soar again. Causal pressure is moderate—the role enables her detachment but does not force a trade-off. Closure linkage is present but oblique.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Birch bark scroll appears in three beats: unrolling at arrival, writing observations, placing beside cot at end. Handles it physically each time. Returns with reweighted meaning—initially a repository of past work, finally a patient witness waiting for "strange truths." Enables her method and charges the final image. Specific properties (birch bark as medium) matter to the chronicler identity. Cost connection is implicit but legible.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Feral nostalgia is named early, analyzed at length, and drives Mira's trek to the cabin. Shapes stakes: she must domesticate this "wild, untamed longing" through chronicle. Present in middle (jealousy of past selves) and ending (watching younger Mira with "jaded wonder"). Constrains her approach—she cannot escape nostalgia, only record it. Cost is conceptual: accepting permanent loss of past certainty. Not swappable; the specificity of "feral" (wild, untamed, teeth) is essential.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Chronologically confused is seeded early ("after enough years…chronological confusion became…a way of being") and returns throughout: timestamps that contradict, grave date wrong or right or both, "all selves exist simultaneously." Enables her to accept the headstone paradox and constrains her ability to know which timeline is real. Present in ending: "chronologically confused, temporally fractured, officially deceased." One visible trade-off: she can no longer wake with certainty about which life is real. Drives the core conflict.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Soar appears in setup (nineteen-year-old lifting off with exhilaration), middle (perhaps tonight she would soar again), and ending ("soared into sleep like falling upward"). Signals the dream-walking ability and frames the final image. The ending turn—soaring as falling upward—reweights prior mentions with paradox. Not easily swappable; the verb carries both freedom and disorientation. However, soaring does not create a concrete choice or trade-off; it functions more as thematic resonance than plot driver.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Getting jealous of past selves is the inciting pressure: Mira envies the nineteen-year-old, the twenty-six-year-old, "every past self who had woken…with certainty." Drives the middle third (recording jealousy, analyzing feral nostalgia) and is present at closure ("something more evolved than jealousy"). Shapes her method: she must distill jealousy into narrative. Cost: accepting that jealousy "represents fundamental misunderstanding" but feeling its teeth anyway. Two beats; causal pressure moderate; closure linkage clear.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mountain ranger cabin anchors the scene from the opening line. Supplies tools (wood stove, cot, frost-touched window) that Mira uses. Provides isolation necessary for uncontaminated observation. Returns at ending: the fire crackles, stars burn, cabin as witness to her soaring. Constrains her choices—she came here "far from any other dreamers" and "any other graves." Not swappable; the remoteness is essential. However, cabin functions more as stable container than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>After seeing your own grave frames the entire piece and drives the inciting question. Present in setup (three days after standing before headstone) and middle (feral nostalgia "since seeing that headstone"). Ending references the plan to "hike down to the grave again." However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—no clock pressure, no urgency tied to the three-day window. The grave discovery is more premise than active constraint; the story could function similarly if the grave had been seen weeks ago.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>To distill chaos into narrative is Mira's core motivation, stated early ("life's work: discipline of distilling chaos into narrative") and tested throughout. Drives two beats: recording feral nostalgia clinically, forcing herself to continue the chronicle despite emotional upheaval. Shapes the ending: "stories could save her from chaos," scroll waiting to receive truths. Friction is present—"the clinical tone fractured" because detachment is hard under this pressure. Cost: she must continue the work despite losing certainty. Causal and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Jaded wonder is named explicitly by the mentor, demonstrated through Mira's "tired appreciation" of fire, and modulates with pressure. Present in setup (fire observed with jaded wonder), middle (jealousy analyzed with detachment), and ending (watching younger self "with something more evolved than jealousy—with the jaded wonder"). Tone charges the final image: she accepts impossibility as "the only sane response." Coherent throughout; the oxymoron (jaded + wonder) fits the temporal fracture. Not static; it deepens from observation to acceptance.</comment>
