<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to protect vulnerable voices is clear and consistent, driving her shield-move against the predatory signal. Her curiosity trait appears but functions more as label than demonstrated contradiction under pressure. The daughter's grief transforms credibly through the connection, though her interiority remains thin. Minor deduction for the generic "persistently curious by nature" authorial assertion rather than embodied demonstration in a pivotal choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira crystallizes her ongoing commitment with visible cost (trembling hands, no answers). The causal lens holds—hearing aid setup pays off, predatory interference creates escalation, successful connection alters the daughter's state. Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraphs. One meaningful tightening (predatory signal forces the shield choice) suffices for this length. Cost is felt in Mira's physical reaction and the piece's recursive final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium provides atmospheric constraint and the hearing aids function as micro-setting that drives the plot mechanism. Spatial choreography remains clear (station, glass panels, the woman's approach). The twilight timeframe and "reeling hush" texture support tone effectively. Deduction for postcard phrases ("mist-clad sanctuary," "failing light") that lean decorative rather than filtering through Mira's professional POV priorities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protecting vulnerable voices during connection) signals early and tightens when the predatory frequency intrudes. Mira's shield-choice is agency under pressure with visible cost (disorientation, trembling). The daughter's emotional arc from poisonous grief to peace provides closure consequence. One clear reversal (interference threat) narrows options and the resolution costs Mira physically. Pressure coheres under the causal lens throughout.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme of listening, mediation, and incidental heroism emerges from concrete action (the shield-choice, the hearing aid method). The final image of Mira preparing for the next threshold offers recursive resonance without moralizing. Deduction for the intrusive label "incidental heroism, they called it later" which tells theme rather than trusting the dramatization, and for "the curiosity that drove her offered no answers, only more questions"—a near-platitude that abstracts rather than charges the moment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with strong perceptual filter (spectral equipment, the battered hearing aid). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven with subtext in the mother's "I heard every word." Mira's voice is distinct in her reverent handling of objects and professional diction. Deduction for "could only assure her with a gentle nod"—an awkward filter construction—and for slight diction elevation ("reeling hush," "surrendered to night") that occasionally drifts from the contact-tracer register under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Clear propulsion through the connection sequence. Deductions accumulate: paraphrase loop ("The daughter wept openly now" restates visible crying from prior beat), template cadence in the opening exposition block ("She was what they called... It wasn't glamorous work. Most nights, nothing happened"), and stock metaphor "carrying her mother's voice like a gift" in the penultimate paragraph. Mixed metaphor: mist "contracts" then "lifts" without spatial logic.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The hearing-aid frequency-tracking method offers a fresh angle on afterlife-contact stories, and the predatory-signal complication avoids pure sentiment. Mira's job title and the Atrium setting provide specificity. Deductions for reliance on familiar grief-reconciliation arc, the threshold/liminal-space trope without deep transformation, and the comfort-closure that grants symmetric satisfaction (daughter sleeps peacefully, Mira returns to work) without deeper cost or ambiguity. The "incidental heroism" frame reads as prompt-fulfillment rather than organic discovery.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Contact tracer present from opening, frames the methodology, and drives the shield-choice at climax. Her decision to draw the predatory signal toward herself is the story's key causal turn. Appears in closure image preparing for the next threshold. Strong setup, middle agency, and payoff all clear.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Photograph appears in two beats: initial handover and the daughter's final press to heart. It establishes the mother's hearing aid model, enabling the plot mechanism. Does not constrain a choice or carry reweighted meaning at closure; functions as credible prop. Mid-band functional presence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Incidental heroism shapes the shield-choice beat ("she hadn't planned for heroism—she'd simply reacted") and is explicitly named afterward. The concept influences one key action with cost (disorientation, trembling). Deduction for authorial tell ("they called it later") rather than full embodiment, and for arriving at climax rather than being seeded earlier to frame expectations.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Curiosity is asserted ("persistently curious by nature") and mentioned as driving her to the work, but does not visibly constrain or enable an on-page choice with cost. It remains label-only without demonstrated tradeoff in a pivotal moment. Present in setup and closure reflection but functionally swappable with "dedication" or similar trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Assure" appears in one key beat: Mira's nod and words to the daughter after the connection. The action provides emotional closure for the secondary character but does not drive a major plot turn. Could be replaced with another reassurance gesture without altering story logic. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Hearing-aid pulse-tracking is signaled early, drives the connection mechanism, and enables the predatory-signal complication. The method shapes two beats (establishing connection, shielding interference) and its specific constraints (faint pulses, static spaces) make modern equipment inadequate. Strong causal role and irreplaceability. Mira's grandmother's device adds specificity and closure-image weight.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mist-clad atrium at twilight establishes atmosphere, provides the threshold-space logic, and the contracting/lifting mist tracks emotional beats. The setting enables the "boundary between worlds" premise and the twilight timeframe gates the action window. Micro-setting (the station, equipment) supports choice. Strong setup and tone integration; minor deduction for decorative phrasing that doesn't always constrain.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"When the dead call" timeframe is established early and gates the narrative window, creating urgency. The "narrow window when signals could slip through" tightens available time for connection. Does not visibly shape tactics within the scene (no live countdown pressure), but frames the encounter's possibility. Functional temporal constraint without moment-to-moment escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Protecting vulnerable voices is stated as motivation in the opening and directly drives the shield-choice at climax. Mira's decision to draw predatory interference toward herself embodies the motivation with physical cost. The trait shapes two beats and closure preparation. Minor deduction for being told ("Her motivation had always been simple") rather than fully discovered through early micro-choice friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Reeling hush" appears in opening and closure, establishing and sustaining a tone of muted intensity. The tone modulates appropriately (suspense during interference, gentle resolution afterward) without breaking the established register. Mist imagery and whispered frequencies reinforce the hush throughout. The tone charges the final image of Mira listening alone. Strong coherence and purposeful modulation under pressure.</comment>
