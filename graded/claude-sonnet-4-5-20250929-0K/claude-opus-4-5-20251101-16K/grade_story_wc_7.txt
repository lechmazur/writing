<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent—memory preservation through culinary craft—but her interiority relies heavily on reflective summary rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The memory-tasting gift is asserted but never dramatized under pressure; we're told she tastes memories but never see her processing one in real time with embodied conflict. The final choice to distribute fruit is signaled from the start without meaningful internal resistance or cost that forecloses a live path. Mother's memory loss provides backstory weight but remains summary-only, never complicating a present choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who/where/when anchor by the opening paragraph—pass. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: greenhouse work accumulates symbolic weight toward the harvest closure. However, the closure lacks visible cost; Mira picks fruit and plans distribution with no on-page consequence, sacrifice, or tightening that forecloses an option. The alignment functions as atmospheric deadline rather than a causal constraint that narrows tactics. The ending offers thematic repricing (memory as beautiful rebellion) but the conceptual cost remains asserted rather than dramatized—no loss, no friction, no price paid in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse is vividly anchored with corroded door, cracked pots, fractured glass, and serves as micro-setting for the entire scene. Sensory selection is strong: earth, decay, silver light, gold-veined leaves. The pruning shears constrain her method (purposeful cuts vs. scattered energy), and the alignment's light charges the harvest moment. Spatial choreography is clean. The setting enables her work but does not pressure a difficult choice; it remains backdrop rather than antagonist.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve memory through cultivated fruit—is signaled early. The pruning action offers one tightening (directing energy vs. fragmentation), but it encounters no resistance or complication; Mira's expertise meets no friction. The alignment provides atmospheric deadline rather than escalating pressure; no reversal or trade-off tests her commitment. The ending declares future distribution without on-page cost or narrowed options. Agency exists but operates unopposed, reducing escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—memory as beauty, gentle rebellion through care—emerges organically from greenhouse work and fruit cultivation rather than stated thesis. The pruning metaphor (shaping to concentrate wisdom) and synaptic plasticity conceit integrate cleanly. "Feed people. Remind them who they were" avoids sermonic tone. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("harvest would take root in minds ready to remember") rather than letting the image resonate without gloss. The Council's memory suppression provides thematic antagonist but remains off-page context.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds steady; psychic distance modulates purposefully between immediate sensation (hinges singing, fruit warm to touch) and reflective summary. Diction is controlled and character-particular: "impossible hope," "kitchen work," "pruning with intention." Perceptual signature (taste memories, gardener's eye) distinguishes Mira's lens. However, heavy reflection (~35% of text) occasionally flattens present pressure, and the voice converges toward essayistic clarity in expository blocks (synaptic plasticity explanation reads more authorial than character-filtered under stress).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; opening and closing images carry charge. Information density is generally high. However, template cadence appears in reflection blocks: "She thought about why she did this. Not for revenge... No, Mira worked for..." The synaptic plasticity passage reads as exposition insert rather than urgent thought. Minor scaffold: "This was her gentle rebellion—not bombs or speeches, but kitchen work. Feed people. Remind them..." restates the same content. Figurative language (libraries and starlight, rusted tools, silver-gray bark) is vivid but occasionally stacks without propulsion. No paraphrase loops in peak beats; proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The memory-tasting chef and knowledge fruit tree offer a fresh synthesis; the gentle rebellion frame avoids militant clichés. Pruning as metaphor for focused wisdom and synaptic plasticity as mechanism add specificity. However, the core arc—underground resistance cultivating forbidden knowledge to restore agency—is widely used in speculative fiction, and the story does not transform it through unexpected moral calculus or embodied cost. The alignment provides atmosphere but no irreversible consequence. Emotional truth (mother's blank gaze) anchors the premise, yet the ending's safety ("there was work to do") avoids bold risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Chef who can taste memories is present as biography and backstory anchor (grandmother's hands, first kiss strawberry, seed tasting like libraries) but the gift never drives an on-page choice or complication. Mira does not taste anything during the scene; her culinary skill remains latent. The trait colors backstory but does not constrain present action or enable a key turn. Setup clear; development and payoff absent. Swappable with "memory keeper" or similar role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Knowledge fruit seed appears in setup (grandmother's pocket, tasting like libraries), drives middle action (tree grew from seed, pruning shapes fruit), and produces the closure harvest (twelve glowing fruit). It constrains method (must be pruned, responds to alignment light) and the fruit's properties (synaptic plasticity, memory restoration) shape her plan. Specific irreplaceability high; the seed's origin and mechanics are integral. Visible cost is low—harvest succeeds without sacrifice—preventing higher score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Gentle rebellion is named explicitly and shapes tactics on the page: "not bombs or speeches, but kitchen work," pruning rather than destruction, feeding rather than fighting. It informs her method (careful cultivation vs. confrontation) and the ending's distribution plan. However, the concept remains thematic overlay rather than source of friction; no moment where gentleness costs her speed, safety, or reach. Present in setup and closure; middle development is assertion rather than dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Informally wise appears as backstory summary: "whispered conversations with old gardeners and faded books, gathering wisdom from margins and memory." It enables her pruning knowledge but is told rather than demonstrated through on-page problem-solving or a tradeoff between informal insight and formal gaps. No cost tied to the attribute; her informal learning encounters no friction or blind spot. Setup present; development and payoff are label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Prune drives the middle beat: Mira's deliberate cuts concentrate the tree's energy, shaping fruit quality (fragmented truths vs. powerful restoration). The action demonstrates her expertise and the story's metaphor (shaping growth, directing strength). However, pruning faces no complication—no wrong cut, no hesitation, no competing method. It succeeds without cost or reversal. Present in setup (pulling shears), development (snip, snip), and implicit in closure (concentrated fruit). Essential to the metaphor but unopposed in execution.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Synaptic plasticity is explained mid-scene as the fruit's mechanism: "restores the brain's ability to form new connections, to change and grow and remember." It provides scientific grounding for the magic but does not shape tactics or constrain method on the page. Mira does not test, adjust, or grapple with synaptic mechanics; it remains exposition. Introduced past the 40% mark as explanation rather than action driver. Cap 4.6 for late arrival; functional but swappable with "neural reset" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rusted greenhouse frames the entire scene: corroded door, cracked pots, fractured glass ceiling, and houses the tree. Its decay contrasts the tree's vitality (beauty from ruins). The broken glass filters alignment light to ripen fruit—environmental feature enables the harvest. Spatial anchors are clear throughout. The greenhouse pressures theme (creation from decay) and supplies resources (shelter, light transmission) but does not force a difficult spatial choice or tactic shift. Setup, development, and payoff all strong; closure participation via light and shelter.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Once-in-a-lifetime celestial alignment is signaled in opening paragraph ("Tonight was the alignment") and structures the scene's urgency. The moons' convergence triggers fruit ripening and provides atmospheric charge at closure ("unrepeatable in her lifetime"). However, the timeframe does not tighten tactics—Mira completes pruning without time pressure, clock is not tracked, and no choice is forced by the narrowing window. Present in setup and closure; middle urgency is asserted rather than felt. Lyric reprise with mild cost (singularity acknowledged).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>To create something beautiful from the ruins is stated explicitly mid-scene and drives her method: careful cultivation, purposeful shaping, feeding rather than fighting. It explains why she persists and colors the ending's resonance ("something beautiful... something impossible"). However, the desire is told rather than tested—no moment where beauty costs efficiency, no friction between aesthetic care and urgent need. Present in setup (greenhouse as ruin), middle articulation, and closure framing. Desire shapes lens but lacks embodied conflict or tradeoff.</comment>
