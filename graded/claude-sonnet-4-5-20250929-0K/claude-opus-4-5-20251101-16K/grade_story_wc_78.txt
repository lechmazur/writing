**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural — density builds through layered sound-making and atmospheric intensification toward storm crossing; closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (earned endurance with visible physical cost).

**Closure Unit:** RR — Veluna emerges battered but whole, rain barrels overflowing, exhausted with fallen apples around her. Cost is physical damage and exhaustion; the boundary current is crossed.

**Dominant Stake:** Survival (freshwater scarcity forcing dangerous crossing).

<question>1</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Veluna's motivation is clear (freshwater scarcity → must cross boundary current) and her actions align with her role, but she functions more as archetype than individual. No contradictory impulses act in scene—she knows her method and executes it without internal resistance, doubt, or competing values. The "exhausted hand" at closure provides embodied cost but arrives without prior moments of genuine struggle against her competence. No micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values with visible tradeoffs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly within ~50 words. Under the Accumulative lens, density escalates from preparation to storm impact, and the closure shows visible cost ("battered but whole," fallen apples, exhaustion). However, the causal mechanism—how the sound-cocoon actually transforms storm chaos into safety—is asserted rather than dramatized; "the chaos found structure" resolves the central problem through declaration. The plan executes without complication, yielding a linear arc with no meaningful constraint on the resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The floating orchard is genuinely vivid and specific: clay pots with threading roots, salvaged telephone pole as mast, driftwood worn by decades of salt. Setting directly constrains choices (freshwater shortage, boundary current as barrier, raft surfaces as instruments). Sensory detail crosses auditory, tactile, and visual registers with Veluna's perceptual bias toward sound and weather. The environment charges the final image (fallen apples, overflowing rain barrels).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake (survival via freshwater) is signaled early and the boundary current provides clear external danger. Under the Accumulative lens, sound density does escalate through the preparation. However, no reversal, adaptation, or forced trade-off occurs—Veluna's plan works as intended with surface-level damage. The storm never truly threatens to overwhelm her method; "the chaos found structure" arrives without a moment where her approach fails or must be altered. Cost is visible but lightweight for the declared stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The obstacle-as-instrument theme is stated explicitly at least four times: "every obstacle contained hidden frequencies," "chaos was simply music no one had yet learned to play," "She was turning the obstacle into an instrument," and the final paragraph's "the boundary between obstacle and instrument had dissolved entirely." This last instance is a severe thematic echo in the closing paragraph (−0.7). The final three sentences moralize rather than let the image resonate (−0.6). Theme is imposed rather than emergent from dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited; Veluna's perceptual signature (sound, vibration, cloud-reading) is consistent. The prose carries a lyrical, oceanic rhythm that modulates with intensity. Weakness: some elevated diction ("restless euphony," "invisible architectures of sound") reads as authorial ornamentation rather than character-filtered perception. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance holds at medium-close without leaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Strong individual lines ("its rubber tip frayed from striking surfaces never meant to sing") coexist with overwriting: "drawing invisible architectures of sound that would persist long after each note faded" does one job stretched across many words. Paraphrase loop: "kept playing, kept generating her fractals of sound, kept sketching resonance against the darkness." Template cadence: multiple "She [verb]" sentence openings in the preparation sequence. The final paragraph stacks theme statements that summarize rather than show, dulling the closure image. Metaphor density in peak beats (storm crossing) is high without clear pattern-teaching.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The floating orchard world-building is genuinely inventive—bound driftwood raft carrying three generations, the xylophone mallet as prophetic tool, fractal sound-making as navigation. The specific synthesis (post-flood survival + musical prophecy + botanical vessel) feels fresh even if the "communion with nature through art" arc is familiar. The dubbing of the storm as Firstmother is a lovely conceptual touch. The piece commits fully to its premise without retreating into explanation.</comment>
