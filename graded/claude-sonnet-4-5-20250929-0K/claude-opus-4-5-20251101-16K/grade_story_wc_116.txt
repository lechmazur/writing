<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The chronicle keeper is rendered through evocative images—gripping reality loosely, shifting between solid and shimmer—but these remain largely atmospheric labels rather than embodied contradictions that drive on-page choices. Her "purpose" to witness without judgment is declared repeatedly but never tested by a competing impulse or cost that would reveal character under pressure. The piece offers rich interiority but no micro-choices that alter tactics or foreclose a path with visible consequence. Emotional states are asserted ("the silence grows too heavy") rather than embodied through perception and action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: library decay, swan folds, obsidian refuge, and seeker traces layer to build density and modulate tone. The final paragraph attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through pattern and cadence, reweighting "crumbling peace" and "witness again," but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse—no specific forfeiture or stance crystallization is legible on the page. The circular structure (swan → refuge → library → swan) is taught early and held, satisfying lens coherence, but the closure image does not deliver a decisive tightening or a felt price that redefines prior material. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly within the first third, avoiding penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The catacombs, obsidian refuge, and decaying library are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (dripping water, volcanic glass, roots pushing through ceilings) that reflects the keeper's long perspective. The underground river's pulse and the black glass sanctuary provide a concrete spatial contrast that structures the keeper's rhythmic return. The swan—held, traced, folded—functions as micro-setting that charges the ritual and appears in the closure image, meeting the gate for environment constraining a recurring choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—sustaining the capacity to witness without judgment—is signaled early but remains abstract and untested. No on-page reversal or narrowing choice appears; the keeper's cycle (burrow → refuge → library → repeat) is described as established routine rather than a decision under new pressure. The seeker's torn page and the collapsing shelf are potential complications, but neither alters the keeper's tactics or imposes a visible cost. Escalation requires one meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens; here the final paragraph restates the循环 without deepening or foreclosing an option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from imagery: decay as transformation, witness without judgment, regenerative silence. The piece avoids overt moralizing and allows "crumbling peace" to carry complexity—beauty in breakdown, serenity in surrender. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("This is enough. This has always been enough.") that risks stating rather than dramatizing the question. The swan and obsidian refuge offer recurring motifs that shift slightly in weight, though the return does not fully charge the closure with a non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Voice is distinctive and sustained: lyric diction, controlled psychic distance, a texture of patient observation and geological timescales. Perceptual signature is consistent—long view, geological patience, attention to roots and stone—and syntax modulates appropriately (longer, layered sentences during reflection; shorter bursts for present action). No dialogue is present. The piece maintains stable third-person limited focalization with no head-hopping, and the register remains elevated but coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence structures and vivid figurative language ("grips reality loosely, the way one holds water"). However, the piece exhibits paraphrase loops and template cadence in several passages: "watched the shelves bow...watched moss claim...watched spiders weave" cycles a single stem; the final two paragraphs recycle "The river moves. The library breathes" and similar constructions. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent, though "cryptic folds" and "regenerative silence" are asserted more than shown. Information density is moderate; some lines restate concepts without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The premise—immortal librarian in decaying catacombs practicing witness without judgment—offers a lyric angle on entropy and acceptance. The swan as navigational/emotional tool and the obsidian refuge as healing chamber provide specific, grounded details that avoid generic fantasy tropes. However, the emotional arc and thematic resolution (crumbling is beautiful, witness is enough) follow a familiar trajectory without a sharp, non-obvious inflection. The seeker's torn page arrives as a grace note but does not transform the keeper's stance or reweight prior material in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The chronicle keeper is present throughout and her witnessing role frames the piece, satisfying setup and development. However, her choices are cyclical routines (trace swan, visit refuge, return) rather than decisions that narrow options or alter tactics under new pressure. She observes the seeker and shelf collapse without acting, and the closure restates her stance without a visible turn or cost. Meets two gates (setup, lyric reprise) but lacks causal pressure or closure linkage with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The obsidian refuge appears in the opening third, is visited mid-piece, and returns in the final section, satisfying setup, development, and closure participation. Its function—offering regenerative silence—shapes the keeper's tactics (she returns to rebuild capacity). However, its role is consistent rather than evolving; no reweighted meaning or charged reprise at closure. Meets all three gates with modest causal pressure but lacks irreplaceability or a transformed final use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Regenerative silence is introduced early, dramatized at the obsidian refuge ("not the absence of sound but something more profound"), and invoked in the closing lines. It shapes the keeper's return to the refuge (a tactical choice) and frames her capacity to continue witnessing. However, it remains largely conceptual; the mechanics and cost of seeking or losing regenerative silence are not tested on the page. Meets setup and closure participation with modest stake-shaping but lacks middle conflict or visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Grips reality loosely" is established in the opening third and illustrated through the keeper's shifts between solid and shimmer. It appears in the closure paragraph ("loosely gripping this moment"). However, the trait is described rather than constraining an on-page action with cost; no scene shows her failing to grip tightly when needed or paying a price for fluidity. Meets setup and lyric reprise but lacks development beat with visible tradeoff, capping at 4.6 per missing-middle-development gate.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Burrow" is introduced early (the keeper burrows into the swan's folds) and detailed in a dedicated passage where she traces creases and travels "without moving." It recurs in the description of seekers who "burrow through the stacks." However, no major turn traces uniquely to this action; the keeper's use of the swan is part of her established routine rather than a choice that redefines options. Meets setup and development with modest causal role but lacks closure-specific pressure or irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The origami swan is introduced in the opening third, handled across multiple beats (tracing folds, holding echoes, placing the seeker's page in its outermost fold), and returns in the closure paragraph ("fold that knowing into the swan"). Its mechanics—cryptic folds holding living moments—are specified and shape the keeper's tactics. Meets all three gates with beat involvement and causal pressure. Slightly swappable (another ritual object could serve), limiting irreplaceability, but the specificity of "well-worn paper" and "folds" charges the image.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The overgrown library in catacombs is established immediately and detailed throughout: roots as scholars, vines reading, moss claiming sections, spiders weaving texts, shelves collapsing. It supplies the central pressure (patient crumbling) and resources (books, seekers, the torn page). Spatial choreography across catacombs and refuge is clear. The setting drives the keeper's witnessing role and appears in the closure beat. Meets all three gates with strong causal pressure and closure linkage, approaching essential status.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Across the drift of untold seasons" is named in the opening and echoed in "the last seeker" and the keeper's memory of transformations. However, the timeframe remains atmospheric rather than tightening decisions; no live clock or season-specific constraint alters tactics. The piece operates in deep time without urgency or a deadline that would narrow options. Meets setup and thematic presence but lacks development and closure pressure, capping near 4.6 per missing-middle gate; vague tracking lowers further to 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The motivation "to witness change without judgment" is declared in the opening third, shapes the keeper's stance toward seekers and decay, and returns in the closure paragraph. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants; no scene shows the keeper tempted to judge or intervene with visible cost for restraint. Meets setup and closure reprise with thematic coherence but lacks a middle beat where the desire is tested or refined under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Tone is coherent and consistent: lyric, elegiac, patient, with a controlled melancholy that charges images of decay and regeneration. "Crumbling peace" is named explicitly and embodied in the collapsing shelf, yellowing pages, and softening swan folds. The tone modulates subtly (reflective passages lengthen; present-action beats compress slightly) and charges the final image: "The peace crumbles beautifully, as peace always does." Meets setup, development, and closure with purposeful modulation that reweights the dominant stake.</comment>
