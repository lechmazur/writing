<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The guardian's interiority is richly textured with contradictory impulses—she both craves and resists home, moves between feral and contemplative states. However, her core motivation remains largely static across the piece; the "making friends with uncertainty" arc is told through summary reflection rather than dramatized micro-choices under pressure. The interiorizing-exteriors method is asserted but never tested by a concrete dilemma that forces her to choose between competing goods. Embodied emotion is present ("ice forming on her eyelashes") but often slips into abstract philosophical musing without visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, signaled early by the mist-and-stasis imagery. Orientation anchors who/where by ~150 words but "when" remains deliberately vague ("through the veil of sleep") without clear payoff at closure. The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: she no longer aches to return, waits with the books accreting) but the cost is conceptual and oblique—no single on-page sentence shows what she forfeited to reach this peace. The recursive structure (waiting, mist, books, other guardians) deepens texture but does not tighten options or foreclose a legible path with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The frozen garden, ice-locked roses, and book columns constrain the guardian's physical range and charge the final image of "boundaries of light held." Sensory detail is purposeful—mist in lungs, ice on eyelashes, weak twilight—and filtered through her feral POV. Spatial choreography remains clear across her circling movements. The micro-setting (pendant, roses, books) functions as world and charges the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate criterion, but the piece edges into static catalog in the middle third, recycling "mist" and "ice" without evolving their tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether she can make peace with permanent exile—is signaled early but never tested by a concrete on-page choice. Pressure accumulates through imagery (visitors leaving, other guardians in mist) yet no reversal narrows her options; she simply waits until the ache fades. The ending shows her no longer yearning, but this shift is summarized ("she dreamed of dimensions she no longer ached to return to") rather than earned by a renunciation with visible cost. Under the Accumulative lens one deepening is sufficient, but here the deepening lacks a legible trade-off or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—befriending uncertainty, presence at edges—emerges from the garden's particulars (mist, frozen roses, accreting books) without overt thesis. The ending image ("boundaries of light held, neither advancing nor retreating") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to endure homelessness. However, the piece edges into direct statement ("uncertainty had introduced her to patience") and recycled abstractions ("the particular peace of existing at edges") that dilute subtext. The pendant's warmth and the raised hands of other guardians gesture toward recognition-as-home but remain understated enough to avoid sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature—feral, patient, attentive to mist and ice. Diction is controlled and lyric ("luminescence frayed into mist," "knowledge had accreted here") with purposeful compression. Free indirect style is clean. However, under peak reflection the voice occasionally drifts into elevated register ("the particular peace of existing at edges," "devotional act of pure presence") that feels slightly extern to a feral guardian's lexicon. No dialogue is present. Psychic distance remains consistent; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but controlled ("books stacked in columns that grew from the frozen earth like stalagmites"). Clarity is high; no grammatical errors. However, paraphrase loops appear: "mist" and "ice" recur across adjacent lines without added pressure (e.g., "mist curling through her thoughts," "mist taught her," "through the mist"). Template cadence in reflection blocks ("She had learned to wait. Not as patience…but as practice") and synonym churn ("stillness," "waiting," "presence") dull momentum in the middle third. The final paragraph recovers propulsion but the accumulated scaffold merits deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—feral librarian, frozen garden at dimensional boundaries, interiorizing exteriors—is specific and non-obvious. The emotional arc (homesickness to acceptance) avoids tidy resolution through the Earned Stasis form. However, the core premise leans on familiar "exile librarian" and "liminal space" templates without transforming them through unexpected moral calculus or a sharp turn in the guardian's stance. The visitors-who-wait motif and raised-hands-through-mist image are fresh inflections. Risk-taking in structure (recursive, lyric) heightens atmosphere but does not fully compensate for the predictable emotional trajectory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Present throughout; she circles roses, watches visitors, raises her hand. Setup clear, development shows her observing and waiting, payoff in final image. However, her choices are largely passive—waiting, absorbing, declining to act—rather than decisions that alter tactics. Her feral state is described but does not create a key turn; she could be replaced by a contemplative guardian with minor edits. Two beats (watching visitors, raising hand) but no causal pressure or visible cost tied specifically to her ferality.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Introduced early (~20% mark) as "doorway" symbol and anchor to homesickness. Returns once when it "grew warm" for patient visitors. Setup and one development beat present, but no payoff—it does not appear in or shape the ending. The pendant's mechanics (doorway vs. anchor) are asserted but never tested; she never attempts to use it or renounces its promise. Swappable with any symbolic keepsake. Missing closure participation caps it; warm-pendant beat is ornamental description without altering her stance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Framing image in opening line ("boundaries of light, where luminescence frayed into mist") and returns in final paragraph ("boundaries of light held"). Setup and payoff clear. Development implicit in the garden's twilight setting which constrains her range and charges her acceptance of edges. However, the concept functions mostly as atmosphere and theme label; it does not narrow a tactical choice or enable a specific action under pressure. Lyric reprise reweights the dominant stake (she no longer fights the boundary) with conceptual cost, pushing it above mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Introduced early ("dimensionally homesick") and restated ("homesickness itself," "no longer ached to return"). Setup and closure participation present. However, the trait is label-only; it does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. She never makes a choice between easing homesickness and another goal. The shift from aching to not-aching is told in summary rather than dramatized through a renunciation or tradeoff. Missing middle development and swappable with generic longing.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Signaled early ("learned to wait"), developed through middle beats (watching visitors, sitting with patient ones), and central to the ending ("She waited. The books accreted around her"). Three beats with causal linkage: waiting becomes "devotional act," defines her relationship to visitors, and anchors the Earned Stasis closure. Removes this verb and the story's logic fails—she would need a different mode of guardianship. Visible cost (she forgoes search, action, departure) charges the final image. Strong integration across setup, development, payoff.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Introduced at ~40% ("interiorizing exteriors—taking the frozen garden into herself"). Described in one sustained beat: breathing mist, pressing palms, absorbing patience. Returns obliquely in final paragraph ("interiorized garden"). Setup late, one development beat, payoff via echo. The method is asserted but its mechanics do not shape a choice or enable a tactic under pressure; she never uses it to solve a problem or faces cost for employing it. Swappable with "meditation" or "attunement." Late arrival and ornamental use lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Present from opening line; ice-locked roses, book columns, and mist anchor every beat. Setup immediate, development throughout (she circles roses, visitors emerge from mist, other guardians visible through fog), payoff in final image ("frozen garden bloomed…with accumulated stillness"). The garden constrains her range, supplies the visitors as pressure, and charges the ending's texture. Spatial choreography clear. The setting is irreplaceable—remove it and the story's stakes and closure collapse. Meets all three gates with strong causal and atmospheric integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Phrase appears in opening ("through the veil of sleep") and recurs three times. Setup clear. However, the timeframe remains vague and does not tighten decisions or tactics; "years as moments and moments as epochs" signals time dilation but imposes no deadline or live clock. Development absent—no middle choice is shaped by this temporal mode. Payoff weak—final paragraph mentions it but the ending does not hinge on dream-time logic. Ornamental and swappable with "timeless" or "eternal twilight."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Stated explicitly at ~50% ("make friends with uncertainty") and developed in reflection: "not by conquering it…but by letting it occupy her." Returns in final third ("She had made friends with uncertainty"). Setup mid-story, one development beat (letting mist occupy her), payoff via summary statement. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants and costs—she never chooses uncertainty over a concrete alternative goal (e.g., using the pendant, joining another guardian). Missing the friction test; no visible tradeoff on the page. Lyric restatement without embodied cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Tone established early—mist, frayed light, half-remembered book—and held through middle turns with modulation (visitors bring brief tension, other guardians offer calm). Final image ("foggy lucidity") names and charges the tone, completing a purposeful arc from confusion to acceptance-within-ambiguity. Coherent across beats. However, the tone is static in affect—the same contemplative, patient mood throughout—without a decisive shift under pressure. Modulation is subtle texture change rather than charged reconfiguration. Meets setup/payoff and contributes to closure, earning mid-7s.</comment>
