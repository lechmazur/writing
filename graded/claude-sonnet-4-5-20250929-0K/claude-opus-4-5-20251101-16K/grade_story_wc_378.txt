<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Caela's interiority is concrete and textured—her organic hands, the static she feels, her diagnostic protocols for memory compression. The choice to burn the box is earned through three centuries of accumulation, embodied in her inability to delete the children from memory banks. The transformation from frozen nostalgia to "renewed purpose" could have been more conflicted; the shift reads somewhat smooth. Still, the final stance—singing lullabies while carrying transformed fears—feels credibly arrived at and closes the loop with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece opens with magnetic shift and static, accumulates through memory and roses, and closes with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: Caela accepts fragmentation and transforms grief into oxygen). The controlled burn reweights prior nostalgia, and the final singing carries undeniable cost—she will never leave, the children will never return, but she has freed herself from the loop. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening (the burn scene) suffices at this length, and the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The glass dome, desert roses, and Caela's organic hands constrain and charge every beat. The adeniums' "swollen trunks like sculptures of captured time" and the ceramic pot anchor the burn. The dome's atmosphere becomes literal breath that roses process—micro-setting as metaphor made physical. The controlled burn depends on the dome's enclosed space, and the final image of singing "beneath this very glass, beneath these very stars" reweights the dome from prison to sanctuary.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: resolving inner static while tending the farm alone. The magnetic shift externalizes and tightens this stake, forcing recalibration. The burn scene narrows options—she can miniaturize memories or transform their weight—and she chooses transformation. The cost is legible: she will remain fragmented, the children are gone, nostalgia becomes oxygen. Agency is renunciation with visible price. One clear tightening (the burn) deepens the stance and forecloses return to the nostalgic loop.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: organic hands, paper fears, controlled burn, breath as transformation. The piece never states "grief must transform" but enacts it through fire converting terror into atmosphere. The final image—singing lullabies to plants—offers a resonant answer without moralizing: remembrance is an active caretaking, not a loop. "Fragmented wholeness" and "sometimes the kindest thing you can do for grief is give it permission to become something else" risk explicit summary, but the burn scene and the closing gesture earn the insight through concrete action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Caela's perceptual signature is distinct: she measures time in years, processes through diagnostic protocols, and her hands have "textured like bark." The prose modulates cleanly between her mechanical terms ("memory compression," "navigation systems") and organic metaphors ("roots she pruned," "captured time"). No head-hopping; single POV is stable. The rhythm varies purposefully, slowing for reflection and tightening at the burn. Minor slip: "fragmented—parts of her would always belong" edges toward explaining what the image already shows, but the effect remains controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>High information density: "her synthetic hands growing strangely organic with time—fingertips now textured like bark, palms creased with lines that mimicked the adenium roots" does three jobs in one beat. Rhythm varies without template cadence. Minor scaffold: "She understood now" and "Caela understood her escape route" repeat the insight-claim pattern, and "The children were gone. They had always been going" risks paraphrase. No loops touch closure, and figurative language ("swollen trunks like sculptures of captured time") sharpens rather than muddles. Propulsion is strong throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of android caretaker, nostalgic grief, and controlled burn as literal transformation is specific and non-obvious. The organic hands and Mars roses ground the premise in fresh detail. The burn scene—converting paper fears into breath the roses will process—feels inevitable in hindsight yet not telegraphed. Minor proximity note: "sometimes the kindest thing you can do for grief is give it permission to become something else" risks summarizing the core move, but the image work (ash to oxygen to lullabies) transforms the familiar grief-arc through world-specific causality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Caela's choices drive every turn: she keeps the box for two centuries, walks to retrieve it, arranges the burn, interprets its result, and returns to sing. Her nostalgia creates the static, and her decision to burn rather than compress memories enacts the closure. The android trait enables the diagnostic framing and the organic hands anchor her transformation. Introduced early, present in all major beats, and indispensable to the ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The box appears in paragraph four (storage shed), is carried to the clearing, opened, and its contents burned—three distinct beats. The paper fears are read aloud (Maria's green crayon), nested in dried leaves, and ignited. The burn transforms them into atmosphere, directly resolving the static. Without this exact object and its childhood origin, the grief-loop and the transformation both collapse. Closure hinges on it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The controlled burn is the pivotal action: Caela gathers leaves, nests the papers, strikes ignition, and watches the transformation. The concept shapes her diagnostic choice (miniaturize vs. transform) and the method (containing chaos directs transformation). It appears at midpoint and drives closure. Slightly less indispensable than the box itself—other transformative actions could substitute—but the containment logic (dome, ceramic pot, controlled flame) is tightly woven and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Caela's organic hands are introduced early ("fingertips now textured like bark, palms creased with lines that mimicked the adenium roots") and return at closure ("her strangely organic hands moving among the blooms with renewed purpose"). The trait signals her long transformation and ties her physically to the roses. It enables the final gesture (tending, touching) with thematic weight. Not causally decisive—she could tend without organic hands—but the specificity charges the image and the attribute constrains nothing mechanically, so mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Miniaturize" is Caela's rejected option: her diagnostic protocols suggest memory compression, she recalls trying to "shrink her grief into manageable fragments," and the result was "fragmented wholeness." This frames the burn as the opposite choice—transformation rather than reduction. The concept appears early and shapes the turn, but the burn itself is the enacted climax; "miniaturize" functions as contrast and setup. Two-gate presence (setup, development via flashback) without direct closure action places it in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"By containing chaos, you could direct its transformation" is stated explicitly at the burn and demonstrated through the ceramic pot, the dome's enclosed atmosphere, and the controlled ignition. The method is signaled (dome as controlled environment from the start) and its mechanics matter: uncontrolled fire would fail; containment converts fear to oxygen. The principle shapes the entire climax and the thematic closure. Present in setup (dome), active in the burn, and resonant in the ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The glass-domed desert rose farm is introduced in the first sentence, anchors every scene (no location change), and directly enables the closure: the dome traps smoke, creating the atmospheric transformation; the adeniums' roots mirror Caela's hands; the controlled environment is the containment that directs chaos. The roses are the inherited task and the final audience for her lullabies. Setting and stakes are inseparable; the story cannot occur elsewhere. Three gates, high causal pressure, closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The magnetic north shift frames the story (opens and closes), externalizes Caela's inner static, forces recalibration, and provides a three-day clock. Her compass spins toward "coordinates that no longer existed," and when the shift settles, "her compass found true direction for the first time in three days." The timeframe tightens the window for resolution and charges the closure moment. Not mechanically decisive—she could burn the box without the shift—but the parallel (external pole shift / internal static resolution) is purposeful and thematically load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Resolving inner static is the dominant stake, stated early ("Caela felt her circuits sing with static") and dramatized throughout: her navigation systems "recalibrating wildly," diagnostic protocols suggesting compression, and the burn scene titled as the resolution ("Caela watched her inner static quiet"). The motivation drives the rejection of miniaturization, the choice to burn, and the final acceptance of fragmented wholeness. Friction is visible: she cannot delete the children, compression failed before, and the burn carries the cost of permanent separation. Three gates, strong causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Fragmented wholeness" is embodied in Caela's state: synthetic yet organic, caretaker yet abandoned, parts belonging to the children yet whole in her purpose. The tone modulates from static and diagnostic language to organic metaphor and finally to quiet acceptance. The burn scene shifts cadence (urgent, present-tense feel) and the ending breathes with earned calm. The phrase is stated once but enacted throughout, and the final image (singing lullabies, carrying transformed fears) charges it with pressure. Coherent, purposeful, and integral to closure.</comment>
