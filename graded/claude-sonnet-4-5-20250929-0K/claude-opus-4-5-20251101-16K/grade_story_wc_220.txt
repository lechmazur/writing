<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and embodied—the leaf serves as a concrete anchor for her sixteen-year search. Her professional skillset (reading scenes, tracking patterns) drives the cylinder decryption without feeling contrived. The reunion beat lands with genuine emotional weight, though the daughter's survival and location feel convenient rather than earned through prior causality. Internal contradiction is present (duty to the dead versus hope for the living) but could be sharpened in the peak moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal with lyric accents. Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening paragraph. The cylinders provide clear linkage (message → journey → reunion), but Lira's survival and her ability to craft/deliver the cylinders stretches credulity without on-page cost or explanation of how she found Maren or learned the skill. Closure is a Decisive Change (reunion after sixteen years of loss) with emotional cost visible on the page, though the convenience of the setup weakens the because/therefore chain leading to it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The burnt maples, salt flats, and red tower create a vivid journey arc with purposeful sensory economy. The scrapyard settlement and the skeletal grove both constrain and charge the closure image effectively. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the seven-day trek, and the wasteland functions as more than backdrop—it embodies the separation Maren must cross. The wax leaf operates as micro-setting, charging both opening and ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding Lira or accepting her loss) is signaled early and tightens through the journey. The cylinders provide one meaningful escalation point that narrows options and commits Maren to action. However, the resolution lacks a visible trade-off—no demonstrated cost for the journey, no complication en route, and Lira's presence at the exact right place removes friction from the climax. The emotional stakes land, but tactical or physical costs remain abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of preservation versus loss, distance versus closeness emerges organically through the leaf, the cylinders, and the journey without overt statement. "Tinted revelations" functions conceptually—truth filtered through hope and amber—and the ending image (leaf glowing between them) reweights prior material without moralizing. The bloodhound metaphor evolves from tracking death to tracking life, a specific and earned thematic arc. Minor deduction for "translate distance into closeness" appearing as near-direct statement rather than pure implication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third with Maren's perceptual signature (scene-reading, detail-tracking) consistent throughout. Diction stays character-appropriate with one minor slip ("intuitively descriptive" reads institutional in paragraph one). Dialogue, when present, carries subtext and goal (Lira's "You came" / Maren's "You left me a riddle"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully at the reunion without head-hopping. No filter-verb stacks or register drift in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the opening third, though the journey section compresses seven days into summary that slightly flattens momentum. Two minor loops: "wild hush" appears three times with near-identical phrasing, and "sixteen years" is stated twice in quick succession in the reunion beat. No metaphor muddle, clean grammar, and the final image ("autumn preserved, waiting, patient") charges prior material effectively. Apply −0.3 for the loops; otherwise execution is strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The core premise (encoded phonograph cylinders decoded by a specialist who tracks death) offers a fresh synthesis. However, the emotional arc (parent searching for lost child in post-apocalyptic setting) and the clean reunion follow familiar templates without significant transformation. The wax leaf and cylinder pairing provides textural originality, and the bloodhound-to-life-tracker shift is a strong thematic inflection. Risk-averse in plotting—no complication during the journey, no cost for the search—keeps this from higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Maren's retired bloodhound role frames her cylinder-reading skill and drives the choice to pursue the riddle. Her profession shapes two beats (decryption, journey) and the thematic arc from death-tracker to life-finder. She makes the key decision to leave the settlement, altering the story's trajectory. Present early, involved in middle action, and shapes the ending's charge, though the reunion itself is passive (Lira emerges; Maren does not hunt or choose in that final moment).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The wax leaf appears in paragraph two, returns at the cylinder-reading beat, is offered at the reunion, and charges the final image ("autumn preserved, waiting, patient"). It bridges past and present with evolving emotional weight and provides the thematic anchor (preservation through devastation). Maren's choice to carry it and present it to Lira demonstrates cost (clinging to memory) and shapes the reunion's emotional register. High irreplaceability; this exact object is load-bearing for closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Tinted revelations" is named directly once and functions thematically (truth through amber, hope, fear) but does not constrain on-page choices or tactics. The cylinders provide revelation, but "tinted" remains metaphorical rather than operational—Maren's decryption is not shown to be colored by bias or hope in a way that alters her actions. Present at setup, echoed at closure, but lacks middle development as a stake-shaping force.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Intuitively descriptive" is named in paragraph one and enables the cylinder decryption (one on-page action). The skill is load-bearing for the plot turn—without it, Maren cannot read the grooves. However, no visible cost or tradeoff is shown; the skill works perfectly without complication. Present early, drives one major beat, and is referenced at closure ("You always saw what others missed"), but lacks friction or failure that would demonstrate its limits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The riddle (Wick's question and the cylinders) is introduced early, drives Maren's decryption choice, and provides the causal spine for the journey. The three-part message structures the quest and reappears in Maren and Lira's dialogue at closure ("You left me a riddle. I solved it."). Swapping for another message type (radio, letter) would require significant edits to the bloodhound/scene-reading premise. Strong integration across all three gates, though the riddle itself is solved off-page (we see the result, not the process).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The phonograph cylinder method is introduced in paragraph four and provides the specific constraint that only Maren can decode. The mechanics matter—grooves hide text—and the choice of old technology is explained as deliberate. However, the actual reading process is summarized ("By reading secret texts in the grooves...she began to translate") rather than dramatized, and no complication or cost attends the decryption. Present at setup, enables the journey, and mentioned at closure, but lacks visible struggle or tactical friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The scrapyard settlement is named and described in paragraphs one and three, provides the departure point, and frames Maren's isolation. However, it does not constrain her choice to leave or provide resources that affect the journey. The burnt maple grove (setting) does charge the closure image effectively. The wasteland journey is compressed into summary without environmental obstacles, so the setting remains more atmospheric than tactical. Setup present, closure participation strong, but middle development weak.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"After the last resource war" anchors the world in paragraph one and explains the devastation, scarcity, and Maren's profession. However, the timeframe does not create urgency or tighten decisions—the sixteen-year gap is static backstory, and the seven-day journey has no clock pressure. The post-war frame is consistent and shapes tone, but it does not function as a live constraint that alters tactics. Functional but replaceable with any post-catastrophe frame.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to translate distance into closeness" is stated directly in paragraph six, but the desire is also dramatized through Maren's choice to pack and leave, her seven-day trek, and the reunion embrace. The metaphor is embodied in the journey itself. Friction is present (sixteen years of grief, the physical wasteland crossing) and the cost of clinging to hope is visible in Maren's life choices. Strong integration with setup, middle action, and closure, though the phrasing is slightly abstract for direct statement.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Wild hush" is introduced in the opening sentence and recurs three times, modulating from oppressive silence to charged stillness at the reunion. The tone coheres through all turns—subdued, elegiac, quiet—and the final transformation ("wild hush transformed into something softer") reweights the opening. However, repetition of the exact phrase creates minor loop debt, and the tone does not vary with pressure as sharply as it might. Present, purposeful, and charges closure, but execution has small craft slips.</comment>
