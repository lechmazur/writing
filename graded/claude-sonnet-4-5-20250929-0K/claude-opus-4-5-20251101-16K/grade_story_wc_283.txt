<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent—refusing prophecy as fixed fate—but her interior life remains abstract. The grandmother's deathbed wisdom and the button-cataloging work are told rather than dramatically tested under pressure. Emotional states are labeled ("quietly inspired") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The final choice to stay and tend fires feels thematically required rather than earned through on-page struggle with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (cataloging buttons builds toward a conceptual repricing of prophecy). Orientation anchors arrive late—warehouse location and Mira's role clarify gradually across the first third. Closure effect is Conceptual Repricing: prophecy reweighted as "possibility wearing certainty's mask," with the village's survival as proof. Cost is present but diffuse—neighbors' fear, the risk of staying—rather than a single decisive forfeiture tied to Mira's action. The causal link from button patterns to fire-source knowledge feels convenient; the baker's oven detail arrives only at resolution without prior setup.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The amber warehouse is vividly rendered—honey-colored light, shelves rising to vaulted ceilings, frozen hourglasses—and the cataloging desk and button trays ground Mira's physical work. The canyon echo jar constrains a choice (uncorking it to access shared wisdom) and charges the thematic closure. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. Minor: the cliffs and village geography remain generic, and the warehouse's thirty-year abandonment is asserted but never pressures a present decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the village from prophesied fire—is signaled early. Pressure is conceptual rather than escalating: Mira's night of cataloging deepens understanding but does not narrow options through reversals or visible trade-offs. The baker's oven revelation tightens the problem, yet the solution (vigilance by those who stay) bypasses on-page confrontation or cost. Agency is present in Mira's choice to descend and her decision to share knowledge, but coincidence (finding three bone buttons from prior survivors) enables the resolution without protagonist sacrifice or tactical adaptation under duress.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—prophecy as puzzle, fate as shapeable—emerges clearly from Mira's cataloging and the echo's wisdom. The ending image of turning frozen hourglasses and time resuming its breathing offers resonant reconfiguration without overt moralizing. Subtext operates in the buttons as markers of choice-moments and the canyon echo as accumulated voice. Weakness: the grandmother's "hidden grammar" and "shared wisdom" are asserted more than dramatized, and the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("prophecy was merely possibility wearing certainty's mask") rather than trusting the image alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single POV, third-person limited, remains stable. Diction is elevated and consistent—"unearthed silence," "honey-colored light," "prophecy bowed to persistence"—but perceptual signature is generic rather than character-specific. Psychic distance stays consistent. No dialogue on the page; the canyon echo is paraphrased rather than voiced. The prose texture is uniform and slightly formal, lacking modulation under peak pressure (the all-night cataloging reads at the same register as the opening descent). Free indirect style is clean but the narrator's certainty about Mira's insights ("she discovered fate's grammar") tells rather than shows inference.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and clarity is high. Information density is solid in the warehouse description and button-catalog sequences. Minor loops: "shared wisdom" recurs across four paragraphs without added texture; "prophecy" and "fate" are near-synonyms cycled frequently. The phrase "unearthed silence" appears twice in identical phrasing. Stock constructions: "breath broken only by," "truth unraveled," "raw possibility." Overwriting is minimal, but figurative language in the final third (prophecy "wearing certainty's mask," future as "river seeking new channels") stacks without concrete anchoring. No major scaffolding or clarity breaks; propulsion is steady but never urgent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The amber warehouse and button-cataloging premise is specific and non-obvious. The hourglass-turner role and canyon echo jar add textural freshness. Transformation of the prophecy trope—reframing it as puzzle rather than decree—is conceptually clear but executed through familiar beats (catalog research, deathbed wisdom, midnight insight). The bone-button pattern echoes prior survivor stories in a way that feels engineered for the resolution. Emotional truth is present but template-shaped: the village's collective fear, Mira's refusal to flee, the grandmother's whispered secrets all follow recognizable arcs without sharp personal cost or contradiction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Mira (hourglass turner) drives the plot: she descends to the warehouse, catalogs buttons, uncorks the echo, and returns to share her findings. Her role shapes two beats (descent/cataloging, return/persuasion) and the closure (village stays, no fire). However, the title functions more as worldbuilding label than constraint—her specific skills as "turner" are asserted but not demonstrated under pressure. She could be any determined researcher. Early signal present; closure participation clear; causal pressure moderate; some swappability remains.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The canyon echo jar is handled twice (uncorked during cataloging, bottled again before dawn) and its message—prophecy bends—directly enables Mira's understanding. It appears early (first-third description) and returns at the key insight beat. However, its specific properties (echo of cliffs that "spoke truths aloud") are ornamental; any repository of ancestral wisdom would serve the same function. The jar charges the thematic closure but does not impose a unique constraint or cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Shared wisdom" is named explicitly in the opening, the echo sequence, and the ending, and it frames the story's premise: accumulated knowledge across centuries guides Mira's solution. It shapes her motivation and the village's final understanding. However, the concept remains abstract—asserted rather than embodied in on-page choices with trade-offs. It does not narrow options or create visible friction; instead it smooths the path to resolution. Present across beats; closure participation clear; causal pressure light.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Quietly inspired" is mentioned once as a phrase ("She was quietly inspired by the patterns emerging") and colors Mira's interior stance during cataloging. It does not constrain a choice or impose cost; removing the phrase would not alter her actions. The attribute is label-only, not dramatized through embodied contradiction or tactical adaptation. Late first appearance (mid-story); no closure linkage; no visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Unscramble" appears in the title of the prophecy-as-puzzle frame and recurs in the key revelation beat: "she had unscrambled the prophecy's true nature." It drives the primary action (cataloging to decode the prophecy) and the resolution (understanding enables persuasion). However, the mechanics are vague—pattern-matching across buttons is described but not shown in granular choice. The action shapes closure but could be replaced with "decode" or "solve" with minimal structural change. Early signal; closure participation; moderate specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Cataloging lost buttons is introduced early (end of first third), occupies the central work sequence (sorting trays, cross-referencing ledger, finding three bone buttons), and directly yields the solution (fire starts from baker's oven, vigilance prevents spread). The method drives at least two beats (night cataloging, dawn insight) and is essential to the ending—without it, Mira has no mechanism to "unscramble" prophecy. The ledger and button materials ground the process. However, the causal leap from button-era correlation to oven-location knowledge is under-motivated. Strong beat involvement; closure linkage clear; some convenience remains.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The amber warehouse is present by the second paragraph, grounds all middle action (descent, cataloging at the desk, returning at dawn), and bookends the story (Mira descends, later returns to turn hourglasses). Its abandonment and contents (frozen hourglasses, canyon echo, ledger) enable the research that drives the plot. The cliffs above and the village below create spatial stakes. The warehouse's specific materials (amber walls, vaulted ceilings) do not impose unique constraints, but its isolation and archive function are indispensable. Early signal; multiple beats; closure participation; some generic qualities remain.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"As the truth unravels" titles the timeframe and the story tracks a compressed sequence: descent, night-long cataloging, dawn return, winter solstice passage. Time pressure is present (solstice deadline) but not live on the page during the cataloging—Mira works "through night" without urgency or interruption. The solstice arrival is summarized in the final act. Time shapes the stakes conceptually but does not force tactical adaptation or visible cost during key beats. Setup clear; closure participation indirect; moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mira's desire to "spin a prophecy into raw possibility" is articulated late (penultimate paragraph: "Her motivation had never been to deny prophecy but to spin it...") and drives her descent and research. It conflicts with collective belief and her mother's fear, creating social friction. However, the motivation is told rather than tested through on-page choice with visible cost—no moment where spinning prophecy demands sacrifice or contradicts another want. Present across beats; closure participation clear; friction moderate; late explicit articulation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Unearthed silence" appears twice (opening: "unearthed silence"; closing: "In that unearthed silence, time resumed its breathing") and characterizes the warehouse atmosphere throughout. Tone is consistent—meditative, archival, hushed—and modulates subtly (honey light at opening, breathing time at close). It charges the final image of hourglasses turning and integrates with the theme of stopped/resumed time. However, tone does not shift under peak pressure; the cataloging sequence maintains the same register as the frame. Early signal; closure participation; coherence high; static across turns.</comment>
