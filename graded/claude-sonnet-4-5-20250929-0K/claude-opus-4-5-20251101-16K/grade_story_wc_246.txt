<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and her motivation (correcting the signal) drives the arc. However, the "confidently uncertain" and "editing history" concepts feel more declared than embodied in micro-choices under pressure. The final decision to reframe rather than erase is dramatized cleanly, but the protagonist's renunciation lacks visible cost—she pivots to acceptance without forfeiting a live option. Emotional progression is credible but lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (conceptual deepening via the "editing history" motif). The closure is a Conceptual Repricing—Mira shifts from "unbending" to "adding new curves," reweighting her mistake as reframable rather than erasable. Cost is conceptual: she accepts irreversibility and her own fallibility. Orientation anchors cleanly (anomaly station, signal work). One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes her mentor edited meaning, not events, licensing her new signal. The lens holds and the closure reconfigures the premise with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly functions as micro-setting, constraining perception (signals from the future) and enabling the reframing tactic. The dried pen recurs as a concrete anchor for the "interpret, don't create" rule and is handled twice with reweighted meaning at closure. Spatial grounding is light but sufficient for a single-room conceptual piece. Sensory detail is selective (prismatic nib, shimmering halos) and POV-filtered. The anomaly charges the final image by making "everything contingent" visible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: correct the colony ship's trajectory before it reaches the dying system (three years remain). One meaningful deepening: Mira realizes she can reframe the signal rather than erase the mistake, narrowing options from "undo" to "contextualize." Agency is clear—she writes and transmits the new signal. The resolution is earned by her conceptual shift, though the lack of external opposition or a second reversal keeps pressure modest. Cost is felt (accepting irreversibility) but not materially visible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: "interpretation is creation," "mistakes can become opportunities," and the contingency of meaning. The dried pen and anomaly imagery recur with reweighted significance at closure. No overt moralizing; the final image (stars bending toward each other, "wrong turns could become right ones") offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Subtext operates in the mentor's hidden editing and Mira's pivot from "unbend" to "add new curves." The arc integrates character goal and thematic question without abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single-POV third limited, stable throughout. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent: "confidently uncertain," "threshing meaning from experience," "strange comfort." Perceptual signature is selective (anomaly-filtered worldview). No dialogue; interiority carries the arc cleanly. Some filter verbs ("she understood," "she had been trying") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Psychic distance remains tight. A slight template cadence appears mid-story ("She could do the same. Through the contingent relationships...") but does not disrupt voice coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; sentences layer image, concept, and character. Rhythm varies (short declaratives at closure, longer interiors mid-story). Minor paraphrase loop: "Everything here was contingent—dependent on perspective" restates the prior paragraph's core without added pressure (−0.2). One run of "She had" stems in the backstory block but does not create template cadence. Figurative language is purposeful (solar-flare nib, light bending, "threshing grain") without muddle. No major line-level artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The "editing history" premise is familiar from time-loop and retcon narratives, but the story transforms it via the anomaly's contingent relationships and Mira's realization that meaning, not events, can be reframed. The dried pen as a recurring constraint and the mentor's hidden editing add specificity. The ending pivot from "unbend" to "add curves" feels earned in hindsight. Risk-taking is modest—no structural boldness—but the conceptual synthesis is non-obvious and thematically coherent. Slightly above mid-band due to thematic follow-through.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Present early (Station Kepler-7 interpreter). Drives two beats: the backstory mistake and the decision to send a new signal. Her choice to reframe rather than erase narrows options and shapes the closure. Essential to the arc but the role could function with a generic "signal worker" label; specificity (celestial, seventeen years, anomaly expertise) adds texture but does not create unique causal pressure. Score reflects strong beat involvement and closure linkage, minor deduction for replaceability at the role level.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Appears in three beats: intro (mentor's rule), midpoint realization (mentor edited meaning), and closure (she touches it after transmitting). Returns with reweighted meaning (from "don't create" to "interpretation is sacred"). However, it remains a symbolic anchor rather than a tool that constrains choice—she does not use it to write. Charged reprise and thematic function earn mid-6s; lack of on-page tactile constraint or causal pressure prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Signaled early ("interpretation was creation") and drives the arc: Mira's mistake = editing history; her solution = editing the interpretation. Shapes stakes (correct the colony's course) and tactics (reframe, not erase). The realization that her mentor edited meaning licenses her new signal. Appears in the closure decision and final reflection. Irreplaceable—remove it and the thematic and causal spine collapses. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and beat involvement across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Declared in paragraph 5 ("confidently uncertain about the solution"). Functions as a trait label that colors her stance but does not constrain a specific choice with visible cost. It describes her posture ("certainty felt like arrogance, but hesitation meant paralysis") rather than enabling/disabling an action. Present in closure reflection but not causally active there. Lyric resonance and thematic fit keep it functional; lack of on-page trade-off caps it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Signaled early ("trying to unbend what had curved") and drives the midpoint turn: Mira realizes unbending is impossible, pivots to "adding new curves." The verb frames her failed strategy and licenses the solution. However, "unbend" is metaphorical; the physical action is writing/transmitting a signal. Swap "unbend" for "correct" or "reverse" and the plot holds with minor edits. Strong thematic and conceptual role; moderate replaceability at the action level prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Signaled early ("contingent relationships—the networks of cause and effect that the anomaly revealed"). Mechanics matter: the anomaly shows branching decisions and future signals, enabling Mira to contextualize her mistake. Shapes her tactic (reframe via new signal) and charges the closure ("Everything was contingent"). Recurs across three beats and is irreplaceable—remove it and the solution mechanism vanishes. Strong causal and closure integration; slight abstraction (relationships as concept) keeps it from top band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present throughout. Supplies the core resource: signals from the future, time pooling, bent light. Enables Mira's job and the solution tactic. Constrains perception ("time bent," "halos and shadows") and recurs in the closure image (stars bending, "everything was contingent"). Causally active in two beats (anomaly reveals contingent relationships, allows future signals) and charges the final paragraph. Irreplaceable—the story's logic collapses without it. High integration across all gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Signaled early (three months post-mistake; colony ship three years from destination). Creates urgency (14-hour transmission window) and frames the window for correction. The "after" framing motivates the entire arc—Mira's realization and new signal attempt. Time is tracked clearly and tightens the decision beat. However, the three-year cushion reduces immediate pressure; the 14-hour wait at closure is passive. Strong setup and development; closure participation is structural rather than visceral.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Declared in paragraph 6 ("her motivation, her purpose. To find the grain of truth among the chaff of possibility"). Frames her job (signal interpretation) and drives the solution (threshing meaning from the mistake). Recurs at closure ("meaning was harvested, not invented"). However, it functions as a thematic claim more than a dramatized friction—no on-page moment shows competing desires or a cost tied to this motive. Lyric cohesion and conceptual fit earn mid-6s; lack of visible trade-off limits score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Declared in paragraph 9 ("strange comfort in this") and recurs in the final section ("strange comfort of her work"). Tone modulates appropriately: reflective and measured throughout, accelerating slightly at the decision beat, then settling into acceptance. The oxymoron charges the closure image (comfort in irreversibility). Coherent across turns and legible in the final paragraph. Minor deduction: tone is consistent but does not intensify under pressure—it remains steady rather than crystallizing at closure.</comment>
