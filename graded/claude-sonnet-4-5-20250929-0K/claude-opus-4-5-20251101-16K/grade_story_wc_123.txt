<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and specific to her professional mindset—the lateral progression through data, the weighing of evidence. Her final choice to continue recording is earned by her eleven-year devotion to precision and the concrete cost of being followed. The embodied detail (trembling hands, turning the message tube) grounds emotion without label-speak. Internal contradiction appears only lightly; her fear and resolve coexist but don't clash in scene, keeping the portrayal credible but not exceptional.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accretes pressure through nested revelations (pigeon → anomalies → quarantine zone → surveillance), culminating in the decision to record honestly. Closure is Earned Stasis: Mira refuses erasure with visible cost (the man in gray coat will continue, her safety remains at risk). The orientation is clean by the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening (recognition of the zone's existence) tightens stakes sufficiently for this length. Cost is legible in "small stubborn flame of her refusal" and the persistence of external threat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The courtyard functions as micro-setting with purposeful detail: jasmine, fountain, stone bench anchor tranquility and constancy against external threat. Spatial choreography is clear (courtyard → study). The setting charges the final image—her refuge becomes the site of her refusal. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mira's professional calm. The eleven-year storm-recording context is sketched efficiently without becoming expository weight. Not quite indispensable, but purposeful throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether to destroy evidence or preserve integrity. The piece tightens once—recognition of the zone's existence narrows Mira's options to complicity or refusal. Agency is renunciation (she refuses to adjust figures) with visible cost (ongoing surveillance, personal danger). The choice forecloses safety. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens: each discovery adds weight until the ledger decision crystallizes. The man in gray coat provides external opposition without requiring confrontation. Cost is on the page in "Let him" and the acceptance of persistent threat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: integrity, solitude, the stubborn preservation of truth against erasure. The final image ("small stubborn flame of her refusal") offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The ledgers function as concrete embodiment of the theme—each entry a refusal. Subtext operates in silence and gesture (turning the message tube, walking to the study). The piece avoids abstraction; theme is inextricable from Mira's professional devotion and the specific mechanics of her discovery. One minor slip: "integrity required no audience" tilts slightly toward statement, though the phrase is embedded in action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited with stable distance and a perceptual signature tied to Mira's meticulous profession: "progressing laterally," "cross-referenced," "exacting precision." Diction remains controlled and purposeful; vocabulary fits her analytical mindset. POV modesty is maintained—inference reads as inference ("she suspected," "she began to intuit"). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Voice modulates appropriately from tension (opening) to resolve (closing). Prose reflects her character through syntax and attention to pattern. No dialogue to assess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, discovery, or atmosphere. Rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening/closing anchor voice and stakes effectively. Minor scaffold appears: "The work demanded solitude, and solitude had become her cathedral" edges toward elegant paraphrase without added pressure. "Each one a small refusal" in the penultimate section echoes "small stubborn flame of her refusal" at the end—purposeful but risks loop territory. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence. Clarity and propulsion are strong throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of meticulous data-keeper discovering political suppression through weather anomalies is specific and non-obvious. The lateral-progression method and the ledgers-as-testimony angle transform a familiar whistleblower frame. Emotional specificity (her courtyard as cathedral, the pigeon as accidental witness) personalizes the premise. One friction: the rogue quarantine zone and surveillance-state apparatus trend toward familiar dystopian territory without a bold subversion. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows implications, but the conceptual territory is well-trodden.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Present early (storm recorder role anchors opening). Her professional habit of verifying data enables the discovery; her final choice to continue recording (closing beat) drives closure. The trait constrains her response—she doesn't flee or confront, she records. Two beats (discovery through data review; decision to record evening measurements) and closure linkage push this into solid integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Introduced early (third paragraph, "three days ago"). Handled twice: upon arrival and when Mira turns it in her fingers at dusk. The broken seal and misdirection are causally important—without the pigeon's error, no discovery. Returns in the contemplation beat, reweighted as "fragment of some other story" she refuses to let it become. Shapes key turn and charges reflection, approaching essentiality.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Revealed in the pigeon's message and recognized through Mira's data analysis (middle third). Shapes the dominant stake: the zone's existence creates the choice between complicity and testimony. The concept doesn't appear in the closure beat directly, but it underwrites the entire decision. Alters tactics (she won't investigate directly) and motivates the final act of recording. Solid causal role, not quite indispensable to the image itself.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Label appears once ("credibly curious nature preferred the indirect path"). The trait enables her method of progressing laterally rather than direct investigation, which is causally relevant. However, the trait itself is told rather than dramatized in a discrete choice with visible cost. It explains behavior but doesn't constrain a beat with friction. Functional but understated; no closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Present throughout the discovery sequence: she intuits the names' significance, the zone's existence, and the doctors' fate. The action is central to the middle turn (recognizing the anomalies as proof). However, "intuit" mostly describes offstage cognition rather than a dramatized, visible act. The mechanics are sketched but not shown in granular choice. Swappable with "deduce" or "infer" without major structural change. Important but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Signaled early ("By progressing laterally, examining what she already knew, she began to recognize patterns"). The method justifies her indirect discovery and contrasts with "direct investigation would have been foolish." Shapes her tactics in the middle section. Not present in the closure beat; the final act of recording is direct, not lateral. Meaningful in setup and development but absent from payoff. Solid functional role, not essential to ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Anchors opening and closing; described with purposeful detail (jasmine, fountain, stone bench, geometry). The courtyard embodies constancy and refuge, charging the final image: "The courtyard held its breath in the gathering darkness." It contrasts external threat (man in gray coat beyond the walls) and provides the space for her resolute act. Micro-setting that actively shapes tone and charges closure. Strongly integrated, nearing indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Introduced in opening line ("after being followed home"). Creates initial tension but doesn't return or tighten later choices. The timeframe is "evening" and "dusk deepening," but no live clock pressures the decision. The pursuit has already stopped three streets back; the threat is ongoing surveillance, not immediate deadline. Present in setup, absent in development and payoff. Functional context, not a driver.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Stated early ("solitude had become her cathedral," "nurturing integrity in solitude"). Dramatized in the climactic choice: she walks to her study and records with precision rather than destroying ledgers. The motivation drives the entire arc and is tested by surveillance pressure. Friction between safety (destroy records) and integrity (preserve truth) creates the core conflict. Present across all three gates with visible cost at closure. Strongly integrated.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Established in opening (courtyard's "tranquil geometry," amber light, jasmine). Tone modulates through discovery tension ("she had not understood at first") while retaining underlying calm. Returns at closure: "The fountain sang its patient song. Dusk settled into night." The layered quality—peace atop danger—charges the final image and supports Earned Stasis. Coherent through pressure and integral to the ending's effect. Essential to the story's emotional architecture.</comment>
