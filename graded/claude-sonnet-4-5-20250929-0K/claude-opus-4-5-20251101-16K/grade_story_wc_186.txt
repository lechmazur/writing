<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation crystallizes through concrete interaction with the prism, and her retrocognitive gift generates embodied contradiction—she sees patterns others call accident while maintaining beacon duty in isolation. The four-year star-charting effort and her placing of the "shard of hush" last show micro-choices under pressure. Internal conflict between desperate faith and empirical method drives the peak beat, though the final gesture ("touches the shard of hush once more") leans slightly toward performed ritual rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational coloring. The piece teaches its pattern early (retrocognitive visions layered with present-tense beacon work) and escalates through density increase: four years of charting compress into tonight's alignment, seven shards positioned per calculation. Closure lands as Charged Poise—the beacon rekindles, the distant figure turns, and Mira feels "silence between heartbeats" in a final image that reconfigures the premise (coincidences as language) with undeniable conceptual cost: she has committed to this interpretive frame and will keep the beacon burning on faith. One meaningful deepening is present and the cost (isolation, faith without proof) is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The glass humming pavilion anchors early, its wind-threaded song and surviving panes functioning as micro-setting that constrains Mira's rekindling attempt. Star paths through "northeastern facet," the workbench with seven shards, and spatial choreography (pavilion crowns the tower's apex) remain coherent. The prism's positioning and Orion's alignment charge the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful—"lattice of surviving panes that sing"—and reflects Mira's priorities without catalog excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove coincidences have meaning by rekindling the beacon) is signaled by the third paragraph and tightens through Mira's four-year star-charting effort. The alignment creates one meaningful pressure point: she positions each shard "according to her calculations, her retrocognitive visions, her desperate faith." The beacon rekindles with visible limitation (fifty miles instead of three hundred), forecloses the path of abandoning her thesis, and the cost—isolation, reduced reach, fragile hope—is legible. Agency is clear in the placement sequence; coincidence complicates (Orion's alignment) but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (coincidences as the universe's forgotten language) emerges from concrete particulars—the merchant's whim, the storm-birth vaccine, the old lightkeeper's gesture mirroring Mira's—rather than assertion. The final image offers a non-literal answer: the distant figure pauses, "might be hope, might be accident, might be both at once," reweighting the premise without a stated moral. The "shard of hush" and "silence between heartbeats" recur with shifted meaning. No thematic echo in the final paragraph; the pavilion's hum and the figure's turn carry resonance through image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single POV; psychic distance is stable and close. Perceptual signature is distinct—Mira notices "thistle seeds," "amber," "spider silk"—and reflects her custodian lens. Diction remains consistent under pressure ("fragile as spider silk, strong as destiny") without therapy-speak or filter-verb stacks. The prose rhythm modulates: lyric compression in the opening, technical focus during shard placement, then expansion in the closing image. The phrase "thistle-blown hope rise in her chest" balances metaphor and embodiment cleanly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance image, character, or world without padding. Rhythm varies purposefully—short declaratives at the rekindling beat ("The beacon rekindles."), lyric expansion in the final paragraph. Minor scaffold appears: "She touches the shard of hush once more and feels the silence between heartbeats, between stars, between the person she was and the person she is becoming" recycles the "shard of hush" gesture without new pressure, approaching paraphrase-loop territory (−0.2). No filter-verb stacks or template cadence; figurative language is controlled and voice-motivated. The opening and closing lines anchor and resolve cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The retrocognitive beacon-keeper premise is specific and executed with earned detail (star-path charting, prism geometry, fifty-mile reach). The coincidence-as-language frame avoids solipsism by grounding it in concrete historical threads (plague port, vaccine child). Thistle-seed imagery and the "shard of hush" label feel slightly ornamental rather than irreplaceable, and the distant figure turning at the end brushes close to a stock hopeful-light tableau. The four-year commitment and broken-things-still-function angle offer freshness, but the emotional arc (isolation → fragile hope) follows a familiar template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira positions each shard, decides to place the "shard of hush" last at the convergence point, and chooses to keep the beacon burning after rekindling—three distinct beats shaping tactics and closure. Early signal (paragraph 1: "Mira keeps the beacon tower"), middle development (star-charting over four years narrows her method), and closure participation (she watches the light pulse, touches the shard again, commits to continuing). The final choice forecloses abandoning the beacon with visible cost (isolation, faith without proof). Swappability is low; her custodian role and retrocognitive access are causally active.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The prism appears in paragraph 4 (early signal), is handled across workbench preparation and shard placement (two beats), and returns in the final reprise ("She touches the shard of hush once more"). Its seven-piece brokenness constrains her rekindling method, and the "shard of hush" carries reweighted meaning at closure (silence before collapse → silence between heartbeats). Causal pressure is strong; without the prism's specific geometry, the beacon cannot rekindle. Cost connection: her four years of charting and the beacon's reduced fifty-mile reach tie directly to the prism's broken state.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Shard of hush" is named in paragraph 6 (late first mention, −0.3), returns at the placement beat and the final touch, and carries thematic weight (silence as understanding). It enables one key choice (positioning it last at the convergence point) and charges the closing image. However, it reads more as a poetic label for the largest fragment than a concept that shapes tactics across beats. Lyric reprise reweights the stake (silence between heartbeats), reaching the low 6s, but swappability is moderate—"largest shard" could replace it with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Retrocognition is signaled in paragraph 3, enables two distinct beats (seeing the prism's centuries of service, witnessing the old lightkeeper's gesture), and constrains her method (she charts "according to her retrocognitive visions"). The trait imposes no visible cost (no nausea, time loss, or social friction), capping the score below 8.0. It is irreplaceable—without it, she cannot see the historical threads or the lightkeeper's parallel gesture—and participates in closure (the final touch yields vision). Early signal, middle and closure participation all present.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Rekindle" frames the goal from paragraph 5 onward, drives the shard-placement sequence, and delivers the climax ("The beacon rekindles."). The action redefines Mira's options (she can now prove her thesis, however partially) and the distant figure's turn hinges on the rekindled light. Early signal (implicit in "If she could rekindle the beacon, she could prove it"), middle development (four years of prep), and closure participation (the beacon pulses, the figure pauses). Causal pressure is strong; removing "rekindle" would require a different climax entirely.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Star-path tracking is signaled in paragraph 7 ("Mira has spent four years tracking star paths through the pavilion's surviving glass"), constrains her method (Orion alignment dictates tonight's attempt), and enables the rekindling beat. It appears in two beats (charting phase, alignment execution) and shapes the closure's timing. However, the mechanics remain abstract—"mapping the angles where the seven shards might focus again" is summary rather than dramatized calculation. Functional and non-ornamental, but the method could be replaced with "lunar cycles" or "seasonal light" without deep structural loss, capping the score in the upper 6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The pavilion is introduced in paragraph 2 (early signal), supplies the "northeastern facet" alignment cue that dictates shard placement (middle development), and charges the final image ("The glass pavilion hums. The light reaches out."). Its wind-song and surviving panes create atmosphere and micro-setting that constrains the rekindling method (light must pass through specific gaps). Spatial choreography is clear (crowns the tower, Mira positions shards within it). Causal pressure is moderate; the pavilion is essential to the light's focusing but could be replaced by "cracked lens array" with edits, landing it in the mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The collapse is named in the opening line and paragraph 4, establishes the broken prism and scattered humanity, and tightens the stakes (no airships to guide, Mira works alone). It does not impose a live clock or urgent deadline—four years of prep and "tonight" create pacing, but the collapse itself is backdrop rather than active pressure. Early signal and closure participation (the figure in the post-collapse world) are present, but middle development is thin. The timeframe enables the premise but could be replaced with "after the war" or "during the long winter" without altering tactics, placing it in the low-to-mid 6s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira's desire to prove coincidences have meaning is dramatized in paragraph 6 ("her motivation crystallized the night she held the prism's largest shard") and tested across the star-charting effort and shard placement. The motivation drives two beats (the four-year prep, the alignment attempt) and participates in closure ("The coincidences will continue... someone, someday, might finally learn to listen"). Friction between faith and isolation is legible ("desperate faith," "fragile and stubborn and alive"). The cost—years of solitary labor, reduced reach—is visible. Early signal, middle development, and closure linkage all present; specificity and causal pressure push it into the upper 7s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Thistle-blown hope" is coined early (paragraph 1: "scattered humanity like thistle seeds"; paragraph 10: "thistle-blown hope rise in her chest") and modulates from fragility to stubborn persistence across the rekindling sequence. Tone is coherent through turns—lyric compression in the opening, technical focus mid-piece, expansive hope at closure—and charges the final image ("fragile and stubborn and alive," the figure's pause). The thistle motif recurs with reweighted meaning, and the tone avoids static sentiment. However, "thistle-blown" reads slightly ornamental (swappable with "wind-scattered" or "seed-light") rather than irreplaceable, capping the score in the mid-7s.</comment>
