<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira's internal contradiction—holding seventeen truths against ritual precision—is visible on the page, and her final defiant choice forecloses absolution with felt cost. Fen reads young and mischievous through his delight in refraction, though his interior remains thin. Minor concern: Mira's brother's death remains abstract; no single concrete image of that event anchors her guilt across the variations. The ending choice is consistent with her established stance, but the brother himself never becomes embodied enough to charge the final renunciation fully.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through poetry-session refraction, deepening the architecture of grief until the final image reconfigures the ritual's demand into defiant wandering. Closure lands as Earned Stasis with visible cost—Mira will not simplify, and she accepts eternal echoes. Orientation anchors early: canyon, bone towers, tomorrow's ritual. One meaningful deepening occurs when the poetry session's purpose shifts from preparation to rebellion, and the final descent reweights all prior refractions with conceptual cost (forgiveness refused, memory preserved).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Bone stairs, mist, pale spire, and canyon acoustics are vivid and filter through Mira's artist lens. The "forged hush" of the chamber—sound swallowed to prevent canyon echoes—constrains the poetry sessions and charges the final image when her echoes join the canyon's cacophony. Spatial choreography is clear across tower, window, chamber, and descent. Minor limit: the bone towers function more as atmospheric backdrop than active constraint on Mira's choices within the scene; they set mood without narrowing her tactical options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to collapse truth into one confession or preserve all versions—is signaled early and tightens through the poetry session's refractive practice. One clear deepening: the sessions are revealed as rebellion, not preparation, which narrows Mira's path to refusal. Her final descent forecloses absolution with visible cost (eternal wandering, joining the lost). Coincidence does not resolve; her choice drives the ending. The price of defiance is legible and felt, though the on-page pressure could have been sharpened by showing a moment of genuine temptation toward the ritual's promise.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—multiplicity versus precision, grief's architecture versus convenient absolution—emerges through the poetry sessions and the spire's ritual design without thesis statements. The final image of Mira descending to join the echoes offers a resonant, non-literal answer: she chooses eternal remembering over reductive forgiveness. The seventeen variations and the phrase "eternal wandering, eternal remembering, every truth held at once" integrate theme into action. No moralizing in the final paragraph; the pale spire's outline softening in mist reweights the opening window-view with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited through Mira; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature—artist framing truth as refracted light, noticing the "forged hush," calling defiance "its own kind of art"—is character-specific. Fen's dialogue ("Tell us something") and youthful delight carry distinct voice. Minor density concern: "that deliberately mischievous quality that made even grim requests sound like games" over-explains rather than trusting the quoted line. Filter verbs ("watched," "had learned") are voice-consistent and do not dull immediacy. Diction stays within Mira's register; no corporate drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; each paragraph advances Mira's stance or the ritual's mechanics. Rhythm varies naturally, and the final image ("her echoes joining all the others") propels without scaffold. Two template-cadence runs lower the score slightly: "No—" repeated four times in quick succession reads mechanical rather than urgent, and "seventeen different deaths, seventeen different guilts, seventeen different sisters" stacks into a list that flattens rather than intensifies. No paraphrase loops or synonym churn. Clarity and momentum remain strong, but the "No—" sequence and the seventeen-fold list trigger a −0.4 deduction for pattern artifact in a high-pressure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The concept—ritual forgiveness demanding precision versus defiant preservation of all truths—offers a fresh angle on guilt and memory. The poetry sessions as rebellion (not preparation) and the bone-tower setting transform familiar confession tropes through specific world logic. Risk: Mira's choice to wander rather than simplify avoids the safety middle and commits fully to its cost. Minor swappability: the brother's death could be replaced with any irrevocable loss without structural change; the particulars of his death never constrain her present choices. The ending feels earned in hindsight, and the canyon-echo recursion charges the final image with conceptual integrity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's defiant-artist stance shapes every beat: she refracts truths in the poetry session (middle), refuses the ritual's precision (ending), and chooses descent into the canyon (final action). Her decision alters tactics from preparation to rebellion and forecloses absolution with visible cost. Introduced early, drives two key beats, and is causally active at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The pale spire appears in the opening window view, is named again at the poetry session, and its outline "softening in the deepening mist" closes the piece with charged reprise. It frames the ritual's threat and reweights in the final image. However, Mira does not handle or interact with it; it remains distant symbol rather than tactile constraint. Two touches (opening, ending) with thematic resonance, but no middle development that narrows her options.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The price of forgiveness—ritual precision versus eternal wandering—structures the entire conflict. It shapes Mira's tactics (poetry sessions to diffuse truth), forces the final choice (descend or confess), and appears in the ending image ("the price of forgiveness she had chosen to pay"). The concept is dramatized on the page, not merely thematic echo, and its dual costs (absolution's reduction vs. memory's exile) are both legible.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Fen's "innocently mischievous quality" is labeled, then shown in his request ("Tell us something") and his delighted reaction to Mira's variations. It enables one beat: his request prompts Mira's performance. However, the trait does not constrain later action or impose visible cost; he remains a catalyst without developmental pressure. Present in setup and middle, but closure participation is absent.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Refract" is the story's central action: Mira refracts her truth into seventeen versions, the poetry sessions are described as breaking truths "like bread," and the final choice hinges on refusing to collapse refractions. The action drives the middle beat (poetry performance) and defines the ending stance (preserve all truths). Removing "refract" would require structural overhaul; no near-synonym (e.g., "split," "vary") carries the light-spectrum specificity or the artist's lens that charges the concept.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The impromptu poetry sessions are signaled early ("This was how it worked in the bone towers"), their mechanics matter (shared refraction diffuses truth), and they drive Mira's middle performance and the revelation that they are rebellion, not preparation. The method enables her final choice by proving that precision is refusable. Present across all three gates with causal pressure; the sessions constrain the ritual's hold and shape the ending's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The towers of bone provide spatial anchors (spiraling stairs, narrow window, chamber above) and the canyon's endless echoes underpin the closure image (Mira's voice joining the lost). The "forged hush" of the chamber—sound swallowed to prevent premature echoes—constrains the poetry sessions' acoustics. However, the bones themselves (leviathans, yellowed centuries) remain decorative; Mira does not handle or navigate around them in ways that alter her choices. Setting pressures the ending and enables one middle tactic (controlled silence), but the bones are more atmospheric than functional.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Before the ritual" and "tomorrow's ritual" frame every choice with deadline pressure. The timeframe tightens Mira's decision: poetry session tonight, descent before dawn. The clock is legible and motivates the final act ("Before the ritual came, she would climb down"). However, the elapsed time within the poetry session is not tracked, and no moment shows Mira checking the night's progress. Present in setup and ending, with one clear tactical consequence (she must choose now), but mid-scene time discipline is loose.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira's desire—to refract a single truth into many—is dramatized on the page through the poetry performance, conflicts with the ritual's demand for precision, and drives the ending choice. The motivation is charged with cost: preserving all versions means eternal exile. Friction between want (honor the full architecture of grief) and price (forgiveness lost) is visible in the final paragraph. The motivation appears early, constrains middle tactics, and is causally active at closure with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "forged hush" is named, explained (deliberate silence to prevent canyon echoes), and modulates under pressure: quiet chamber to gathering poetry to Mira's final image of echoes multiplying. Tone charges the ending when the forged silence breaks into eternal reverberation. However, the label "forged hush" itself appears only once; the effect is sustained through description rather than recurring anchor. Coherent through turns, participates in closure, but could be more tightly woven as a returning phrase to reach higher bands.</comment>
