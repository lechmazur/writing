<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cal's involuntary truthfulness is established clearly, and his choice to reveal through riddles rather than plain speech shows internal contradiction. Mira's motivation lacks embodied conflict—she pursues a solution methodically without visible internal stakes or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final paragraph's claim that she "carried a reminder that miracles hide in plain sight" tells rather than dramatizes her transformation, and no visible cost forecloses a path on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. The closure unit is a conceptual repricing: the final image reweights wonder as more precious than the solution itself. However, the cost remains asserted rather than felt—no prior option is visibly foreclosed, and Mira's ascent into darkness reads as poetic gesture rather than a choice that narrows her world. The drive lens wobbles between Causal (sabotage → riddle → vault solution) and Accumulative/Textural (nectar dusk, wonder motifs), settling only in the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tower's copper stairs, lacquer box, and painted matchboxes anchor setting through tactile detail. The nectar dusk imagery is sustained and purposeful. The vault combination (7-19-42) arrives late without prior setup, reducing its constraint value. The final image of stars above dormant lightning rods charges the closure beat cleanly, satisfying the 9+ gate test for this category.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring city power—is signaled early but remains abstract; we never see citizens suffering or Mira's personal jeopardy. The riddle's solution arrives without meaningful tightening: Cal simply tells her the vault location and combination. No on-page choice narrows options or imposes visible cost; the "cure sleeps in the first sting" is exposition, not earned agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme of wonder-versus-routine emerges organically from Cal's matchbox collection and the forgotten sacredness of bees and lightning. The riddle functions as subtext rather than exposition. The final image offers a non-literal answer: carrying wonder is more valuable than the technical fix. Minor deduction for the closing line's direct thematic statement ("miracles hide in plain sight, waiting for someone candid enough to name them"), which tilts toward summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third on Mira. Distinct perceptual signature is present in "honey-colored hour when the world seemed suspended" and "metal rain." Cal's dialogue carries subtext ("You already suspect the truth") and his voice is distinct from Mira's interiority. The prose modulates appropriately from nectar-dusk lyricism to functional exposition when Cal explains the sabotage, though the vault-combination handoff feels abrupt in register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Opening and closing images are vivid and purposeful. Information density is high; most lines advance world or conflict. Minor artifact: "people climb past me every day without seeing me" and "I've been keeper of this tower for three decades" paraphrase the same invisibility-in-routine idea within two lines. The riddle's elaborate presentation ("hand-painted symbols she didn't recognize") slows momentum briefly without payoff, as the symbols are never referenced again.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The combination of lightning-collection infrastructure, mechanical bees, and enzymatic batteries is inventive and internally consistent. The toll-keeper-as-riddle-collector adds texture but feels ornamental—his matchboxes could be a simple archive with minimal change. The sabotage plot is functional but follows familiar infrastructure-mystery beats. The nectar-dusk frame and wonder-preservation angle provide a fresh synthesis, elevating the material above template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Cal appears in one sustained beat (tower landing). His choice to reveal via riddle rather than plain speech constrains his method and ties to his attribute. He does not drive the inciting incident or closure; Mira's climb and discovery proceed independently. Swappable with a helpful librarian or clerk with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The lacquer box is opened and closed in one beat. It stores the matchboxes but does not itself constrain action or return with reweighted meaning. Its "black surface reflecting the dying sun like still water" is description without causal work. Removing it and having Cal hand Mira a matchbox directly would not alter structure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Drone beehive failure is the inciting incident (blackout), frames the city's fear, and the prototype queen in the vault provides the solution. Signaled early ("hive smoke," falling drones). It shapes Mira's goal and Cal's explanation. The enzymatic-compound mechanism is specific and irreplaceable. Minor cap: the failure is solved off-page; we do not see Mira retrieve or deploy the prototype, so closure participation is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Involuntarily truthful since birth" is established in paragraph five and motivates Cal's riddle-reveal method: he cannot lie, so he chooses *how* to tell truth. This appears in one beat without visible tradeoff—his condition does not create friction or narrow options on the page. Most people avoid him, but Mira does not, so the attribute's social cost is told rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Reveal" structures Cal's entire scene: he opens the box, selects the riddle matchbox, and discloses the vault combination. The action drives exposition and provides the key to resolution. However, it is passive receipt for Mira; she does not earn the reveal through negotiation or trade. Swappable with "decrypt," "request," or "discover" with modest edits, limiting indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The matchbox containing the riddle appears mid-scene, is read three times, and clarifies the vault's purpose. The riddle ("When the keeper becomes the kept...") reframes the sabotage and points to the prototype. Its painted bee-and-lightning motif ties thematically to the concept. Minor friction: the riddle was written fourteen years ago by the programmer, not generated by the present conflict, so it feels like a planted clue rather than a dynamic method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The lightning collection tower frames the entire scene spatially: Mira climbs, pauses at the first landing for Cal's booth, then ascends higher as stars emerge. The tower's dormant state (no charge, silent rods) drives the city's fear and Mira's mission. The vault beneath provides the solution's location. The copper stairs and nectar-light-on-struts imagery charges the final image. Removing the tower setting would break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After the city-wide blackout" anchors present action and the city's twelve-hour darkness drives urgency ("People are afraid," "another night without power"). The timeframe does not tighten tactics on the page—Mira proceeds at a steady pace with no clock pressure. Cal's "tonight" and "tomorrow" frame the ending but do not alter her choices within the scene.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Cal's desire "to preserve wonder in routine" is stated explicitly and dramatized through his matchbox collection and riddle-giving practice. It motivates his choice of *how* to reveal (riddles, not plain speech) and ties to the theme. Minor cap: the motivation belongs to Cal, not the protagonist Mira, whose stake remains abstract problem-solving. The motivation shapes one scene but does not create on-page friction or cost for Cal himself.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Nectar dusk—that particular honey-colored hour" is established in the opening and sustained through "amber sky," "dying sun," "purple shadows climbing," and "nectar light...into genuine darkness." The tone modulates from suspension ("what was and what could be") to somber practicality during Cal's exposition, then lifts again in the final image as Mira ascends "through nectar dusk into genuine darkness." The tone charges the closure image and integrates with the wonder-preservation theme, meeting the high-band test.</comment>
