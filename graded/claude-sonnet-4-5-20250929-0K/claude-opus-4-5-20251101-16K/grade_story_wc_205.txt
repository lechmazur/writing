<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and particular—pressing the shard until it marks her palm, her revolutionary past informing present choices. Internal contradiction surfaces in her wanting to forget yet being unable to let go of the Carvers' humanity. The backstory (revolution, daughter's death) occupies significant space but anchors present stakes: her drive to restore dignity to the dead mirrors her own need for meaning after loss. Minor slip: the Council remains abstract; no on-page resistance tests her resolve in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal elements. Orientation anchors (Maren, baroque asteroid, research station) arrive within the first two paragraphs. The piece accumulates through crystal shard → storm → core chambers → report drafting, with each beat deepening her interpretive stakes. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "In the morning, she would begin again" crystallizes her stance—persistence as revolutionary act—with the felt cost of perpetual dispute and isolation visible in "The Council would dispute her findings. They always did." One meaningful tightening occurs when she finds the intact vessels holding preserved moments, reweighting her theory from conjecture to evidence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid functions as more than backdrop: carved spires, temporal light clinging like moss, and core chambers constrain Maren's investigative path and supply the evidence (funeral vessels) crucial to her argument. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—she sees "grief encoded in angles" where the Council sees "aesthetic excess." The mirrors-covered-during-storms detail integrates spatial logic with world rules (temporal resonance, madness risk). The crystal shard as micro-setting charges multiple beats: tactile (pressed to palm), interpretive (fractured planes/poetry), and evidential (cousins in the core). Small slip: the station layout remains vague during the storm sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and signaled early: restoring the Carvers' spiritual depth against the Council's dismissal. One meaningful tightening occurs when the storm passes and Maren descends to the core, finding intact vessels that transform her conjecture into demonstrable evidence—a narrowing from theory to proof. Agency is present but mostly internal: she gathers equipment, photographs, drafts a report. The resolution ("In the morning, she would begin again") is earned by her persistence and revolutionary identity, though the Council remains off-page, reducing immediate pressure. Cost is felt (isolation, perpetual dispute) but not viscerally tested in a scene-level confrontation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (grief, memory, the act of interpretation as restoration) emerges organically from the Carvers' funeral vessels, Maren's lost daughter, and her revolutionary past converging without thesis statement. The shard's return—"beside the report" in the penultimate paragraph—reweights it from disputed fragment to prayer, and the final image ("artists of grief, architects of memory") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether the dead can be given back their humanity through proper witness. Subtext operates in "defunct revolutionary" and the mirrored losses (her daughter, the Carvers' children). Minor deduction: "poets whose language was light and stone and sorrow" in the final paragraph borders on overt summary, though it remains imagistic enough to avoid flat moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled; Maren's perceptual signature is consistent (she reads grief in geometry, poetry in crystal planes). Diction matches her dual identity: poetic ("temporal debris," "luminous ribbons") yet precise ("funeral vessel," "temporal accumulation"). The prose modulates appropriately—lyric during reflection, tighter during the storm. Psychic distance is purposeful: close during the mirror scene ("older than she remembered, eyes holding the burnished sorrow"), slightly elevated when describing the Carvers to maintain interpretive authority. Small deduction: "She was poetically inclined enough to recognize what the Council could not" tells rather than trusts the prior dramatization, breaking the established distance briefly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high: "Once she had rallied millions on three worlds. Now she catalogued fragments" compresses backstory into propulsive contrast. Opening and closing images are strong. Minor loop: "grief" appears frequently (crescent mark/grief encoded/their grief still glowed/artists of grief) without always adding pressure; the repetition feels more thematic than structural. The storm sequence is clear, though "moved through the research station, covering mirrors" is slightly summary-like for a beat that establishes world rules. Figurative language is controlled and voice-consistent ("time itself churning," "amber luminescence") without purple excess. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—archaeological dispute filtered through a bereaved revolutionary's interpretive lens, set against a temporal-physics conceit—feels specific and non-obvious. The funeral vessels encoding moments in crystal matrices offer fresh materialization of memory. Risk-taking is present: the piece trusts lyric pacing and keeps the Council off-page, building pressure through internal commitment rather than confrontation. The transformation test passes: swap Maren's identity or the Carvers' medium and the emotional architecture changes. Small deduction: "time becomes visible" as amber light is a striking premise but remains underexplored in how it specifically shapes Maren's tactics beyond the storm/mirror protocol; it functions more as atmospheric detail than lever for choice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's identity as "defunct revolutionary" is signaled in paragraph two and shapes her persistence ("revolutionaries understood that truth required patience, persistence"). It informs her conflict with the Council and her drive to restore the Carvers' humanity, mirroring her need for meaning after personal defeat. It appears in the closure paragraph ("The defunct revolutionary slept") and charges the final stance ("In the morning, she would begin again"). The trait enables her interpretive lens but does not force a on-page tactical tradeoff with visible cost; her revolutionary methods (patience, drafting reports) are low-conflict. Two-gate presence (setup, closure) with strong thematic linkage but limited causal pressure in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The crystal vase shard appears in four distinct beats: pressed to palm (paragraph two), held during the storm (paragraph nine), lifted to light in the core (paragraph twelve), and placed beside the report (paragraph fifteen). Its function evolves: tactile anchor → talisman → interpretive key ("Poetry. Grief encoded in angles") → evidence cousin. The closure links it to the report, reweighting it from disputed fragment to prayer. It constrains her argument (the Council dismisses it as decorative) and enables her discovery (finding intact cousins validates her reading). Cost is present but oblique: her attachment to it isolates her professionally. Strong integration across beats and closure, though the specific properties (fractured planes, temporal refraction) do not directly alter a tactic on the page.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The archaeological dispute is the dominant stake, signaled in paragraph three ("whether the Carvers... had possessed spiritual depth or merely aesthetic excess"). It drives Maren's investigation, frames her descent to the core, and motivates the report she drafts. The dispute appears at closure ("The Council would dispute her findings. They always did") and charges her resolve to persist. However, the Council remains abstract and off-page; the dispute does not force an on-page tactical choice with immediate cost. The concept shapes the what (her goal) more than the how (her methods under pressure). Two-gate presence (setup, closure) with thematic coherence but limited causal friction in middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Poetically inclined" is stated once in paragraph twelve ("She was poetically inclined enough to recognize what the Council could not") and echoed in her perceptual filter throughout (reading grief in angles, seeing the shard as prayer). It enables her interpretation but does not constrain a choice with visible cost; it functions more as explanatory trait than tactical friction. The attribute is present in closure thinking ("poets whose language was light and stone and sorrow") but does not force a tradeoff. One-gate presence (middle/closure) with thematic resonance but limited on-page cost. The line that names it borders on tell rather than show, though prior beats have dramatized the sensibility.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Devise" appears in paragraph ten ("Maren began to devise her approach"). It introduces her plan (gather evidence the Council cannot dismiss) and drives the descent to the core chambers where she finds the intact vessels—a major turn. The action is present in setup and middle development, shaping the discovery beat. However, the mechanics of devising are summary ("She would need evidence... photographs proved nothing... show them time itself") rather than scene-level problem-solving with friction. The intact vessels resolve her problem, but the action itself (sitting, thinking, planning) lacks physical or tactical texture. Two-gate presence (middle, indirectly in closure via the report) with causal linkage but minimal on-page cost or constraint during execution.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Covering mirrors during storms" is introduced in paragraph six ("protocol demanded") and executed in paragraphs seven-eight. The method supplies world-rule texture (mirrors trap temporal resonance, cause madness) and one character beat (Maren catches her reflection, sees her sorrow). It does not shape a middle choice or return at closure; the storm passes and she proceeds to the core without mirrors affecting tactics or outcome. The method is functional set-dressing that enriches setting but remains ornamental to the central conflict. One-gate presence (middle) without closure participation or causal pressure on the archaeological dispute. The dramatic potential (madness, trapped consciousness) is described but not tested.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid is present from the opening line and anchors every beat: carved spires, temporal moss, core chambers with funeral vessels, the dome through which the storm approaches. The setting supplies the evidence Maren needs (vessels in the core) and constrains her movements (descent to chambers, covering mirrors). Spatial detail is consistent (observatory windows, research station, dome, core). The asteroid's carved-cathedral quality charges the thematic question (aesthetic excess vs. spiritual depth) and the final image ("baroque spires caught starlight"). Three-gate presence (setup, middle, closure) with strong causal and thematic integration. Minor deduction: the station's interior layout during the storm is vague, and the transition from station to core chambers is compressed.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Time becomes visible" is signaled in paragraph five ("Since time had become visible three centuries ago") and manifests as amber light, temporal storms, and light captured in crystal vessels. The timeframe enables the Carvers' funeral technology (preserving moments in crystal) and Maren's evidence (time glowing in the vessels). The storm creates urgency (descent must wait until it passes) but does not tighten a choice; it functions more as atmospheric interlude than escalation lever. The timeframe is present in closure ("time drifted past in luminous ribbons") and charges the final image. Two-gate presence (setup, closure) with strong thematic linkage and setting integration, but the storm itself does not alter tactics or force a tradeoff. The concept is evocative but remains more premise than pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to reimagine an entire civilization" is stated in paragraph four ("She wanted to reimagine an entire civilization, to restore their humanity") and drives every subsequent beat: her interpretation of the shard, her descent to the core, her discovery of the vessels, and her drafting of the report. It is present in closure ("the civilization she would give back to the universe") and charges her resolve to persist despite the Council's inevitable rejection. The motivation is dramatized through her actions (gathering evidence, drafting through the night) and conflicted by the futility implied in "They always did" (dispute her findings). Three-gate presence (setup, middle, closure) with strong causal and thematic integration. Cost is felt (isolation, perpetual struggle) but not viscerally tested in a scene-level confrontation; the Council remains abstract.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tone "burnished sorrow" is established in paragraph two ("defunct revolutionary," causes scattered) and sustained through imagery: crescent mark, daughter's death, "eyes holding the burnished sorrow," grief encoded in angles, temporal light as memorial glow. The tone modulates appropriately—elegiac during reflection, tighter during the storm, resolute at closure ("In the morning, she would begin again"). It charges the final image: "artists of grief, architects of memory, poets whose language was light and stone and sorrow." Three-gate presence (setup, middle, closure) with consistent diction and thematic coherence. The tone is purposeful and controlled under pressure, avoiding sentimentality while maintaining emotional weight. Minor deduction: the final paragraph's explicit naming of "sorrow" borders on summary rather than trusting the established atmosphere.</comment>
