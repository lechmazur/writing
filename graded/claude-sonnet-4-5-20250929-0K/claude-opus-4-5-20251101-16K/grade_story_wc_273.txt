<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vera's obsession is embodied through concrete rituals (tracking ink patterns, commanding the drone) and her motivation—understanding stretched crisis-time to reach Marcus—drives every choice. The "serene anger" is physicalized in her methodical preparation and cold dissection of the universe's mechanisms. Internal contradiction appears when she questions whether time's slowdown was torture or gift, and the final decision to pursue Marcus into folded time carries visible cost (potential self-erasure). Minor deduction: the backstory block is substantial (~20%) but does anchor present stakes and primes the closure choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through ink-pattern intensification, eclipse timing, and the brother's glimpsed figure, culminating in Vera's decision to create a larger pattern and step through. Closure qualifies as Charged Poise: the final image crystallizes her options (find Marcus or disappear alongside him) with undeniable emotional cost, and the "serene fury" reconfigures into active pursuit. Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored by ~100 words). One meaningful deepening occurs when the ink reveals Marcus climbing endlessly, transforming her understanding from "time slowed" to "time folded with prisoners."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The wind-carved sandstone pillars, desert wind, and eclipse aftermath create a vivid sensory frame filtered through Vera's kinship with "frozen screams." The disappearing ink and stone table function as micro-setting tools that constrain her experimental method and charge the closure (she will "pour enough ink to create a pattern large enough to step through"). Spatial choreography is clear throughout. Minor gap: the encampment's layout and how it enables or restricts her work could be more tactile, but the body/tool/object constraint for 9+ is met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding crisis-time to recover Marcus—is signaled early and tightens when the ink reveals him trapped in folded moments. The escalation is Accumulative: pattern complexity grows during the eclipse, then the glimpse of Marcus forces Vera's final commitment to step through herself. Agency is clear: her decision to mix stronger solution and wait for the next alignment forecloses her present life with visible cost. The price is felt on the page ("bring her brother home, or disappear into that amber light herself"). No protagonist passivity; her methodical pursuit drives every beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—time as layered prison, the gift/curse of stretched crisis perception—emerges through concrete images (disappearing ink, amber light, Marcus climbing endlessly) without thesis statements. The final image of Vera preparing for the next attempt offers a resonant answer: she will inhabit the question rather than resolve it, accepting self-erasure as the cost of kinship. The "serene anger" deepens from cold dissection to active rescue mission. The ink patterns function as genuine motif (not token recurrence), constraining her method and charging closure. Minor wobble: "Time was not linear, she knew now" edges toward articulation, but the surrounding particulars (folded rooms, hidden doors) keep it grounded.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: Vera notices time-traces, kinship with carved stone, and ephemeral blueprints through her scientist-hermit lens. Diction matches her voice ("consciously wild," "dissected its mechanisms with cold precision") and modulates under pressure without losing coherence. No head-hopping. The drone's commands and the backstory of Marcus's fall are smoothly anchored to present stimuli. Filter verbs ("felt kinship," "understood then") appear but read voice-motivated rather than distancing. One brief register note: "serene fury" in the penultimate section feels slightly elevated compared to earlier "serene anger," though the shift may be intentional escalation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high (most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes). Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor deductions: "She felt kinship with them" immediately after describing the pillars as frozen screams could be cut (shown, then told). The phrase "the kind that had calcified into something permanent and patient" adds texture but slightly stalls momentum in a backstory-heavy paragraph. "Eventually, she would pour enough ink" in the final third repeats the core plan without new pressure. Still, clarity and propulsion remain strong through peak beats, and figurative language (molten glass, amber light) is coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise—tracking time's traces via disappearing ink during eclipses—offers a fresh synthesis of grief-driven science and speculative restraint. The transformation of "time slows in crisis" into "perception stretches to glimpse folded moments" feels earned rather than late-rule convenience. Vera's choice to pursue Marcus into time's hidden rooms avoids the safety middle. Minor reservation: the wind-carved encampment and hummingbird drone, while vivid, approach familiar "isolated scientist" iconography; the emotional specificity (serene anger, kinship with stone) and the ink-as-portal mechanic provide enough particularity to elevate, but not enough for highest originality bands.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>0.0</grade><comment>Vera is not described as albino; no textual evidence of this trait.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The drone appears in three beats: hovering at Vera's shoulder recording pattern 43, swooping closer on her command to magnify, and settling on her shoulder at the end as it powers down. It enables her documentation method and its "emerald eye" and "precise silence" are specific. However, its role is instrumental rather than causally decisive—removing it would require only minor edits (she could sketch or photograph). It does not constrain a choice or reweight meaning at closure, capping it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Disappearing ink is introduced early, shapes the central experimental method (ephemeral patterns reveal hidden dimensions), drives the middle beat (pattern forms doorway, glimpse of Marcus), and anchors the closure decision ("pour enough ink to create a pattern large enough to step through"). The ink's vanishing property creates urgency and constraint. Removing it would collapse the story's logic and tactics. Cost is tied directly to its use: Vera must wait for alignments, evidence vanishes, and she risks self-erasure by stepping through.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Consciously wild" is introduced early as a post-accident choice and enables her desert isolation, but the trait itself does not constrain a specific on-page action with visible cost. It functions more as backstory context (explaining her departure from institutes) than as a live attribute shaping tactics. The label appears but does not drive a turn or trade-off in the present action, placing it in the functional-but-replaceable range.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"Disappear" anchors both backstory (Marcus disappeared into the canyon) and closure (Vera will "disappear into that amber light herself"). The verb recurs with escalating stakes: evidence disappears from drives, the ink vanishes, and Vera's final commitment is to vanish alongside Marcus or bring him home. The action redefines her options at closure and the entire plot hinges on understanding disappearance as entry into folded time rather than annihilation. Removing this exact action would require fundamental restructuring.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The method—ephemeral patterns in spilled ink—is signaled early (pattern sequence 43), demonstrated in the middle beat (spirals, fractals, doorway configuration), and directly shapes Vera's future attempts at closure ("mix a stronger solution," "pour enough ink"). The mechanics matter: patterns grow complex during alignments, vanish quickly, require the drone to capture. The method constrains her tactics (she must wait for eclipses, work fast) and its fragility drives urgency. Integral to plot and closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The wind-carved encampment is introduced early with vivid detail (sandstone pillars, desert wind, tent) and reflects Vera's isolation choice. It provides the stone table for her experiments and the acoustic frame ("wind sang through the carved pillars"). However, the setting does not pressure a key choice—she could perform this experiment elsewhere with minor adjustments. The environment enriches atmosphere and mirrors theme (carved by time like Vera) but does not alter tactics or outcome, placing it in the "shapes one key turn" range via its contribution to the closure image's resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The timeframe is anchored early ("seventeen minutes ago") and the eclipse's end frames the opening, but the constraint does not tighten decisions after that. Vera's plan extends to "tomorrow" and "another alignment" without on-page pressure from the current window closing. The post-eclipse moment enables heightened ink patterns, giving it causal relevance to one beat, but it does not function as a live clock that alters moves or escalates urgency within the scene. Functional in setup, minimal in escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The motivation—"to discover why time slows in crisis"—is introduced early, dramatized through Vera's experiments and Marcus's fall flashback, and evolves at closure when she reframes the question (time doesn't slow, perception stretches to glimpse folded moments). The desire drives her three-year search, the current ink experiment, and her final commitment to step through. Friction appears between her cold methodology and the emotional cost of potentially joining Marcus in endless falling. The motivation is indispensable and shapes the ending's charge.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Serene anger" is introduced early ("Her anger was serene, the kind that had calcified"), recurs with variation ("serene fury"), and modulates appropriately under pressure—cooling into methodical observation during the ink experiment, then charging the closure commitment ("she would face with the same serene fury"). The tone is coherent through turns and charges the final image (preparing with patient, relentless resolve). It avoids static mood by showing the anger's patient quality enabling three years of searching and now compelling self-risk. Strong integration, just shy of indispensable.</comment>
