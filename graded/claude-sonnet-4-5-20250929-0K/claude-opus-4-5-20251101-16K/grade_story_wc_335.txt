<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vera's contradictory impulses—her nervous backward walking versus her combative mentoring stance—act simultaneously in scene. The boy's hollowed-out exile state is embodied through tea-leaf reading and his trembling first words rather than labeled. The daughter's shadow sphere anchors Vera's motivation with concrete cost (thirteen years of waiting), and the final choice to pick up the pen is earned by the prior pressure. Minor slip: the "sharp with a tenderness that refused to be gentle" risks over-articulation at a peak beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Charged Poise: the boy picking up the pen crystallizes the reversal from hopelessness to active return, and the cost is visible (he must now endure being "fought every step"). The inferred lens is Causal with lyric accents (tea leaves, shadow sphere); the because/therefore chain holds from exile diagnosis through Vera's combative offer to the boy's agency. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when Vera reveals reversibility and the boy must choose whether to engage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The forgotten library pressures choice: Vera's reading desk, the tea pot, the velvet cradle for the shadow sphere all function as micro-setting that constrains her mentoring ritual. The playground swing outside marks the timeframe and mirrors the boy's suspended state. Spatial choreography is clean (backward walking, pouring tea, pulling book from shelf). The shadow sphere charges the final image when it "seemed to shift," reweighting the daughter's return as template for the boy's path.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (can the boy reverse his exile?) is signaled early and tightens when Vera offers combative mentorship instead of comfort. The boy's agency—picking up the pen—narrows options (he must now endure her fighting him) with visible cost. One meaningful reversal: Vera's initial defensiveness ("rough-edged") gives way to her combative tenderness, and the boy shifts from passive questioning to active writing. The tea-leaf geometry and his name already in the book deepen inevitability without resolving through coincidence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (return requires resilience woven into bones, not loud performance) emerges from Vera's annotated records, the daughter's shadow, and the boy's trembling pen without explicit thesis. The final image—shadow shifting, boy writing, scattered mirror reflections—offers a non-literal answer: reversibility is recursive practice, not single success. "Not how to succeed—how to return" crystallizes the thematic question. The glass sphere and mirror shards accumulate meaning across beats, constraining Vera's choices and charging the ending without symbolic convenience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is strong: Vera notices "the hush as an empty playground swing drifted," geometry in tea leaves, and walks backwards when nervous—character-specific filters. Dialogue is goal-driven (the boy seeks help, Vera pushes back) with subtext in "Want has nothing to do with it." Free indirect style is clean. Minor slip: "sharp with a tenderness that refused to be gentle" risks over-explanation at a peak emotional beat, slightly flattening the voice under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings avoid template runs. Information density is high: the tea pot is "painted with equations no mathematician had ever solved," doing world-building and tone work in one line. No paraphrase loops or scaffold detected. Minor slip: "that particular stillness of late afternoon" and "as if the tree it belonged to had felt a distant breeze" edge toward decorative phrasing without advancing pressure. The final image—mirror shards scattering light—propels resonance cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The shard-mirror archivist who catalogs exiles via tea-leaf geometry is specific and non-obvious. "Reversible exile" transforms the familiar mentor-student frame by making hopelessness a lie and resilience the recursive practice of returning. The daughter's afternoon shadow caught in glass is particular to this world and stakes. Combative tenderness as Vera's method avoids the safety middle. Risk: walking backwards as nervous tic and annotating records both heighten character specificity. The emotional arc (from declared permanence to the boy picking up the pen) feels inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vera's choices create key turns: she diagnoses exile via tea leaves, reveals reversibility (turning the boy's belief), offers combative mentorship, and watches him write. Her archival work frames the entire encounter. Present in setup, middle pressure, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The shadow sphere appears in two beats: when Vera lifts it to explain her daughter's exile and when it "seemed to shift" at the end, reweighting prior meaning. The object is handled (lifted from velvet cradle, set down firmly) and its reappearance charges the closure image. Missing tighter mid-scene development; the sphere remains static between introduction and final reprise.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Reversible exile shapes stakes (the boy believes it's permanent; Vera's revelation changes his options), tactics (Vera uses combative mentorship to teach resilience), and closure (the boy picks up the pen to begin reversing). Signaled early, drives two beats (tea-leaf diagnosis, Vera's explanation), and the final action (writing) is the on-page reversal mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Walking backwards appears in three beats: when the boy arrives, when Vera retreats toward shelves, and when she stops herself near the end. The trait embodies her nervousness and her struggle to mentor (stopping the retreat shows growth). Visible in setup and ending, but the cost remains implied rather than causally pivotal to a turn.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Annotating drives the premise: Vera's archival work is her life's purpose, the book already contains the boy's name (deepening inevitability), and the boy's first annotations mark the on-page reversal of his exile. Present in setup (her work), middle (the annotated book), and closure (he picks up the pen). Removing this action collapses the story's logic and method.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Tea-leaf geometry is signaled in one beat: Vera reads the boy's soul via the leaves, identifying his belief in permanence and "angles of determination." The method shapes the diagnosis (middle turn) but does not recur or constrain later tactics. Functional but not essential beyond the single diagnostic moment.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The forgotten library supplies resources (annotated records, tea pot, velvet cradle for the shadow) and pressures choice: Vera's desk is the threshold where exiles learn to return. The setting's abandonment mirrors the boy's exile state. Present in setup, used in middle beats (pulling the book), and charged at closure (the library "held its breath"). The setting is integral to Vera's archival identity and method.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The playground swing hush marks arrival and mirrors the boy's suspended state. The swing stills by evening, tracking passage. The timeframe is present in setup and noted at closure ("light...grew longer"), but it does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. Atmospheric rather than pressure-driving.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mentoring resilience quietly is dramatized through Vera's combative method ("fight you every step"), her refusal of pity, and her insistence on teaching return rather than success. The motivation is conflicted (her defensiveness when showing the shadow, her nervous retreats) and shapes her key choices. Friction between her want (to help) and her method (to push back) is visible across beats and charges the closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Combative tenderness is coherent through turns: Vera's "rough-edged" words when offering the shadow, "shoved the book toward him," and "sharp with a tenderness that refused to be gentle." The tone modulates under pressure (initial defensiveness to final watchfulness) and charges the ending image (mirror shards scattering "scattered possibilities"). The oxymoron is enacted rather than declared, and it shapes both dialogue and gesture.</comment>
