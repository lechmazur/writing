<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mira's characterization shows contradictory impulses—guarded defense versus vulnerability—that act simultaneously in scene. The confession's revelation motivates her final choice to release the seed and unbend, though the transition from "warlike serenity" to softness arrives somewhat abruptly. Internal voice remains coherent, with embodied tension in "fingers touched the seed, that familiar hunger pulsing against her palm." The teacher's backstory explanation works causally but edges toward diagnostic clarity ("you find what is lost because you are meant to return things to wholeness") that slightly flattens the discovery.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis shifting to active stance): Mira plants the seed, releases her guard, and the vortex parts—a visible alteration with cost (surrendering her last defense, accepting vulnerability). Orientation anchors by ~80 words (druid, cursed lake, orchard vortex). The inferred lens is Causal with Accumulative undertones: her choice to unbend causally weakens the vortex ("gave it nothing to grip"), and the cost is legible. One meaningful tightening occurs when the confession thaws and the vortex surges, forcing her choice. Minor cost proof: the seed's transfer and her departure "whole" show before/after, though the phrase "transformed now" leans slightly toward summary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The orchard vortex constrains Mira's approach (expanding circles, negotiation with the curse) and charges the final image when "trees parted like curtains." Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "Fruit rotted and bloomed simultaneously in the warped time." The lake and vortex function as micro-setting, applying immediate pressure. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the spiral walk and final planting. The mirror of still liquid at the center serves both as setting element and thematic payoff, constrained by the vortex's mechanics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discover the frozen confession and reclaim her gift—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening: the vortex surges when her defenses drop, creating a live choice between guarding (planting the seed offensively) and unbending. The reversal is protagonist-driven under the Causal lens: her vulnerability causally weakens the curse. Cost is visible: she surrenders her last weapon and accepts softness in a warlike place, foreclosing the defensive path. The climactic choice feels earned, though the mechanism ("curse fed on fear") is stated rather than fully dramatized through prior failed attempts.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete action: finding versus returning, guarding versus healing. The teacher's confession reweights Mira's self-concept without stating a moral. The final image—mirror showing purpose, not face—offers a non-literal answer to "what mirrors don't show." Minor deduction: "finding was only half her gift / Returning was the rest" articulates the theme overtly in the closing lines, edging toward summary. The flesh-eating seed's transfer to guard the place (rather than the healer) carries symbolic weight that feels earned by prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is character-specific: "impossible center where reality bent and groaned," "armor forged from stillness." Diction stays within Mira's register, blending natural observation with druidic perspective. The teacher's voice in the confession is distinct and modulates from fragmented to clear. Psychic distance shifts intentionally at the confession beat, deepening intimacy. Minor deduction: "warlike serenity" is declared early and repeated near the end, bordering on label rather than fully embodied modulation under peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is clear and propulsive with strong imagery ("branches reaching like desperate arms," "arrows of light through carefully constructed walls"). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no loops or scaffold detected. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Minor deductions: "transformation" and "whole" appear as summary claims in the final paragraphs rather than pure image. The phrase "Some hungers deserved to be fed by curse rather than carried by a healer" edges toward thematic assertion rather than dramatized insight, slightly dulling the closure beat's immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The premise—cursed lake that feeds on guardedness—offers a fresh angle on the "healer must heal herself" template. The paradox that softness defeats the curse inverts typical fantasy logic. The orchard vortex and flesh-eating seed as protective totem show specificity. Deductions: the core emotional arc (teacher's hidden truth reshapes student's self-concept) follows a familiar mentor-revelation structure. The ending's "violence no longer aimed inward" and "finding was only half" risk abstraction over earned particulars. Transformation test: the plot and arc could transfer to different names/settings with minor adjustments, suggesting mid-band freshness rather than full originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup: Mira's guardedness frames expectation early ("trained herself to expect nothing, want nothing"). Development: her instinct to guard versus unbend creates the key middle choice. Payoff: she actively chooses to unbend at closure, releasing her defensive stance. Causal pressure: guarded stance shapes tactics (carrying the seed, walking circles) and the final act (unbending) causally weakens the vortex. Cost: surrendering her last defense and accepting vulnerability with visible consequence (vortex parts, she emerges whole). Beat involvement: at least three (opening trait, confession reaction, climactic unbending). Specificity: "guarded" is irreplaceable—swapping for "cautious" would lose the defensive armor metaphor that the story hinges on.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: seed introduced early as "last defense." Development: Mira touches it when threatened, establishing its hunger and her reliance. Payoff: she plants it at the lake's heart, transferring guardianship. Two distinct beats (threat response, final planting). Causal pressure: the seed constrains her tactical options (she could plant it offensively but chooses not to). Closure linkage: planting it is part of the resolution. Minor deduction: the seed's mechanics (how it devours, why it guards the place now) remain abstract; we see it pulsing and planted but not in active use. Swappability check: another defensive tool could serve similar function with edits, though "flesh-eating" and "hunger" add thematic resonance to Mira's own starvation metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: "frozen confession" is named in paragraph four and framed as the search target. Development: Mira detects it ("pulse of frozen memory"), and its thawing triggers the vortex surge. Payoff: the confession's content directly motivates her unbending. Causal pressure: the confession reweights her self-concept and enables the final choice. Cost connection: hearing it makes her vulnerable, which the curse exploits. Beat involvement: two (detection, revelation). Specificity: "frozen" and "preserved like amber" are irreplaceable—the temporal stasis metaphor grounds the magical residue. Closure linkage: strong; the confession's truth is the hinge for her transformation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup: "gift of finding lost things" appears early and is the premise. Development: she uses it to detect the frozen confession in the third circle. Payoff: the trait is explicitly reframed ("you find what is lost because you are meant to return things to wholeness"). Cost: minimal on-page; the finding itself doesn't exact a visible price beyond the vortex's general threat. Beat involvement: one (finding the confession); the final reframe is thematic commentary rather than on-page use. Swappability: moderate; another magical sense could locate the confession with adjustments. The trait drives the plot but its mechanics remain abstract (how does she sense it?) and the cost of using it isn't dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setup: "unbend" is foreshadowed by her guarded, defensive posture throughout. Development: the action is dramatized in detail at the climax ("spine straightened from its defensive curve. Her shoulders dropped..."). Payoff: unbending causally weakens the vortex and allows her to enter the heart. Causal pressure: irreplaceable; swapping for another action (e.g., "relax," "open") would lose the physical-metaphorical hinge. The vortex's response ("gave it nothing to grip") is tied specifically to the release of rigid defense. Cost: visible—she makes herself vulnerable in a lethal place. Beat involvement: the climactic beat. Specificity: the physical description (spine, shoulders, fist) grounds the metaphor in embodied action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: "expanding circles" is introduced early ("she began her search through expanding circles"). Development: the method structures her approach and creates escalation ("each circuit brought her closer"). Payoff: "one final expanding circle" delivers her to the vortex's heart. Mechanics matter: walking the perimeter inward is a tactic tied to the vortex's spiral geometry. Beat involvement: at least two (initial search, final entry). Causal pressure: moderate; the circles constrain her path and pace the discovery, though another search pattern could serve with edits. Specificity: "expanding" as an inward spiral mirrors the vortex's own motion, adding thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: orchard vortex introduced in paragraph three with vivid detail ("ancient apple trees caught in eternal spiral"). Development: it applies continuous pressure (inward pull, groaning trees, lashing branches) and shapes Mira's tactics (walking circles, planting feet). Payoff: the vortex parts at the climax and reveals the still mirror. Causal pressure: strong; the vortex's curse mechanics (feeds on fear/defense) enable the resolution. Cost connection: the vortex's surge when she's vulnerable is a direct threat. Beat involvement: pervasive across the piece. Specificity: "orchard" and "spiral" are irreplaceable; the fruit rotting/blooming simultaneously and the branches as "desperate arms" are particular to this setting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setup: "after the magic trick fails" anchors the opening but isn't developed. Development: the timeframe doesn't tighten decisions; no live clock pressures Mira's choices. Payoff: absent; the failed mirror spell is referenced but doesn't shape the ending. The timeframe is static context rather than a dynamic constraint. Swappability: high; Mira could arrive at the lake for other reasons without structural change. The "after" frame provides backstory motivation but doesn't alter tactics or escalate pressure on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Setup: "discover what mirrors don't show" is stated early as Mira's goal. Development: the motivation drives her search and frames the frozen confession as the target. Payoff: the still mirror shows "not her face, but her purpose," directly answering the question. Friction: moderate; the want (truth) conflicts with the cost (vulnerability), though the internal struggle is more implied than dramatized in moment-to-moment choices. Cost connection: hearing the confession makes her vulnerable to the vortex. Beat involvement: two (framing search, mirror revelation). The motivation is functional and causally linked but trends toward thematic statement rather than visceral, conflicted desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Setup: "warlike serenity" is introduced early ("settled over her like armor forged from stillness"). Development: the tone is reiterated at the climax ("The warlike serenity remained, but transformed now") and modulates slightly. Payoff: the tone charges the final image (readiness without inward violence). Coherence: the paradox (calm blade, poised stillness) holds across beats, though the final modulation is stated rather than shown through prose rhythm. Under pressure, the tone doesn't degrade or fracture; it remains declarative. Minor deduction: the tone is more label than embodied modulation; the prose doesn't shift cadence or diction to enact "warlike serenity" versus its transformation.</comment>
