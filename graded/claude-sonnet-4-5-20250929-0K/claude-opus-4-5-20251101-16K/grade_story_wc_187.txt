<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vesna's preemptive nostalgia is established through embodied perception ("mourned things before they vanished"), but her interiority relies heavily on elevated, contemplative language that reads more as philosophical meditation than character-specific thought under pressure. The micro-choices present (measuring shadows, recording in the ledger) demonstrate method but lack genuine internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final smile and stance feel resolved rather than earned through dramatized struggle, and the cost of her solitary archiving remains abstract rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building through measurement beats and reflective density toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) in the final paragraph where Vesna's archival stance crystallizes with felt cost ("preemptively nostalgic for this very moment of hope"). Orientation anchors are clear early (stormlit observatory, Vesna as archivist, post-fog world). The closure reweights her solitary position with undeniable emotional pressure, though the conceptual cost could be more visceral—her acceptance reads contemplative rather than foregrounding what she forfeits by continuing alone.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory setting is vividly rendered with purposeful detail (brass astrolabes, crystal lenses, stone monuments) that anchors the archival work, and the shadow-measurement system directly enables Vesna's conjecture method. The buried crystal whispering forecourt supplies emotional resonance and stakes (collective memory fading), though it remains in reflective backstory rather than physically constraining present choices. The stormlit atmosphere modulates with Vesna's contemplative rhythm, and the spatial choreography of her movement between monuments tracks cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preservation of collective memory against the fading of the forecourt—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, escalation operates primarily through Vesna's internal deepening and measurement confirmation rather than external pressure that narrows her options; the shadow readings validate her fear but don't force a tactical shift or trade-off. The cost of her archival solitude is more conceptual than visceral, and no on-page choice forecloses a live alternative with felt consequence—she continues her work without dramatized sacrifice or renunciation that alters her immediate circumstances.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Vesna's archival practice and the image of solidified fog sealing the past: memory as identity, preservation against erasure, the solitary keeper's burden. The final image offers a resonant answer without moralizing—writing into the hush, becoming part of the future archive—and the crystal forecourt functions as a charged particular rather than generic symbol. However, some phrasing edges toward abstraction ("sculpt identity from experience," "fragments of identity future archivists chose to salvage") that risks restating rather than dramatizing the thematic question, keeping the piece just below exceptional range.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a consistent lyric-contemplative register with elevated diction ("stormlit," "bruise and pearl," "summer-quill") that fits the archivist's professional idiom. Psychic distance remains stable in close third, and perceptual filtering reflects Vesna's scholarly attention to detail. However, the diction stays uniformly elevated even in moments of potential emotional urgency, and some constructions read more writerly than character-particular ("the tone of the observatory seemed to deepen into hush" abstracts rather than grounds). Free indirect style is clean, but the voice lacks the compression or rhythm shift under pressure that would reach the high band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, information density is generally high, and the prose advances atmosphere and character throughout. Figurative language ("sound like wind through dry grass," "painted everything in shades of pearl and bruise") is apt and unforced. Minor instances of elevated abstraction ("the weight of what a civilization remembered together," "the gravity of what she documented") slightly dull immediacy in key beats, and a few constructions approach template cadence ("She thought of," "She checked," "She paused"). No paraphrase loops or major artifacts obscure causality, keeping the piece in strong range but short of exceptional line-level control.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of physical archival method (shadow-length measurement) with fantastical elements (solidified fog, emotion-transcribing quills) creates a distinctive frame, and the archivist-as-protagonist offers a fresh angle on memory-preservation narratives. However, the core emotional arc—solitary keeper mourning what will be lost—follows a familiar template without a non-obvious turn or tactical surprise. The crystal forecourt and summer-quills supply specific texture, but the resolution (Vesna continuing her work with acceptance and hope) feels anticipated rather than transformed through lived detail or moral calculus that resists easy sentiment.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The summer-quill archivist role frames Vesna's entire arc and is present in beats (using the quill to record, measuring shadows as archival method). She makes micro-choices (recording, moving between monuments) but these are observational rather than decision-driven turns that alter tactics or foreclose options. The role shapes her stance at closure (continuing to archive), meeting two gates (setup, payoff) but lacking middle development where the occupation constrains a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The crystal whispering forecourt appears in reflective backstory as Vesna's favorite place and as the memory she fears losing, then returns in her final reflection about future archivists. However, it is never handled or used on the page—it exists beneath solidified fog, inaccessible. The reprise reweights her motivation but remains told rather than dramatized, and the object's absence (rather than its presence) drives stakes, yielding functional but replaceable integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Collective memory is the story's central concept, shaping Vesna's stakes (preservation against fading) and her method (measuring shadow lengths to track which memories strengthen or weaken). The concept directly alters her tactics—she records emotional residue with summer-quills, checks monuments to conjecture memory states—and the closure turns on her becoming part of the collective record. Present across all three gates (setup, development, payoff) and causally active, though the mechanics remain somewhat abstract rather than concretely embodied.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Preemptive nostalgia is established in the opening line ("mourned things before they vanished") and colors Vesna's perception throughout ("aching for this moment even while living it"). It reappears at closure ("preemptively nostalgic for this very moment of hope"), reweighting her stance. However, the trait remains more tonal and perceptual than a constraint that forces a visible tradeoff—she never sacrifices present action to mourn the future, nor does the attribute narrow her options under pressure, keeping it in lyric-resonance range.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Conjecture (piecing together collective memory from shadow measurements) is Vesna's core method, present across multiple beats (examining monuments, recording findings, interpreting eastern markings). The action shapes her understanding that the forecourt is fading and motivates her archival work at closure. However, the conjectures confirm her fears rather than forcing a turn or redefining her options—she continues the same practice throughout. Two gates met (setup, payoff) with middle presence but limited causal pressure, placing it in mid-essential range.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Examining shadow lengths at monuments is introduced early as Vesna's method, used in multiple distinct beats (tallest monument → eastern markings, smallest cube → center marking), and the mechanics directly shape her findings about which memories are weakening. The method enables her conjecture and is causally active across the arc, though the measurements confirm rather than surprise or force tactical shifts. Present in all three gates with clear causal contribution, reaching essential range.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory above the clouds is established early and provides the frame for all action—Vesna moves between monuments, measures shadows, records findings. The setting supplies the instruments and atmosphere necessary for her work and is present at closure. However, the environment doesn't constrain choices or supply resources that alter tactics under pressure; it functions more as stage than active pressure. Two gates (setup, payoff) with atmospheric support but limited tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after fog becomes solid" is established in backstory ("three months ago") and provides the inciting circumstance that threatens collective memory. Vesna's shadow measurements indicate "within another season" the forecourt will vanish from collective recall, creating temporal stakes. However, the time pressure remains abstract—no on-page clock tightens her decisions or forces immediate action. The timeframe contextualizes but doesn't alter tactics, meeting setup and thematic presence without middle or closure urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motivation to sculpt identity from experience is stated explicitly in mid-story ("This was why she archived") and drives Vesna's archival practice throughout. It shapes her goal (preserve emotional residue, not just facts) and her final stance (becoming part of the future archive). However, the motivation is told more than dramatized through conflicted choices—she never faces friction between this desire and competing costs or fears. Present in setup and payoff with thematic coherence, but lacking on-page friction that would elevate to essential range.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Deepening hush is introduced as "the tone of the observatory seemed to deepen into hush" and recurs at closure ("writing against the hush, writing into it, letting the silence become part of the record"). The tone modulates with Vesna's contemplative rhythm and charges the final image where silence becomes active material. However, the hush remains more atmospheric descriptor than pressure that shifts tactically across turns—it deepens but doesn't break or reverse. Lyric reprise with thematic resonance, lacking mid-arc modulation under stress.</comment>
