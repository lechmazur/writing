**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural. The story builds through layered motifs (negative space, dewdrops, mist, prism light) toward a cadence shift at closure.

**Closure Unit:** Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) — she lowers the saxophone and lets silence grow, hearing grandmother's voice begin to whisper. Seven years of vigil abandoned; the terrible prophecy she's prevented now moves toward realization. Cost is legible.

**Dominant Stake:** Preventing a coded prophecy from assembling in silence.

<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation is clear and consistent — her seven-year vigil against the prophecy is well-established. The final micro-choice (lowering the saxophone) carries genuine weight, reflecting contradictory impulses: duty versus inevitability, guardianship versus curiosity ("Perhaps they concerned her. Perhaps they always had"). However, the character functions more as a concept-vehicle than a fully embodied person; interiority stays atmospheric rather than psychologically particular, and the internal progression toward surrender is more told than dramatized through competing impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors solidly within the first two lines. Accumulative lens holds cleanly through closure. Backstory (~25-28%) is anchored by present stimuli and tilts present stance — the linguist episode particularly earns its space by establishing the mechanism of her defense. Closure lands with visible cost: the vigil is abandoned, the prophecy begins to speak. The "this morning felt different" pivot is structurally functional but generic, and the because/therefore linkage from expanding prophecy to her surrender could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The grotto functions causally — its acoustic properties (sound lingering for years in sub-audible frequencies) are why she must return and why the prophecy persists. The prism atrium's shift from "dark geometry to scattered rainbows" tracks the daily temporal window; its pulsing this morning signals escalation. Sensory range is good (moisture beading on brass, mist thick enough to touch, "eerie nostalgia on her tongue"), though visual detail dominates. The environment charges the final image effectively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Under the Accumulative lens, density increases through expanding prophecy, new pauses, heavier mist, and pulsing light — these foreclose the option of indefinite guardianship. The trade-off (futile delay vs. accepting the terrible future) is meaningful. The protagonist exercises agency in the final act. However, the escalation is more summarized than dramatized in real-time pressure — "She understood then that she could not play forever" tells rather than shows the tightening through a specific acoustic event or failure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The negative-space concept works on multiple thematic levels — meaning residing in absence, the futility of suppressing truth, the relationship between silence and inevitability. Theme emerges organically from the premise rather than being imposed. "Perhaps they concerned her. Perhaps they always had" is resonant without being explicit. The final line ("what the negative space had always been trying to say") borders on meta-commentary about its own theme but stays just within image territory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Consistent close third person with a distinct lyrical texture. POV modesty is maintained — she notices what she would notice (moisture on brass, the light's behavior). "She tasted eerie nostalgia on her tongue" is a strong perceptual choice. Some moments tip toward the essayistic: "that particular flavor of returning to a place that has changed while you were away, even when you were never truly away" reads as narrator commentary rather than character perception. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Strong individual lines ("the negative spaces growing deeper, more insistent"; "the coded syllables strained toward coherence like water seeking its level"). However, the core concept of negative space is explained at least five times across 750 words — while each instance serves a slightly different narrative function, the cumulative effect creates redundancy. The closing template cadence ("The dewdrops continued... The mist continued... And in the radiant grotto...") is pattern-taught but adds weight without new information. The "that particular flavor" sentence is overwrought.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prophecy-encoded-in-silences concept is genuinely original — negative space as the carrier of meaning, and music as counter-measure to fill those gaps, is a fresh and logically coherent premise. The linguist episode (silencing him by filling the gaps, causing mid-sentence amnesia) is a specific, clever detail. The ending trajectory (guardian surrenders vigil) is somewhat predictable for this archetype, but the mechanism through which she arrives there — the prophecy expanding by creating new pauses — transforms the familiar arc.</comment>
