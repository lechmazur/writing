<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vesper's mechanical arm and Marchetti's history ground motivation, but interiority often defaults to exposition rather than embodied contradiction. The peak choice—agreeing to alliance—lacks visible internal resistance; her threat ("I will not stop at your arm") reads as posturing rather than genuine conflict between wants. Backstory (grandmother's cryptography, the lost arm) anchors present stance but occupies ~25% without always tilting micro-choices on the page. The handshake closure feels declared rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (atrium, sundial, Vesper waiting). The causal chain—coded sundial → needle measurement → alliance proposal → handshake—reads cleanly under a Causal lens. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (alliance replaces duel), but the cost remains abstract: "new philosophy," "purposeful war." No on-page forfeiture or visible tradeoff makes the handshake's weight undeniable. One tightening (Marchetti's reveal that the Council threatens orders) narrows options, satisfying length scope, but the final image charges primarily through assertion rather than a felt price paid in the moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The atrium, brook, half-painted sundial, and needle card supply vivid anchors. The sundial's dual surfaces (gold versus charcoal) and the needle card's rose embossing are specific and recur meaningfully. However, the environment remains postcard-descriptive; no spatial constraint pressures Vesper's choice at closure. The brook "sang on" is asserted atmospheric continuity rather than a micro-setting element that alters tactics. The needle card constrains one beat (decoding) but does not charge the handshake image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve philosophical orders against Council dissolution—is signaled clearly by Marchetti's overture. One meaningful tightening: the Council's threat forces alliance where duel was the norm. Agency is Vesper's acceptance, but the decision lacks visible cost on the page; she issues a conditional threat and shakes hands without forfeiting a live option or enduring friction. The escalation is a shift in stance (adversaries → conspirators) rather than a narrowing under pressure. No loss of time, reputation, or tactical resource alters her approach before the handshake.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—questions as transformation, "dignified chaos," cooperation born from conflict—emerges through the sundial's dual completion and the philosophers' history. However, the final paragraph ("some questions…into destinations through dignified chaos") recaps the theme in prompt-like language rather than letting the handshake image resonate without gloss. The needle card and sundial accrue symbolic weight but remain ornamental rather than driving a non-literal answer. Epiphany is told ("She understood then") rather than earned through scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vesper's perceptual signature (mechanical arm whir as nervous tell, tactile grandmother's tin) is distinct and stable. Dialogue between Vesper and Marchetti carries subtext and goal pursuit without expository bloat. However, convergence appears: both speak in balanced, articulate constructions ("diplomatically fierce," "dignified chaos") that lean toward thematic echo rather than character-specific idiom. Marchetti's "They turn complacency into progress. Ignorance into direction" mirrors the narrator's rhetorical cadence, flattening voice distinction under pressure. POV distance remains controlled; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language (prisms, brook's "eternal conversation," sundial shadows) supports tone. Yet template cadence and paraphrase loops appear: "diplomatic...fierce," "dignified chaos," "questions into destinations" recur without added meaning. The phrase "some questions…one dangerous truth at a time" in the penultimate paragraph loops the theme mechanically. Filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "understood") cluster in reflection without strategic compression. Overwriting: "diplomatically fierce in his manner—every word chosen with precision, delivered with fire" front-loads intensity that could emerge through dialogue alone. Deduct −0.6 for loops and scaffold touching the final third; no artifact obscures closure causality directly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The half-painted sundial encoding and needle-card decryption offer a fresh synthesis. However, the core arc—intellectual rivals form alliance against oppressive authority—follows a familiar template without transformation through specific lived cost or non-obvious moral calculus. The mechanical arm and dueling-philosopher premise promise originality but remain ornamental; Vesper's prosthetic limb does not constrain her choice at closure. "Dignified chaos" and "questions into destinations" read as thematic labels rather than embodied particulars. Risk is gestural (conspiracy, revolution) rather than enacted with visible tradeoff on the page.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Vesper's role as dueling philosopher with mechanical arm is central and shapes two beats: measuring the sundial and accepting alliance. The arm's nervous whir signals internal state, and the handshake juxtaposes "cold metal palm" against Marchetti's warmth, charging the closure image. However, the arm does not constrain her choice; she could accept the alliance without it. The duel history informs motivation but the prosthetic itself remains ornamental at the peak decision. Present in setup, middle action, and ending; causal pressure is moderate; specificity adds texture but not irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The needle card appears in three beats: introduction with backstory, measurement of sundial angles, and reflective moment before the handshake. It enables the decoding (middle choice) and recurs with "inherited courage" to prime Vesper's acceptance. The card's rose embossing and length-as-degrees system are specific and irreplaceable for the cryptographic function. However, it does not constrain the alliance decision directly; Vesper tucks it away before the handshake rather than using it to alter her stance at closure. Strong setup, middle involvement, and thematic reprise; causal pressure and closure linkage are moderate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The hidden overture is the dominant stake: Marchetti's coded invitation shapes Vesper's decoding action and the alliance proposal redefines their adversarial relationship. It appears early (sundial encoding), drives the middle reveal, and names the closure shift ("hidden overture…transformed"). The concept is indispensable to plot logic. However, "overture" itself is abstract; the specific choice to ally does not hinge on the overture's hiddenness but on the Council threat. The concept frames stakes more than it constrains tactics under pressure. Present across all three gates; strong causal role; moderate specificity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Diplomatically fierce" is applied to Marchetti once ("diplomatically fierce in his manner—every word chosen with precision, delivered with fire"). The trait is told rather than enacted through constrained choice or visible tradeoff. His dialogue is articulate and goal-driven but does not demonstrate a tension between diplomacy and ferocity that alters tactics. The label appears in the second third without prior setup and does not recur or shape closure. Label-only mention; no beat involvement or cost; swappable with "persuasive" or "intense."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Fencing as action is thematic (history of duels, rapiers hung at hips, "fence ideas rather than flesh") but does not occur on the page. The story pivots from physical dueling to intellectual alliance; the substitution is the turn, not the fencing itself. Vesper and Marchetti do not fence in scene; the rapiers remain props. The concept of fencing as metaphor for debate shapes the alliance decision but the specific action—drawing blades, crossing steel—is absent. Thematic presence; no on-page enactment; swappable with "debate" or "clash" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The coded sundial angles appear early (setup), drive Vesper's measurement with the needle card (middle beat), and the sundial's shadow "cast across them both" charges the handshake closure. The method is specific: seventeen, thirty-two, forty-five, sixty-three degrees translate to archive coordinates. The mechanics matter—Vesper's decoding enables the alliance conversation. The half-painted design (gold versus charcoal) and "hidden message in the mathematics of time" are irreplaceable. Present in all three gates; strong causal pressure; the sundial's dual completion mirrors the philosophers' shift from conflict to cooperation, adding thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The glass atrium with brook is anchored early and recurs in the closure paragraph ("brook sang on…walls gleamed"). Spatial details (marble floor, prisms, transparent walls) are vivid. However, the setting does not constrain choice; Vesper could decode and accept alliance in any room. The brook remains atmospheric ("eternal conversation," "gentle chaos") without altering tactics or supplying a resource. The atrium's privacy is mentioned but not tested by intrusion or surveillance risk. Setup and closure presence; moderate thematic resonance; low causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"While waiting" opens the story and frames Vesper's stance ("This was the nature of philosophy—and dueling—patience before the strike"). However, the timeframe remains vague; no clock tightens decisions. The wait ends when Marchetti arrives, but duration and urgency are untraceable. The waiting posture primes the alliance as a "strike" but does not constrain tactics or escalate pressure. Thematic setup; no middle development or closure linkage; swappable with "during a meeting" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Turn questions into destinations" is Marchetti's articulated motivation ("We transform questions into destinations, Vesper") and recurs in the final paragraph as narrator assertion. The desire drives the alliance—preserving philosophical inquiry against Council suppression. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choice; Vesper's acceptance faces no visible cost between wanting to ask questions and the alliance's risk. Setup via Marchetti's speech; thematic closure reprise; moderate causal role but low friction between wants and costs on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Dignified chaos" appears as narrator assertion (brook's "gentle chaos," "space between conflict and cooperation," "dignified chaos" in closing lines) and shapes tone throughout. The story balances formality (Vesper's title, mechanical precision, needle-card ritual) with disruption (duels, conspiracy, half-painted sundial). Tone modulates minimally; the register remains elevated and controlled even at the peak alliance decision. The phrase charges the final image but reads as thematic label rather than tonal embodiment under pressure. Coherent presence; moderate charge at closure; tone is declared more than enacted through cadence shifts.</comment>
