<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to decode language patterns is clear and sustained, grounded in seventeen years of concrete action. Her internal contradiction between reticence and the coming need to speak creates tension, though the resolution feels stated rather than fully embodied under pressure. The character work is consistent but lacks a pivotal on-page choice that forecloses a path with visible cost—her decision to testify tomorrow is announced, not dramatized. Interiority remains thoughtful but edges toward abstract reflection ("the holiness of words") without sufficient micro-choices that test her values in the present moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening and establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: Mira's years of listening accumulate toward the Council testimony. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—she moves from silent observation to readiness to speak, and the cost is the loss of her wilderness-garden innocence. However, the decisive moment remains offstage (tomorrow's testimony), and the final image ("finally ready to speak") reweights prior material but lacks an on-page action or renunciation that forecloses a path with felt immediacy. The causal throughline is motivated and the lens holds, but closure cost could be more tangible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Aldren Library is vividly rendered with dust, gray light, shattered chandelier, and shadowed reading tables; the setting constrains Mira's work (she must use the crystal to access trapped sound) and charges the final image (the library "breathes around her, full of words"). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her scholarly perspective. The crystal itself functions as micro-setting, appearing in multiple beats and enabling her research method. Spatial choreography is clean, and the environment's decay mirrors the declared death of language, creating purposeful tension with her discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving language is still alive—is signaled early and sustained through Mira's seventeen years of research and the upcoming Council testimony. Pressure accumulates via the textural lens as she assembles her map of language growth, and the irony of the reticent scholar needing to speak provides internal conflict. However, escalation occurs mostly offstage (the years of listening) rather than through on-page reversals or narrowing choices. The testimony itself is future-facing, so the present scene lacks a concrete turn that alters tactics or forecloses an option with immediate cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from concrete particulars: the crystal's fractured sequences, the child's "liberry," the undergrowth of slang and whispers. The wilderness-versus-garden metaphor reweights at the end without stating a moral, and the final image (the library breathing with unprinted words) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether language can be finished. The story resists false binaries and avoids thematic echo in the final beat. Minor slip: "I think language is alive" spoken aloud years ago borders on thesis statement, though its inclusion as a recorded fragment rather than present dialogue mitigates the issue.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and voice remains distinct: formal, scholarly, with a quiet reverence for language ("holiness of words," "wilderness, ungovernable and eternal"). Psychic distance modulates appropriately—closer during crystal listening, wider during reflection. Free indirect style is clean. However, passages like "the expression strange on her face after so long" and "weathered innocence thin but had not destroyed it" edge toward tell-heavy summary rather than embodied perception. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable. Narrative stance is controlled and the perceptual signature (her scholar's filter) remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is clear and rhythmically varied with strong imagery ("dawn pressed against the eastern windows," "words becoming"). Information density is high in the crystal-listening beats. However, several instances of scaffold and near-paraphrase: "Language had never stopped growing. It had only gone underground" repeats the same idea across two sentences; "She had begun this work... Seventeen years had worn..." loops conceptually without advancing pressure. Template cadence appears in the reflection-heavy middle ("She still believed... She was leaving knowing..."). These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull momentum in non-closure beats. No filter-verb stacks or major register drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The core premise—a scholar using a sonically reflective crystal to decode language evolution—offers a fresh synthesis of archival research and speculative object. The inversion (reticent scholar must speak) and the wilderness/garden metaphor feel earned rather than imposed. The story commits fully to its concept and avoids safety hedging. However, the "last dictionary printed, language declared complete" frame echoes familiar dystopian-archive templates without deep transformation through lived detail or unexpected moral calculus. The seventeen-year vigil and crystal mechanics provide specificity, but the stakes and resolution trend toward the expected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira the reticent scholar is signaled early, appears in every beat, and her reticence creates tension with the upcoming testimony. However, her key decision (to testify and let the crystal speak) is announced for tomorrow rather than enacted on the page. She makes micro-choices (listening to the crystal, placing it in her pocket), but none alters present tactics with visible cost. Her arc is observation-heavy; the final readiness is a stance shift rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Gates: setup ✓, middle development (listening beats) ✓, closure participation (readiness to speak) ✓. Causal pressure is moderate; closure linkage is thematic rather than action-driven. Present across beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, but swappability (could be any scholar) −0.5, late decisive choice −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The crystal appears early, is used in multiple beats (listening to grandmother's voice, scholar etymology, child mispronunciation, poet testing, her own voice), and charges the final image (placed in her pocket "close to her heart"). It enables her research method and constrains her approach (she must listen through fractured sequences). The crystal's properties are irreplaceable—its sonic reflectivity is the story's core mechanism. Gates: setup (shard discovery) ✓, development (repeated listening) ✓, payoff (final listening and pocketing) ✓. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (enables research) +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.7. Small deduction for ornamental description in opening −0.3. Near-indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The suspended hush is named early and revisited ("seemed to deepen, as if the building itself was listening"). It shapes the atmosphere and mirrors Mira's silence, but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics on the page. The hush functions as tone and setting texture rather than a stake-shaping force. Gates: setup ✓, middle (deepening hush) ✓, payoff (library breathing) ✓. Early signal +0.5, lyric reprise (first to final third) +0.6, closure linkage (library listens) +0.8. Deductions: ornamental use (mostly descriptive) −0.7, no causal pressure −0.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sonically reflective is the crystal's defining trait, discovered three years ago and enabling all her research. It constrains her method (she must press the crystal to her ear, listen through fragments) and drives the plot (without this property, no language-pattern map). The trait appears in multiple beats and is essential to the ending's logic (she will let the crystal speak). Gates: setup (accident discovery) ✓, development (repeated listening) ✓, payoff (crystal will testify) ✓. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (enables entire arc) +1.5, closure linkage +1.2, specificity (unique, irreplaceable) +0.8, cost (seventeen years of solitary work) +0.5. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Testify is announced early as the upcoming Council summons and frames the story's tension. It motivates Mira's reflection and her final readiness. However, the action itself occurs tomorrow, offstage; the present scene is preparation rather than the testimony. The action shapes her stance but does not create an on-page turn. Gates: setup (Council summons) ✓, middle (anticipation shapes reflection) ✓, payoff (readiness, but not the act) partial. Early signal +0.6, causal pressure (frames urgency) +0.9, closure linkage (readiness to testify) +0.8. Deductions: future-tense (not enacted) −0.8, swappable (could be "present findings" or similar) −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Fractured sequences as method is signaled early (crystal releases sound in fragments) and used repeatedly (scholar 1847, child 1923, poet 1976, her own voice). It constrains how she accesses language history and will shape her testimony ("testify through the fractured sequences"). The method is specific to the crystal's mechanics and irreplaceable. Gates: setup ✓, development ✓, payoff ✓. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.6. Small deduction: the method is more process than obstacle; it enables without visible tradeoff −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Shadowed library at dawn is established in the opening and sustained throughout. The setting provides resources (crystal from chandelier, dust, vaulted halls) and mirrors the theme (dying place versus living language). Dawn light breaks through at the climax, fracturing into rainbows, and the library "breathes" in the final image. Gates: setup ✓, development (movement through stacks, reading tables) ✓, payoff (library breathing) ✓. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage (final image) +1.3. Deductions: setting enables but does not constrain a choice −0.6, dawn functions more as atmosphere than pressure −0.6. Micro-setting (crystal handling) is strong but the library as location is less causal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Timeframe (after last dictionary) is established in the opening line and creates the story's premise: language declared complete seventeen years ago. It motivates Mira's research and the Council's challenge. However, time does not tighten decisions in the present scene—the years have passed offstage, and tomorrow's testimony is future-tense. Gates: setup ✓, middle (seventeen-year span referenced) ✓, payoff (readiness now) partial. Early signal +0.8, causal pressure (creates the world's belief) +0.9, closure linkage (moving from past silence to future speech) +0.6. Deductions: time is context, not clock −0.8, no live countdown that alters moves −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Decode the pattern of growth is named early as her "simple" motivation and sustained through seventeen years of listening and map-building. It drives her daily actions (listening to the crystal) and the upcoming testimony. The motivation is specific and in tension with the world's belief (language finished). Gates: setup ✓, development (assembling the map) ✓, payoff (ready to share the pattern) ✓. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.1. Deductions: the desire is told more than dramatized in conflicted choice (she reflects on it rather than acting under friction) −0.8, cost connection is moderate (loneliness implied but not visceral) −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Weathered innocence is embodied in "seventeen years had worn that innocence thin but had not destroyed it" and "She still believed in the holiness of words." The tone modulates from quiet vigil to a smile and readiness at the end. It coheres across the piece and charges the final image (moving from innocence to knowledge while retaining belief). Gates: setup ✓, development (wearing thin) ✓, payoff (readiness with smile) ✓. Early signal +0.6, closure linkage +1.2, tone modulation +0.7. Deductions: tone is asserted ("weathered innocence") rather than fully embodied through contradictory impulses −0.7, static mood until the final beat −0.5. The smile is the only dramatized shift.</comment>
