<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elena's grief and duty-release are established, but her interiority remains abstract: "swallowing her own dreams until they dissolved like salt in water" is label-only metaphor without embodied contradiction. The guides exist primarily as exposition vehicles, lacking individual contradiction or internal friction. No micro-choices under pressure appear; Elena simply accepts what is offered without visible tradeoff, and the final transformation is asserted rather than earned through on-page choices that foreclose paths.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The closure offers Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Elena accepts her unused courage through the journey's accumulation. Cost is conceptual—the star mark fading, the guides dissolving—but felt rather than decisive action. Orientation anchors clearly (Elena, ridgeway, post-mother's-death). The weakness: no meaningful tightening or reversal narrows options; the walk is a guided tour without resistance, so the final image reweights prior material only softly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The veiled ridgeway, mist, and clifftop sea create coherent atmosphere and constrain Elena's path (she cannot see far ahead). The ticket punch's star stamp is handled twice (pressed into palm, checked later) and charges the final moment when it fades, linking tool to closure image. Spatial choreography is clean across the journey's stages. No occupational depth needed at this length; the setting serves the allegorical frame without modern-world realism issues.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: reclaiming unused courage. However, no reversal or tightening occurs; the guides lead Elena through waypoints (hollow, promontory, spring) without opposition or narrowed options. She screams grief, laughs, speaks dreams—all cathartic but not forced by escalating pressure. The resolution is acceptance, not a decision with visible cost that forecloses a live alternative. Under Accumulative lens, one deepening beat is needed; here the walk is steady descent without friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of reclaiming selfhood after duty emerges from concrete images: leash, pressed flowers, star stamp. The final headland moment avoids overt moralizing and uses the fading star as a resonant non-literal answer. Weakness: the guides' dialogue edges into theme-statement ("courage isn't a destination") and Elena's epiphany is partly summarized ("she felt different—not transformed, exactly, but uncovered") rather than left implicit in image. The ending image is quiet and purposeful, rescuing thematic resonance despite mid-story exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Narrative distance remains consistent, though psychic access to Elena is shallow (thought is often summarized). The guides' voices converge into a single wise-elder register without distinct idiom; their dialogue carries subtext of patient invitation but lacks individual speech signature. Diction is controlled, leaning lyric ("soft as a shoreline lullaby"), but the elder's explanation of courage and the guides' purpose reads as helpful-narrator exposition rather than embodied pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is generally high, though several phrases loop: "the leash" revisited, "unused courage" repeated without reweighting. The metaphor "dissolved like salt in water" and "pressed flowers in a forgotten book" are stock images without fresh vehicle. Minor template cadence in the guides' speeches: "We wait... / We can help... / This marks..." Filter verbs ("she felt," "she understood") appear frequently but remain voice-legible. No major artifacts touch the closure beat; line-level craft is competent with scattered slack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Premise—mystical guides on a fog-wrapped path leading a grieving woman to self-discovery—is a widely used recovery-journey template. The ticket punch's star stamp and the indirect-route method offer specific detail, but the emotional arc (grief → catharsis → acceptance) and the wise-elder archetypes follow familiar beats without transformation. The veiled ridgeway and twilight vigil are fresh images that elevate texture, yet the core synthesis remains median rather than daring. No bold structural risk; the progression is linear allegory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Ferry guides appear early, frame the walk, and deliver thematic dialogue, but they make no choices that alter Elena's path; they wait, explain, and dissolve. Their persistence is shown (waiting forever if needed) but not tested by resistance. They are present in setup, middle waypoints, and closure handoff (all three gates), yet their causal role is facilitation without friction. Swappable with generic wise-mentor figures.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ticket punch with star stamp is handled twice: pressed into Elena's palm (with warmth and meaning) and checked later when fading. It anchors her choice and returns in the final beats to symbolize impermanence. Setup, middle anchor, and closure reprise are clear. However, the punch does not constrain a choice or shift tactics; it marks passage without altering options. Specific object, purposeful reprise, but causal pressure is thin.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Vigil in twilight frames the guides' sacred work and the story's tone. The vigil is mentioned early ("keeping vigil," "wait in twilight") and closes with the guides returning to it. It shapes the stakes insofar as Elena must choose to accept their help during this liminal time. However, the vigil does not constrain tactics on the page or create pressure; it functions as thematic backdrop. Two gates (setup, closure echo); middle development is thin.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Gently persistent" is shown: the guides wait without urging, yet their presence compels Elena's nod. This patience enables her acceptance, a key turn. However, the trait does not create visible tradeoff or limit options—gentle persistence is advantage without cost. The attribute appears in setup and closure but does not constrain middle choices. Functional but replaceable with "patient" or "steadfast."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Traverse" is the dominant action: Elena walks the ridgeway, descends valleys, climbs stone, screams on the promontory, laughs by the spring. The traverse structures all middle beats and delivers her to the final headland. Setup, multiple middle beats, and closure all hinge on traversal. Removing this action collapses the narrative. However, the walk itself is unchallenged; the action is present but not contested, so causal pressure is mid-range.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Through indirect routes" is explained by the second guide ("the path winds through indirect routes... courage isn't a destination") and demonstrated: the path curves inland, descends, climbs, visits hollow/promontory/spring rather than running straight. The method is signaled early, shapes the journey's structure, and is implicit in the closure (arriving by the longer way). However, the indirection does not create tactical friction or force mid-course correction; it is descriptive of the walk, not a contested choice.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Veiled ridgeway is introduced in the opening line, structures every beat, and anchors the closure image ("walked down from the ridgeway toward a new morning"). The mist limits visibility, the clifftops and valleys dictate Elena's path, and the final headland provides the vantage for the ending. Setup, middle constraint (curves, descents, promontory, spring), and closure presence are all strong. The setting is indispensable to the story's logic and tone.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the leash breaks" (mother's death) is the inciting timeframe, present in setup. The story moves from "the morning after" through "twilight came again" to "a new morning," marking passage. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency; Elena's walk unfolds without deadline pressure. The "after" is thematic context rather than live constraint. Two gates (setup, closure echo); middle development weak.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Motivation—"to find where unused courage waits"—is named by the guide and implied in Elena's acceptance of the walk. The desire is present in setup and payoff (she "carr[ies] at last what she had always possessed"). However, the motivation is mostly told rather than tested: Elena does not resist, doubt mid-journey, or face a friction between wanting courage and fearing its cost. The friction exists in backstory (duty guarding courage) but not in present choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Shoreline lullaby" tone is woven throughout: "soft as a shoreline lullaby," "voices like waves withdrawing over sand," "mist-wrapped," "gentle eyes." The tone is established early, modulates gently across grief (screaming into sky) and joy (laughing by spring), and charges the final image ("emerging stars," "gathering dark"). The lullaby cadence supports the accumulative/textural lens and remains coherent through turns. Tone is integral to closure's resonance.</comment>
