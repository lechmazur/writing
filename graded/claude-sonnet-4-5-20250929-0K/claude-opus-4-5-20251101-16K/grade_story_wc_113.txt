<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Miriam's motivation is established ("strange impulses"), but her interior life remains largely abstract—labeled inspiration rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice to pursue the archive research feels inevitable given the trajectory, but the cost is conceptual rather than embodied with visible sacrifice. Emotional progression is told through metaphor ("cold, silent grave") rather than through micro-choices under pressure that reveal competing values. No therapy-speak or diagnostic labels, and the professional detail (orchestra pit musician) anchors perception appropriately.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates through nightly visits and sensory accretion toward a Conceptual Repricing—the ghost's truth is handed to Miriam and she commits to excavating it. Closure lands on the page with conceptual cost (she inherits the burden of unsettling recorded history). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when the program reveals Maestro Venn's name and implied murder. The water receding functions as a micro turn that closes the wordless conversation, granting permission to act in the ordinary world.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The flooded opera house is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (black water, flickering lanterns, water-warped portrait) and the environment constrains Miriam's tactics—she must wade, hold objects above water, interpret stains as code. The recurring program and cello bow function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (waist-deep water, balcony rails above, submerged stage). The water itself acts as a medium that the ghost uses to communicate, making setting an active participant rather than backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: unravel the ghost's code and correct the historical record. One meaningful tightening occurs when the water stains coalesce into Maestro Venn's face and the murder narrative, narrowing Miriam's mission from vague inspiration to specific investigative task. The final act—playing the C note and receiving the name—demonstrates agency (she performs the ritual that completes the exchange) with conceptual cost legible on the page (she now owns the ghost's unfinished business). Coincidence does not resolve; the flood and her return are premise, and the ghost's communication is purposeful constraint rather than luck.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of unsettled history and the ethics of correcting silenced truths emerges organically through the program's water-damaged code and the ghost's wordless communication. The "in between spaces" motif (margins, silences, unstruck chords) recurs with escalating meaning and culminates in the final image where the lanterns steady, suggesting the ghost's release. No overt moralizing; the ending offers a resonant image (unstruck chords waiting to be played true) that reweights the premise without stating a thesis. The flood as both destroyer and revealer carries thematic weight tied to the specific event rather than abstract symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single POV, third-person limited, remains stable with strong perceptual signature—Miriam notices musical and architectural detail (orchestra pit angle, conductor's podium, portrait) filtered through seventeen years of professional experience. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the cello-playing and program examination, slightly pulled back during exposition. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("divining rod," "pregnant pause," "etched itself into her memory"). No dialogue on the page; the wordless conversation is enacted through gesture and image. Elision is purposeful (the name is withheld to create forward pressure) and paid off when it etches into Miriam's memory.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in key beats (the program revelation, the playing of the low C). Minor scaffold appears in exposition: "She understood now that she was meant to unravel the code" tells rather than shows the realization, and "The conversation was over, but the story was just beginning" is a meta-comment that could be cut. The phrase "water damage creating images that shouldn't exist" in paragraph three slightly dilutes momentum by summarizing what the next sentences demonstrate. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; sentence openings vary. Figurative language is controlled and mostly fresh ("ink dropped in milk," "water etching stone").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The flooded opera house as conduit for ghostly communication is a specific synthesis, and the water-damaged program as code is a fresh inflection on haunted-place premises. The wordless conversation via cello notes, ripples, and lantern flickers avoids overt supernatural dialogue clichés. However, the core ghost-with-unfinished-business frame and the musician-as-medium are familiar; transformation arises from the accumulative texture and the specific mechanism (water stains, musical notation) rather than a bold structural or conceptual departure. The premise commits fully and follows implications without retreat, but does not take unconventional risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Miriam (orchestra pit musician) is present throughout and her professional lens filters perception (pit angle, conductor's podium). Her choice to play the low C and then commit to archive research constitutes two distinct beats. Setup is immediate; middle development occurs when she decodes the program; closure participation is clear when she decides to trace the lineage. Causal pressure: her musical skill enables the ghost's communication. Removing "orchestra pit musician" and substituting another profession would require rewriting the perceptual filter and the cello ritual, demonstrating moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The antique opera program appears in three beats: discovery (first night), examination under lantern (tonight), and slipping into the flood after its purpose is served. Setup is early (paragraph five). Development: the program's water-damaged symbols guide Miriam's interpretation and reveal Maestro Venn's murder. Closure linkage: its release into the water signals the transaction's completion. Causal pressure: the program is the ghost's chosen medium and its mechanics (water stains forming faces and hands) shape Miriam's understanding. Swapping it for another artifact would require rewriting the communication mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"In between spaces" is signaled early (paragraph six: "margins of the program, the silences between drips of water, the pregnant pause amid the hush of unstruck chords") and recurs across beats. It constrains Miriam's tactics—she must interpret absences and play single notes to elicit responses rather than speak directly. The concept charges the final image: "The unstruck chords hung in the darkness, waiting for someone to finally play them true." Removing this exact framing would flatten the communication mechanics into generic haunting. Felt cost: Miriam must accept ambiguity and trust indirect signs.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Lately inspired" is mentioned once in paragraph three ("She was lately inspired by something she couldn't name") but remains label-only. It does not constrain an on-page choice or generate visible tradeoff; the impulses that pull her back are described as "strange" but not shown to conflict with competing priorities or exact a cost. No middle development or closure participation. The attribute is ornamental, explaining her presence without forcing a decision.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Disrupt" appears thematically in paragraph nine: "disrupt the accepted history… tear through the official narrative." Miriam's commitment to archive research enacts this action at closure, and the ghost's communication throughout is an act of historical disruption. Setup is delayed until the second half; development and closure participation are both present. However, the action could be reframed as "reveal" or "correct" with minor edits, indicating moderate swappability. No direct cost tied to "disrupt" specifically; the cost is inheriting investigative burden rather than facing resistance to disruption on the page.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Water damage creating images is signaled in paragraph four (stains forming faces, hands, musical notation) and mechanics matter across multiple beats: the program's translucent pages reveal hidden notes; holding the program to flame produces Venn's face; stains tell the murder story. Setup is early; development constrains Miriam's interpretation tactics; closure linkage occurs when the images fade as the water recedes, confirming the method's completion. Causal pressure: without this specific mechanism, the ghost cannot communicate the historical truth. Replacing water damage with another medium would require rewriting the flood premise and the tactile revelation beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The flooded opera house lit by flickering lanterns is established in paragraph one and shapes multiple choices: Miriam must wade waist-deep, hold objects above water, and interpret the lanterns' responses (they flicker in unison when she plays the C note, steady at the end). Setup is immediate; middle development includes the water carrying fragments to her feet as answers; closure participation is direct when the lanterns steady and the water recedes as she exits. Spatial detail (submerged seats, half-drowned stage, balcony rails) remains consistent. The setting is both constraint (movement is difficult) and resource (water is the ghost's medium).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Amid the hush of unstruck chords" as timeframe is poetic but abstract. The phrase recurs in paragraph six and the final paragraph, framing the silence as temporal suspension rather than a literal clock. No ticking pressure or deadline tightens Miriam's decisions; she has returned "each night" but the urgency is intrinsic (her impulse) rather than time-driven. The hush modulates at closure when the chords "hung in the darkness, waiting," reweighting the stake with a future-oriented charge. Setup and closure participation are present; middle development is weak. Lyric resonance (early seed to final reprise) earns mid-band placement despite minimal causal tightening.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To unravel the code left by a ghost" is signaled in paragraph six and drives Miriam's nightly returns, program examination, and cello playing. Setup is clear; middle development includes interpreting the water-damaged symbols and playing the C note; closure participation is direct when she receives the name and commits to archival research. Friction: the code is wordless and ambiguous, forcing Miriam to trust indirect signs. Cost: she inherits the ghost's unfinished task, which will require tracing lineage and confronting silenced history. The motivation could be reframed as "communicate with" or "help" the ghost with moderate edits, indicating some swappability.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Wordless conversation" is established in paragraph six ("communication existed in the in between spaces") and governs tone throughout: Miriam and the ghost exchange meaning via cello notes, ripples, lantern flickers, and water-stained images rather than speech. The tone modulates with pressure—tentative during setup ("learning its grammar"), charged during the C-note exchange, resolved when "the conversation was over." Closure linkage: the tone shift to past tense ("was over") and the lanterns steadying signal the conversation's completion. Coherence is strong; the piece resists overt supernatural dialogue and maintains oblique communication. Removing this exact tonal choice would require adding speech or explicit messaging, altering the story's texture fundamentally.</comment>
