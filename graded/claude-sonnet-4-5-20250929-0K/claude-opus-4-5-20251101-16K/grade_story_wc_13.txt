<comment>Maren's motivation is clear and specific—finding the birthplace of echoes—and her final choice to age herself carries visible cost ("silver threading through her hair"). The action is rooted in consistent traits (illustrator of the invisible, grandmother's legacy). However, interiority leans toward poetic summary rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene; the decision to free the echo-spirits feels inevitable without genuine friction or a competing desire that she must sacrifice. The embodied cost is present but the internal struggle remains somewhat abstract.</comment>

<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Closure lands on the page with visible cost (Maren ages, "minutes she would never reclaim") and the causal lens holds: she borrows time, frees the spirits, races back. The Resonant Reconfiguration is legible—echoes return to the world, the interrupted cadence completes—and the final image of "faithful, singing shadows" reweights the opening search. Orientation is swift (who, where, what by the second paragraph). One meaningful tightening occurs when the Giant stirs, forcing the return journey. The cost is shown through physical change and the sketchbook documentation, satisfying the closure-with-cost requirement.</comment>

<comment>The rooftop canal system is vivid and purposeful: "copper-bright beneath her, channeling rainwater and starlight between spires." The canals guide the journey and the time-locks at junctions force Maren to spend borrowed seconds, directly shaping her choices. The Giant's breathing and impending waking impose spatial and temporal pressure. The body (her aging reflection in the canal water) charges the final image. Micro-setting (pendant, skiff, water, stone towers) recurs and constrains action throughout, satisfying the 9+ gate.</comment>

<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—find and free the echo-spirits before the Giant wakes—is signaled early and tightens when "His breathing shifted. He was stirring." Maren's agency drives escalation: she navigates time-locks, spends borrowed seconds, and makes the climactic choice to "borrow deeply" despite the personal cost. The choice forecloses a path (youth, future minutes) with on-page consequence. One meaningful pressure point where options narrow and the cost becomes unmistakable. The ticking-clock structure coheres under a causal lens, though the time-locks feel somewhat static obstacles rather than dynamically escalating threats.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from the image of interrupted cadence and silenced echo-spirits: the world cannot answer itself until origins are freed. The recurring pendant reweights across beats—first hummingbird pause, then water-locks, then deep borrowing—and the final image of "faithful, singing shadows" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without a stated moral. "The world remembered how to listen to itself" is close to thematic summary but remains anchored in the specific act of freeing the spirits. The story resists tidy resolution (Maren has aged, debt remains) while completing the symbolic arc.</comment>

<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>POV is stable third-limited on Maren; distance is consistent and vocabulary suits an artist who catalogs "impossible biology." Perceptual signature is clear: she notices translucency, iridescence, song-as-structure. The prose modulates under pressure ("Her fingers flew," "raced her skiff") without register drift. Diction remains character-specific ("temporal amber," "echo-spirits"). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. The narrative certainty stays within what Maren can plausibly infer (understanding the pendant's mechanism feels slightly convenient but not a clean break).</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; most sentences advance character, action, or atmosphere. The opening anchors voice and stakes efficiently. A few near-loops appear: "They were singing, or had been, until the song was caged" followed by "silencing the source of all the world's reverberations" restates the same concept without added pressure (−0.2). "Interrupted cadence" recurs frequently but is pattern-taught and thematic, not scaffold. Figurative language is dense in some beats ("temporal amber," "glass singing") but remains legible and purposeful. No major clarity issues, though the pendant's mechanism explanation mid-story edges toward telling what could be shown through earlier micro-uses.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.5</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of natural-history illustration, time-sculpting pendant, rooftop canals, and a sleeping Giant is specific and non-obvious; the "birthplace of echoes" premise feels fresh. The emotional truth—artistic documentation as both witness and intervention—grounds the fantastical elements. The turn (echo-spirits imprisoned mid-song) arises from prior particulars and the cost (aging via borrowed time) is concrete. Risk-taking is present in the layered world-building and the quiet ending, though the moral calculus (free the spirits, pay the cost) is straightforward. The transformation test holds: plot and arc depend on these exact choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Maren's profession appears in the opening ("natural history illustrator") and closing (sketchbook documentation), and her choice to sketch the spirits mid-crisis is character-specific. However, the illustration work does not constrain or enable key tactical decisions; she could be any seeker. The sketchbook functions more as thematic closure accent than as a tool that alters her approach to the time-locks or the freeing. Present across setup and payoff, but development involvement is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The infinity pendant is handled in the opening (hummingbird pause), middle (restarting waterfalls at time-locks), and climax ("pressed… with both hands and borrowed deeply"). Each use escalates causal pressure and the pendant's cost (aging) is visible at closure. It enables the key action (uncaging) and constrains tactics (debt accumulation). The mechanics are signaled early and the final image of touching the pendant on the walk home reweights its meaning. All three gates satisfied with strong beat involvement and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>"Interrupted cadence" is named in the opening (grandmother's claim), dramatized at the time-lock junctions ("Someone had interrupted the natural cadence here, breaking the rhythm"), drives the discovery (echo-spirits frozen mid-note), and resolves at closure ("The interrupted cadence was complete at last"). It shapes stakes (restore the flow of echoes) and tactics (Maren must restart each broken moment). The concept is irreplaceable: the entire plot hinges on cadence being broken and then restored. Visible cost (borrowed time) is tied directly to repairing the interruptions.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Time-sculpting appears in the hummingbird anecdote (setup), enables the middle action (restarting waterfalls), and drives the climax (borrowing deeply to free the spirits). The trait carries visible cost: "She felt herself age, felt possibilities close, felt the weight of debt." It constrains tactics (every moment borrowed is owed back) and shapes the ending image (silver hair). The mechanics are explained mid-story ("She could not create time, only borrow it") and tested across multiple beats. Two gates plus closure participation with strong causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>"Uncage" is the story's climactic action: Maren presses the pendant, borrows deeply, and "the amber cracked." The entire quest centers on freeing the imprisoned echo-spirits; removing this action would eliminate the story's resolution. The spirits' release resolves the dominant stake (restore echoes to the world) and carries the thematic weight (interrupted cadence made whole). The action is irreplaceable—no near-synonym fits—and the cost (Maren's aging) is tied directly to the uncaging effort. All three gates with decisive closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The method ("borrowing time") is signaled early in the hummingbird anecdote, articulated explicitly ("She could not create time, only borrow it, pulling seconds from the future"), shapes middle tactics (spending three seconds at each time-lock), and drives the climax (borrowing minutes to free the spirits). The cost of the method is visible and cumulative: aging, debt accumulation, "minutes she would never reclaim." The mechanics matter across beats and constrain her choices. All three gates with strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The rooftop canals provide the geography for the journey, impose time-locks that force Maren to spend borrowed seconds, and must survive the Giant's waking ("the waterways held"). The setting shapes tactics (navigating junctions, racing back) and pressures the timeline (reach the cavern and return before collapse). The "copper-bright" water and towers are specific and the canal's final survival confirms the stakes. Setup, development (time-lock obstacles), and payoff (echoes absorb the Giant's sound) all present with tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The Giant's three-hour nap is signaled early, tracks through the middle (time-locks slow progress), tightens when "His breathing shifted. He was stirring," and pressures the climactic race back. The timeframe shapes Maren's decisions: how much time to borrow, when to retreat. The clock is live and visible, altering moves throughout. The final beat ("reached the canal's edge as the Giant opened his eyes") depends on the timing. All three gates with clear causal pressure and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Maren's desire to find "the birthplace of echoes" is stated in the opening, drives the journey through the canals, and resolves when she discovers and frees the echo-spirits. The motivation is tested by the cost of borrowed time, though the internal friction is modest—she weighs the debt but commits without prolonged hesitation. The final image (sketchbook holding "the first illustrations ever made of their kind") ties back to the opening search. Setup, development (navigating toward the Source Cavern), and payoff all present with clear goal pursuit and visible cost.</comment>
