<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is specific and embodied—"It hurt like dying. Like letting die" lands with concrete cost. Internal contradiction operates clearly: she clings to the portraits to avoid grief while understanding they're theft. The micro-choice to "begin by untangling threads" and her sequential card-by-card dismantling earn the final state. Minor slip: the lighthouse keeper's daughter functions only as backstory anchor without complicating present pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/textural lens holds cleanly: the opening seed (bleeding portraits, failed capturing) → middle intensification (library walls closing, thread-untangling begins) → closure (blank cards, rainbow threads, heart empty enough to fill). The Resonant Reconfiguration lands with visible cost: she unmakes her father first, endures the ache, commits to continuing. One friction: "when the walls close in" is announced in exposition rather than dramatized as pressure, slightly weakening the timeframe constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The library's cylindrical geometry constrains the moment—"walls seemed closer," "accumulated memory" pressing inward—and charges the final image: the lighthouse beam's sweep through the porthole at dawn frames her completion. The velvet threads laid on wooden floor, the single porthole knife of light, and the spiral stairs anchor spatial choreography. The micro-setting (body + box + beam cycle) drives the untangling action and reweights the closure with "hammered copper" sea at dawn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: Maren must decide whether to unmake the portraits that preserve but also trap the people she loved. Pressure tightens through one meaningful deepening: recognizing "the box was beyond saving" → choosing to dismantle → beginning with her father (highest cost). The question "if she was strong enough" crystallizes the trade-off; her hands proceeding despite uncertainty shows agency under constraint. Cost is visible: "It hurt like dying."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: grief as "necessary darkness," portraits as theft, letting die as prerequisite to fill with "something living." The Fool/father card sequence dramatizes the insight without stating a moral. The final image—blank cards, rainbow threads, empty heart—answers the central question (can she let them go?) through action and image rather than assertion. The lighthouse beam's arc functions as earned metaphor, not convenience symbolism.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV distance is stable; perceptual signature is consistent (questions asked "knowing no answer would come"). Diction remains controlled: "Blue became blue again, not her father's eyes but merely pigment" shows precise register calibrated to Maren's artistic vocabulary. Rhetorical questions function as interior texture without becoming tell-y. One slip: "luminescent ache" in the pivot beat drifts slightly elevated from prior diction, though it remains within artist-POV plausibility.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is strong; information density is high. Figurative language serves pressure: "dust motes that hung like suspended souls" charges the atmospheric build without muddle. One cluster of minor artifacts: "These were the questions Maren asked herself, knowing no answer would come, knowing she asked only to hear her own voice" repeats structure and dilutes momentum slightly. The "It hurt like dying. Like letting die" fragment lands cleanly. No loops touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of tarot portraits as grief-capture + thread-dismantling as letting-go feels specific and inevitable in hindsight. The lighthouse library as liminal pocket adds spatial originality. Risk is present: the story commits to metaphysical bleed ("portraits remember") without retreating into rational explanation. The transformation test passes: swapping out tarot or lighthouse would require full structural rebuild. One bonus element: the old woman's diagnosis ("fragmented reality") seeds the concept without hand-holding the closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's choices drive all three beats: climbing the stairs (setup), recognizing she must "dismantle every portrait" (middle turn), beginning the unmaking with the Fool (closure action). Her crestfallen state is implicit in "just another face Maren couldn't finish" and motivates the entire descent. The decision to pull threads alters tactics and forecloses the path of keeping the portraits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The broken tarot box appears in beat one (pressed against chest, hinges snapped, frayed velvet), beat two (set down, contents described), and closure sequence (threads untangled from its lining as the first physical action). Its brokenness motivates the redesign; its velvet threads become the literal material she untangles. Removing it would collapse the structural logic of the unmaking action.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Fragmented reality" is named by the old woman, then demonstrated on the page: "The Hanged Man's rope had become the Hermit's lantern chain." The bleeding images constrain Maren's tactics—she must separate identities thread by thread—and shape the ending stakes (seventy-eight blank cards as restoration). The concept drives the middle recognition and closure action, though the phrase itself arrives via backstory.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhetorical questions appear in three beats: "Was that even possible?" (setup), the self-aware acknowledgment "knowing she asked only to hear her own voice" (middle), and "if she was strong enough" (closure). The attribute is constrained—questions function as interior texture and crystallize hesitation—but cost is oblique; the final question's unanswered state enables her hands to proceed, a micro-reversal that charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"Redesign" is signaled in the recognition beat ("She understood now what she had to do. Redesign."), defines the middle turn (dismantling versus repair), and structures the entire closure sequence (unmaking the Fool, reaching for the Empress). Swapping "redesign" for "fix" or "restore" would fundamentally misalign the thematic stance. The action is irreplaceable and carries visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>9.3</grade><comment>Thread-untangling is prepared (velvet strands from the box lining), executed on the page ("With her fingernail, she traced where colors intersected"), and drives the closure beat: "Thread by thread, color by color, she unwound the image." The method is specific, physical, and iterative; the mechanics of separation matter to both action and metaphor. Removing this exact method would require full structural rebuild.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The library exists "in the space between," its curved walls and exhaled dust create atmospheric pressure, and its walls "pressing inward with accumulated memory" trigger the timeframe urgency. The single porthole window delivers the lighthouse beam that illuminates dust motes and the Fool's eyes at the pivot moment. The forgotten pocket's containment enables the unmaking ritual; a mundane room would lose the metaphysical charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"When the walls close in" is announced as the dreaded timeframe and demonstrated through "walls seemed closer." The compression forces immediate action ("she began by untangling threads"). Dawn's arrival at closure provides temporal bracket: "By morning, she would have seventy-eight blank cards." The clock is loose but functional; tighter mechanization (beam rotations, card count progress) would push higher.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The descent into necessary darkness is framed early ("nowhere left but down"), drives the middle recognition ("avoiding the necessary darkness of grief"), and shapes the closure choice to unmake everyone she loved. Friction is visible: "It hurt like dying" shows cost. The motivation is conflicted—she climbs toward the task while dreading it—and the final commitment ("her hands knew what to do") dramatizes acceptance of the descent.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>"Luminescent ache" appears at the pivot ("his painted eyes caught the beam and released it, a luminescent ache that made her chest seize"), charging the moment she begins unmaking her father. The tone coheres across all beats: longing in the bleeding portraits, dread in the closing walls, pain in the thread-pulling, and tentative hope in "heart finally empty enough to fill with something living." The phrase modulates with pressure and is indispensable to the closure's emotional register.</comment>
