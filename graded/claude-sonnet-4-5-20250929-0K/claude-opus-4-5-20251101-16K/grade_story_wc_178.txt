<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's frugality and devotion are embodied consistently through concrete choices (reused charts, copper wire repairs, lentil stew economy). Her internal drive to "seal a covenant with the unknown" motivates the seventeen-year commitment and the final act of encoding her own observations. The weeping moment feels earned by accumulated pressure rather than asserted, and her decision to continue the work despite regime uncertainty shows authentic endurance with visible cost. Minor deduction: the backstory summarizes her austerity rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors cleanly (Ishtar Observatory, interregnum, Mira's seventeen years). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise—Mira's act of encoding her observations into a new magic square crystallizes her covenant with future seekers and forecloses the path of seeking external validation, with the cost legible in her acceptance of potential erasure ("Tomorrow, another regime might claim this palace. It did not matter"). The escalation moves from discovery to decoding to witnessing the nebula to the final commitment, with each beat reweighting her devotion. One meaningful deepening occurs when the nebula appears, validating her method and sealing the connection across centuries.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The Babylonian chamber and observation deck constrain Mira's movements and charge the closure image (tile placed on the ledge catching nebula light). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "amber tears," "dust motes suspended like distant galaxies," "sky deepened from copper to violet." The ziggurat silhouette, exposed stonework, and salvaged telescope all ground the setting in tactile specificity. The interregnum context (between regimes) subtly pressures the timeline and adds urgency to preservation. The tile as micro-setting object actively shapes the final image and meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: Mira's drive to uncloak the final sequence and validate the ancient priests' astronomical knowledge. One meaningful tightening occurs when the nebula appears at the predicted moment, confirming the decoded pattern and sealing the covenant. The escalation is driven by Mira's agency (claiming the chamber, analyzing the tile, building the telescope over eight years, waiting for the equinox). Cost is visible: seventeen years of austerity, social isolation implied by colleagues calling her austere, and acceptance that her work may be erased. Minor gap: the external pressure from regime change remains abstract rather than forcing immediate tactical choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme of devotion transcribed across time emerges organically from the magic square, Mira's frugality, and the final encoding act. The covenant concept integrates without meta-commentary: "devotion encrypted" operates through the tile's dual function as prayer and data. The nebula matching the tile's symbol offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether patient observation outlasts empires. Subtext operates in Mira's weeping (connection rather than triumph) and her calm acceptance of potential erasure. The final image—Mira encoding her own square for future seekers—reweights the entire narrative without stating a moral, creating a loop of transmission that resists tidy closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited with clean focalization through Mira's perceptual priorities (counting stars and coins, patched robes, salvaged instruments). Diction reflects her empirical yet devotional stance: "Empirically ironic," "encrypted devotion," "dusky harmony." Voice remains consistent under emotional pressure; the weeping beat avoids therapy-speak and stays grounded in sensory response. Prose rhythm modulates effectively from exposition to the tighter observatory sequence. Minor slip: "The unknown required patience. Mira had always been good at patience" edges toward summary rather than trusting the dramatized seventeen years to carry that point.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or thematic resonance. Rhythm varies naturally, accelerating during the observation sequence. Opening and closing lines bracket the piece effectively. Deductions: two paraphrase loops appear—"her colleagues called her austere; she called herself efficient" and the later exposition on efficiency with lentil stew feels redundant; the final paragraph's "The unknown required patience. Mira had always been good at patience" restates what the prior action has shown. Figurative language occasionally clusters without added pressure: "amber tears," "scattered salt," "frequency beyond hearing" in close succession. No significant scaffold or syntax monotony.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of Babylonian astronomy encoded in a magic square and a contemporary frugal scientist decoding it across fifteen centuries offers a specific, non-obvious premise. The interregnum setting adds fresh context, avoiding the tired "lone scholar" template by embedding her work in political suspension. Emotional truth in Mira's weeping and her decision to encode her own observations feels earned. Deduction: the core arc—patient scholar validates ancient knowledge and commits to transmitting it forward—follows a recognizable template, and the transformation relies more on setting and object specificity than on a bold structural or moral calculus that redefines the reader's expectations. The ending's recursive encoding is elegant but anticipated once the covenant concept is established.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's frugality shapes her seventeen-year commitment (reused charts, copper wire, lentil stew) and is signaled early. It enables her salvaged telescope and justifies her claiming the chamber before bureaucracy intervenes. The trait constrains her resources and pressures her patience, appearing in at least three beats (initial characterization, telescope-building, final encoding). It participates in closure by underscoring that her covenant is sealed through austere devotion rather than institutional support. Deduction: frugality is more characterization than a decision-maker in key turns; her choices at the climax (waiting for the nebula, encoding the square) would proceed identically if she were wealthy but equally devoted.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The tile is introduced early (claimed chamber, fifteen centuries old), decoded in the middle (schematic mapping, dynamic seasonal pattern), observed with during the nebula sighting (clutched to chest, placed on ledge catching light), and its function is transformed in the ending when Mira creates her own magic square to encode observations. It appears in at least four distinct beats and its unique properties (numbers corresponding to stellar positions, shifting meaning with seasons) are irreplaceable. The tile's presence in the final image directly charges the closure and makes the covenant tangible. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Encrypted devotion" is signaled early (priests hiding science within worship) and shapes Mira's entire seventeen-year project: decoding the tile, understanding that mathematics preserves what regimes destroy, and ultimately encoding her own observations. The concept drives the middle analysis (schematic representations, seasonal alignment) and defines the stakes—devotion that outlasts empires. At closure, Mira enacts the concept by creating her own magic square, ensuring the cycle continues. The concept alters tactics (patient observation, frugal commitment) and charges the final image with thematic weight. Very strong integration across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Empirically ironic" appears once as a label in exposition: "Empirically ironic, she thought, that her own mathematical analysis had revealed they were right—not through mysticism, but through astronomy." It does not constrain an on-page choice or enable a visible action with cost. The irony is stated rather than dramatized through a decision where empirical method and devotional impulse create friction. Functional but replaceable; the story's logic would hold if the line were removed.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Uncloak" is the stated goal ("Tonight, she would uncloak the final sequence") and frames the climactic beat when the nebula becomes visible, validating the decoded pattern. The action drives the middle work (schematic analysis) and enables the closure moment (sealing the covenant). However, the uncloaking itself is passive observation rather than an active choice with tactical friction; Mira waits for atmospheric clearing rather than solving a problem through the act. Present in two beats (stated intent, nebula reveal) and shapes the ending, but somewhat swappable with "decode" or "reveal" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Through schematic representations" is signaled early (walls covered with diagrams mapping the tile's numbers onto star charts, orbital calculations, temporal cycles) and enables the middle discovery (dynamic seasonal pattern). The method matters: without the schematics, Mira could not predict the equinox alignment. It appears in two beats (initial exposition, seasonal pattern revelation) and primes the closure by making the nebula sighting possible. Deduction: the mechanics of the schematics are told rather than shown in action; we do not see her drawing, testing, or revising them under pressure. Functional and causal but the method's execution remains summary.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The ancient Babylonian palace reimagined (ziggurat silhouette of steel and glass, exposed stonework beneath modern flooring, lowest chamber claimed by Mira, observation deck) is introduced early and pressures multiple choices: Mira claims the chamber before bureaucracy seals it, the dual setting (chamber/deck) stages the discovery and observation beats, and the interregnum context (between regimes) adds urgency to preservation. The setting supplies resources (the tile, the deck for observation) and charges the final image (tile on ledge catching nebula light). The palace's hybrid nature (ancient/modern) embodies the encrypted devotion theme. Strong spatial choreography and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The interregnum timeframe ("between regimes—the old king deposed, the new council not yet crowned") is signaled in the opening and creates the suspension that lets astronomers work uninterrupted. It adds urgency to Mira's encoding act ("Tomorrow, another regime might claim this palace") and pressures the decision to preserve her work. The forty-minute countdown to the autumn equinox provides a local clock. Deduction: the regime change remains abstract; no administrators appear to threaten her work on the page, so the timeframe tension is atmospheric rather than forcing immediate tactical friction. Present in setup and closure but development is implied rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to "seal a covenant with the unknown" is introduced explicitly midway ("She understood now why she had devoted herself to this work with such single-minded intensity") and frames the final act of encoding her observations for future seekers. The desire is dramatized through seventeen years of frugal commitment, the weeping at connection across centuries, and the calm acceptance of potential erasure. Friction between devotion and cost is visible: social isolation, colleagues' judgment, material austerity. The motivation drives three beats (initial framing, nebula observation, final encoding) and charges the closure image. Strong causal and thematic integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Dusky harmony" is established early ("amber light filtering through high slits, dust motes suspended like distant galaxies") and modulates with pressure: the chamber's quiet contemplation, the sky deepening "from copper to violet" during observation, and the final "harmony between past and future hummed through her like a frequency beyond hearing." Tone remains coherent through turns without flattening into static mood. The harmony concept charges the closure by resolving the tension between past priests and future seekers. Deduction: "dusky" as a color/time descriptor is less active than "harmony" as relational state; the tone leans heavily on the latter and the color palette is somewhat ornamental in non-peak beats.</comment>
