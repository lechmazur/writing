<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Venn's interiority is concrete and purpose-driven through most of the piece, with the seed-sorting ritual and monument-building showing her orderly nature through action. The transformation at the end is adequately earned by the moonstone discovery, though the shift from preservation to scattering feels somewhat abrupt—the internal conflict between hoarding and releasing could have been seeded earlier. Embodied emotion is present ("mossy delight spread through her chest like roots finding water") but leans toward poetic description rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to plant rather than store forecloses her old identity with visible cost, meeting the baseline for transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph and maintains clear spatial orientation throughout the single continuous scene. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the discovery of the moonstone speck provides the decisive tightening that reweights Venn's understanding of her entire practice, shifting from preservation to planting. Closure lands on-page through Resonant Reconfiguration (a crystallized stance shift) with felt cost—her old identity must be laid to rest, the arbor's dying acknowledged. The cost is conceptual and emotional rather than physical, but it's legible in "She would build monuments to her old self...and let that version rest."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail—floating islands, pearl-grey clouds, spiral ladders, and gnarled plum tree branches create a coherent fantastical space. The setting meaningfully constrains action: the drifting soil, the falling leaves, the platform perches all shape Venn's ritual and her final realization that scattering seeds across floating islands differs from ground-bound planting. The moonstone speck's prismatic shadows across grey bark and the transition from "grey sky seemed less like an ending now and more like a held breath before rain" directly charge the closure image. Sensory detail is filtered through Venn's particular attention (ash on cheeks, cloud-rain worn stones) without becoming a catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding ancestral wisdom in falling leaves—is signaled early and remains coherent throughout. The moonstone discovery provides a meaningful tightening that narrows Venn's options: she must shift from her orderly preservation to active planting, a choice with visible cost (abandoning seven turnings of careful sorting, letting go of her "Orderly One" identity). The escalation reads cleanly under the Accumulative lens: the illuminated leaf veins and decoded message ("What falls must be planted again") force a stance crystallization with undeniable pressure. Agency is present in her decision to plant rather than store, though the revelation arrives more through gift (the moonstone) than through protagonist struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the monument-building practice and leaf-reading: preservation versus release, endings as seeds of beginnings. The piece resists didacticism until the leaf's message—"You carry the garden forward. What falls must be planted again"—which borders on thematic statement but functions as the catalyst rather than authorial intrusion. The final image ("already imagining the green shoots that would emerge from ashen soil") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The moonstone and monuments recur purposefully, gaining charge as the story progresses. Subtext operates effectively in the arbor's dying state, revealed through Venn's realization rather than exposition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and clean throughout, with perceptual filtering consistent to Venn's character (seed-sorting precision, monument-building ritual). Diction is distinctive and controlled: "hush where past meets prophecy," "mossy delight spread through her chest like roots finding water," "grey sky seemed less like an ending now and more like a held breath before rain." Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the moonstone discovery and illumination sequence. The prose carries a lyrical, fable-like texture that remains voice-motivated rather than ornamental, with vocabulary choices (arbor, cairn, cabochon) fitting the elevated yet grounded register. No filter-verb stacks or head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with strong rhythm and varied syntax, though several phrases trend toward purple: "trembling hour when dusk neither advanced nor retreated," "mossy delight spread through her chest like roots finding water." The opening effectively anchors setting and character through action. Information density is high with minimal scaffolding, and the piece avoids paraphrase loops. Minor overwriting in the middle section where figurative language ("rivers of molten gold," "sharp and bright") clusters without adding pressure. The final paragraph's imagery ("already imagining the green shoots") effectively charges closure. No significant grammar or mechanical errors; pronoun references remain clear throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The core concept—reading ancestral wisdom in falling leaves through monument-building—offers a fresh synthesis of folklore and ritual that feels specific to this world. The ashen skyborne arbor provides a memorable fantastical frame that integrates organically with the seed-sorting premise. However, the transformation arc (hoarder realizes she must scatter/plant) follows a familiar environmental-stewardship template, and the moonstone as mystical catalyst is a stock device. The monument-building method and the specific image of "moon-tears" provide texture, but the emotional beats (epiphany, tears, renewed purpose) trace a conventional path. The piece commits fully to its premise and executes at a high level within its chosen register, elevating familiar material through specific world-building.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Venn is present throughout, signaled early as "the Orderly One" who sorts seeds. Her monument-building shapes the middle beat (constructing the shrine for the moonstone leaf), and her decision to plant rather than store—forfeiting her preservation identity—drives closure. The character's choices create the key turn from hoarding to scattering. Two distinct beats (building the monument, deciding to plant) with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The moonstone appears early in the discovery beat, serves as the catalyst for monument construction (middle beat), and its prismatic light directly charges the revelation and closure decision. The speck's impossibility ("folklore spoke of moon-tears...but she had never witnessed one") and its illumination of the leaf veins make it irreplaceable. Three beats with strong closure linkage and causal pressure. Slight swappability—another mystical marker could function similarly—prevents a higher score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Regional folklore is present early ("ancestors encoded their wisdom into the veins of falling leaves") and frames Venn's practice, but functions more as thematic backdrop than active constraint. The folklore validates her monument-building and leaf-reading but doesn't narrow tactical options or create meaningful friction. It shapes expectation and provides world logic, but the core conflict (preserve vs. scatter) would function without this exact folklore frame. Setup and closure participation present; middle development weak.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Emerges transformed always" appears as summary ("She emerged transformed always from these twilight sessions") without constraining prior action or enabling a specific choice. The trait is asserted rather than dramatized through visible tradeoffs. The story shows one transformation (tonight's shift) but doesn't demonstrate the "always" pattern or its costs. Label-only mention; no middle development; closure references transformation but doesn't hinge on the attribute's recurring nature.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prodding the moonstone speck with a pine needle occurs early and confirms its reality, enabling Venn's decision to build the monument and trust the revelation. This action is specific and irreplaceable—without physically testing the speck, she might dismiss it as illusion. However, the prod itself doesn't create the major turn; the illumination and message do. One strong beat with causal setup, but not the pivot point of closure. Setup and development present; closure linkage indirect.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Monument-building is signaled in paragraph four, demonstrated in the discovery beat ("three twigs for the vanished First Trees, a curl of bark..."), and the practice itself becomes the object of her final decision ("build monuments to her old self"). The method is irreplaceable—it embodies her preservation instinct and provides the ritual structure that the moonstone revelation interrupts. Three beats with strong closure linkage: the method must be retired for transformation to complete. Causal pressure and cost visible.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor is established early, shapes Venn's movement (spiral ladders, platforms, drifting soil), and directly informs the climactic realization: "The arbor was dying...from too much preservation." The floating islands and ash-grey environment necessitate a different planting strategy than ground-based agriculture, making the setting causally active. The setting's decay state drives the thematic and tactical shift. Three beats with closure linkage and causal constraint. Strong micro-setting use (plum tree platform, grey bark).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"During the hush where past meets prophecy" is established early and frames the scene's ritual window ("that trembling hour when dusk neither advanced nor retreated"). The timeframe creates atmospheric pressure and signals when the work is possible, but doesn't function as a ticking clock that alters tactics—Venn has the full hush to complete her observation. The temporal frame charges the mood and marks significance but remains more poetic than mechanically constraining. Setup and thematic resonance present; tactical pressure absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Decoding leaf messages is established early ("read them—truly read them—for the first time"), dramatized in the discovery and illumination beats, and fulfilled at closure when the veins become legible. The motivation drives monument-building and seed-sorting across seven turnings, and the successful decoding forces the tactical reversal (plant vs. preserve). Want is clear; the friction between patience and reward, between orderly preservation and wild scattering, creates authentic tension. Three beats with causal pressure and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Mossy delight" appears late ("mossy delight spread through her chest like roots finding water") in the final section, charging the closure image but absent from earlier beats. The tone throughout leans contemplative and mystical rather than delighted—Venn is patient, careful, reverent. The phrase is specific and vivid but arrives as a descriptor of transformation rather than a modulating presence across the piece. Closure linkage strong; setup and development weak. Lyric reprise without middle pressure.</comment>
