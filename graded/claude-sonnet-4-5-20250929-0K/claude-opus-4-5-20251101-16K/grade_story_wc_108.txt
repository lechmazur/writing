<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and her phobias embodied throughout ("Fear of heights, fire, water—she felt them all...transform terror into motion"). The final choice to climb despite terror carries visible cost and is earned by prior causality. However, Victor's motivation remains thin—his desperation appears suddenly without the prior contradictory impulses that would make his mask-crack land with full weight. Internal contradiction is present in Mara but not fully dramatized in simultaneous pulls during peak beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Decisive Change: Mara escapes with proof, forecloses the cage Victor built, and claims her real identity with visible cost (terror, isolation, unknown future). The causal lens holds—discovery triggers flight, Victor pursues, confrontation forces the climb. Orientation anchors quickly (rusted library, three days post-discovery, Mara hiding). One meaningful tightening occurs when Victor arrives and Mara must act. Cost is legible in the final image: "a night that finally, terrifyingly, belonged to her."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The rusted library is vividly rendered ("stars where the ceiling should be, cold light falling on collapsed shelves") and the balcony ladder constrains her final choice, charging the escape. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful. However, the setting functions more as atmospheric backdrop than active pressure—the library's connection to the Harrison family is told rather than shown through lived-in spatial detail that would deepen the stakes. The skylight escape feels convenient rather than inevitable from prior spatial logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim stolen identity vs. remain in Victor's cage) is signaled early and coheres. Pressure tightens meaningfully when Victor arrives and Mara must choose between familiar safety and terrifying freedom. Her agency—stepping into moonlight, revealing the cast, climbing despite phobia—narrows options with visible cost (physical danger, emotional rupture, unknown future). The confrontation deepens her understanding of her own strength. Victor's pursuit provides genuine opposition, though his threat could press harder with one additional complication mid-scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (vulnerability as strength, fear as motion) emerges from specific action—Mara climbs while shaking, claims her terror as power. The seashell and cast accumulate meaning across beats. However, the final articulation ("The ones who feel no fear aren't brave. They're just lucky") edges toward stating the thesis rather than letting the climb itself embody it. The whispered "I'm coming home" offers resonance, but Victor's line "without me, you're nothing but a collection of fears" feels like thematic echo planted for Mara to refute rather than organic desperation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is strong—Mara's fear-trained attention notices rust flaking, groaning rungs, starlight. Dialogue pursues goals and carries subtext (Victor's false warmth, Mara's trembling certainty). However, Victor's voice ("This doesn't have to be difficult") lacks distinct idiom beyond generic menace. Minor filter-verb stacking in reflective passages ("she'd thought," "she'd learned") slightly dulls immediacy, though voice remains character-particular throughout the climb.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; the climb sequence propels with short urgent beats. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. However, paraphrase loops appear: "transformative betrayal" is named twice in close succession (para 1), and "I'm scared" is repeated three times in the confrontation, sliding from dramatized to mechanical. The phrase "carrion birds" and "hard as bone" are vivid, but "That's how I'll outwit you, Victor. With your own heart" drifts into elevated diction that clashes with her visceral terror elsewhere.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The stunt-double-with-phobias premise offers a fresh angle on stolen-identity narratives, and the cast as proof is specific. The rusted library and childhood seashell create textured particularity. However, the core emotional arc (mentor-betrayer confrontation, found-family rupture, claiming true identity) follows a familiar template without a non-obvious inflection. The ending—protagonist escapes with evidence, vows to reclaim real family—is competently executed but predictable. The piece commits fully to its premise yet lacks the synthesis or risk that would make the turn feel inevitable in hindsight rather than expected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's phobia-ridden identity drives key choices: she must override height terror to climb the balcony, her fear-versus-motion training enables the final escape, and her self-understanding ("I feel everything. And I still choose to move") crystallizes at closure. Present across three beats (initial hiding, confrontation stance, climb). The trait is causally active and specific to her.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The seashell appears in two beats: Mara holds it for comfort mid-scene and clutches it while running at the end. It connects to her real mother and provides emotional grounding. However, its function is largely symbolic comfort rather than causal pressure—removing it would not break the plot or alter her decision to climb. The reprise reweights emotional texture but does not reshape options.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Transformative betrayal is the engine: Victor's theft didn't just harm Mara, it made her into someone else, and this realization drives her entire stake (reclaim identity vs. remain in the constructed cage). The concept shapes tactics—she uses Victor's own sentimental evidence against him. It appears early, pressures the confrontation, and charges the final escape with cost. Thematic echo weakens it slightly but does not negate causal force.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara's adaptive trait enables the core choice—she translates survival skill (transform terror into motion) from stunts to this escape. It's signaled early, tested mid-scene ("this was her gift...being afraid and moving anyway"), and decisive at the climb. However, the attribute is somewhat told via summary ("she was firmly adaptive") rather than shown through a prior failed adaptation attempt that would demonstrate cost. Present in two beats with visible payoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Outwitting Victor is the central action: Mara reveals she's already sent photographs of the cast to the lawyer, using Victor's sentimental record-keeping against him. This disarms his pursuit and redefines the power dynamic. The action is signaled (she holds up the cast, explains his mistake) and drives the resolution. Swapping "outwit" for "outrun" or "overpower" would require structural rewrites. The method (exploiting his sentimentality) is specific and earned.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Decrypting the cast appears early (Mara tilts it toward starlight, reads "dates, figures, names") and its mechanics matter—the smudged ink is water-damaged but legible, Victor's handwriting from 26 years ago. She has already sent photographs before the confrontation, so the method enables her tactical position. However, the decryption itself is told in summary rather than dramatized as a struggle, and the cast's content (transaction receipt) is generic evidence rather than uniquely charged by what the notes reveal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The rusted library constrains the final choice: the collapsing balcony and shattered skylight provide her escape route, and the height terror makes the climb costly. The library's connection to her real family (the Harrisons) adds thematic charge. Setting appears in three beats (initial hiding, confrontation staging, climb/escape) and the ladder's groaning rungs embody immediate danger. However, the library's family history is told rather than revealed through spatial detail, slightly reducing integration depth.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The three-day timeframe since discovery is anchored early and creates urgency—Mara has processed the revelation and now must act before Victor recaptures her. The ticking-clock element (Victor tracking her, arrival imminent) tightens the confrontation. However, the timeframe functions more as backstory anchor than live pressure; no on-page deadline or countdown alters her tactics moment-to-moment. Present across beats but does not escalate choices within the scene.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Proving vulnerability is power drives Mara's stance: she articulates her fear openly to Victor, reframes it as strength, and the climb embodies the claim. The motivation is tested in two beats (declaration "I am scared" and the trembling climb). However, the articulation ("You thought vulnerability was weakness") edges toward telling the theme rather than purely dramatizing it. The desire conflicts with her terror and the cage's familiarity, creating friction, but the final statement is more declarative than anguished.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Trembling certainty coheres throughout: Mara's voice shakes but her resolve is "hard as bone," her hands tremble on the ladder yet she climbs, and the final whisper carries "absolute certainty." The tone modulates under pressure—tentative early, vocal at confrontation, physically embodied during the climb. It charges the final image ("terrifyingly, belonged to her") and distinguishes the piece's emotional texture. The oxymoron is sustained without becoming mechanical, and the tone is present in all three structural beats.</comment>
