<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivations are clear and rooted in her forty-seven years of waiting, with embodied emotion ("trembling around the topiary clipping," "giddy terror that made her want to laugh and weep"). Internal contradiction is visible in her "anxious elation" and the tension between rootedness and liberation. The covenant descendants appear functional but underdeveloped—their scars provide connection, but their individual voices and stakes remain generic. The ending's shift from visions to "memory of intersection" earns the change, though the cost could be more viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. Orientation anchors early (Mira, maze, eclipse). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis verging on Charged Poise): Mira renews the covenant, plants the clipping, and walks into an unrooted future—the cost is her visionary identity, now relinquished. The piece teaches its pattern of braided timelines (forty-seven years of waiting, the eclipse arriving early, the convergence at dusk) and pays it off when the clipping roots and Mira becomes "free—unbound, purposeless." One meaningful deepening occurs when others arrive and the threads weave, tightening the dominant stake. Cost is legible: "carrying no visions, only the memory of intersection."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cobalt glade is specific, purposeful, and constrains the climax—"the precise shade of cobalt that appeared in her oldest visions." The maze is lived-in and tactile ("boxwood and yew," "weathered hands"). The clipping functions as micro-setting, pulsing warm and guiding east, charging the final image when it sprouts roots. Spatial choreography at the glade is clear (treeline, center, earth/sky anchors). Sensory detail is filtered through Mira's prophetic bias and reflects urgency appropriately.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: witness the intersection or humanity loses its shared unconscious. The eclipse arriving "three decades early" supplies urgent pressure. Mira's agency drives the journey and the covenant renewal; the scars weaving into a constellation is a visible tightening that narrows options to this moment. Cost is legible: she forfeits her rooted visionary role, becoming "free—unbound, purposeless, and impossibly, terrifyingly alive." The renunciation is earned by her decision to walk east and hold the clipping, and the final image reweights her entire forty-seven-year arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the tension between rootedness and release, covenant and forgetting, shared dreaming and isolated voids. The clipping, scars, and intersection recur with shifting weight, avoiding motif checklist. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: witnessing renews the covenant, but Mira's personal cost is the loss of prophecy—"carrying no visions, only the memory of intersection. That would be enough." No moralizing intrudes. The final image of the clipping sprouting roots reweights her entire arc without stating a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored in Mira's perceptual signature (visions, scars, "muscle memory she didn't know she possessed"). Voice is distinct: compressed prophetic phrasing ("purposefully curious," "eclipsed covenant") matches the visionary frame. Register remains consistent. The brief dialogue ("We must heed the old words") fits the ritual solemnity without over-articulation. Distance shifts intentionally at the glade when collective perception floods through ("dreams flooding through her"). No head-hopping; stance is controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Information density is high: "The eclipsed covenant demanded witnesses at the intersection of dreams" does multiple jobs. Minor scaffold: "Wars scattered them, prosperity dulled their purpose" is efficient but edges toward list rhythm. "Anxious elation" and "giddy terror" risk synonym churn but the second phrase adds embodied specificity ("want to laugh and weep"). Figurative language ("pooled like liquid sapphire," "screaming into separate voids") is vivid but clusters in the first third without payoff; one mixed vehicle ("dreams...bleeding" vs. "scatter permanently") blurs slightly. No loops touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of visionary rootedness, eclipse timing, and scar-linking offers a specific angle on covenant/prophecy material. "Purposefully curious" and the detail of the clipping cut with her own blood are fresh inflections. The emotional core—liberation as terrifying loss—feels earned rather than generic. The risk of multiple symbolic objects (maze, clipping, scars, glade, eclipse) is managed by convergence at the ending. However, the "seven families scattered by wars" and "shared unconscious / separate voids" echo familiar fantasy templates; transformation is present but not fully decisive.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's choices create key turns: she cuts the clipping with her blood, walks east, raises it at the glade, and renews the covenant. Her final choice to walk into the morning "carrying no visions" is the closure renunciation. Setup, development (journey), and closure payoff all present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The clipping is cut in beat one with her blood, pulses warm and guides her east in beat two, is raised to weave the threads in beat three, and sprouts roots in the closure image. It is indispensable: "This was her ticket out." Removing it breaks the physical link between Mira's rooted past and the covenant's renewal. Irreplaceable and closure-active.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The eclipsed covenant frames the dominant stake: "demanded witnesses at the intersection of dreams." It shapes Mira's forty-seven-year vigil, the early eclipse tightens pressure, and the final thread-weaving renews it. It appears in all three gates and drives tactics (scars, gathering, ritual). Essential but slightly abstract; more mechanical than visceral cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Purposefully curious" is stated once and motivates her "decades piecing together the location." It enables the journey but does not constrain a choice with visible cost. Setup and development gates met; closure participation is indirect. Functional but replaceable with "determined" or "diligent" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Heed the old words" triggers the climactic ritual when Mira speaks and others extend their scarred hands. It is the action that weaves the threads and renews the covenant. Setup (implied in covenant lore), development (gathering), and closure payoff present. One major turn traces to it, but swappable with "invoke" or "honor" without structural break.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Scars link Mira to the clipping ("blade that bore her blood") and connect the descendants ("ancient blood recognizing ancient blood"). The method is signaled early, matters in the gathering beat, and shapes the thread-weaving at closure. It appears in all three gates and its mechanics (blood, scars, light from wounds) constrain the ritual. Not fully indispensable—another mystic link could substitute—but deeply integrated.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cobalt glade is the sole location where the intersection manifests: "twilight pooled like liquid sapphire," "boundary between waking and sleeping grew thin." It constrains the climax spatially and temporally ("three miles east," "at dusk"). The glade's color matches her visions, charging recognition. The final beat roots the clipping in its soil. Setup, development (journey), and closure all hinge on it. Remove it and the convergence has no anchor.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The eclipse arriving "three decades early" creates urgency: "forty-seven minutes to succeed or fail." Time pressure is stated and shapes the race to the glade. However, the clock is not tracked beat-by-beat; dusk arrival feels inevitable rather than earned through visible time cost. Setup and closure gates met; development is summary. Functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Finding the intersection drives Mira's forty-seven-year vigil, her eastward walk, and the climactic gathering. It is dramatized in her piecing together the location and tested when she walks beyond the garden gate. Friction: the cost of losing her visions opposes the desire to witness. Setup, development (journey), and closure (threads anchor to the intersection) all present. Essential to the arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Anxious elation" is embodied at the glade: "giddy terror that made her want to laugh and weep simultaneously." Tone modulates with pressure—quiet dread in the garden, soaring ritual tension at the glade, quiet relief in the final paragraph. It charges the closure image: "impossibly, terrifyingly alive." Coherent through turns and present in the ending's emotional texture.</comment>
