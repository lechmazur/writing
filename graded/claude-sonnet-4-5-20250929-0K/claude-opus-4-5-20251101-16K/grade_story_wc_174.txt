<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and specific—her reflection on listening and the story stick is earned through three years of circuit work. The epiphany at the dome ("not to give audiences more illumination… to sit among them") feels character-particular and motivated by Marcus's exit. However, the final vision ("some truths only reveal themselves in pieces") drifts toward abstract insight without an embodied micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Internal contradiction is present (her serenity versus the heated argument) but not dramatized as simultaneous competing impulses in a single beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly: Mira, dome, post-argument. The accumulative lens holds—pressure deepens from Marcus's demand through her reflection to a crystallized new vision. Closure reads as Charged Poise: she will propose a circle-based show, crystallizing options (no stage, shared puppets) with felt cost (abandoning her performer's remove, risking further rupture with Marcus). The cost is legible in the image of her walking out "knowing that some truths only reveal themselves in pieces," though the actual proposal remains off-page and the immediate price (what she risks tomorrow) is somewhat diffuse.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dome's architecture—stripped radar shell, white curve, original purpose of listening—directly constrains Mira's reflection and charges the closure image. "Built for listening" mirrors her thematic stakes and the final line ("listening for what falls from great heights") reweights the premise with purpose. The story stick is handled twice (balanced on knees, turned in hands, tucked under arm) and its use evolves from symbol to proposed tool. Spatial choreography is clean (floor, hatch, exterior) and the setting is filtered through Mira's bias (irony of rehearsing in a listening station).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: how to practice ethical storytelling without cowardice or didacticism. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mira reverses her own position rather than Marcus's demand—"not to give audiences more illumination… to sit among them, passing the stick." The choice narrows options (no more stage/performer's remove) and the cost is visible (professional risk, vulnerability). However, the actual decision to "find Marcus tomorrow" defers the confrontation off-page, so the escalation stops short of a fully paid price in the present window.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the dome's listening function, the story stick ritual, and Mira's circuit work: ethical storytelling as collaborative, half-lit, requiring listeners to bring their own light. The final image ("taught you to see in the dark") offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in Mira's silence during the argument and her grandmother's trust in "darkness between words." Minor slip: "some truths only reveal themselves in pieces" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic echo, restating rather than dramatizing the insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent perceptual signature: Mira notices the dome's "memory of listening," the "meteor hush," and the irony of her chosen rehearsal space. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during reflection, wider for backstory of the circuit). Diction remains within Mira's plausible lexicon—"urbane calligrapher," "seedy bars," "puppet shadows"—without register mismatch. One minor filter-verb cluster in the opening ("had died," "had just walked," "had worked") slightly dulls immediacy, but the voice recovers and the prose rhythms support the contemplative pressure throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled with sentence variety and strong imagery: "inside of a skull," "meteor hush," "half-lit epiphany… shape emerging from shadow." Information density is high; most lines advance character or theme. However, two paraphrase loops appear: "leaving only the vast quiet" / "meteor hush" in close proximity, and "half-measures" / "riddles" / "ambiguity" recur without added pressure. The final paragraph contains template stems ("knowing that some truths only reveal themselves in pieces, and that the spaces between knowing are where transformation lives") that feel algorithmic rather than Mira-specific, dulling the closure beat slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—subversive puppet shows that refuse to finish stories—is fresh and the dome setting (radar installation as listening metaphor) is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. Mira's epiphany (reversing her own position rather than her puppets' method) feels earned in hindsight. However, the emotional arc and thematic resolution (collaborative storytelling, trust in ambiguity) echo familiar workshop templates about art's role and audience participation. The final image ("taught you to see in the dark") resonates but does not fully transform the template into something indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira is seeded early ("urbane calligrapher by training") and the trait matters: her "precise brushwork" translates to puppet shadows, shaping her circuit work. She makes one key choice—reversing her own position rather than Marcus's demand—that alters tactics for the proposed new show. However, "calligrapher" itself does not constrain the peak choice; "artist" or "performer" would serve similarly with minor edits. The specificity enriches texture but does not create irreplaceable causal pressure at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The story stick appears in three beats: balanced on her knees (opener), turned in her hands (mid-reflection), tucked under her arm (exit). Its mechanics matter—whoever holds it has the right to speak—and that rule directly shapes Mira's epiphany: "passing the stick, becoming a listener herself." The stick anchors the grandmother's village ritual and charges the closure by literalizing the new show format (circle, shared puppets, anyone can pick one up). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; only slight swappability (another ritual object could substitute) prevents full indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Half-lit epiphanies frame the piece: "half-lit epiphany began to form" explicitly, and the theme recurs ("half-lit by design," "see in the dark"). The concept shapes Mira's stake—ethical storytelling requires ambiguity—and drives her choice to stop illuminating and start listening. However, "half-lit" operates more as thematic label than on-page constraint that narrows tactics. The epiphany itself (reversing her position) is dramatized, but the "half-lit" phrasing feels decorative in several mentions rather than mechanically necessary to the choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Uncommonly serene" is stated in the opening ("uncommonly serene for someone whose collaborator had just walked out") and supports the tonal palette, but it does not constrain or enable any subsequent action with visible cost. Mira's silence during the argument and her patient reflection align with serenity, yet the trait is label-only; removing "uncommonly serene" and leaving "calm" or implicit demeanor would not alter story logic. No on-page tradeoff (e.g., serenity preventing decisive action or inviting Marcus's scorn) is dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Reverse" drives the central turn: Marcus demands she reverse course (make puppets preach), but Mira reverses her own position instead (from performer to listener). This reframes the conflict and defines the new show format, making it essential to escalation and closure. The action is signaled early ("what if the reversal he demanded wasn't the reversal she needed?") and pays off in the final vision. Minor swappability: "reframe" or "invert" could substitute with light edits, preventing full irreplaceability, but the thematic and structural weight is undeniable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The method is seeded early: "three years… circuit of seedy bars," "puppet shadows cast against smoke-stained walls," "puppets would stop mid-scene and ask the audience what should happen next." It shapes Mira's professional identity and motivates Marcus's accusation ("your half-measures change nothing"). The new show format (circle, shared puppets) evolves from the method. However, the mechanics appear mostly in backstory summary rather than on-page action, and the method does not constrain a present beat's tactics. Solid middle development but not indispensable to closure execution.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The dome is introduced immediately and its architecture—stripped radar shell, built to listen for falling objects—directly mirrors and constrains Mira's reflection. "She'd chosen this place for their rehearsals precisely because it was built for listening" makes the setting causally active. The final line ("leaving the dome to its original purpose: listening for what falls from great heights, waiting to understand what survives the descent") charges closure by fusing setting with theme. The white curve, hatch, and spatial staging are handled concretely. Strong causal pressure, specificity, and closure linkage; only slight conceivability of an alternate listening-metaphor venue (anechoic chamber, library) prevents absolute indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"In the hush left behind by a heated argument" anchors the timeframe in the opening and the "vast quiet" / "meteor hush" tone persists throughout. The temporal window is tight (single evening, post-argument to exit) and coherent. However, the hush functions more as tonal palette than as a clock that tightens decisions; Mira's reflection could stretch or compress without altering her choice. The argument itself is off-page and Marcus's absence creates space for thought rather than urgency. Functional setup and payoff, but mid-band: time does not pressure tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The motivation is seeded early ("to explore ethical storytelling… not to tell people what's right. To make them feel the weight of choosing") and drives the central conflict: Marcus accuses her of cowardice; she must decide whether to preach or deepen ambiguity. The friction between artistic integrity and efficacy is dramatized in her reflection and the proposed new show (no stage, shared puppets) embodies the motivation. Cost is visible: risking further rupture with Marcus, abandoning performer's authority. Strong causal and closure linkage; only slight abstraction (motivation operates in thought more than conflicted micro-choices within the present scene) prevents higher band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" is introduced early ("meteor hush of the abandoned station") and sustained through "vast quiet," "silence," "stars hung silent and ancient." The tone is coherent and modulates subtly—serene opening, deepening reflection, charged final image—without static monotony. The hush charges the closure by framing Mira's internal work and the dome's listening function. However, "meteor hush" as a descriptor is slightly ornamental; "quiet" or "stillness" could substitute with minor tonal shift but no structural loss. Solid tonal control and closure contribution, but not fully indispensable.</comment>
