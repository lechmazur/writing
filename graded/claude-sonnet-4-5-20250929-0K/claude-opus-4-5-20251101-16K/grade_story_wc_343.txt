<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's curiosity is well-established through concrete micro-choices (kneeling by the hopscotch, tracing chalk, consulting the phrasebook), but her interiority leans toward label-driven trait assertion ("diligently curious") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The emotional journey from isolation to discovery reads smooth and rational without genuine internal conflict or mistake-driven complications. The ending's satisfaction feels predetermined rather than earned through struggle; she never faces a moment where her curiosity costs her something meaningful on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story establishes a clear causal chain: hopscotch → phrasebook correlation → coordinates → light manipulation → escape. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by line 3), and the closure delivers a Decisive Change (airship freed, course set) with agency. However, the cost remains abstract—no visible trade-off or foreclosed option appears on the page; Elara gains everything without sacrifice. The starling confirmation and light-beam solution arrive conveniently rather than through earned struggle, softening the causality at the climactic beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The airship setting is vividly particular (cargo deck, mirror array, porthole) and the stranded luminance creates atmospheric constraint. The phrasebook functions as micro-setting, handled across multiple beats and charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout (cargo deck → engine room → helm). The luminance pocket genuinely constrains the ship's movement and Elara's solution uses the established mirror array, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment shape tactics and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (earn journeyman papers through discovery) is signaled early and drives exploration. One meaningful tightening occurs when the hopscotch pattern connects to coordinates, narrowing options from passive waiting to active pursuit. The escalation reads as accumulative discovery rather than mounting pressure with trade-offs. No visible cost attends the resolution—the engines restart, the coordinates are set, and Elara faces no losses or difficult choices at closure, only gain and confirmation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme of sociable isolation emerges through concrete particulars (conversations with maps, compasses, dead navigator, unknown children, starlings) without overt statement. The final image of murmurations parting offers visual resonance tied to prior material. However, the ending drifts toward thesis articulation ("She was exactly where she was meant to be") that replaces earned ambiguity with tidy affirmation. The discovery arc resolves into unambiguous triumph without wrestling with the cost of perpetual isolation or the tension between connection and solitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV distance is stable and third-limited throughout; no head-hopping. Elara's perceptual signature (cartographic framing, pattern-seeking attention) is consistent and character-specific. The prose carries distinct texture in word choice ("murmurations sketched impossible geometries," "stranded brilliance") and the voice modulates purposefully from contemplative opening to urgent climax. Minor filter-verb density in reflective passages ("had learned," "had read") slightly dulls immediacy but doesn't obscure clarity or break the ending's momentum.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is strong; most lines advance discovery or atmosphere. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and the read-aloud test passes cleanly. Two paraphrase loops create minor drag: "sociable isolation, surrounded by stories yet separated from their tellers" restates the concept within the same paragraph, and "She was diligently curious" at the end echoes earlier assertion without added pressure. The phrase "the next great discovery" appears twice verbatim (middle and final paragraphs), functioning as light scaffold rather than charged reprise. No artifacts touch the closure beat itself.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The airship-cartographer-stranded-luminance combination feels organic and the hopscotch-as-cipher twist offers a fresh angle on the discovery plot. However, the core emotional arc (isolated scholar finds validation through pattern recognition) follows a familiar template without transformation through lived cost or moral calculus. The starlings-confirming-the-pattern beat strains credibility as nature conveniently validates her theory at the exact needed moment. The resolution delivers wish fulfillment (engines restart, coordinates unlock, murmurations part) without the protagonist earning it through sacrifice or confronting a trade-off inherent to her condition.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara's curiosity drives the key turns: examining the hopscotch, consulting the phrasebook, connecting patterns, manipulating the mirror array. Present in setup (first paragraph establishes the trait), development (pattern-solving middle), and payoff (sets course at closure). Two distinct action beats rely on her observational choices. Moderate causal pressure; her decisions enable discovery but face no opposition or cost, limiting irreplaceability—a less curious character could still stumble on the hopscotch and follow the same steps.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The phrasebook appears in three beats: introduction with dog-ear detail, correlation with hopscotch numbers (page 314), and clutched to chest at helm. Setup is strong (page 314 dog-ear planted early), development uses it as the cipher key, and payoff shows it physically present in the closure image. High specificity—the dog-ear and "phrases for light, direction, and home in seventeen languages" provide unique properties that enable the coordinate discovery. Causal pressure is clear; removing it breaks the puzzle solution. Approaches 8.5 but lacks visible cost tied to possession or use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Stranded luminance traps the ship (setup constraint), provides the material Elara redirects (development), and is explicitly overcome at closure ("stranded luminance faded behind"). Present in all three gates. The concept shapes tactics—she uses the mirror array to focus accumulated light—demonstrating causal pressure. However, the luminance functions primarily as obstacle-then-resource in a single sequence rather than constraining multiple choices or charging the final image with reweighted meaning. Functional but closer to replaceable atmospheric condition than indispensable story engine.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Diligently curious" is named three times but demonstrated unevenly. Setup labels it ("diligently curious by nature"), development shows observation and note-taking (tracing chalk, mapping correlations), and closure repeats the label without new cost. One on-page action (the sustained pattern analysis) clearly stems from the trait. The trait enables discovery but never constrains—no moment where curiosity costs her time, safety, or a competing goal. Swappability moderate; "thorough" or "systematic" would serve similar function with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Note" appears in the final line ("noted the heading in her journal") and earlier ("began to note the correlations"). Setup is weak (no framing of notation as method), development shows the action creating the coordinate discovery, payoff includes it in closure beat. Two distinct beats rely on the noting action. Moderate causal linkage—the act of recording and correlating drives the key turn—but easily swappable with "map," "trace," or "calculate" without structural loss. The action matters but lacks irreplaceable specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The hopscotch board is introduced at the one-third mark ("Today she found the hopscotch board"), detailed immediately (setup), examined and decoded in the next beats (development: "noting secret patterns"), and its sequence shapes the closure (starlings draw the numbers, coordinates are set). Present in all three gates with strong specificity—the unusual number sequence (3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6,5) provides unique cipher properties. Two action beats center on it. Causal pressure is high; the method is indispensable to discovery. Late setup (after 25% mark) caps potential slightly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The airship is present from line one (setup), provides tools in development (cargo deck, mirror array, engine room), and is the vessel Elara pilots at closure. Spatial specificity is strong (porthole, planking, helm). The mirror array—a ship-specific resource—enables the climactic light manipulation, demonstrating that setting constrains and enables tactics. Present in all three gates with clear causal participation. Approaches essential but could be replaced with another stranded vessel (balloon, sky-station) with moderate edits, limiting irreplaceability to high-7s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Starling murmurations frame the story (opening image, mid-story confirmation, closing image where they "parted below her") and the twilight timing is noted ("Phosphorescent Shoals... existed only at twilight"). Setup and payoff are present; development is weak—the murmurations observe rather than constrain. The timeframe provides atmospheric resonance and a charged final image but does not tighten decisions or create urgency. No live clock alters tactics; Elara works at her own pace. The twilight condition remains abstract rather than pressuring her window of action.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The desire to "earn journeyman papers" and "chart the next great discovery" is established in paragraph three (setup), drives the exploration and pattern-solving (development), and is restated at closure ("already composing the notation"). Present in all three gates. The motivation produces on-page action but faces no friction—no competing wants, no moment where discovery might cost her safety or relationships. Told more than dramatized in conflict; the final "She was exactly where she was meant to be" declares fulfillment rather than earning it through visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Sociable isolation" is named in paragraph two and demonstrated through "conversations with maps," the dead navigator, unknown children, and starlings. The tone coheres through solitary contemplation and pattern-finding; modulates purposefully from contemplative drifting to focused discovery. Setup strong, development maintains the paradox (alone but in dialogue with traces), payoff sustains it ("still alone, still isolated—but she carried conversations"). The tone charges the final image of communion-through-discovery. Approaches 7.0 but the overt labeling and restated formula in the ending reduce subtlety.</comment>
