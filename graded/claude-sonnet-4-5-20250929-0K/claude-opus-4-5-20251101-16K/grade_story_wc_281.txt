<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's affectionate skepticism is signaled early and her devotion drives the light-painting attempt, but her interiority leans abstract ("beautiful, structured patterns that spiraled infinitely inward") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. Eli's transformation from disconnected to speaking ("I felt it") reads schematic—the body crying and speaking coherent words lacks embodied specificity showing why *this* moment breaks through. The final choice to continue ("We'll do it again tomorrow") feels declared rather than earned by visible cost that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story infers a Causal lens: Maya devises somatic-marker light painting → Eli's hand moves to chest → tears → first words. Orientation anchors quickly (warehouse studio, post-recall). The closure unit is a Decisive Change (Eli speaks) with felt emotional cost, but the breakthrough mechanism remains asserted ("the nervous system remembered") rather than dramatized through a specific gesture or micro-choice that shows why *now*. One meaningful tightening occurs; the cost is legible but lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The light painting studio provides concrete resources (LED wand, shutter, light table) and the muscovite's prismatic scattering charges the final image with "small rainbows across the studio walls like promises." Spatial choreography is clear and the geode's crystalline structure constrains Maya's method. However, the studio functions primarily as backdrop; no environmental detail forces a tactical choice mid-scene, keeping it just below the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reconnecting Eli—is signaled early and pressure tightens when Maya begins the light-painting attempt. The hand-to-chest movement and tears constitute one meaningful reversal, but the turn arrives via somatic response rather than Maya's tactical adjustment under resistance. The cost (enduring repetition, "until every pathway is illuminated") is stated rather than paid on the page, and no live obstacle tests her commitment during the attempt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—love as patient reconstruction versus technological shortcut—emerges from the telepathy-pill premise and Maya's somatic-marker method. The final image ("small rainbows across the studio walls like promises") offers a resonant answer without moralizing. However, the narration edges into direct statement: "love was its own kind of telepathy" and "hope…was sometimes strong enough" articulate the thesis rather than letting particulars do the work, dropping Q5 below the high band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Maya; her perceptual signature (light as revelation, structured beauty) is consistent. Dialogue is sparse but functional ("I'm going to try something" / "I felt it"). The prose modulates appropriately from clinical context to lyric closure. Minor filter-verb density ("She understood," "She knew") in the final third slightly dulls immediacy, but no head-hopping or register breaks occur.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Clarity and propulsion are generally strong, but figurative density clusters in non-peak beats: "fractally precise layers," "spiraled infinitely inward," "delicate as light through crystal," "patient as muscovite forming in the earth." The phrase "willowglass" (line 2 from end) reads invented without pattern-teaching, creating a minor register bump. Two near-paraphrase loops: the geode's light-scattering function is restated across three beats without added detail. Template stems ("She'd been… She understood… She only knew…") recur in the final third. Applying patterned-artifact pack: −0.8 for figurative cluster + loop; touching final third disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The telepathy-pill recall is a fresh speculative premise, and pairing it with light painting and somatic markers offers a non-obvious synthesis. However, the emotional arc (patient love rebuilding what technology broke) follows a familiar template, and the breakthrough moment—tears and first words—lacks a turn that redefines prior material. The piece commits fully to its premise but does not transform the recovery-through-art trope into something structurally surprising.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Maya's affectionate skepticism frames the opening and her decision to devise the light-painting method drives the middle turn. She appears in setup, development (the attempt), and payoff (holding Eli, promising repetition), meeting all three gates. However, her choices feel assured rather than conflicted; no on-page cost (stamina, doubt, tactical pivot) materializes during the attempt. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (method choice) +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, minus swappability (another caring partner could perform similar acts) −0.5, minus ornamental interiority in peak beats −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The muscovite geode appears in beat one (Maya turns it over, recalls Eli's gift), beat two (attached to LED wand to fragment light), and the final image (scattering rainbows as promises). It meets all three gates and its crystalline structure enables the somatic-marker method. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (enables light fractal) +1.2, closure linkage (charged reprise) +1.4, specificity (fractally precise scattering) +0.6, minus slight swappability (any prism could fragment light, though the anniversary backstory adds weight) −0.4, minus one ornamental mention (first-anniversary memory pauses action) −0.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The telepathy pill recall frames the inciting problem (Eli's disconnection) and is present in setup and closure context ("other families navigating the aftermath"). However, the pills themselves do not constrain a middle choice or force a tactical shift; the story pivots to somatic markers and light, making the recall a backstory generator rather than an active stake-shaper. Setup +0.5, closure context +0.5, missed development gate −1.0 (cap ~6.0), ornamental use in final paragraph −0.3, swappability (any neuro-incident could serve) −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Fractally precise" appears as a descriptor for the geode's light-scattering (twice) and Maya's thought patterns (anniversary memory). It does not constrain a choice or enable a trade-off; the attribute remains metaphorical. Present in setup and closure image but absent from development. Two beats +0.9, label-only trait −0.6, missed development gate −1.0 (cap ~3.4 waived slightly by lyric reprise allowance to 4.6 ceiling), late thematic echo in final third −0.3, swappability (any ornate scattering pattern would do) −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Devise" occurs on-page when Maya "began to devise her approach" and enacts the light-painting method. The action shapes the central beat and is causally necessary for the breakthrough. Setup +0.6, two beats (planning + execution) +0.9, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage (method produces Eli's response) +1.2, irreplaceability +0.5, minus summary phrasing ("began to devise" rather than shown tactical weighing) −0.5, minus swappability (another artist could "create" or "design" with similar effect) −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Somatic markers are named once ("the neurologist had mentioned") and Maya's method recreates "motions of their shared history" to trigger bodily memory. The mechanics matter: gesture → nervous system recall → Eli's hand moves. Present in setup (neurologist mention), development (execution), and payoff (Eli's response). Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.0, minus ornamental summary (the neurologist mention pauses action) −0.3, minus swappability (any embodied-memory cue could serve) −0.5, minus late first dramatized use (method enacted only in second half) −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The light painting studio provides the LED wand, shutter, and light table that enable the attempt, and the "converted warehouse space" anchors setting early. It appears in setup, supplies resources in development, and the "studio walls" catch rainbows at closure. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (tools enable method) +1.0, closure linkage +0.8, minus postcard function (the space is described but does not force a tactical pivot) −0.6, minus swappability (any dark room with light tools would work) −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the static shock event" and "three months later" establish timeframe in setup, and "past weeks" anchors Eli's disconnection duration. However, no live clock tightens the attempt; Maya's session has no temporal constraint or cost. Setup +0.5, missed development gate (no mid-scene time pressure) −1.0 (cap ~4.6), ornamental summary (weeks/months told, not felt) −0.3, swappability (any post-crisis window would serve) −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maya's motivation to "illuminate hidden pathways" is declared and dramatized through her choice to attempt the light painting. It drives the middle turn and closure. Present in setup ("I'm going to illuminate hidden pathways"), development (the attempt), and payoff (promise to repeat). Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.0, irreplaceability +0.5, minus told declaration rather than shown friction between hope and doubt −0.5, minus no visible cost during the attempt −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Willowglass hope" (final third) names the tone and "fragile…delicate" modulate the ending mood. The tone is coherent and modulates from clinical backstory to lyric closure. Present in closure only; missed setup and development. Closure linkage +0.9, late first appearance (final third) −0.8 (cap ~4.6), lyric-resonance allowance (the image reweights the stake) +1.2, label-only mention ("willowglass" unexplained neologism) −0.3, swappability (any fragility metaphor could serve) −0.5.</comment>
