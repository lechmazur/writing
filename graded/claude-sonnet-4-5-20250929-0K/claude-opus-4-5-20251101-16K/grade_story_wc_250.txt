<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The guardian's stillness and silent witness are embodied through concrete action (shutter manipulation, mirror angling), and her motivation—to create light patterns for the suffering—drives the scene. The girl's emotional arc from trembling to weeping to sitting is clear, though her interiority remains thin; we see her hands unclench but little internal contradiction. The guardian's backstory about finding the dental mirror feels like efficient setup rather than digressive reflection. Minor gap: the girl's "terrible thing" remains abstract, limiting the felt weight of her renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (canal guardian, cobalt dock, post-rain evening) land within the first two paragraphs. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the shutter-and-mirror patterns build pressure through sensory intensification and the girl's progressive calming, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—she sits, weeps, and defers confession, a stance crystallization with visible emotional cost. The closure image ("learning that darkness did not have to mean alone") reweights prior material without stating a moral. One minor slip: the phrase "in the morning, the girl would speak her secret" briefly steps outside the scene's temporal frame, though it reinforces rather than undercuts the present cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cobalt dock, wet planks, canal, and mist function as micro-setting that charges the final image: light refracted in fog, shutters throwing moving stripes. The dental mirror and shutter-cord mechanism are handled on the page and constrain the guardian's method of silent comfort. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the guardian's calm witness (lapping water, night bird) and the girl's distress (tremor, shadow). The setting modulates with pressure—still water, pooling residue, then the rhythmic dance of light and dark—supporting the "stillwater tension" tone without becoming a static postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether the girl will act on despair or find another path—is signaled early ("almost did something terrible") and tightens through her approach, her trembling hands, the half-spoken secret. The guardian's shutter weaving and mirror angling are active choices that narrow the girl's options from isolation to witnessed company. The ending forecloses immediate confession (cost: vulnerability deferred, dependence on a stranger accepted) in favor of sitting together, a meaningful tightening under the Accumulative lens. No antagonist is required; the girl's internal crisis and the guardian's silent intervention cohere. Minor: the abstract "terrible thing" limits escalation clarity, capping the upper band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—silent empathy as presence rather than prescription, small lights made meaningful in darkness—emerges from the guardian's concrete actions (shutter patterns, dental mirror stars) and the girl's response (unclenching, weeping, sitting). The ending image ("darkness did not have to mean alone") reweights prior material through a non-literal answer: connection without words, witness without solution. The piece resists moralizing; "teach darkness the value of stars" is shown in action, not asserted. One brief slip: "sometimes that was the only honest response" edges toward thematic summary, though it remains grounded in the guardian's lived method.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds steady on the guardian's perceptual signature: "spiralingly calm," "stillwater tension," selective focus on the girl's body language and the canal's rhythm. Diction is elevated but consistent ("glazed with the sky's residue," "weave," "scattering against the mist"). The girl's sparse dialogue ("I almost—") and the guardian's silence are voice-motivated and advance plot. Minor register drift: "the breathless pause before confession, when words gather behind teeth like floodwater against a dam" reads slightly authorial rather than guardian-focalized, and "artificially manufactured constellations" carries a clinical precision that tensions the lyric cadence. No head-hopping; psychic distance remains controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully (short beats at peak moments: "Neither spoke. The moment hung there."), and figurative language is mostly coherent ("spiralingly calm," "stillwater tension," light as artificial stars). Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or action. Two slips: "teach darkness the value of stars" and "not through words, never through words" feel slightly thesis-stated rather than purely enacted. The phrase "because sometimes that was the only honest response" adds scaffold. One paraphrase loop: "tiny points of refracted brilliance" and "small and bright" reiterate without new pressure. No major template cadence or filter-verb stacks; clarity remains high.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The guardian's method—using a dental mirror and rigged shutters to weave light patterns—is a fresh, concrete synthesis that avoids cliché comfort-giver tropes. The canal setting and "spiralingly calm" attribute anchor the emotional logic in specific, non-obvious detail. The girl's deferred confession and the guardian's wordless witness resist the tidy resolution template. Minor limitation: the "silent empathy" and "teach darkness the value of stars" framing, while specific in execution, echo familiar therapeutic-wisdom idiom. The emotional truth and sensory particularity elevate the piece above derivative territory; transformation is present but not extraordinary.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The silent canal guardian is introduced in paragraph two, frames the entire scene through her POV and actions, and drives the key turn: pulling the shutter cord to create light patterns that calm the girl. Her choices (retrieving the dental mirror, angling it, adjusting the shutters, maintaining silence) alter the girl's trajectory from despair to witnessed endurance. The guardian's "spiralingly calm" presence and wordless witness are enacted on the page with visible cost (patience, sustained effort, emotional witness). Setup, development, and closure all pivot on her agency; the story's logic would collapse without her exact choices.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dental mirror appears in paragraph thirteen with brief backstory (found floating, "compass for navigating human darkness"), is physically handled (angled toward the girl, tilted to catch light), and used in two distinct beats: first to catch warehouse light, then to scatter refracted points into the mist. Its reappearance at closure ("transformed it into something small and bright") reweights its function from tool to symbol of manufactured hope. The mirror's unique reflective property matters—no other object could create the "artificial stars." Missing stronger middle development; it arrives and is used effectively but does not constrain an intermediate choice. Two gates (development, payoff) met; setup is compressed but present.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Silent empathy shapes the guardian's method on the page: she refuses speech, offers no advice, and instead creates sensory patterns (light/dark weaving) and maintains witness. This silence is not passive; it is the story's central tactic, articulated in paragraph seventeen ("language was too crude an instrument") and enacted throughout. The girl's response—slowed breathing, unclenched hands, eventual sitting—shows the concept altering her options. The ending crystallizes silent empathy as "presence" and "space" rather than solution, with visible cost (the girl's vulnerability accepted, confession deferred). The concept is both thematic and operational, constraining the guardian's choices and charging the final image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Spiralingly calm" is attributed to the guardian in paragraph five and linked to her effect on passersby ("unwinding their knots"). The attribute enables her to sit in stillwater tension and create the shutter patterns without agitation, an on-page action with cost (sustained patience, emotional labor). It reappears implicitly in her silence and measured movements. The trait is label-heavy in first mention ("spiralingly calm, radiating outward") and could be demonstrated more through syntax or gesture rather than declared. Middle development is thin; the attribute's constraint is clearer at setup and closure than in a pivotal mid-scene choice. Two gates met (setup, payoff); causal pressure is present but not sharp.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Weave" is signaled in paragraph fifteen when the guardian pulls the shutter cord and creates "patterns with the shutters that threw moving stripes." The action is repeated and refined (pulling, releasing, shifting patterns from bars to spirals), and it drives the girl's calming (transfixed, breathing slowed, hands unclenched). The weaving is the story's pivot: without it, the girl remains isolated and the guardian's silent empathy has no vehicle. The final paragraph reprises weaving as "creating small stars in the darkness," charging the closure image. Setup, development, and payoff all trace to this action; it is narratively indispensable and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The shutter mechanism is introduced in paragraph fifteen ("a mechanism she had rigged herself, connected to the old shutters") and used immediately: the guardian pulls the cord to open and close slats in sequence, creating light patterns. The method's mechanics—cord pull, shutter shift, light filtration—are shown on the page and enable the guardian's silent intervention. The shutters are adjusted again (paragraph eighteen: "pattern shifted: spirals now") to sustain the girl's attention. The method shapes the guardian's tactics and charges the closure (light weaving as the enacted answer to despair). Three gates met; the method is present early enough, developed through repeated use, and essential to the ending's effect.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cobalt dock after rain is established in the opening line and sustained throughout: wet planks, pooling water, canal lapping, mist above the water. The setting provides the resources for the guardian's method (warehouse shutters, streetlamp light to reflect) and the tone (stillwater, glazed surfaces). The dock's dampness and residual mist enable the dental mirror to scatter light into "artificial stars," a micro-setting detail that charges the final image. The setting also isolates the pair, creating privacy for the girl's approach and the guardian's witness. Three gates met; spatial choreography is clear and the wet, reflective surfaces meaningfully enable tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Within the edge of a half-spoken secret" is named in paragraph ten and frames the scene's tension: the girl has arrived but not yet confessed. The timeframe tightens the girl's hover at the dock's edge and the guardian's patient silence; confession is imminent but deferred. The ending explicitly postpones resolution ("In the morning, the girl would speak her secret"), so the timeframe constrains present action by holding the moment before speech. However, the phrase is more lyric label than operational clock; no sentence-level pressure derives from racing against this edge. Two gates met (setup, payoff); middle development is thin. The timeframe shapes tone more than tactics, capping the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to teach darkness the value of stars" is articulated in paragraph sixteen and enacted through the guardian's shutter-weaving and mirror-angling. The desire is dramatized: she creates light patterns specifically to offer the girl a visual counterpoint to despair, accepting the cost of patience and silent witness. The motivation shapes her refusal to speak and her choice of sensory method over verbal comfort. Minor friction: the phrase itself is stated rather than purely shown, and the final paragraph repeats it ("creating small stars in the darkness because sometimes that was the only honest response"), edging toward thematic summary. Two gates met (development, payoff); setup is compressed. The motivation drives key choices but is partly told.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Stillwater tension" is named in paragraph ten and sustained throughout: the guardian's motionless witness, the girl's trembling pause, the "suspended hour." Tone modulates with pressure—opening with wet stillness, tightening at the girl's approach, then easing as the light patterns calm her—and charges the final image (sitting together, "learning that darkness did not have to mean alone"). The tone coheres across beats without static monotony. Minor slip: the phrase "stillwater tension" is label-declared rather than purely emergent, though the scene's pacing and sensory detail embody it. Three gates met; tone is coherent, purposeful, and supports the ending's resonance.</comment>
