**Drive Lens:** Causal — because/therefore linkage drives the plot (anomaly → investigation → confrontation → decision).

**Closure:** Charged Poise — Mara copies coordinates and begins erasing traces, crystallizing her choice between safety and pursuing her mother, with felt cost (abandoning her life/security).

**Dominant Stake:** Truth about her mother's disappearance / survival against a lethal corporate conspiracy.

<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and rooted in the mother's disappearance, and the lie to Chen is a good micro-choice under pressure. However, internal contradiction is thin — she was always going to follow her mother, so the final "choice" feels predetermined rather than torn. Chen is a functional antagonist who inexplicably reveals his crimes and then walks away, undermining both his credibility and the pressure on Mara. "The sensed absence that had haunted Mara for eight years suddenly had shape" leans toward label-speak rather than embodied realization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors land cleanly within the first few lines. The causal chain is legible until the critical Chen scene: a director who confesses to murder ("We deleted them") and then strolls away saying "think carefully" is a massive plausibility break that undermines the story's central turn. The coordinates being simultaneously "hidden in the archive's deepest layers" yet signaled everywhere via 7319 is contradictory. Closure (Charged Poise) functions — the cost of abandoning her life is felt — but it rests on an implausible foundation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The concept of the social network archive as a "strange temporal space" is evocative, and the patch serves as effective micro-setting. However, the physical workspace is essentially a white room — no sensory detail beyond screen glow and the patch in her hands. "Ghost impressions in the data architecture" is atmospheric but abstract. The setting concept is rich; its execution lacks tactile, sensory grounding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake is signaled early and the Chen confrontation is the clear tightening point. However, escalation is driven almost entirely by the antagonist's voluntary exposition rather than protagonist agency — Mara doesn't force the confrontation, Chen simply appears and confesses. The "stay useful or follow into obscurity" binary is clear but lacks moral complexity. The felt cost of her final decision is real but arrives through convenience plotting.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The digital/human deletion parallel is conceptually strong. However, the final two paragraphs devolve into explicit moralizing: "nothing is truly erased. It just waits to be found by someone who refuses to forget" is a stated thesis, not earned resonance. This is a textbook thematic echo in the final paragraph (−0.7). The story tells us its meaning rather than letting the image of Mara erasing her traces carry the weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited is stable throughout. The voice is competent genre-thriller prose without a distinctive perceptual signature. Chen's dialogue shifts from plausible menace ("I've noticed your queries") to theatrical villain monologue ("quite ironic, really") — a register break that undermines his character. Mara and Chen's voices are insufficiently distinct. No head-hopping issues.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"His smile thin as a razor cut" and "Mara's blood chilled" are stock phrases in peak beats. The closing features purple prose and paraphrase loops: "She'd understand someday" echoed by "Tonight, she finally understood," and the triple prepositional cascade "from the ghosts... from the echoes... from all the absences" is overwrought. Template cadence appears in the parallel fragment constructions ("In timestamps... In user IDs... In the metadata"). Information density is reasonable but scaffolding persists in the moralizing close.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The corporate memory keeper concept is genuinely fresh — cataloging erasure patterns is a compelling premise with built-in thematic resonance. The 7319 embedded in the patch emblem (seven rays, three stars, one moon, nine planets) is clever if slightly contrived. However, execution defaults to conventional thriller patterns: convenient villain monologue, corporate conspiracy, determined investigator. The transformation test reveals a familiar skeleton beneath the digital-age skin.</comment>
