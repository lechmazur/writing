<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and drives choices across the piece—seeking her father through sequential seal-closings. Interior states are largely abstract: "breath caught," "gripped the workbench" remain gestural rather than embodied. The automaton delivers exposition mechanically; dialogue lacks subtext or resistance. The final reunion lacks visible cost or contradictory impulse—her father simply "stumbled into her arms" without friction, flattening what could have been an earned moment of choice or renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal (because/therefore linkage across seal-closings). Orientation anchors by ~80 words (Mira, observatory, post-Bending world). Closure unit: Decisive Change—father released from shadow-space. The cost remains abstract: "infinitely tired" tells rather than shows visible forfeit or altered options. The seventeen-seal sequence is recounted in summary ("night after night") rather than dramatized; no on-page reversal tightens options before the final seal. The Orientation Test penalty does not apply, but the thin escalation and summary-only progression lower the score.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The nocturnal floating isle, iron stairs with runes, bronze automaton, and noon-shadow compression create vivid, purposeful anchors. Spatial choreography is clean; the observatory dome and workbench track across beats. The clockwork key constrains the opening action (three-five-seven turn ritual). The final image—"noon compressed into the observatory," "where darkness waited, patient and full"—charges closure with setting detail. Scope fits; no gratuitous catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find father) is signaled early and coheres. Pressure operates via the sequential seal structure, but all sixteen prior closings are summarized in two sentences rather than dramatized on the page. The seventeenth seal lands without visible trade-off or narrowed option—Mira speaks the rune, light explodes, father appears. No complication or cost shapes tactics at closure; coincidence (automaton knowledge, preserved father) solves rather than tests. One meaningful tightening is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme of knowledge-as-reconstruction emerges through Mira's relearning and the "sealed awakening" concept. The noon-shadow question offers philosophical charge. However, the automaton's final line—"knowledge can be reconstructed by closing loops"—states the theme overtly rather than letting the closure image carry it. The ending pivots on a rescued father, not a resonant non-literal answer; the personal reunion eclipses thematic reweighting. Minor thematic echo penalty in the automaton's dialogue reduces resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited with stable distance; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and voice-appropriate. Dialogue from the automaton ("Seventeen sealed awakenings remain unclosed") functions as exposition without subtext or evasion; Mira's replies are transparent rather than layered. The perceptual signature leans generic: "breath caught," "gripped," "studied" lack character-specific texture. Free indirect style is clean. Rhythm modulates with intensity but does not reach a distinct sonic signature under peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; no sustained template runs. Information density is solid; most lines advance. Minor paraphrase: "Each unclosed loop destabilizes local reality" followed by "He was closing them" restates without new pressure (~−0.2). The automaton's exposition uses stacked filter verbs in adjacent beats ("understood," "went," "extended") but remains legible. Opening and closing images anchor effectively. No major loops or artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The clockwork-automaton scholar and "sealed awakenings" concept offer fresh synthesis. The noon-shadow question is intriguing. However, the seventeen-seal quest structure and the rescued-parent climax are familiar beats; the transformation test is weak—swap "rune scholar" for "techno-mage" and the arc remains unchanged. The "spoons bent reality" detail feels decorative rather than causally integrated. No bold structural or perspectival risk that heightens stakes. Mid-range originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira as budding rune scholar drives all major beats: winds the automaton, studies charts, closes sixteen seals (summarized), speaks the final rune. Her scholarly knowledge enables the progression. The attribute is present in setup (first paragraph), middle (studying charts), and closure (speaks closing rune). Two distinct beats: automaton activation and final seal. Causal pressure: her relearning narrows the path to the seventeenth seal. Swappability is moderate—any scholar archetype could substitute with minor edits. No visible cost tied uniquely to her scholar identity at closure; she succeeds without trade-off. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, swappability −0.5, cost missing −0.3 = base ~6.7.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The clockwork key appears in two beats: Mira pulls it from her satchel and winds the automaton (three-five-seven ritual), then it is not mentioned again. Setup present (first third), middle development (enables automaton conversation), but absent from closure—the final seal is spoken by Mira without the key's involvement. Two beats (retrieve, wind) +0.9, early signal +0.5, causal pressure (enables automaton) +0.8, specificity (ritual counting) +0.4, missing closure participation −0.7, swappability (any artifact could wake the automaton) −0.5 = ~5.4. The key does not return with reweighted meaning.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Sealed awakenings" as dimensional pockets with unclosed power loops shapes stakes from the automaton's first speech and structures the entire quest. Present in setup (automaton explains), middle (Mira closes fourteen–sixteen), and closure (the seventeenth releases her father). The concept constrains tactics: she must close them in sequence, tethered to celestial alignments. Three or more beats +1.4, early signal +0.7, causal pressure (narrows path) +1.2, closure linkage (final seal is a sealed awakening) +1.3, specificity (dimensional pocket logic) +0.6, cost connection (reality destabilization) +0.4 = ~7.8. Indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Quietly deliberate" is mentioned in one beat: "Mira approached it with quietly deliberate steps, each movement considered." The trait is told rather than shown constraining a choice—her approach to the automaton does not face pressure or trade-off. Absent from setup (not signaled in first paragraph), briefly present in middle (approach scene), absent from closure. One beat +0.4, label-only (no on-page cost) −0.5, late first appearance (second scene) −0.3, ornamental (does not alter outcome) −0.7, swappability (any caution adjective) −0.5 = ~4.2. Missing closure cap does not apply because the element fails development and setup gates.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Relearn" drives the middle arc: "she began to remember. Not just remember. Relearn." The automaton frames it as necessary ("You must relearn what you've forgotten"), and Mira's nightly work reconstructing knowledge enables her to read new runes and understand why spoons bent. Present in setup (second scene via automaton), middle (nightly study), and implied at closure (she speaks the closing rune with reconstructed knowledge). Two beats (automaton instruction, nightly progression) +0.9, early signal +0.6, causal pressure (enables final seal) +1.1, closure linkage (her relearned knowledge speaks the rune) +1.2, cost connection (scattered knowledge) +0.4, summary-only (nightly work told, not shown) −0.5, swappability (study/practice could substitute) −0.6 = ~7.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"By closing loops" is the method signaled early ("Each unclosed loop destabilizes local reality") and executed across the arc. Mira closes awakening after awakening; each closure restores something (constellation, river of light). The final loop—seventeenth seal—releases her father. Present in setup (automaton explains), middle (she closes fourteen–sixteen), and closure (speaks closing rune, loop closes). Three beats +1.4, early signal +0.7, causal pressure (loop-closing is the tactic) +1.3, closure linkage ("The loop closed. The shadow-space released him.") +1.5, specificity (loops tied to celestial alignments) +0.7, cost (reality mends) +0.5, summary-only for first sixteen −0.6 = ~8.1. The method is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The nocturnal observatory on a floating isle provides the workspace for all action: iron stairs, runes, dome, automaton, star charts, workbench. Present throughout; Mira returns "night after night." The setting enables the celestial-alignment mechanic (star charts guide seal closings). The final seal occurs in the observatory with "noon compressed into" it. Setup +0.6, three beats (arrival, nightly work, final seal) +1.4, causal pressure (charts guide closings) +0.9, closure linkage (final image in observatory) +1.1, specificity (nocturnal/floating isle) +0.5, swappability (any isolated workspace) −0.6 = ~6.9. The micro-setting (workbench, charts) alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After spoons bend reality" establishes the post-Bending setting and motivates the quest (father vanished, stars rearranged, Mira lost memories). Present in setup (first paragraph), mentioned in middle ("By the sixteenth, she understood why spoons had bent"), absent from closure action. The Bending is causal backdrop but does not create on-page time pressure or alter tactics at the ending. Setup +0.5, two beats (opening, mid-arc explanation) +0.9, causal pressure (world rules changed) +0.7, ornamental at closure (no ticking clock) −0.6, swappability (any reality-warping event) −0.7 = ~3.8. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To find where shadows go at noon" drives Mira's opening obsession and is the quest's endpoint. Present in setup ("That was her obsession now"), middle (automaton reveals noon shadow is the seventeenth seal), and closure (she sees "where shadows went. Not absence, but presence elsewhere"). The desire is dramatized through her nightly labor and final action. Setup +0.7, three beats (declaration, automaton reveal, final vision) +1.4, causal pressure (motivates all seal-closings) +1.3, closure linkage (final seal answers the question) +1.4, cost (seventeen nights, father frozen) +0.5, swappability (any rescue goal) −0.6 = ~7.6. The noon-shadow specificity is essential.</comment>
