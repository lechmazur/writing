<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and internally consistent, but her interior life remains largely summarized rather than embodied in contradictory impulses under pressure. The thirty-year backstory and her "hauntingly optimistic" heart are told rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal competing values. The final moment of "orchid solace" reads as a labeled emotional state rather than an earned shift with visible cost. No secondary character appears to create relational pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the seventeen canopies accrete meaning through patterned action culminating in the seventeenth stitch. Orientation anchors (Mira, labyrinth, post-tide timing) arrive early enough. The closure unit is Charged Poise—she sits between effort and outcome, the labyrinth "begins to hope"—but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse rather than a legible forfeiture or tactical narrowing on the page. The piece teaches its pattern (repeated sewing at convergence points) and holds the lens, but the final image's pressure is asserted more than felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The labyrinth's red walls, tide-pool entry, and indigo canopies are vivid and purposeful. The seventeen convergence points constrain Mira's choices across the middle, and the phosphorescent thread charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The setting elevates above decoration by shaping her tactics (waiting for tide retreat, mapping sleepwalker paths), meeting the 9+ gate test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring the labyrinth for the sleepwalkers—is signaled early and holds. One meaningful tightening occurs: finishing the seventeenth canopy completes the pattern and triggers the breath-ripple effect. However, the council's disapproval and village warnings remain abstract obstacles never tested on the page, and Mira's agency at closure is completion rather than a choice that forecloses a live alternative with visible cost. Pressure accumulates under the Accumulative lens but does not narrow options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme—bridging ruin and reverence through craft—emerges from concrete action (sewing, mapping, phosphorescent thread) rather than statement. The illustration plate, sleepwalkers' nocturnal healing, and the final canopy ripple cohere around memory and restoration. The ending avoids overt moralizing, offering the labyrinth's nascent hope as a resonant image. Minor slip: "orchid solace" is a coined phrase that leans toward the clever rather than the earned, and the final paragraph's "new story for an old place" edges close to thematic summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single POV remains stable; Mira's perceptual signature (weaver's rhythm, verse in craft) is consistent. Register occasionally drifts elevated ("carve a path from ruin to reverence," "as if recognizing its vision made manifest") beyond a wharf weaver's likely lexicon under pressure. Purposeful compression in the opening (tide retreat, bone needle, silver thread) establishes a lyric cadence that the piece sustains. No dialogue to evaluate. The phrase "orchid solace" and "pilot light" feel imported rather than voice-native.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Information density is high and rhythm varies purposefully. Minor loop: the labyrinth "remembers" / "begins to hope" in the final two paragraphs restates the anthropomorphic charge without added pressure. Template cadence appears in mid-section exposition: "They called her… for she could not… could not…" and "Once, pilgrims… Now the red walls… and the village…" The elevated diction ("hauntingly optimistic," "orchid solace," "celestial alignment") in peak beats slightly obscures rather than sharpens the final image. No major clarity breaks, but the prose leans ornamental in places where economy would tighten.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The convergence of sleepwalking paths, phosphorescent embroidery, and the illustration-plate as blueprint offers a fresh synthesis. However, the core premise—restoring a sacred site through art against bureaucratic prohibition—follows a familiar template (artist vs. council, ruin vs. renewal). The specific combination of tide-gated entry and dreamers' convergence points elevates the material, but the stakes and closure remain abstract enough that near-synonyms (painter, sculptor) could replace "weaver" and "sew" with minor edits. Transformation is present but partial.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and her observation (mapping sleepwalkers, discovering the plate) sets up the action. Her decision to sew the seventeen canopies drives the middle. However, key turns—finishing the seventeenth stitch, the canopies rippling—are completions rather than choices that alter tactics or foreclose paths. She does not face a dilemma on the page; her role is execution of a plan formed off-stage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The illustration plate appears early (discovery in attic, carried in satchel, depicts the labyrinth's glory, margin notes inform embroidery) and returns at closure ("grows warm… as if recognizing its vision made manifest"). It shapes Mira's vision and verse content but does not constrain a choice or create friction. The plate is more blueprint than active pressure; swappable with a faded map or oral tradition without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Breaking precedents" is named explicitly ("She is breaking precedents, and she knows it") and dramatized: the council forbade interference, yet Mira sews canopies and plans to reveal the labyrinth's purpose. This defiance shapes her motivation and sets up the coming council investigation. The concept drives stakes (village taboo vs. sleepwalkers' need) and alters her social position. However, no on-page confrontation tests the precedent-break with immediate cost; it remains setup for consequence rather than paid consequence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Hauntingly optimistic" is labeled in paragraph three ("her own heart—hauntingly optimistic, the kind that sees cathedrals in ruins") and echoed in her choice to restore rather than abandon the labyrinth. The trait enables the project but does not constrain or create visible tradeoff; it functions as character summary rather than a friction that complicates choices under pressure. One could replace it with "stubborn" or "visionary" without altering on-page action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sewing is signaled early (bone needle, silver thread), drives the middle (seventeen canopies stitched at convergence points), and anchors the closure beat (final stitch, phosphorescent thread glows, canopies ripple). The act is irreplaceable: it binds fabric to stone, verse to memory, and completes the pattern that makes the labyrinth "breathe." Removing sewing would require a different craft and altar the thematic resonance of weaving/binding. Two beats minimum, closure participation clear, specificity high.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Overlapping sleepwalking paths" is signaled early (paragraph six: villagers descend asleep, Mira maps with flour, photographs by moonlight) and its mechanics matter: seventeen convergence points form her canvas and dictate where she sews. The method shapes her tactics (waiting for nocturnal routes, placing canopies at dreamers' pauses) and primes the closure promise ("sleepwalkers will process beneath poetry"). It is less active agent than framework, but its mechanics are essential to the story's logic and cannot be removed without collapse.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The labyrinth is present from the opening (carved red canyon walls, tide-gated entry, thousands of passages) and throughout (ancient stone anchors, carved symbols, strange currents). It supplies resources (anchors for fabric, convergence points) and constrains choices (wait for tide retreat, work at night, navigate crumbling corridors). The final image—red walls curve like cupped palms, canopies ripple—charges closure. The setting is irreplaceable: a modern gallery or forest shrine would not provide the same convergence mechanic or ruin-to-reverence stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"After the tide pools empty" frames the opening and return ("tide pools begin refilling with dawn's first waters") brackets the closure, creating a tidal clock. Mira waits all day for the hour, and dawn's approach creates mild urgency ("she sews the final stitch as dawn approaches"). However, the timeframe does not tighten tactics in the middle or force tradeoffs; it functions more as atmospheric frame than live pressure. The clock is present but not stressed.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To carve a path from ruin to reverence" is stated explicitly (paragraph ten) and dramatized through the sewing project, sleepwalker mapping, and defiance of the council's decay-policy. Mira's desire drives the entire action arc and shapes her choice of verses, canopy placement, and final stance. Friction appears in the council's prohibition and the villagers' shame, though these remain abstract rather than tested on-page. The motivation is essential and irreplaceable, but its conflict is setup more than paid cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Orchid solace—that rare purple peace found only in the space between effort and outcome" is coined and defined in the penultimate paragraph. The tone is lyric and meditative throughout (long sentences, elevated diction, recursive imagery), modulates slightly with the seventeenth-stitch urgency, and stabilizes in the final rest. The phrase "orchid solace" charges the ending image, but its late coinage and direct definition reduce its integration; it reads more as imposed capstone than emergent quality. The tone is coherent but the label feels forced.</comment>
