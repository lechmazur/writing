<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is grounded in concrete choices—arranging driftwood, uncasing the flute despite trembling fingers—and the backstory of her daughter's loss anchors her current motivation with embodied guilt. Internal conflict between precision and forgiveness emerges through her playing technique, showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The epiphany about teaching recovery rather than perfection arrives through sensory encounter (the echo's "absence of sound in a particular shape") and forecasts a path forward with visible cost: she must abandon her old method. Minor template phrasing ("After the guardianship—that was how she measured time now") slightly flattens voice in early exposition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis shifting toward Charged Poise): Mira learns to "forgive herself one note at a time," the echo stirs in response, and the final image crystallizes her new method with undeniable pressure even though the daughter's return remains off-page. Orientation anchors who/where/when by line three ("Mira climbed the slate path"). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered memory, physical ritual, and sonic exploration until the canyon's response reweights her understanding. One meaningful deepening occurs when she plays imperfectly and pulls the melody back, altering her tactics and opening the possibility of recovery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Thunder-echo range functions as active constraint: the "avalanchingly quiet" silence can cascade into the void with "one wrong sound," directly shaping Mira's approach to playing the flute. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—slate path, canyon depth, overcast sky that makes the gilded flute "glow anyway"—filtered through her grief and professional knowledge of acoustics. Micro-setting (the shelf overlooking the canyon) enables the sonic discovery that charges the closure. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves from path junction to canyon overlook.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Mira seeks to "harvest insights from failure" and understand the weave's collapse that cost her daughter. One meaningful tightening occurs when she hears her daughter's echo and realizes the flaw was in her teaching, not the weave—this narrows her options and reframes three years of guilt. Agency appears in her decision to play imperfectly and call the melody home, demonstrating the recovery technique she failed to teach. The canyon's stirring response raises cost visibility, though the daughter's fate remains unresolved on the page, leaving some emotional price implied rather than fully dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of recovery-through-imperfection emerges from concrete action: Mira's new playing method (letting the song fray then pulling it back) enacts the insight without stating it as thesis. The driftwood markers and gilded flute recur with shifted meaning—from markers of failure to tools of understanding. The final image ("forgive herself one note at a time") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to repair teaching failures, grounded in the particulars of weaving and music rather than abstraction. The "avalanchingly quiet" silence functions as both atmosphere and thematic constraint, accumulating pressure that the ending releases without resolving into tidy moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with tight focalization through Mira's grief-charged perception; narrative certainty matches her expertise (acoustics, weaving) and uncertainty (her daughter's fate). Diction is controlled and voice-particular: "avalanchingly quiet," "the world wore thin," "arranging them like driftwood along mountain paths." Perceptual signature is consistent—she notices sonic absences, memorial objects, the flute's lack of light—all filtered through her professional and maternal lens. Minor register lift in "the art of recovery" and "the weave collapsed" reads slightly expository but remains within her specialized vocabulary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully with short declarative beats ("Mira sat. She breathed.") accelerating the ritual moment, then longer syntactic arcs for the playing sequence. Information density is high: most lines advance character state, setting constraint, or thematic layering. Small scaffold appears in "After the guardianship—that was how she measured time now" (explicating what the prior sentence already implies) and the paraphrase loop "It had been in her teaching. / She had been so focused on precision..." restates the insight without adding pressure. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence runs in peak beats; closure image remains clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of sonic cartography (thunder-echoes as dimensional passages), maternal grief, and music pedagogy feels specific rather than generic fantasy-quest material. The premise—that teaching precision without recovery dooms students—offers a non-obvious angle on mentor-failure narratives. Transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on Mira's particular failure (guardian of passage) and the canyon's acoustic properties. The driftwood-as-directional-markers detail and "absence of sound in a particular shape" provide fresh inflections. Risk-taking is moderate: the open ending (daughter's return uncertain) and the emphasis on process over rescue elevate without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's relic-keeper role (collecting driftwood failures, holding the flute she refuses to play) frames all choices. She decides to uncase the flute despite trembling guilt, then chooses to play imperfectly—both decisions create key turns and alter her understanding with visible cost (confronting three years of grief). Setup, development, and closure all hinge on her agency. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The gilded reed flute appears in at least four beats: carried in its case (setup), uncased with ritual deliberation, played thin then stronger, played again with intentional fraying. Its unique property (singing between worlds) matters causally: only this instrument can elicit the daughter's echo and demonstrate the recovery technique. The flute's glow "the way memory glows when you finally face it" charges the final image. Indispensable to both plot and theme.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Weaving between worlds shapes the backstory stakes (the passage collapse, daughter's loss) and the present goal (understanding the weave's flaw). It constrains Mira's playing technique and provides the conceptual frame for "recovery" as both sonic and dimensional navigation. The concept reappears in the ending when she learns to call the song home, modeling the anchor her daughter lacked. Present across setup, middle insight, and closure, but its mechanics remain somewhat abstract—how weaving worked or failed is told more than shown in action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Avalanchingly quiet" is introduced early, described as gathering mass "like snow before a slide," and explicitly constrains Mira's first playing attempt ("one wrong sound could send it cascading"). The trait reappears in the final line, holding as she learns forgiveness. It enables thematic pressure (silence as both threat and teacher) but the actual consequence of breaking the silence is never tested on the page—she plays without triggering the cascade. Functional across beats with modest cost visibility.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Uncasing the flute is the major structural hinge: Mira has avoided it for three years, and the ritual of finally opening the case transitions her from passive collector to active seeker. The action is dramatized with embodied hesitation ("trembling whenever they touched the case") and immediate consequence (hearing her daughter's echo). Removing this beat would collapse the story's arc from stasis to movement. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Arranging driftwood appears in one extended beat: Mira lays three pieces pointing east, west, north, and follows the northern marker to the canyon. The method is described but its mechanics don't constrain later action—she could have reached the canyon overlook by any path. The driftwood functions thematically (failures as navigation) but is not causally load-bearing; easily swappable with another symbolic gesture. Present in setup, absent from development and closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Thunder-echo range provides the acoustic mechanism for the daughter's echo to persist and rebound with "more precise" meaning over three years. The canyon's depth and wall geometry enable Mira's sonic experiment; the setting is not postcard but functional constraint. The range's silence threatens avalanche, pressuring her playing choices. Micro-setting (the shelf) alters her access to the echo. Present across setup, middle discovery, and closure with clear causal work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After the guardianship" anchors all of Mira's choices in a three-year span of grief and avoidance; the temporal frame tightens her decision to finally play (she cannot wait longer). The timeframe shapes her emotional state and the echo's evolution (growing quieter, more precise). It appears in setup and implicitly governs the middle and ending, but no on-page clock or countdown intensifies tactics within the scene itself. Functional temporal pressure without live urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Harvesting insights from failure is Mira's explicit goal, dramatized through collecting driftwood, climbing to the canyon, and forcing herself to play despite guilt. Conflict appears between her desire for understanding and her fear of confronting the wound. The insight (teaching recovery vs. precision) arrives through embodied action (playing imperfectly) with visible cost (three years of self-blame reframed). Friction between want and cost is legible on the page. Strong setup, middle pressure, and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Canyon hush is established early ("avalanchingly quiet") and sustained through the story with modulating intensity: the silence "gathered in crevasses," the first note "fell into the canyon and disappeared," the echo emerges as "absence of sound in a particular shape." Tone shifts purposefully from stasis (Mira's breath-holding) to tentative action (thin notes) to resolution (stirring presence). The final line recharges the hush as container for forgiveness. Coherent through turns and integrated into the closure image.</comment>
