<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior life is richly layered—her collection practice and perceptual filter feel specific and embodied. However, she remains fundamentally passive: she observes, transcribes, and arranges, but makes no difficult choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The ending renews her routine without testing her stance or forcing a sacrifice, leaving the character arc static despite vivid texture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early (tidal rhythm, fragment collection) and maintains coherent pressure through sensory accumulation. However, closure defaults to reaffirmation rather than reconfiguration: "tomorrow there will be new workers" restates the opening premise without reweighting cost or options. The poison-bottle label and the unnamed dead woman seed a potential conceptual repricing, but the final image does not activate that cost—it dissolves back into routine. A Resonant Reconfiguration requires undeniable pressure at closure; here the ending breathes out rather than crystallizing stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (groaning metal, salt air, tidal rhythm) and functions as both physical shelter and conceptual architecture for erasure. The blue Rotterdam container and the sealed container with the body provide spatial anchors that recur meaningfully. Micro-setting (her ear against rusted walls, the label altar) charges key moments, and the tidal timeframe subtly constrains her rhythm, though it does not force a choice at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—sustaining selfhood through collected fragments—is signaled early and sustained texturally. Yet no on-page reversal or tightening narrows options: she collects at the start, collects through the middle, and will collect tomorrow. The poison label and the dead woman hint at escalation (erasure threatens everyone), but this recognition does not alter her tactics or force a trade-off. Accumulative designs require a density shift or cadence break that reweights cost; the ending's "strangely free" offers comfort rather than visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and action: bureaucratic erasure, the texture of second-hand memory, identity as vessel. The poison label and the dead woman anchor the conceptual stakes with specificity. However, the final paragraph edges toward thesis statement ("she is no one / she is everyone") rather than letting the image speak. The ending's resonance is real but slightly diluted by abstraction where a concrete sensory beat would have charged harder.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable and the perceptual signature is distinct: her filter privileges texture over meaning, fragments over narrative. Diction stays disciplined ("sediment," "slack tide," "residence in a throat") and rhythmically controlled. A few lines drift toward elevated register ("umbilical cord," "alter of salvaged histories") that feel authorial rather than character-generated, and the "she is no one / she is everyone" toggle in the final third slightly breaks the established restraint, but voice remains mostly coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean with strong sensory specificity and controlled rhythm. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "She is none of these things. / What she is, instead, is a collector" and the "she is no one / she is everyone / she has found" sequence in the final section. The "texture of memories" motif recurs without fresh pressure (rough grain of grief, smooth polish of joy, sharp edges of regret) in a way that feels like synonym churn. These loops do not obscure causality but dull momentum in non-closure beats. Information density is high elsewhere, and figurative language mostly stays grounded.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—bureaucratically erased woman living in containers, collecting overheard stories—is specific and evocative, with the poison label and unnamed corpse adding fresh moral weight. However, the conceptual architecture (erasure, fragment collection as self-construction) follows well-worn literary templates without a decisive twist. The ending's "strangely free" and "dreaming in voices that are not her own" feel anticipated rather than transformed. Emotional specificity and sensory commitment elevate execution, but the core synthesis remains recognizable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The death-certificate survivor frames the premise and her erasure drives the collection practice. However, she makes no on-page choice that tests or alters this identity; the error is backdrop rather than active pressure. Present in setup and thematically throughout, but her decisions do not turn on this status—she could be undocumented or hiding for other reasons with minimal edits. Two gates (setup, thematic presence) but no causal middle choice; lyric resonance at closure is real but does not require the bureaucratic error specifically.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The poison label appears in the altar scene, recurs when she traces its letters at slack tide, and is folded away before the ending. It signals the dead woman's erasure and anchors the theme of chemical/bureaucratic violence. However, it does not constrain a choice or drive a beat—she contemplates it but does not act on its implications. Two beats (altar introduction, slack-tide tracing) plus thematic charge, but no causal pressure or closure linkage. Specific object, meaningful reprise, but passive use caps the score in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Erased histories shape the premise, the collection practice, and the thematic through-line. The dead woman in the sealed container and the protagonist's own bureaucratic death both instantiate the concept with specificity. The concept constrains her tactics (she lives off-grid, collects rather than participates) and charges the ending's "erased histories she gathers form the only record." Present in setup, middle reflection, and closure image; drives at least two beats and enables the final reconfiguration of self as archive. Essential to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Filters reality differently" is stated early and demonstrated through her perceptual method: texture over meaning, fragments over narrative. It enables her collection practice and shapes her interior monologue throughout. However, the trait is largely descriptive; no on-page moment shows this filter costing her an option or forcing a trade-off. Present across beats and integrated into voice, but the cost remains conceptual rather than dramatically visible. Solid thematic integration without decisive causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Layering (fragments atop one another, sediment, accumulated texture) structures both the collection practice and the narrative's accumulative design. The action appears in multiple beats (listening, transcribing, reading aloud, adding to the altar) and the ending's "layered and strange" self directly references it. The method is irreplaceable—removal would collapse the story's conceptual architecture. Drives escalation under the Accumulative lens and charges the closure unit. Essential across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The method is signaled early (pressing ear to containers, transcribing overheard stories), demonstrated in the dock-worker fragments, and enacted again at high tide when she reads aloud. It drives her daily routine, enables the thematic claim (vessel for others' pasts), and the closure image ("dreaming in voices that are not her own") depends on this exact practice. Mechanics are specific and visible; removal would eliminate the protagonist's agency and the story's structural logic. Present in setup, multiple middle beats, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is established early with vivid sensory detail (groaning metal, tidal shifts, blue Rotterdam container) and recurs across beats. It provides both literal shelter and conceptual architecture for erasure and layering. The setting enables her collection method (proximity to workers), supplies the dead woman's sealed container, and the tidal rhythm structures time and closure. Micro-setting (ear against rusted walls, sleeping container) constrains action and charges the final image. Environment is indispensable to plot, theme, and atmosphere.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Tidal rhythm is introduced early ("mark time by this rhythm") and recurs at key moments (high tide readings, slack tide contemplation, moon-pulled sleep). It structures narrative time and provides a non-clock temporal frame that reinforces her erasure from bureaucratic time. The rhythm modulates mood and enables the high-tide ritual. However, it does not tighten a decision or narrow options—she could perform these actions on any schedule. Present across beats and integrated into setting/tone, but lacks decisive causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The desire to discover memory's texture is stated early and pursued through collection and spoken repetition. It drives her listening practice and the altar curation. The motivation is consistent and thematically integrated, but never conflicted on the page—no moment shows her sacrificing an alternate want or paying a visible cost to continue. Told more than dramatized; the search shapes action but without friction or trade-off. Present in setup and throughout, but lacks the tension between want and cost that would lift it higher.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Namelessness is introduced immediately ("She calls herself nothing") and threaded through the piece (unnamed woman in the container, "she is no one"). Tone is coherent—quiet, meditative, elegiac—and modulates appropriately (contemplative at slack tide, more rhythmic at high tide). The final image charges namelessness with "strangely free" and "outside of time," reweighting it from loss to ambiguous liberation. Tone supports theme and closure without static flatness, though it does not escalate pressure sharply enough to reach high-8s.</comment>
