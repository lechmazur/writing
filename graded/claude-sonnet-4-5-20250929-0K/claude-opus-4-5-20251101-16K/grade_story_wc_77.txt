<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to confront fear is established early and her luminescence provides embodied stakes. The advisor exists only as voice and displacement, never constraining a choice or forcing a trade-off—it observes and murmurs but doesn't oppose. Internal conflict is asserted ("aversion to her own reflection") but never shown through simultaneous contradictory impulses in scene. The final act of holding up the clasp feels more like execution of a plan than a choice under pressure with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density of images and motifs building toward a reconfiguration at closure. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The closure image—fear shattering into "glitter of old carnival lights"—reweights the premise, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt: what did Elara forfeit or lose by refusing to look away? The luminescence "fading into something warmer" suggests gain without visible sacrifice, weakening the Conceptual Repricing. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes fear's own terror, satisfying the tightening requirement, but the stakes never narrow her options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The funhouse setting is vividly realized with selective, purposeful detail: "melted clown mannequin," "dead cotton candy," "mildew and sugar." Spatial choreography remains clear as Elara moves from exterior to center. The mirrors function as both environment and constraint, shaping her final tactic (holding up the clasp as mirror). Sensory selection reflects urgency appropriately. The setting charges the closure image directly, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for environment constraining choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—confronting the photographically captured fear—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through Elara's movement deeper into the funhouse, but no on-page reversal or narrowing occurs; she executes her plan without impediment. The advisor's admiration ("You tricked it") and Elara's correction offer micro-deepening, but the "darkness lunging to flee" feels convenient rather than earned by protagonist agency. Cost at closure is unclear: she walks out with the luminescence "fading into something warmer," suggesting reward without visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: "To reveal is to consume. To hide is to be consumed." The serpent clasp, mirrors, and luminescence accumulate pressure without overt statement. The final image—refusing to look away—resonates as a non-literal answer to the central question. However, the grandmother's note "To defeat fear, you must love what repulses you" and Elara's declaration "I just refused to look away" drift toward abstraction. The resolution avoids moralizing but lacks the conceptual cost that would elevate the Conceptual Repricing into the high band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Voice carries distinct texture: "the stubborn glow that death had left behind like perfume from a departed lover." The advisor's dialogue feels stylized but purposeful. No head-hopping. Diction remains within Elara's plausible lexicon, though occasional phrases ("unbosom yourself," "photographically cursed") edge toward elevated register. Under peak stress, perceptual signature holds. The advisor exists only in sensory displacement ("murmurs," "cold breath"), maintaining voice-motivated filter use.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose carries momentum with varied sentence rhythm and selective detail. Information density is high in setting beats. However, paraphrase loops appear: "not because of what she saw, but because of what lingered" / "A faint luminescence traced her outline"—the second line restates rather than advances. Template cadence in the grandmother's note section: "To defeat… To make… To reveal… To hide…" reads as patterned artifice. Figurative language density in high-pressure beats (serpent "writhing," darkness "spilling secrets like black water") edges toward overwriting without clarity harm. No loops touch the closure beat directly, capping deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes familiar gothic elements (haunted carnival, resuscitation aftermath, fear personified) through specific detail: the luminescence as death's residue, the photographically captured moment. The advisor as displaced sensation rather than corporeal form offers fresh inflection. However, the core arc—confronting fear by reflecting it—follows a recognizable template: journey into darkness, paradoxical wisdom, symbolic object as weapon. The "serpent biting its own tail" and mirrors creating "infinite regress" are stock symbols deployed without transformation. Risk-taking in voice and setting elevates but does not fully escape derivative structure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The advisor appears in five beats (shoulder whisper, "closer," "unbosom yourself," admiration, final laugh) but never constrains Elara's choices or creates a turn. It observes and narrates rather than opposing or enabling. Present throughout but functionally ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The clasp appears in three beats: introduction with grandmother's backstory, Elara holding it in her palm, final use as mirror-weapon. It enables the closure tactic (reflecting darkness) and carries charged specificity (serpent biting tail). However, its properties are not tested or constrained earlier; it solves the problem without prior friction. Strong closure linkage but weak middle development.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Lingering luminance shapes stakes from the opening ("stubborn glow that death had left behind") and tactics throughout (Elara's visibility to fear). It pressures her aversion to reflection and enables the final confrontation ("I brought the light with me"). Present in the closure beat ("luminance flaring," then "fading into something warmer"). Drives two major beats and charges the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Photographically cursed is established early (photographer documented horrors, every photograph since shows "the thing that had worn" her face) and motivates Elara's return to the funhouse. It constrains her identity but does not alter an on-page tactic or force a visible trade-off. The curse is solved off-page (no camera, no photograph at closure). Functional but replaceable with another trauma marker.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Unbosom" appears twice: the advisor's prediction ("You mean to unbosom yourself here") and the darkness's involuntary spilling of secrets ("it unbosomed itself involuntarily"). The action shapes the closure turn—fear revealing its own weakness—but Elara does not execute unbosoming herself; the darkness does. The verb is present but not protagonist-driven. Two-beat involvement with closure linkage, but agency is displaced.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The dream dictionary appears in one beat: Elara withdraws it and consults the paradoxical note. The mechanics matter (grandmother's shifting handwriting, paradoxical instructions) and prime the closure tactic. However, it is not used again; the clasp, not the dictionary, becomes the tool. Single functional beat with early signal but no reprise or constraint on later choices.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The funhouse is established immediately and sustained throughout. It supplies the mirrors that enable Elara's final tactic, constrains her movement (she must go deeper), and embodies the repulsive allure. Setting details pressure choices (melted clown, infinite regress) and the mirrors are causally essential to closure. Strong setup, development, and payoff with irreplaceable specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"After the resuscitation" anchors the timeframe in the opening line and explains the luminescence. The aftermath state shapes Elara's aversion and her advisor hitchhiker. However, no ticking clock tightens decisions; the resuscitation is backstory context rather than live pressure. Present throughout as premise but does not escalate or constrain tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation to "trick fear into revealing its weakness" is dramatized through Elara's deliberate progression into the funhouse and her final question ("what does fear fear?"). The advisor's admiration ("You tricked it") and Elara's correction ("I just refused to look away") reframe the trick as endurance. Two beats with closure linkage. However, the desire is not conflicted—no competing want or cost friction appears on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Repulsive allure is established early ("drawn to this place despite its rot, because of its rot") and sustained through imagery: melted clown face, dead cotton candy, "mildew and sugar, childhood and decay." Tone modulates under pressure (escalates as Elara moves deeper, resolves as luminance fades "into something warmer") and charges the closure image. Coherent across turns with purposeful cadence shift at the end.</comment>
