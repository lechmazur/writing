<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's pacifist stance is established concretely through the raider incident and drives her understanding that mercy, not force, unlocks the dimension. Her shadow-work moment—allowing herself to hate—feels psychologically earned and contradictory in a productive way. The final sacrifice (rising, releasing Sera) carries visible cost and forecloses her survival. Minor slip: the backstory about the raiders slightly flattens present urgency, though it primes the closure choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Causal with Accumulative texture (the stitching of grief-threads). Closure is a Decisive Change—Mira opens the dimension and sacrifices herself to deliver Sera—with visible cost (her dissolution/ascent). The causal chain (shadow work → dimensional breach → portal crossing → her rising) is clean and motivated. Orientation anchors (Compassion, archive chamber, medical bay) arrive early and stay coherent. One meaningful tightening: the dimensional seam opens because she integrates her darkness, narrowing options to self-sacrifice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The recycled-ship setting (seventeen dead ships, salvaged panels) and the archive of tear-stained photographs constrain Mira's method and charge the closure image. Spatial choreography (corridor → archive → medical bay → portal) is clear. The green world glimpsed through the breach and the soft grass at landing provide sensory closure payoff. Minor: the vessel's "groaning" and dimensional pressure feel slightly generic rather than specifically tied to established ship mechanics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unlock the dimension to save Sera/humanity) is signaled early and tightens when Mira realizes mercy is the key. The shadow-work beat—confronting her own hatred—narrows options by forcing self-integration as the cost of opening the portal. Her carrying Sera through and then rising forecloses her survival with on-page cost. The raider anecdote provides context but slightly diffuses immediate pressure; the final sequence recovers momentum decisively.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme (mercy begins with self-mercy; shadow work as prerequisite for compassion) emerges through concrete action—stitching frequencies, touching grief, integrating darkness—rather than declaration. The Kwan Yin tear and the bodhisattva's teaching are woven into choice without moralizing. The final image (Sera laughing, Mira ascending, "some doors only open from the inside") reweights the premise with resonant paradox. One phrase—"shadow work finally complete"—edges toward thematic summary but the image itself earns the closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mira; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature (grief as luminescent, frequencies as stitchable) is distinct and voice-motivated. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during shadow work, slightly elevated at closure to honor the mythic register. The line "She let herself hate" compresses a complex interior beat crisply. Minor: "strange one who wept for enemies" and "bizarre attribute" occasionally tilt toward summary rather than embodied perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; no template cadence. Information density is high (gene-tailored colonists, joy/gravity link, dimensional memory in tears all compress economically). "Kwan Yin's tear blazed hot against her chest, not in judgment but in recognition" is precise and propulsive. Small slips: "the strange one who wept" and "something adjacent: acceptance" feel slightly explanatory rather than imagistic. The phrase "shadow work" recurs but stays functional; no loops or synonym churn in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis (shadow work + pacifism + grief as dimensional key + gravity-as-emotion) is specific and non-obvious. The inversion—violence fails, mercy succeeds—avoids the expected space-opera solution. Mira's final ascent (lightness from completion rather than joy) is a fresh inflection on the gravity attribute. Moderate friction: the gene-tailored joy/gravity mechanic and the locked-dimension premise lean on familiar SF and spiritual-quest templates; transformation through Mira's particular sacrifice and the tears-as-memory detail elevates but does not fully escape the template neighborhood.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's steadfast pacifism is established (raider incident), drives her interpretation (mercy unlocks the dimension), and shapes the climactic choice (non-violence as method, self-sacrifice as cost). Present in setup, middle realization, and closure action.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Kwan Yin's tear appears in setup (pressed to sternum, "ancient warmth"), returns at the shadow-work beat ("blazed hot… in recognition"), and is passed to Sera at closure. Three beats; the object's heat signals recognition and charges the final transfer. Specific and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Shadow work is named and dramatized: Mira acknowledges her hatred, envy, exhaustion in a pivotal beat that opens the dimension. It shapes the middle turn and closure causality. Moderate friction: the term is used as a label ("shadow work demanded acknowledgment," "shadow work finally complete") in ways that edge toward theme claim rather than pure action pressure, though the hate-confrontation beat itself is concrete.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The gravity/joy attribute is established early and returns at closure: Mira becomes "lighter… not from joy exactly, but from something adjacent: acceptance" and rises after releasing Sera. It enables the final image and ties to theme. Moderate penalty: the mechanic is described more than used—no mid-scene moment where her emotional state visibly alters her movement under pressure (e.g., feet lifting during a choice), weakening causal demonstration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Stitching ("stitching frequencies," "weaving consciousness through photographs," "pulling threads of forgiveness") is the method that unlocks the dimension and structures the climax. Appears in setup metaphor, drives the shadow-work sequence, and is inseparable from the dimensional opening. Essential and irreplaceable; removing it collapses the closure mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The shimmer of long-dried tears is signaled early ("faint shimmer… crystallized into something almost luminescent under ultraviolet light," "contained dimensional memory"), guides Mira's method ("using the shimmer… as a guide"), and the photographs scatter at closure with tears "finally shed for something other than sorrow." Three beats; causal and charged. Small friction: the UV-light detail is mentioned once and not returned to, slightly weakening specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The Compassion (recycled ship, seventeen dead ships, salvaged panels) frames the setting and provides spatial anchors (corridor, archive, medical bay). The ship's groaning under dimensional pressure imposes a time constraint ("minutes before… collapse"). One causal involvement; closure happens beyond the ship. Moderate: the recycled-ship detail enriches atmosphere but does not constrain a middle choice or alter tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After the last human was born" establishes scarcity and urgency (Sera is the last infant, Mira the last adult). The timeframe motivates the stakes but does not impose a ticking clock that alters tactics beat-to-beat. The vessel's collapse countdown ("minutes") is a late pressure addition. Functional setup; limited middle development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The locked dimension is the story's dominant goal, established early ("push open a locked dimension") and pursued across all beats. Mira's insight (mercy, not force) and shadow-work choice directly serve this motivation. Closure—opening the portal and crossing with Sera—completes the desire with visible cost. Essential and well-dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tone (ghostly resolve) is coherent: "ghostly light of the opened dimension," "departing spirit," "unfamiliar sky," blended with steady determination ("deliberate thought," "set the child down"). Modulates subtly from archive solemnity through shadow-work intensity to the quiet, mythic ascent. Charges the final image without breaking voice. Minor: one or two beats ("strange woman floating upward") tilt slightly whimsical, creating brief tonal flutter.</comment>
