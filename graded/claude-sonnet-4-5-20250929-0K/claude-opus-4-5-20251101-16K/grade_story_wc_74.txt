<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and her nightly ritual feels embodied, but her transformation across three years remains largely told rather than dramatized. The vision of the old woman teaching the child creates a turning point, yet the leap to "this was why" feels slightly too articulated for a character mid-discovery. Embodied contradiction is present in the sleeplessness and the drive to preserve lost languages, but the final stance—acceptance of insomnia as "alright"—lacks visible cost that forecloses an option on the page. The methodical hope sustains her but doesn't evolve through pressure in this single night.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates density through the brush, the visions, and the layered backstory, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where Mira accepts her sleepless vigil as proof of kindness remembered. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The closure reweights the paintings from failed preservation to relational monument, and the cost is felt—three years of insomnia and social skepticism. One deduction: the turn ("this was why") arrives through reflection rather than a new pressure or constraint that forces realization, slightly softening the escalation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse with its tomato vines, smog-choked city, and moonlight filtering through glass panels creates a micro-setting that constrains Mira's ritual and charges the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "saffron threads dissolving in warm milk" and "grey light compete with the smog" anchor POV and mood. The brush's moon-tipped stone holds light "like water held in a cupped hand," and this tactile specificity returns when she cleans it at dawn. The setting and recurring objects constrain the daydream trigger and charge the closure, meeting the 9+ gate for this category.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving strangers remember kindness—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure accumulates through her three-year struggle, skeptical gallery owners, and few attendees, but within this single night the escalation is mild: she paints, has a vision, realizes the paintings are monuments, and continues. The vision of the old woman teaching the child tightens meaning but doesn't narrow Mira's options or force a trade-off; she was already painting and will continue. Cost is visible (insomnia, social doubt) but not newly incurred on this page. One meaningful deepening occurs when the realization reweights her work, sufficient for this length under an Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—kindness rippling outward through strangers—emerges from the platform encounter, the brush's gift, and Mira's sustained labor without didactic summary. The final image of cleaning the brush and the "saffron quiet" between night and morning offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Subtext operates in the old woman's tears, the untranslatable blessing, and the unpopulated exhibits. Minor slip: "methodically hopeful" and "proof accumulating" veer slightly toward stated thesis in the penultimate paragraph, though they remain tied to concrete action (hanging canvases). The ending avoids moralizing and lets the particulars carry weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with a distinct perceptual signature: "saffron threads dissolving in warm milk," "pale coin," "sand through fingers." Diction is controlled and purposeful, matching Mira's artist sensibility. Psychic distance modulates appropriately when recalling the platform encounter versus the present greenhouse ritual. Minor deduction: a few phrases ("methodically hopeful," "waking dream, soft and golden") nudge slightly toward over-articulation, and the clause "Not because Mira could save a language—no one person could do that—but because…" reads as helpful-narrator clarification rather than strict POV discovery. Otherwise, voice remains consistent and embodied under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is vivid and rhythmically varied: "moon hung like a pale coin," "smog-choked city below," "saffron threads dissolving in warm milk." Information density is high, and most sentences do multiple jobs. Minor loop: "methodically hopeful" appears twice in close proximity, and "someone was here, someone mattered, someone trusted" runs a parallel-stem pattern that edges toward template cadence. Slight register drift: "collective memory," "monument," and "rippled outward, unbroken" elevate diction in a way that occasionally floats above the embodied immediacy of the greenhouse setting. No clarity breaks, but figurative density in consecutive lines ("pale coin," "water held in a cupped hand," "saffron threads") without pattern-teaching nudges the score down slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of lost languages, moon-triggered daydreams, and proof-of-kindness stakes offers a specific, non-obvious angle. The rooftop greenhouse micro-setting and the calligrapher's brush anchor the concept in tactile particulars rather than abstraction. However, the emotional arc—sleepless artist preserving beauty to honor a stranger's gift—echoes familiar templates (artist-as-witness, kindness-across-time) without a sharp twist that redefines expectations. The waxing moon ritual and the three-year insomnia add texture but don't transform the core premise in hindsight. Solid originality in detail and voice, but the stakes and their resolution follow a recognizable path.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and her decision to paint, her vision, and her realization that the paintings are monuments to the old woman all drive the narrative. Setup is immediate, she paints in the middle section, and the final image shows her cleaning the brush—three gates met. However, her choices within this single night are modest: she paints as she has for three years, has a vision, and continues. The insomnia is a given condition rather than a choice with cost on this page. Causal pressure is present but the night's actions don't narrow options or introduce new trade-offs; the escalation is internal realization rather than decision-driven reversal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The brush appears in the opening ("pressed the calligrapher's moon-tipped brush into her palm"), is used mid-scene ("the brush began to rouse something different," "Mira painted faster now"), and returns in the closing line ("Mira began to clean her brush"). Its moon-tipped stone property triggers the daydreams and constrains the ritual to moonlit nights. The brush is irreplaceable—its specificity (moon-stone tip, gift from the old woman) matters to both the stakes and the closure. All three gates met, with strong causal and closure linkage. Minor cap: the brush enables rather than creates tension; Mira's agency with it is consistent rather than conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lost languages shape the paintings' content and Mira's three-year mission. Setup is clear in the second paragraph ("symbols… lost languages"), and the concept returns in the vision of the old woman teaching the child to write the spiraling characters. The ending reweights the languages from preservation project to relational monument. However, within this single night the concept doesn't narrow tactics or create friction; the languages are what she paints, not what she struggles to decode or defend. They theme the work but don't pressure the protagonist's choices on this page. Two gates (setup, closure participation) met solidly; middle development is thematic rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Methodically hopeful" is named twice and described in her sustained ritual and mounting exhibits. However, it functions primarily as a label for her endurance rather than constraining a specific on-page choice with cost. Setup is present, and the attribute colors her stance at closure ("her methodical hope made visible"), but no single beat shows the method or the hope foreclosing an alternate path or enabling a risky tactic. The trait is told and illustrated by her three-year effort, but within this night it doesn't shape a decision that alters outcome. Two gates (setup, closure mention) met; middle causal work is absent.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Rouse" appears explicitly when "the brush began to rouse something different in her daydreams," triggering the vision of the old woman and child. This vision is the major turn that leads to Mira's realization about the paintings' true purpose. Setup is immediate (the brush and moonlight rouse daydreams from the start), the middle beat delivers the new vision, and the ending reflects the reweighted meaning. However, "rouse" is close to "trigger" or "evoke"; swapping it would require only minor edits. The action is essential to the mechanics but not uniquely irreplaceable. All three gates met with solid causal linkage, but moderate swappability caps the score in the 6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The method—daydreams sparked by moonlight—is taught in the opening paragraphs: "When moonlight touched it, something shifted in Mira's mind… a kind of waking dream." Mira positions her easel to catch moonlight every month, and tonight's waxing moon triggers the vision of the old woman. The mechanics matter: without moonlight there are no daydreams, no visions, no painted symbols. All three gates met (setup, middle use, closure participation via the vision that reweights the work). Specificity is high—moonlight + brush + daydream is a unique causal chain. Minor deduction: the daydreams enable rather than constrain; Mira never struggles with their absence or their unreliability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse is established immediately and anchors the entire scene. Its glass panels let moonlight through where smog cannot reach, enabling the ritual. The tomato vines and basil "breathed around her, alive and patient" in the closing, and the smog-choked city contrasts with Mira's quiet preservation work. All three gates met. The setting pressures the stakes thematically (pollution vs. fragile cultivation) and supplies the resource (filtered moonlight) that makes the daydreams possible. However, within this single night the greenhouse doesn't force a tactical choice or block an option; it's a stable stage rather than a dynamic constraint. Strong setup and closure linkage, moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The waxing moon is named in the opening and Mira times her ritual to it: "as she did every month when the moon began its climb toward fullness." The moonlight triggers tonight's vision, and the final paragraph notes "the moon shifted past her window" before dawn arrives. Setup and closure both anchor the timeframe. However, the waxing phase doesn't create urgency or a ticking clock; Mira could paint any night the moon is visible. The time element establishes rhythm and atmosphere but doesn't narrow her decisions or escalate pressure within this single session. Two gates met (setup, closure), but the middle beat treats time as a given condition rather than a tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation—to prove strangers remember kindness—is articulated late: "To prove that strangers remember kindness. That was what Mira had been doing all along." It shapes the closure image and reweights the three-year project, but it arrives as a realization rather than a live friction in her choices tonight. Setup is indirect (the platform encounter and the paintings hint at it), and the desire clearly charges the ending. However, no on-page beat shows Mira choosing between preserving the languages and honoring the woman, or sacrificing one value for another. The want is dramatized through her actions (painting, exhibiting) but not conflicted within this night. Two gates (thematic setup, closure participation); missing direct middle-beat friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Saffron quiet" appears explicitly in the penultimate paragraph and names the tone that suffuses the piece: "in this saffron quiet, this gentle space between night and morning." The prose sustains a contemplative, warm-hued register throughout: "soft and golden as saffron threads dissolving in warm milk," "smog-choked," "pale coin," "grey light of dawn." Tone modulates subtly—calm ritual, sharper memory of the crying woman, renewed purpose when painting faster—without breaking coherence. The final image ("alive and patient," cleaning the brush) carries the saffron quiet forward and charges closure with gentle resolution. All three gates met, strong closure linkage, and tone is legible under pressure. High integration.</comment>
