<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and character-particular throughout. Her skepticism is embodied in her fieldwork choices and her mother's silence shapes her investigative drive with clear motivation. The final decision to "speak it aloud" arises from witnessing the beaded valve, though the cost (what exactly she forfeits by breaking silence) remains somewhat abstract. Internal contradiction could be sharper; her skepticism and her compulsive listening to psychic calls coexist but don't genuinely collide in a single moment of pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (Mira, tunnel, present-tense exploration). The piece follows an accumulative lens: the tunnel descent gathers weight through radio calls, memory fragments, and the valve discovery, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Mira decides to speak after thirty years of family silence, forecloses the inherited pattern of swallowing, and the beads stay as memorial. Cost is conceptual and relational (breaking family silence, risking judgment) and felt in "carrying her mother's story out." One meaningful deepening occurs when the beads click and she understands the memorial's purpose. The closure effect is legible but the felt cost could be more visceral on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tunnel is vividly rendered—rust, old water, corroded rails, industrial ribs—and sensory detail is filtered through Mira's archaeologist/skeptic lens. The beaded valve wheel constrains nothing tactically but charges the final image by reweighting her mother's silence as memorial work rather than cowardice. Spatial choreography is clear (entrance, forty-minute walk, valve room, return path). The tunnel supplies atmosphere and the valve as thematic anchor, though neither materially alters her tactics or physical choices during the descent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Mira's need to understand her mother's cryptic confession and the weight of swallowed truth. Pressure accumulates through the radio-call pattern, the tunnel descent, and discovery of the beads. One tightening: realizing the beads are a memorial shifts her interpretation from survivor guilt to commemorative act, narrowing her understanding and prompting the vow to speak. Agency is clear (she chooses to photograph, to carry the story out, to break silence), though the decision feels more thematic epiphany than a choice with immediate on-page trade-off or visible price paid in the moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme—truths have weight, swallowed things demand speech—emerges organically from the ghost shift, the beads, the radio calls, and Mira's choice to break inherited silence. The valve wheel and radio motif recur with purpose, and the final image ("the silence—that she would break") offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext operates cleanly in Mira's skeptical listening and her mother's fever confession. No thematic echo or label-speak mars the ending. The piece resists tidy resolution while making the conceptual cost (ending family silence, risking exposure) undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: terse, image-driven, with a journalist's eye and a skeptic's idiom. Psychic distance is stable (close third on Mira). Perceptual signature is strong—she "appraises" calls like artifacts, notices the valve's decorative beads as evidence. Diction remains within Mira's investigative lexicon. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. Rhythm modulates well (short declaratives during memory fragments, longer lines during the descent). The mother's direct-speech confession ("I was there and I left them") briefly shifts tense and voice forEffect, which works but creates a micro-seam.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is lean and propulsive with high information density. Sentence variety supports rhythm (fragment use, varied openings). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Occasional metaphoric density ("throat of darkness," "industrial ribs") is purposeful and doesn't muddle. One micro-slip: "drowsy alertness of a night spent hunting—too tired to be sharp, too wired to be careless" feels slightly over-explained for the established voice. Opening and closing lines anchor cleanly. Grammar and sequencing are tight throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The core synthesis—radio psychic calls as archive for unrecorded labor tragedy—feels fresh and emotionally earned. The beaded valve as worker memorial is specific and non-obvious. The mother's stroke following confession is a strong causal turn. However, the investigative-journalist-into-abandoned-place frame is well-worn, and the piece doesn't fully subvert it; the emotional arc (inherited guilt, discovery, vow to speak) follows a familiar redemptive template. Transformation is present but incremental rather than startling.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira is introduced in the opening line and her recklessness motivates the tunnel entry (setup). Her decision to crawl through the sealed entrance and her choice to photograph and carry the story out both involve her explorer identity (development, payoff). The trait is present across all three gates and drives two key beats. However, "reckless" as a character note is more label than lived friction; her actions read methodical rather than impulsive, and no on-page moment shows her risking harm or ignoring danger with visible cost tied to recklessness itself.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The beaded valve wheel appears at the climax (setup delayed to ~60% but still pre-closure). Mira touches it and the beads click (first beat), photographs it (second beat), and it anchors her understanding that her mother strung the beads as memorial, reweighting guilt as remembrance (closure linkage). The object is irreplaceable—its decorative beads distinguish it from generic industrial hardware and make the mother's agency legible. Visible cost: recognizing the beads forces Mira to accept her mother's survival choice and commits her to public testimony. Strong causal pressure and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ghost shift frames the entire investigation (setup via radio call in paragraph 5). It provides the stakes—unrecorded workers, chemical rupture, her mother's role—and constrains Mira's tactics (she searches for evidence of shifts that "didn't appear on any manifest"). The rupture death and her mother's survival are the heart of the closure realization (payoff). However, the ghost shift itself remains historical backdrop; no on-page choice hinges on understanding shift mechanics or deciding whether to expose the practice. It shapes context more than live decision.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Religiously skeptical" is stated early (paragraph 6) and colors her listening to psychic calls "for patterns" not answers (setup, development). It enables her investigative method—treating confessions as data rather than supernatural testimony. However, the trait never creates friction or cost on the page; her skepticism and her compulsive listening coexist without forcing a trade-off. No moment where doubt blocks a choice or where belief tempts her. The attribute is present and consistent but does not constrain an action with visible price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Appraise" appears three times and governs Mira's core method. She appraises each call "like an archaeologist sifting through ruins" (setup, method signal). The action underlies her pattern-recognition work and her weighing of the beaded valve's meaning (development). At closure she has appraised "the weight of those words" and chooses to speak (payoff). The verb is irreplaceable—swapping to "evaluate" or "assess" would lose the antique-dealer/archaeologist connotation that links her to material evidence. It drives her interpretive turn and constrains her to evidence-based rather than emotional reasoning. Strong causal and thematic work.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Radio psychic calls are introduced early (paragraph 5) and Mira's method—listening for patterns across callers—is explained and demonstrated with the ghost-shift caller (setup). The method shapes her investigation: three callers mentioning Harlan in six months form the map that brings her to the tunnel (development). A final caller crackles in her pocket as she exits, bracketing the descent (payoff). The means is specific and irreplaceable (no other archive exists for ghost-shift testimony). However, the calls themselves don't constrain a live choice or create friction; they provide backstory motive rather than on-page tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tunnel is present throughout (setup immediate). It supplies the valve room where discovery occurs and its sealed entrance requires Mira to pry through crumbled concrete (mild constraint, development). The dripping water, corroded rails, and "throat of darkness" charge atmosphere and the return walk frames her vow to speak (payoff). The tunnel is irreplaceable as the hidden site of the ghost shift. However, it doesn't materially alter her tactics—no navigational choice, no danger forcing a trade-off, no resource scarcity. It functions as charged setting and symbol more than active constraint on decision.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "during the hush that follows a sudden confession" governs the mother's five-years-ago deathbed moment, which is recounted in flashback. That hush (then silence, then stroke, then nothing) motivates Mira's present search but does not tighten present decisions. The current tunnel descent is unclocked and proceeds without time pressure. The story occurs after the confession rather than during its hush. The element is present thematically but does not create a live temporal constraint or escalate on-page stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Mira's motivation—to find the weight of her mother's swallowed truth—is stated clearly mid-story and demonstrated in her years of listening and tonight's descent (setup, development). It drives every choice: entering the tunnel, touching the beads, photographing evidence, vowing to speak (payoff). The weight metaphor recurs and the final image ("truths had weight... swallowed things demanded eventually to be spoken") makes the motivation's cost and fulfillment legible. Friction is present: she risks exposing her mother and herself, forecloses the family's inherited silence. Strong causal and thematic integration with visible relational cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Drowsy alertness" is named explicitly ("that drowsy alertness of a night spent hunting—too tired to be sharp, too wired to be careless") and the tone is sustained through syntax: short declaratives mixed with longer reflective passages, the radio static, the slow drip rhythm. The tone modulates subtly—sharper sensory detail in the valve room, softer reflection on the return—and charges the final vow with quiet resolve rather than triumph. Coherent and purposeful. However, the explicit naming of the tone mid-story is a small tell rather than full embodiment, and one line ("too tired... too wired") slightly over-explains the established mood.</comment>
