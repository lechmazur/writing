<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera's interiority shows complexity through her past complicity and present penance, with the confession "I was complicit once" anchoring her choices. However, Emil reads mostly as a device for Vera's revelation rather than a fully embodied presence—his trembling hands and quiet acceptance feel functional. The internal contradiction between her former bureaucratic role and current role as memory-keeper creates pressure, though the peak moment when she describes absolution as "tenuous" leans toward articulated insight rather than dramatized struggle. Embodied emotion is present but occasionally tilts into declaration ("she felt the tenuous thread of absolution strengthen").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece builds pressure through layered memory, objects, and confession, culminating in a pattern break at the evening gathering that reweights the dominant stake (absolution through witness). Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of planting winter jasmine crystallizes her stance with visible cost ("never solid, never certain, but present"). The bread functions causally to unlock Emil's grandmother's forgiveness and shifts Vera's isolation into communal remembrance, though the turn is more deepening than reversal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The guerrilla garden (rosemary, hedgerows, climbing roses) and tea house setting constrain Vera's choices—seven years of cultivation provide both camouflage and a physical manifestation of her penance. Sensory details (yeast and mineral water in the bread, wind through plants, candle flames) are filtered through Vera's noticer perspective and charge the final image. The overgrown palace courtyard transforms from tyrant's seat to sanctuary, with spatial choreography clear across the small room and exterior grounds. Environment directly enables the evening gathering and shapes the closure image of planting jasmine, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: earning absolution through witness and preservation. Pressure accumulates through Vera's confession, the bread as evidence, Emil's question "And that absolves you?", and the grandmother's forgiveness message. The tightening occurs when Vera must uncloak herself to Emil, forecloses the path of private penance, and commits to communal remembrance—a meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. Cost is present (daily re-earning, vulnerability to judgment) but more conceptual than visceral; the evening gathering signals ongoing commitment but doesn't test her with a hard choice on the page. One clear escalation point is sufficient for this length, though the cost could be more immediately felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of tenuous absolution emerges organically through the bread (sacred ordinary), guerrilla gardening (unmaking erasure), and Vera's daily penance. The piece resists easy redemption—"Nothing absolves me" and "Both responses are correct" avoid moral tidiness. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("sacred not because it was grand, but because it was ordinary") and slightly over-articulates what the images already convey. The winter jasmine image offers a resonant, non-literal answer (persistence, emergence from death) but the surrounding prose telegraphs the symbolism. Strong conceptual complexity with minor over-explication at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Vera with consistent perceptual signature ("noticer of creeping normality," "heuristically gentle"). Diction is controlled and purposeful throughout, with phrases like "sleepwalked through the alterations" and "small flames that travelers might glimpse" showing rhythmic care. Dialogue is minimal but functional, carrying subtext in Emil's "Why?" and "And that absolves you?" Free indirect style is clean. The prose occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("accumulation of small kindnesses," "ceremonies of tea and testimony") that sits at the edge of Vera's plausible lexicon but remains voice-motivated and legible throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, though the piece relies on a similar opening structure across several paragraphs ("After the birds," "The tea house itself," "Today she had"). The bread's sensory details (yeast, patience, mineral water) are specific and propulsive. No paraphrase loops or major scaffold detected. Minor register drift in peak beats: "tenuous thread of absolution strengthen" and "ceremonies of tea and testimony" edge toward abstraction in moments that would benefit from sharper concrete anchors. One template-cadence run of three "she + verb" constructions in the final section slightly flattens momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The guerrilla gardening frame and "noticer of creeping normality" offer fresh angles on memory and complicity themes. Vera's dual identity (former bureaucrat / current preserver) creates earned complexity rather than stock redemption. However, the core premise (secret keeper preserving what the regime erases) maps closely to familiar resistance narratives, and the bread-as-relic + tea house sanctuary combination follows a recognizable template. The piece transforms through specific detail (300-year-old starter, scent-confusing herbs) and Vera's particular moral calculus, elevating it above generic execution. The winter jasmine ending gestures toward originality but feels slightly anticipated given the established pattern.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vera's noticer trait is signaled early ("her burden and her gift"), drives the tea house's existence (seven years of preservation), and shapes her confession to Emil. Her observation creates the dominant stake (what to do with noticed erasures) and her choice to "uncloak" herself to every visitor constrains her present action. The trait appears in the closure image ("noticers, the rememberers") and the final planting decision. Two clear beats (confession, evening gathering invitation) plus closure linkage with visible cost (vulnerability to judgment).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The bread appears in three beats: retrieval from floorboards, Vera's explanation of its provenance (300-year-old starter, vanished baker), and Emil breaking it in his palm. It unlocks the grandmother's forgiveness message, serves as physical proof of erasure, and returns in the shared breaking at evening's gathering. The bread's sensory specifics (yeast, mineral water, crumbling texture) and its role as "sacred relics" directly shape the closure frame of ordinary sacredness. Removing it would collapse the story's central proof of preservation and the communion structure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tenuous absolution frames Vera's stake from her confession through the final paragraph. It constrains her daily practice ("must be earned again each morning"), drives her choice to uncloak herself, and lands explicitly in the closure beat ("tenuous thread of absolution strengthen—never solid, never certain, but present"). The concept shapes both her past complicity and present penance, altering her tactics (daily witness vs. one-time redemption). Cost is visible in her vulnerability and the grandmother's mixed judgment. However, the term "absolution" itself is invoked directly rather than purely embodied, trending toward thematic echo in places.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Heuristically gentle appears once as a descriptor ("what others called her heuristically gentle manner") and informs Vera's patient approach with Emil ("warm in its patience, feeling her way toward understanding"). The trait enables her confession strategy (gradual rather than blunt) but doesn't create on-page friction or visible tradeoff. It's consistent with her actions (pouring tea, measured explanation) but remains more label than dramatized constraint. Present in two beats (Emil's arrival, evening invitation) but the specific cost of gentleness vs. directness never materializes as a choice point.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Uncloaking (Vera's confession "I worked in the bureau") is the story's inciting disclosure and redefines her relationship with Emil from secret-keeper to confessed complicit. It drives Emil's challenge ("And that absolves you?") and sets up the grandmother's forgiveness message. The action appears again in Vera's stated practice ("I uncloak myself to every visitor") and shapes the evening gathering structure. However, the specific confession scene feels compressed—one paragraph does heavy lifting—and the act could be replaced with a different vulnerability reveal (showing documents, naming names) without fundamental restructure. Two beats, closure-relevant, but not fully indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Guerrilla gardening is signaled early (climbing roses, "without permission"), detailed in the second paragraph (herbs confusing dogs, hedgerows swallowing sound), and returns in the closure action (planting winter jasmine). The method enables the tea house's seven-year survival, provides camouflage from authorities, and embodies Vera's daily penance. It constrains her space use (must work covertly, transform neglect into cover) and charges the final image ("gentle gardeners of truth who worked without permission"). Three distinct beats with clear causal pressure and irreplaceability—the tea house's existence depends on this exact method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tea house appears in four beats: Vera's arrival and unlocking, physical description (salvaged wood, stolen windows, beneath colonnade), Emil's visit within it, and the evening gathering with candles. The setting enables the preservation work, constrains access (hidden by roses), and supplies the closure frame (small flames visible through growth). Spatial details (floorboards hiding bread, windows from the palace, single room) shape action. The overgrown courtyard provides both protection and symbolic weight. Removing this exact setting (vs. generic safe house) would lose the guerrilla gardening integration and palace transformation arc.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the birds flew south" appears in the opening and returns once as background in "The birds had flown south, but some stubborn creatures remained." It sets seasonal atmosphere (autumn/winter threshold, fallen leaves, coming jasmine) but doesn't create urgency or alter tactics. No clock tightens decisions; the seven-year backstory and "that year" are static anchors. The jasmine's February timing gestures toward future patience but doesn't pressure the present choice. Present in setup and closure image but functions more as mood than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Finding the sacred in the ordinary is named as Vera's penance ("became my penance") and drives her preservation choices (bread, tea, company). It shapes her explanation to Emil, her daily practice, and lands explicitly in the closure paragraph ("sacred not because it was grand, but because it was ordinary"). The motivation is dramatized through her handling of the bread and the planting decision, with visible cost (vulnerability, daily labor). However, the phrase itself is stated rather than purely shown, and the final paragraph over-explains what prior images conveyed. Three beats with closure charge, though the articulation trends toward told motivation.</comment>
