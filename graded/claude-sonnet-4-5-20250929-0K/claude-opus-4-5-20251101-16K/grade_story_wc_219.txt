<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera's interiority remains coherent—the luminous skeptic stance drives her research frame and the fly amber anchors her shift from measurement to meaning. The final renunciation ("the chemistry is just the shadow") forecloses her scientific reduction with visible cost. However, the three convergent strangers lack individuated choice; they serve as mirrors rather than pressuring Vera's stance, and the child's dream feels ornamental. The descent to join others reads as decision, though the stakes of that joining remain abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The structure layers footprints, amber, and convergence toward a Conceptual Repricing—Vera's recognition that "the need comes first" reweights her scientific project. Cost is legible: she abandons quantification and descends to join rather than measure. The midpoint turn (realizing the pilgrimage "ceased to be artificial") deepens the stake cleanly. One structural weakness: the astronaut, linguist, and child appear without earned motivation, relying on coincidence to complicate rather than Vera's choices to tighten.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rainwashed tower, overgrown path, and spring setting provide coherent spatial grounding. The dusty footprints constrain Vera's interpretation (she expected solitary protocol, finds convergence) and the tower's edge supplies the vantage for the final image of others approaching. The fly amber functions as micro-setting, charging both the grandmother's memory and the ending's "suspended yearning." Bronze quiet modulates atmosphere without becoming static. Minor: the sculpture path's specifics remain generic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake clearly signaled: understanding why humans return versus Visitors' detachment. The tightening occurs when Vera realizes others have joined her "artificial" protocol, forcing her to abandon the chemistry hypothesis. The descent to join carries opportunity cost—she relinquishes observer distance. Escalation under Accumulative lens succeeds through footprint layering and convergence density. Weakness: the astronaut/linguist/child offer no resistance; their presence complicates situation but Vera's stance shift feels contemplative rather than forced by visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—attachment to place versus detachment, suspended yearning versus forward motion—emerges through the fly amber's iterative reweighting and the convergence pattern rather than statement. The grandmother's line is repurposed non-literally at closure ("beautiful because it would never arrive"). The Visitors supply thematic contrast without becoming allegory. Minor debt: "luminous skeptic" and the final "finally home" edge toward articulating the thesis directly. The piece resists moralizing but the astronaut's line "You're studying homecoming" risks summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single POV held cleanly; Vera's perceptual signature (scientist cataloging, then renouncing measurement) remains consistent. Diction is controlled: "bronze quiet," "rainwashed," "teardrop of golden resin" create a coherent aesthetic register. Dialogue is minimal and functional. Weaknesses: filter verbs stack in reflective passages ("she understood," "she thought," "Vera watched") without voice motivation, and the astronaut's "not asking" construction plus the linguist's prompt-like question feel slightly mechanical. The final "finally home" risks soft epiphany phrasing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high but mostly controlled: "bronze quiet," "luminous skeptic," "suspended in something beautiful." However, overwriting clusters appear: "darkened to the color of old iron" and "teardrop of golden resin" in early setup, then "compound eyes that had last perceived Oligocene forests" mid-reflection stacks metaphor without pressure payoff. Paraphrase loop: "the chemistry is just the shadow" and "Not the destination, but the turning back. Not the place, but the ache for it" restate the same realization. Template cadence in reflection ("She thought about... She thought about..."). These artifacts touch the closure zone, preventing higher band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The fly amber as suspended yearning offers a specific synthesis of homecoming neuroscience and pilgrimage ritual. The Visitors' detachment versus human attachment provides non-obvious contrast. However, the core frame—scientist measures emotion, discovers science can't capture meaning—is a recognizable template. The convergence of strangers (astronaut, linguist, child archetypes) feels assembled rather than inevitable. The transformation is legible but the arc's safety (Vera abandons measurement, finds community) avoids the bold moral calculus that would elevate originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Vera as "luminous skeptic" drives the research protocol setup, the measurement-versus-meaning turn at the tower, and the final descent to join. Her academic rebellion motivates the solitary pilgrimage premise. Present in setup (Institute reputation), middle (realizes others joined), and payoff (descends, renounces chemistry frame). However, her choices feel contemplative rather than forced by visible cost; the shift is epiphany more than decision under pressure. Two beats (tower realization, descent) and closure linkage earn mid-high band, but swappability (another scientist-doubter) and modest causal pressure limit score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fly amber appears in setup (grandmother's gift, pocket), midpoint (withdrawn to show the three), and ending (warm against palm, "finally home"). Meaning evolves: sentiment dismissed → specimens under scientific gaze → suspended yearning that defines homecoming. It charges the closure image and supplies the metaphor for the Visitors' misunderstanding. Three distinct beats, closure linkage strong, cost connection (abandoning measurement framework). High irreplaceability: the 40-million-year suspension directly mirrors the thematic question. Swappability test nearly passed but another preserved-thing could serve with edits, preventing top band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Artificial pilgrimage frames Vera's research protocol (setup), the realization it "ceased to be artificial" (midpoint turn), and the convergence at tower (ending image). It shapes the dominant stake and supplies the conceptual price (authentic versus constructed return). However, the mechanics remain abstract—what made it "artificial" and why others joined is told rather than dramatized through choices. Present across all three gates, one clear turn (artificial → authentic), but causal pressure is modest; the concept operates more as theme container than tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Academically rebellious" appears as label in setup (argues Visitors' gift less transformative) but never constrains an on-page choice. The tower walk and research protocol could proceed identically without this trait. It colors backstory exposition but does not enable or block tactics. Setup gate met (Institute reference), but missing middle development and closure participation. Label-only use, no visible cost tied to rebellion, high swappability (another descriptor could replace it).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Convergence structures the entire plot: dusty footprints signal it (setup), three strangers meet unexpectedly (midpoint complication), more approach at ending (payoff image). The realization that pilgrimage became authentic depends on this convergence. However, the action itself is passive for Vera—she observes rather than causes it. Others converge *at* her, not because of her tactical choice. Present in all gates, two distinct beats (tower meeting, new arrivals), closure linkage clear, but agency gap and moderate swappability (another group action) limit score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Dusty footprints appear early (setup: "footprints not her own," "many someones"), supply the clue that others joined (midpoint inference), and are visible again at ending ("new ones layering over old"). They enable Vera's key recognition (artificial → authentic shift). Two beats, setup and closure present, but middle development weak—the footprints are observed, not used tactically. Lyric reprise (early signal → final layering) reweights the solitary-research premise. Swappability moderate (another trail sign could serve). Early signal, closure linkage, and reprise earn mid-band; lack of middle causal pressure and modest irreplaceability prevent higher.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rainwashed tower in spring anchors all action: Vera climbs it (setup), meets others at top chamber (midpoint), views convergence from its edge (ending vantage). The tower's "bronze quiet" reinforces tone and the overgrown path signals neglect that mirrors the research question. The spiral descent at closure enacts the homecoming physically. Setting present in all gates, constrains spatial staging, and charges final image. However, spring and rainwashed function atmospherically without altering tactics; the tower could be another structure. Strong closure linkage and three-beat presence, but swappability and modest tactical constraint limit score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Three years after making first contact" anchors backstory and motivates the Visitors comparison, but the timeframe does not tighten present-scene pressure. Vera's walk occurs "early morning" with no urgency or deadline. The element provides context (others mapped wormholes "while" Vera walked) but does not alter tactics or narrow options on the page. Setup present (first contact reference), but missing middle development and closure participation. Functional context, no causal pressure, high swappability.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Understanding homecoming's chemistry drives Vera's protocol (setup: measuring cortisol/oxytocin), her carried measurements (middle reflection on neurotransmitter charts), and her final renunciation ("the chemistry is just the shadow"). The motivation structures her arc and supplies the conceptual cost at closure—abandoning the scientific frame she came to prove. Present in all gates, two beats (research method, abandonment), closure linkage strong, visible cost (foreclosing quantification approach). Irreplaceability solid but another reductive science question could substitute with edits, preventing top band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Bronze quiet" appears in opening line ("bronze quiet of early morning"), recurs at the astronaut's voice ("same bronze quiet as the morning"), and returns in the ending ("bronze quiet of towers where something essential waited"). Tone modulates from solitary observation to shared convergence without breaking coherence. It charges the final image and reinforces the suspended-time quality that mirrors the fly amber. Three beats, setup and closure present, lyric reprise reweights atmosphere. However, tone itself does not constrain choice; it colors rather than pressures. Strong resonance and closure linkage earn mid-high band; lack of tactical constraint prevents 8+.</comment>
