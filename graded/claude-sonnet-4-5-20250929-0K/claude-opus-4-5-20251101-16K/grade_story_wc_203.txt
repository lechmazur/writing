<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marcus's occupation and ghost-seeing ability are established early, and his patient engagement with the dead reads as character-particular. His final choice to remove the mainspring is motivated and forecloses Victor's vigil with visible cost. Internal contradiction is present but light: his acceptance of the gift/burden is asserted more than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The ghost woman's exposition replaces some of the embodied discovery that would deepen Marcus's agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative accent (the dust-reading and ceiling motif accumulate, but the mainspring discovery drives the closure). Orientation anchors cleanly by the first paragraph. The closure—Marcus removing the object and feeling Victor's vigil lift—lands on the page as a Decisive Change with felt cost (the decades-long haunting ends). One tightening: the ghost's directive narrows Marcus's options from assessment to moral action. Cost is legible in the final image of weightlessness and the shift from repair to unburdening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office is vivid and purposeful: boarded clown faces, cracked plaster revealing lath, water-stained ceiling tiles. The dropped ceiling constrains Marcus's search and the dust patterns guide his discovery. The spatial choreography (ladder, panel seventeen, elevator shaft) is coherent. The mainspring barrel—a small object functioning as micro-setting—charges the final image and constrains the ending choice. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Marcus's professional lens.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: discovering what ceilings hide, escalated to freeing the trapped dead. The ghost's directive creates one meaningful tightening that narrows Marcus's options from repair work to moral action. The resolution is earned by his choice to remove the object, with visible cost: Victor's vigil lifts and Marcus carries the burden outward. Pressure coheres under the causal lens. Agency is decision-based (removing the object) but the ghost's exposition does some of the work that Marcus's struggle might have dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the premise: secrets hidden above, guilt as weight, repair as unburdening. The mainspring barrel and "cracks in the façade" motif recur with shifted meaning at closure. The final image—"Some people fixed machines. Marcus fixed what machines couldn't touch"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in Marcus's patient engagement and the ghost's exhaustion. The piece resists tidy resolution: the circus fire's lie remains, but one man is freed. One brief thematic phrase ("the real job was always…") verges on summary but is earned by prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-person limited with controlled psychic distance. Marcus's perceptual signature is distinct: reading dust, studying debris, engaging pulleys as metaphor. Diction remains character-consistent (technician's precision, patient observation). The ghost's dialogue feels natural and goal-driven. One brief register lift ("this weightless burden of seeing the dead") reads voice-motivated and coherent. No head-hopping; narrative stance modulates purposefully from diagnostic observation to moral reflection at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean and propulsive with high information density. Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Figurative language is purposeful: "steel coffin," "skeleton that held up the smile," "trapped insects." The opening hooks with occupation and ability; the closing image recharges the weightless-burden motif. One minor scaffold phrase: "The real job was always what the ceilings hid" slightly over-explains. Otherwise, zero loops, strong verbs, and clear sequencing throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ghost-seeing technician premise is familiar but executed with specificity: dust patterns, horologist's mainspring, circus fire backstory. The combination of occupational detail (elevator repair) and moral unburdening feels earned rather than gimmicky. The mainspring as hidden evidence and the "cracks in the façade" motif are purposeful, not ornamental. Transformation test passes: swap names and the arc weakens. One point of derivative pressure: the ghost-as-exposition device follows a well-worn template, though the occupational lens freshens it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus (elevator repair technician who sees ghosts) appears in paragraph one, constrains his approach (patience, respect for mechanisms), and drives the closure choice (removing the mainspring to free Victor). His dual ability shapes two beats: dust analysis and ghost engagement. The final action—pocketing the object and feeling Victor's vigil lift—is causally tied to his character. Cost: he carries the burden outward, embodying his role. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The horologist's mainspring barrel is introduced mid-story (panel seventeen discovery), handled on the page (Marcus turns it, pockets it), and shapes the closure (removing it frees Victor). It appears in three beats: discovery, ghost's exposition, and final action. The object's specific history (stolen, fire-starter) and its horological function (storing energy, measured release) charge its meaning. Specificity and closure linkage are strong. Late arrival (~50% mark) and slight swappability (any hidden treasure could work with edits) prevent higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Cracks in the façade" is seeded early (paragraph three: cracks in plaster reveal lath, "the skeleton that held up the smile") and reprised at closure ("The cracks in the facade ran deeper than plaster"). It reweights the circus's painted lies and shapes Marcus's understanding. Lyric resonance is clear, but the concept does not constrain a middle choice or alter tactics—it operates as thematic frame rather than plot pressure. Two-gate lyric reprise (setup and payoff) with thematic depth, but limited causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Skillfully observant" is dramatized in paragraph five (Marcus studies dust accumulation patterns, reads stories in debris) and enables the discovery of the mainspring. The trait shapes one key beat: without his observational skill, the rectangular outline and finger marks would go unnoticed. It does not constrain a later choice or create visible cost, but it is essential to the middle turn. Early signal, one causal beat, and specificity (decades of reading debris) elevate it above label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Engage" is dramatized in paragraph six (Marcus speaks to the ghost, asks where to look) and again at closure (he acts on her directive, removes the mainspring). The action shapes two beats: the ghost conversation that narrows his task and the final unburdening. It is character-specific (patience, respect for mechanisms) and drives the resolution. Removing "engage" would flatten Marcus's agency into passive observation. Strong causal linkage and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Analyzing dust accumulation patterns" appears in paragraph five (Marcus crouches, studies the clean rectangular outline) and is mentioned again in paragraph nine (recent disturbance, finger marks). The method enables the mainspring discovery and is signaled as a professional skill. It shapes one key beat but does not constrain the ending or force a trade-off. Present in two beats with causal work, but swappable (visual observation of any kind could serve). Solid middle integration without indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office is anchored in paragraph two and pressures Marcus throughout: boarded clown faces, cracked plaster, dropped ceiling tiles, the frozen freight elevator. The setting provides the puzzle (panel seventeen, ceiling access) and the spatial constraint (ladder, shaft darkness). It supplies the historical backstory (fire, eleven dead) that charges the moral stakes. The setting's decay and concealment motifs shape the closure image. Strong causal pressure, early signal, and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"When the overhead fluorescent buzz dies off" appears in paragraph four and triggers Marcus's first ghost sighting. The timeframe creates one atmospheric beat (silence before vision) but does not tighten decisions or track as a live clock. The buzz returns in paragraph eleven ("fluorescents flickered back to life") as the ghost fades, creating a light/dark rhythm. Lyric reprise with atmospheric charge, but no tactical constraint or pressure escalation. Two-touch pattern without causal urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To discover what ceilings hide" is dramatized early (Marcus studies the spaces above people's heads, assesses the elevator, follows the ghost's gaze upward) and drives the closure (he finds the hidden mainspring and removes it). The motivation shapes three beats: professional assessment, dust analysis, and moral action. Cost is visible: he shifts from repair work to unburdening the dead. The desire is character-particular and conflicted (burden as gift). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Weightless burden" is introduced in paragraph six ("this weightless burden of seeing the dead… present without painful") and charged at closure ("the weight of Victor's decades-long vigil begin to lift—weightless now, truly weightless" and "The burden he carried felt lighter than ever—present but not pressing"). The tone modulates from acceptance to release, supporting the thematic arc. It coheres through turns and charges the final image. Strong lyric reprise and tonal consistency, though the concept risks over-articulation in the closing lines.</comment>
