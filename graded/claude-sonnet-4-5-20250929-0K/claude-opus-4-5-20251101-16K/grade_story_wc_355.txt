<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera's interiority is specific and technically grounded, but her emotional arc—grief, hesitation, then sudden forgiveness—resolves too smoothly without visible internal contradiction acting in scene. The moment she decides "some silences… were meant to be felt, held, and finally released" arrives as epiphany rather than earned struggle; no micro-choice shows her wrestling between cataloging and letting go. The mother remains a construct of frequencies rather than a dramatized presence that creates embodied pressure on Vera's present actions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece orients quickly (workshop, skylight, locked diary) and closure lands on the page: Vera shifts from scientific cataloging to emotional release, tucking the unread diary into her jacket. Cost is legible—she abandons her life's analytical framework—and the lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with a cadence shift at the ending. However, the reversal from "work to do" to "some silences… not meant to be cataloged" is announced rather than motivated by a prior on-page complication; the frequencies deliver understanding without resistance, flattening causal pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The workshop (oscilloscopes, copper coils, glass tubes, skylight) is vividly anchored and the spatial choreography is clear. The locked diary clasp returns with reweighted meaning at closure, charging the final image. Sensory detail (hum, shadows, firework light) is selective and purposeful. However, the frequencies themselves remain abstract; the machinery never constrains a choice or imposes a tactical cost—Vera tunes, receives, and catalogues without friction from the tools or environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding her mother's silences—is signaled early and narrows to an emotional reckoning. Yet escalation is minimal: the frequencies deliver regret, hesitation, and abandonment in sequence without Vera encountering resistance, misreading a signal, or facing a cost mid-process that alters her tactics. The decision to stop cataloging and embrace the unread diary is framed as insight rather than a forced trade-off. One meaningful deepening occurs (recognizing the clasp as shame, not spite), but the protagonist's agency does not drive a visible price on the page before closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and action: locked secrets, cataloged silences, and the shift from analysis to acceptance. The final image—diary tucked close, still locked—resonates without moralizing, and "the path to empathy… was about loving anyway" grows from prior particulars. The piece avoids thematic echo until the penultimate paragraph; "some silences… were meant to be felt" skirts therapeutic phrasing but remains anchored in Vera's specific journey. Subtext operates cleanly in the frequencies and the locked clasp.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Vera notices frequencies, hesitation, and emotional resonance through her technical lens. Diction remains character-consistent ("Silence forty-seven: the pause after a door closes"). However, "theatrical sincerity she could not suppress" is a puzzling register break—who judges her sincerity as theatrical, and why does she suppress it?—and the final paragraph's elevated phrasing ("something she could never have measured") smooths out urgency. Dialogue is absent. Purposeful compression in the frequency cataloging works well.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is clear and propulsive with strong rhythm variation and specific imagery. Sentence openings vary; information density is high. Minor scaffold appears: "The workshop lay… Shadows pooled…" uses passive constructions back-to-back, and "She was an eclectic pacifist" opens a paragraph with weak linkage. "Theatrical sincerity she could not suppress" is overwrought and unclear. The frequency catalog risks repetition but stays concise. No loops or significant artifacts touch the closure beat, and figurative language (shadows, stars as witnesses) remains controlled.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—recovering emotional frequencies from objects—is fresh and specifically executed through oscilloscopes, antennas, and cataloged silence types. The locked diary that cannot be opened but can be "read" via resonance offers a non-obvious synthesis. However, the emotional arc (estranged daughter finds peace with deceased mother) follows a familiar template, and the resolution—forgiveness through indirect understanding—does not transform the trope with an unexpected moral calculus or structural risk. The piece commits fully to its conceit but opts for safe closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Vera is present throughout and her pacifism is stated ("violence began where listening ended"), but the trait does not constrain an on-page choice. She catalogues without resistance, then releases the project—no moment shows her pacifism forcing a tactical cost or enabling a key turn. The label appears early but remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The locked diary clasp is handled in three beats: introduced with backstory (resisted lockpicks, saw), tuned for frequencies mid-scene, and tucked into her jacket at closure with reweighted meaning (shame, not spite). Its locked state shapes Vera's method and charges the final image. Removing it would collapse the central metaphor and closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"The path to empathy" is named in paragraph three and again at closure ("The path to empathy… was not about understanding everything"). It frames Vera's goal and the final realization, but on-page action (tuning, cataloging, deciding to stop) does not dramatize conflicting routes or costs between empathy and analysis. The concept shapes theme more than tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Intuitively descriptive" appears once ("letting herself become intuitively descriptive of what she sensed") as a method label during the frequency tuning. It describes her reception style but does not constrain a choice or create visible cost. The trait could be replaced with "receptive" or "interpretive" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Recover" drives the middle action: Vera tunes frequencies to recover emotional resonance from the diary. The act shapes two beats (adjusting the antenna, documenting silences) and enables her understanding of the mother's shame. However, recovery succeeds without complication; swapping "recover" for "read" or "sense" would require only minor edits, as the mechanics are not causally tested.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Tuning frequencies" is signaled early (antenna, receiver, oscilloscopes) and used in two beats: the initial tuning and the deeper pass that reveals the silence between stubborn people. The method enables discovery and distinguishes Vera's approach from reading the diary. However, the tuning never fails or imposes a cost; it delivers silences on demand without friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The "shadowed workshop under stars" is anchored in paragraph two and returns at closure ("to the watching stars"). The skylight floods the space with firework light at the turn. The setting provides atmosphere and a frame for solitude, but does not constrain a choice—Vera could perform the same tuning in any enclosed space. The stars and shadows charge the final image lyrically but do not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"In the final stillness before fireworks ignite" is named in paragraph two and paid off when the first firework screams upward, breaking stillness. The timeframe creates urgency framing but does not tighten on-page decisions—Vera completes her tuning at her own pace, and the fireworks arrive as atmospheric punctuation rather than a forcing clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"To catalog the varieties of silence" is stated early and demonstrated through spoken documentation ("Silence forty-seven…"). Vera's cataloging shapes two beats and her decision to stop cataloging ("some silences… were not meant to be cataloged") drives closure. However, no on-page friction shows cataloging in conflict with another want; the shift from analysis to release is insight rather than forced choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Theatrical sincerity" is named once in a puzzling aside ("her voice cracking with theatrical sincerity she could not suppress"). The phrase suggests self-awareness or irony but does not modulate across beats or shape tone coherently. The prose otherwise maintains earnest lyricism without tonal shift under pressure. The label feels applied rather than embodied.</comment>
