<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and her actions driven by grief and the entanglement premise, but her interior landscape leans heavily on abstraction ("fragments of moments," "braided together like light through a prism") rather than embodied contradiction. The ritual drumming shows agency, but the peak choice—continuing despite knowing "he could never return"—arrives without visible cost beyond bleeding palms. The "quietly rebellious" label is told in the facility's file rather than dramatized through micro-choices that foreclose options. Internal conflict is asserted more than enacted in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Mira commits to return "tomorrow night," crystallizing her stance with the cost of ongoing physical pain and social defiance legible on the page. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—density builds through layered sensory description and the drumming ritual deepens until Jonah's form appears, reweighting the stake from retrieval to communion. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the lagoon erupts and Jonah materializes, narrowing her options to acceptance of fragmented contact. Cost is visible in bleeding palms and the phrase "simultaneously full and shattered."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is vividly realized through selective, purposeful detail: "crystalline structures that sang," "meditation pools that converted whispers into visible spirals," and the auric lagoon that reflects "the resonance of consciousness itself." Sensory hierarchy reflects Mira's urgent focus on sound and light. The lagoon constrains her ritual by providing the medium through which Jonah can manifest, and the obsidian stone becomes her performative anchor. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from entry through the garden to the lagoon's edge. The environment charges the final image by holding "its breath like it understood," making the setting an active participant in closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—sustaining contact with Jonah across death—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure tightens when Mira drums "desperate now" and the lagoon erupts, forcing her to confront the truth that "he could never return to the world of solid things." Her agency drives the turn: she chooses to continue the painful ritual despite this realization, forecloses the hope of full resurrection, and commits to repeated fragmented communion. The cost is legible in bleeding palms and the phrase "simultaneously full and shattered." One meaningful deepening occurs under the Accumulative lens when recognition transforms want into acceptance with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—love persisting across the unbridgeable divide—emerges from concrete action (the drumming ritual) and image (Jonah's form composed of sound waves) rather than statement. The auric lagoon and entangled memories motif accumulate meaning and reweight at closure when Mira accepts fragmented communion as sufficient. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: she becomes "the keeper of their entangled memories, the drummer who called the dead to dance," with visible cost in her bleeding hands and shattered heart. No thematic echo or moralizing; the final "she would return" carries earned conviction. Subtext operates in the facility's label "quietly rebellious" contrasted with Mira's actual devotion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Mira's perception throughout. Perceptual signature is consistent: she filters the garden through synesthetic sound-to-color mappings ("violet waves," "streaks of silver"). Diction mostly fits her scientific background and grief state, though occasional phrases veer elevated ("hush of the universe inhaling," "auroral sorrow of almost-touching") in ways that feel authorial rather than character-specific. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the drumming crescendo. The brief dialogue with Jonah reads naturally and his single line "Mira" carries weight. No head-hopping. Syntax reflects mounting urgency through shortened fragments during the climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but overwriting clusters in descriptive passages: "that impossible pool of liquid gold that reflected not the sky above but something deeper—some said it showed the resonance of consciousness itself" stacks modifiers without adding pressure. Mixed metaphor in "frequencies layered upon frequencies, colors bleeding into colors" works, but "his smile a frequency she recognized from the inside out" strains coherence. Template cadence appears in "First her palms... Then her fingertips... She tapped" but serves the ritual's structure. Stock phrases: "tears streamed down her face," "heart simultaneously full and shattered." No loops or major artifacts touching closure. Clarity and propulsion remain strong through peak beats despite figurative density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The core premise—experimental neural entanglement allowing post-death contact through synesthetic ritual—offers a fresh synthesis of SF and grief narrative. The sound wave garden as manifestation space is vividly specific and not generic. However, the "Subject 7" framing, failed medical trial, and "quietly rebellious patient" template echo familiar tropes without full transformation. The drumming ritual and auric lagoon provide memorable particulars, and the resolution (accepting fragmented communion rather than retrieval) avoids easy consolation. Emotional specificity in the ending elevates execution, but the experimental-facility setup and "entangled memories" concept feel derivative of neural-link SF conventions without bold reinvention.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira as "Subject 7, the experimental treatment guinea pig" is established in the opening line and her identity as trial participant frames her unauthorized visits. The trait enables her tactical knowledge of the facility and grounds her belief in the entanglement. She makes the key choice to continue drumming despite recognizing Jonah "could never return," which alters her stance from retrieval to acceptance. Present in setup, middle (drives the drumming scene), and closure (commits to return). However, the "guinea pig" framing itself is passive; her active rebellious visits do more causal work than the experimental-subject label.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The auric lagoon appears in setup ("that impossible pool of liquid gold"), is actively used in the middle when Mira drums and it responds with erupting light, and provides the medium through which Jonah materializes at closure. Handled in multiple beats: she perches beside it, drums to make it glow, and watches his form shimmer above it. The lagoon's final act—holding Jonah's smile "across the surface"—charges the ending image. Its specific property (reflecting consciousness rather than sky) constrains the ritual's mechanism and is irreplaceable. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Entangled memories" is signaled early ("somewhere in the tangle of neurons they'd woven between them, his memories still pulsed"), shapes Mira's stake (she can feel fragments "she'd never lived"), and enables the ritual's logic. The concept constrains her tactics: she must use the drumming method because their neural link responds to rhythm. At closure, the entanglement justifies his continued presence as sound-wave form and her role as "keeper of their entangled memories." The concept drives multiple beats and is indispensable to the ending's mechanism, though its scientific grounding remains asserted more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Quietly rebellious" is introduced via the facility's file note ("Patient continues unauthorized visits") and mentioned again at the end. It explains her repeated returns to the garden but does not constrain a specific on-page choice with visible cost. The trait is told rather than shown through micro-decisions; her rebellion is backdrop rather than active pressure. Present in setup and final paragraph, but absent from middle development where her actions stem more from grief and hope than calculated defiance. The label reads ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Perch" is introduced early ("chose to perch on the obsidian stone at its edge") and provides the physical anchor for the drumming ritual. She performs the entire sequence from this position, and the action is referenced again at closure when she "climbed down from her perch." The perching choice is swappable—sitting or kneeling would serve the same function—but it does establish stable spatial choreography across beats. Present in setup, middle activity, and departure frame. Functional but not irreplaceable; the obsidian stone itself does more causal work than the verb "perch."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Drumming on everything" is signaled as "her ritual, the only method that ever brought him close," then enacted in detail: palms on stone, fingertips on crystalline outcropping, tapping chest/knees/log. The method's mechanics matter—different surfaces produce different frequencies that layer to summon Jonah. She drums "harder, desperate now" at the turn, and continues "anyway, her palms bleeding" at closure despite recognizing the cost. The drumming is indispensable: removing it would collapse the story's causal logic. Strong beat involvement, causal pressure, and closure linkage. She becomes "the drummer who called the dead to dance."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is established early with vivid specifics (footsteps ripple in amber frequencies, crystalline structures sing, meditation pools convert whispers to spirals) and supplies the mechanism for Jonah's manifestation. The environment actively responds to Mira's drumming: "The sound wave garden responded. Frequencies layered upon frequencies." At closure, the garden "quieted around her, holding its breath like it understood," charging the final image. The setting constrains the ritual's location and enables the synesthetic logic. Irreplaceable—no generic location would sustain this story's mechanics. Present across all beats with escalating involvement.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"At the hush of the universe inhaling—that suspended moment between heartbeats when the stars seemed to lean closer and time forgot its forward march" is introduced as the arrival timeframe and reprised at the end ("when the universe inhaled again, she would return"). The poetic framing sets tone but does not tighten decisions or impose a live clock. The ritual's duration is vague; no countdown or time pressure shapes tactics. Present in setup and final promise but absent from middle development. The phrase is swappable with "nightfall" or "starlight" without structural loss. Lyric ornament more than causal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to breathe life into a shared dream" is stated explicitly during the drumming crescendo ("her motivation thrumming through every strike") and referenced earlier in dialogue ("We dreamed the same dream, remember?"). It drives her repeated visits and the ritual itself. The friction emerges when she realizes she cannot fully restore him but continues anyway, accepting fragmented communion over abandonment. The cost—bleeding palms, "simultaneously full and shattered"—is visible. Present in setup (the dream of a house on a cliff), middle action, and closure commitment. The phrase "breathe life" reads slightly generic, but the dream-house detail adds specificity.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Auroral sorrow" is embodied throughout: the sound garden's shifting colors (violet, silver, gold), Mira's tears "catching the auroral light," and the bittersweet recognition that communion is possible but incomplete. Tone modulates appropriately—wonder during Jonah's appearance, anguish at "what could never be restored," quiet resolve at closure. The final image charges this tone: "simultaneously full and shattered," "the sound wave garden quieted around her, holding its breath." Coherent across turns without flattening into static mood. The phrase "auroral sorrow" itself is used once, but the texture permeates description and emotional register. Strong closure linkage.</comment>
