<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is anchored in concrete grief (mother's bones, bracelet, lost lullaby) and her contradiction between survival instinct and retrieval compulsion is dramatized through the oxygen gauge pressure. The moment she "forced herself still" and chose understanding over flight shows embodied internal conflict. Minor deduction: the epiphany about "witnessing the ephemeral" reads slightly over-articulated for a character under 6-minute oxygen debt, though it's brief and tied to the vial's sensory flood. The final choice to ascend with the vial is earned by prior causality and forecloses the path of joining her mother's bones.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Earned Stasis with visible cost: Mira retrieves the memory-vial knowing her mother's body still breathes but "no longer possessed" the voice, making the lullaby a temporary presence rather than restoration—"presence would be enough" explicitly names the compromise. Causal lens holds: distress signal → descent → discovery of mother's skeleton → vial retrieval → ascent toward rescue. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) are clear by the opening beat. One meaningful tightening occurs when the oxygen gauge drops from amber to red to six minutes, narrowing options and forcing the choice to retrieve or flee. Cost is legible in the final image: the vial holds "everything that mattered and nothing that could last."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The underwater temple setting constrains every choice through the oxygen gauge (twelve → nine → six minutes) and spatial geometry (broken dome, inner sanctum, mosaic floor). The vial itself—small, crystal, warm despite cold—functions as micro-setting and charges the final image by transforming from object to vessel of ephemeral presence. Sensory selection is purposeful: bioluminescent kelp, barnacles "like scattered jewels," the "gathered hush" that "pressed against her ears" all filter through Mira's diver perception. Minor slip: "lonesome splendor" appears twice as descriptor rather than constraint, slightly decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (retrieve mother's memory-vial before oxygen runs out) is signaled in the opening and tightens through three oxygen-gauge drops that narrow options. Agency is clear: Mira's decision to "force herself still" and "understand" rather than flee, then to grasp the vial and ascend, forecloses the path of immediate escape and the path of staying with her mother's bones. The discovered skeleton introduces a micro-turn (her mother died reaching for the same vial) that deepens rather than reverses the stake. Visible cost at closure: the vial offers only temporary presence, not restoration, and her mother's body "still breathed in a sterile room, waiting for a voice she no longer possessed."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (ephemeral presence versus permanence) emerges through the vial's function, the temple's purpose ("capture fleeting things"), and Mira's final realization that "to harness the ephemeral wasn't to trap it—it was to honor it." The closing image—"holding everything that mattered and nothing that could last"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The lullaby motif (setup: lost to dementia; payoff: "her mother's voice, finally returned") reweights prior material. Minor deduction: "Not permanence. Presence." in the penultimate paragraph borders on thematic echo, though it's brief and followed immediately by the concrete image of the vial's warmth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; perceptual signature is consistent (diver's attention to oxygen gauge, physical pressure, visual gleam of crystal). Narrative distance modulates appropriately under stress: short sentences at peak pressure ("Nine minutes. The instinct to flee screamed through her nerves"), longer reflection when she pauses. Minor deduction: "By overriding instinct, she could think. By thinking, she could understand" reads slightly elevated for peak-stress diction, a small register drift. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Psychic distance shifts are purposeful and the final image maintains voice coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance situation or character. Rhythm varies purposefully (gauge countdowns anchor tempo; longer sentences during discovery beats). Minor loop: "gathered hush" appears three times with similar phrasing ("gathered hush of the temple," "gathered hush seemed to deepen"), creating modest synonym churn around this motif. Another small loop: "lonesome splendor" in opening paragraph and closing paragraph without functional reweighting in the second use. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks. Figurative language (kelp "wrapped," barnacles "sparkled," vial "glowed") is selective and legible. Propulsion is clear; no scaffolding or paraphrase loops in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The combination (underwater archaeology + dementia memory-recovery + ephemeral-capture magic) is specific and purposeful. The twist that Mira's mother died reaching for the same vial deepens rather than reverses, and the bracelet identification grounds the turn in concrete detail. The vial's function (finding knotted memories, not storing new ones) offers a fresh angle on memory-object tropes. Minor deduction: the underwater-temple-with-magical-artifacts premise leans on familiar fantasy/adventure templates; transformation occurs through the dementia-lullaby specificity and the bittersweet closure cost, lifting it above stock execution but not to exceptional synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira (the distress signal sender) makes the key turn at "forced herself still" (overriding flight instinct) and the final choice to ascend with the vial, both decisions altering tactics under pressure. Present in setup (paragraph 1), middle (decision to stay and retrieve), and closure (ascent with vial). Causal pressure: her choice to delay escape narrows oxygen margin and forecloses the path of joining her mother. Cost tied to element: she survives but retrieves only temporary presence, not restoration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The crystal perfume vial appears in four functional beats: (1) described in her mother's journal as the target, (2) seen beside the skeleton, (3) touched and flooded with memory-images, (4) carried during ascent and glowing in the final image. Its unique property (finding knotted memories) is irreplaceable and drives the closure: "holding everything that mattered and nothing that could last." Early setup, middle causal use (the flood of images), and closure linkage all present. Visible cost: the vial offers presence, not permanence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Gathered hush" appears three times: paragraph 2 setup ("gathered hush of the temple pressed against her ears"), paragraph 6 development ("archive of the ephemeral, preserved in glass and magic and the gathered hush"), paragraph 12 closure approach ("The temple's gathered hush seemed to deepen"). It frames expectation and charges the final image by deepening "with reverence," but does not constrain a tactical choice—Mira's actions would proceed identically without it. Lyric reprise with thematic weight, but no causal pressure. Two-gate fulfillment (setup, closure) with thematic coloring justifies mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The vial "touches memories" through its dramatized function: when Mira touches it, "images flooded her mind" and she feels "the lullaby humming through her, note by note, memory by memory." This trait enables the middle beat (understanding her mother's quest) and the closure stakes (carrying the lullaby back). Early setup (journal description), middle demonstration (flood of images), closure linkage (carrying the song). The trait is irreplaceable—generic "memory storage" would not work; the vial must "find them in the chaos of a fading mind." Cost: the memories are retrieved but the disease remains.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Unsnarl" appears explicitly in paragraph 9: "Her mother had come here to unsnarl what the disease had knotted." It explains the mother's quest and reframes Mira's retrieval as continuation rather than reversal. However, the major turn (Mira's decision to stay and retrieve) would function with "restore," "recover," or similar verbs—the specific metaphor of untangling adds thematic texture but is not mechanically irreplaceable. Present in middle (explanation beat) and echoed at closure (Mira completes the unsnarling by retrieving the lullaby). One strong beat plus closure participation; modest causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"By overriding instinct" is signaled and dramatized in paragraph 7: "The instinct to flee screamed through her nerves—to surface, to breathe, to live. But Mira forced herself still. By overriding instinct, she could think. By thinking, she could understand." This method enables the middle retrieval (suppressing flight response to examine the skeleton) and shapes the closure choice (delaying escape to grasp the vial). Early implicit setup (opening choice to descend despite low oxygen), middle explicit use (forcing stillness), closure consequence (she ascends but survives by narrow margin). Mechanically essential to both key choices; the piece teaches the method and applies it twice.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The forgotten underwater temple pressures every choice through depth, oxygen depletion, and spatial structure (broken dome → inner sanctum → mosaic floor). The alcoves housing thousands of vials create the "impossibility of the task" and the skeleton's position (hand extended toward fallen vial) provides the clue that solves it. The temple's "gathered hush" charges the final image. Early setup, middle constraint (how to find one vial among thousands; skeleton as navigation aid), closure charge (reverence deepens as she ascends). Irreplaceable: the story's logic depends on this exact combination of depth pressure, vial archive, and sacred space.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Time pressure is tracked continuously: distress signal "seventeen minutes ago," oxygen gauge "amber" then "red," countdown "Twelve minutes… Nine minutes… Six minutes." Each drop tightens Mira's window and forces tactical choices (stay and understand vs. flee). The timeframe shapes the middle decision (six minutes forces immediate choice), enables the method (overriding flight instinct only makes sense under time pressure), and charges closure (rescue lights "distant, but approaching" implies narrow margin). Early setup, continuous middle pressure, closure payoff (she survives but only just). The clock is irreplaceable; without it the piece loses escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To harness the ephemeral" is introduced in paragraph 2 (the temple's original purpose) and reframed in paragraph 11: "To harness the ephemeral wasn't to trap it—it was to honor it, to witness it fully before it dissolved." The motivation drives Mira's quest (retrieving the lullaby) and her mother's earlier dive. However, "retrieve lost memories" or "recover the lullaby" would serve functionally the same—"harness" adds philosophical framing but is somewhat swappable. Early setup, middle understanding beat, closure linkage ("presence would be enough"). Thematic weight is strong; causal necessity is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" is introduced in paragraph 1 ("the forgotten underwater temple sprawled beneath her in lonesome splendor") and reprised in the closing paragraph ("a small vessel of lonesome splendor"). The tone—melancholy beauty, isolation, reverence—holds through the descent, discovery, and ascent without flattening under pressure. The phrase charges both the opening image (temple with bioluminescent kelp and barnacle jewels) and the final image (the vial glowing warm). Coherent through turns; modulates with pressure (urgency rises, but the sacred atmosphere persists). The exact phrase in bookend positions reweights the vial as microcosm of the temple's larger theme.</comment>
