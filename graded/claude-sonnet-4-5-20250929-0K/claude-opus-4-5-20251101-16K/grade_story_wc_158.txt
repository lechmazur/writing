<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority relies heavily on abstract metaphor ("photosynthesize pain into beauty") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Her centuries-long vigil is told rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure; we see no moment where grief threatens to drown her and she must actively choose wakefulness with visible cost. The final "decision" to continue is a continuation of stasis rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Embodied emotion is scarce—"reef-shadow joy" and "quiet satisfaction" remain label-only rather than shown through physical sensation or contradictory response.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates centuries of lullabies into the "blossom armistice," then offers a conceptual repricing in the final lines where Mira realizes she has "become the dream instead of the dreamer." However, orientation is delayed—who, where, and when clarify only gradually across the first 15% without teaching a pattern. The closure unit (CR) reweights the postcard's meaning, but the cost remains conceptual and oblique; I cannot point to a specific sentence where Mira pays a felt price for her transformation. The armistice itself occurs off-page in summary ("A child...refused," "A soldier...wept"), undercutting causal pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell constrains Mira's existence and its acoustics enable the lullabies to travel, shaping the central method. The bioluminescent gardens and translucent walls charge the final dawn image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("spiraled from nacre and time," "breathing wind"), filtered through a consistent voice. The postcard functions as micro-setting, anchoring longing and repriced at closure. Spatial choreography within the shell remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Mira's inability to surrender to sleep/grief—is signaled early but never tested by a reversal or tightening choice. The "blossom armistice" is a result rather than a complication that forces a new decision. Agency is renunciation (continuing the vigil), but it simply extends prior behavior without foreclosing a live alternative path on the page. The ending offers Earned Stasis, yet the cost is conceptual ("she did not need to [rest]") rather than viscerally felt. Escalation reads as thematic deepening rather than narrowed options under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from image and action: pain metabolized into song, insomnia as vocation, the postcard's transformation from "come home" to "I came home after all." The final lines offer a resonant answer without moralizing. However, "photosynthesize pain into beauty" and "loss composted can become garden soil" veer close to thematic echo in the penultimate paragraph, though they remain image-anchored rather than pure thesis. The piece resists tidy binaries and embraces quiet closure with conceptual weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "shyly unstoppable," "reef-shadow joy," "gargantuan shell rose...like a cathedral spiraled from nacre and time." Psychic distance is stable, third-person limited with purposeful compression across centuries. Perceptual signature is consistent—diction elevates ("ensconced," "nacre," "polyp") but remains voice-motivated and legible. No dialogue present. The final paragraph's slight uptick in abstraction ("darkness into something the world could survive") is borderline but does not break stance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in most beats. However, template cadence appears in the penultimate paragraph: "that pain metabolized can become medicine, that loss composted can become garden soil, that even insomnia can become a gift..." (−0.4). Figurative language is dense ("photosynthesize," "reef-shadow joy," "blossom armistice") but mostly coherent; "reef-shadow joy" as a descriptor is oblique without grounding sensory detail. The scaffold phrase "She had become the dream instead of the dreamer" leans abstract where a concrete image would sharpen closure. Clarity and concision are strong elsewhere; no paraphrase loops detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of insomniac poet, submerged world, and lullabies-as-peace-agent feels specific and non-obvious. The postcard's transformation from nostalgia to present anchor is earned. However, the core armistice mechanism—songs carried on wind changing hearts over centuries—relies on a familiar pattern (art heals war) without a fresh complication or friction that would test the premise. The ending's emotional specificity ("she did not need to [rest]") avoids sentimentality, and the piece commits fully to its lyric mode without retreat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and her choice to continue singing shapes the ending, but her decisions are continuations of prior behavior rather than turns that narrow options. She writes, sings, and watches—observation and creation without a dramatized decision point where she must choose between competing paths with visible cost. Setup and payoff are present; middle development is weak (no on-page choice alters tactics). The element is functional but closer to witness than agent.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The postcard appears in the opening third ("pinned above her writing desk") and again at closure ("curling at the edges now, nearly translucent with age"). The final poem pinned beside it reprices the postcard's message from "Come home when you're ready" to "I came home after all...to what we might yet become." This is a purposeful early seed → final reprise that reweights the dominant stake. However, the postcard is not handled or used in a middle beat; it remains static description until the end. Within lyric-resonance allowance: 5.5–6.3 band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "blossom armistice" is named and described in the second half; it results from Mira's lullabies seeping into "humanity's collective dreaming." It shapes the thematic stakes but is narrated as outcome rather than dramatized as a choice point that alters Mira's tactics. The concept is present in the ending (treaties signed, people "too tired of war") and links causally to her centuries of singing, but the mechanics occur off-page in summary. One beat involvement (the armistice paragraph) with closure linkage, but no middle development or on-page cost tied directly to the concept itself.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Shyly unstoppable" is declared in one sentence: "She was shyly unstoppable, this poet. She never raised her voice above a murmur." The trait is consistent with her method (murmured lullabies) but remains label-only; no on-page moment where shyness constrains an action or unstoppability enables one with visible cost. It describes rather than dramatizes. Present and coherent, but ornamental—swappable with "quietly persistent" without structural loss. Functional but replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Ensconce" appears twice: Mira "ensconced herself centuries ago" in the shell (setup), and later she "had ensconced something larger than herself in the world's memory: a peace that grew like coral" (payoff). The action frames her initial choice to isolate and her ultimate legacy. It enables the shell setting and the acoustic method, and the verb's reprise at closure reweights it from personal retreat to communal gift. The action is specific and irreplaceable—"hid" or "settled" would not carry the connotations of deliberate insulation and embedding. Two beats, closure linkage, causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The lullabies are introduced early ("via half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind") and recur in the middle ("her voice traveling outward") and ending ("began another lullaby"). The method is the causal engine of the armistice: her songs "seeped into humanity's collective dreaming" and diluted anger. The "off-key wind" detail is specific and returns ("an off-key wind singing about stars"). However, the mechanics remain summary rather than dramatized in a pressure beat where the method fails or costs her something on the page. Setup, development (multiple singing beats), and payoff present; causal role is strong but largely told. High functional band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The shell is introduced in the opening line and its acoustics enable the lullabies ("sounds traveling through it in spirals, echoing and transforming"). It constrains Mira's existence and appears in the final beat ("The shell hummed with her voice"). The setting is indispensable to the method and frames the entire narrative. However, the shell does not supply a resource or obstacle that alters a middle choice—Mira never navigates its chambers under pressure or uses its structure tactically. Setup and payoff strong; middle development minimal. Essential to premise but not to turn-by-turn tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Across centuries of longing" appears early and the time frame recurs ("century after century," "her centuries of waking," "new century's first dawn"). The span establishes scale and enables the armistice's gradual accrual. However, time does not tighten decisions—no moment where a deadline or duration pressures a choice. The centuries function as backdrop rather than clock. The element supports the Accumulative lens (density increase over time) and charges the final image (postcard "nearly translucent with age"), but it remains atmospheric rather than tactical. One strong closure linkage, minimal middle pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To photosynthesize pain into beauty" is stated explicitly in the text and shown through Mira's transformation of grief into lullabies. The motivation drives her vocation and explains her insomnia. It appears in setup (metabolizing pain) and payoff (darkness into song). However, the motivation is never conflicted on the page—no beat where the cost of beautifying pain threatens to exceed its value or where she must choose between authentic grief and crafted song. Told and consistent, but not dramatized as a friction point with visible tradeoff. Functional across beats, but lacks live tension.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Reef-shadow joy" is named once and exemplifies the story's tonal register: muted, filtered, patient. The tone is coherent and modulates subtly from the opening's isolation to the ending's communal satisfaction. Imagery throughout supports this mood (bioluminescent gardens, translucent walls, dappled light). However, the phrase itself is oblique and not anchored in a concrete sensory moment—"happiness filtered through depth" explains rather than embodies. The tone charges the final image and remains stable under pressure, but the specific phrase is more ornamental than functional. Coherent execution; the named phrase less essential than the sustained atmosphere.</comment>
