<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority shows embodied perception ("pressed her palm against the cold stone") and her sensitivity trait enables key moments. The grandmother's research provides motivation, but the ending choice—to stay captured by the building—feels insufficiently dramatized as a decision vs. passive surrender. Internal contradiction is present (legacy she "never asked for but couldn't abandon"), but the final moment lacks a visible cost trade-off that makes the capture feel earned rather than imposed. Minor: "sensitively perceptive" reads as label-speak rather than fully dramatized capability under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece holds a Causal lens: grandmother's research → Mira's inheritance → discovery of burned diaries → architecture responds → capture. Closure lands on-page as Decisive Change (Mira is physically trapped and drawn into the building's memory). The Orientation Test is satisfied early (who/where/when by paragraph 2). One meaningful tightening occurs when the ivy grabs her ankle. Cost is visible: Mira loses freedom and is absorbed into the building's dreams. The closure effect is clear, though the final image ("drew her deeper") verges on summary rather than fully dramatized action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and selective: ivy-veiled passages, ruined atrium with ferns growing from beams, moss-carpeted marble. The fireplace anchors discovery; the ivy actively constrains choice at closure (grabs her ankle). Climate shifts provide context without slowing momentum. Spatial choreography is clean. The ivy's arrangement into letter-shapes on the film negative and its final physical action both charge the ending, satisfying the 9+ gate partially—though the building's "groaning" voice remains abstract rather than tied to a specific environmental feature.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: map acoustic memories, discover what walls dream about. One meaningful tightening: discovery of diaries → building speaks → ivy captures. Agency is present but passive at closure—Mira asks the question, but the building's response does the narrative work. The ivy grabbing her ankle provides physical escalation, but the final cost (being drawn into memory) is more reported than dramatized. Under the Causal lens, escalation is adequate but the protagonist's role in her own capture feels reactive rather than driven by a forced choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of legacy's burden and walls that mourn emerges organically through grandmother's burned diaries and Mira's inherited obsession. The central question—"What do you dream about?"—receives a non-literal answer: walls dream of wholeness and inhabitation. Subtext operates in the ivy "arranging itself into shapes" and the building's patient waiting. The final image avoids moralizing, though "Some legacies weren't meant to be carried" verges on explicit statement. The grandmother's warning and Mira's realization that "they dreamed of never being alone again" reweights prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled. Voice is distinct: "Legacy's burden hung heavy" and "They'd been waiting for someone who could hear them" carry character-specific perception. Psychic distance tightens effectively under pressure. No head-hopping. The narration stays within Mira's knowledge boundary. Minor slip: "She should have run. Legacy's burden kept her rooted" employs a filter construction that slightly distances the reader from immediacy, but the effect is minor and voice-motivated. The building's "groaning" and Mira's perception of its dreams are cleanly rendered as focalized experience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings are mostly distinct. Information density is high in the diary passages. Minor loop: "The walls dreamed of wholeness... They dreamed of being inhabited again" recycles the verb "dreamed" without adding new pressure (−0.3). "Sensitively perceptive" is a compound modifier that reads as slightly generic label-speak (−0.2). The climax suffers mild summary: "flooding her sensitively perceptive mind" tells rather than shows the overwhelm. Clarity is strong overall; no major artifacts touch closure, but the final paragraph leans on abstract summary ("drew her deeper into its memory") rather than concrete image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—acoustic memory cartography in post-climate-shift ruins—offers a fresh angle. The idea that walls dream is evocative and specific to this story. Transformation is evident: the trope of haunted buildings is recast through scientific inheritance and ecological reclamation. The grandmother's role as cautionary predecessor adds depth. Risk is moderate: the piece commits to its concept but the ending resolution (protagonist trapped by sentient architecture) follows a recognizable Gothic pattern. The synthesis of eco-apocalypse, acoustic memory, and family legacy feels organic but not radically original.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira's role as corridor echo cartographer frames the story and motivates her presence in the ruins. Her skill enables her to hear the building and interpret its memories. She makes the decision to ask "What do you dream about?" which triggers the ending. Present in setup, middle (mapping), and closure (communication with the building). Causal role in two beats: her inherited equipment and sensitivity bring her to this moment, and her question invites the building's response. However, the final capture feels reactive—the building acts on her rather than her choice driving the outcome. Strong integration but agency at closure is partly externalized.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The film negative strip appears late (after diaries are introduced) but reweights understanding: it shows grandmother's warning and the ivy's letter-shapes. Handled on-page ("held it toward the light") and its images directly inform Mira's realization that her grandmother tried to warn her. Present in middle discovery and shapes the closure beat by revealing the grandmother's final warning. Two distinct beats: discovery and interpretation. Causal pressure: it demonstrates the danger before Mira faces it. Specificity: a film negative is analog, fitting the grandmother's era and the decay aesthetic. Cap at ~7.2 due to late introduction (second half) and no setup seed.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Legacy's burden is signaled early ("inheritance of listening equipment, hand-drawn frequency maps, and an obsession") and directly shapes Mira's motivation and final choice. It constrains her: "Legacy's burden kept her rooted" when she should flee. Present in setup, middle (diaries reveal grandmother's struggle with the same burden), and closure (Mira understands "Some legacies weren't meant to be carried"). The concept drives stakes and the ending's tragic undertone. Strong causal pressure: without the inherited obsession, Mira wouldn't be there or stay. Visible cost: she becomes trapped. High irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Sensitively perceptive" enables Mira to hear wall-memories and perceive the building's response. Mentioned early ("always had been") and used at closure ("flooding her sensitively perceptive mind"). However, the trait is largely label-only; we see her press her palm and hear vibrations, but the sensitivity itself doesn't visibly constrain or trade off against another need. No demonstrated cost to hyper-sensitivity (e.g., overwhelm, distraction). Present in two beats but functions more as backstory explanation than on-page mechanic with friction. Mid-band: functional but not irreplaceable or costly.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Glimpse" is the method by which Mira sees the grandmother's warning in the film negative's final frame: "she could glimpse something terrible." This moment is pivotal—it reveals the danger and the grandmother's intent to warn. The glimpse directly informs Mira's realization ("Grandmother tried to warn me"). Present in middle and shapes closure understanding. Causal role: without this glimpse, Mira lacks context for the building's menace. However, "glimpse" as action is brief and could be swapped for "see" or "notice" without major structural change. Solid integration but moderate specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The half-burned diaries are signaled early (fireplace discovery ~25% in), used extensively in the middle (Mira reads entries that reveal breakthrough, terror, and the grandmother's realization), and directly shape closure (Mira understands the warning and the danger). The method "through half-burned diaries" is the primary information-delivery mechanism. Present across three beats: discovery, reading, realization. High causal pressure: the diaries provide the knowledge that reframes the building's behavior. Irreplaceable: the burned state signals the grandmother's attempt to destroy the research. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage is introduced early and provides atmospheric grounding. The ivy recurs at closure, grabbing Mira's ankle and trapping her. The passage itself is a transit point; the atrium becomes the active setting. The ivy's agency (arranging into letters, tightening around her) charges the ending. Two beats: entrance and capture. Causal role: the vegetation embodies the building's sentience and enforces the trap. However, the "passage" as distinct from the atrium or ivy is less integral—the ivy does the narrative work. Mid-high band: the setting matters but the specific "ivy-veiled passage" could be generalized to "ruins" with minor loss.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the climate shifts" establishes the post-apocalyptic context and explains the vegetation reclaiming buildings. Present in setup (paragraph 2) and implied throughout (wild growth, abandoned facility for thirty years). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency. It functions as static backdrop rather than active pressure. No middle development: the climate shifts don't constrain Mira's choices or tactics. Minimal closure participation: the green-wrapped dreams reference it thematically but don't hinge on it. Functional worldbuilding but replaceable with any reason for abandonment. Swappable; no visible cost tied to the timeframe.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mira's motivation "to discover what walls dream about" is explicit, inherited from her grandmother, and drives the inciting action (she enters the ruins to map acoustic memories). She pursues it actively by asking the building directly: "What do you dream about?" This question triggers the closure. Present in setup (grandmother's obsession), middle (Mira's inherited purpose), and closure (she asks and receives an answer). Causal pressure: the motivation places her in danger and keeps her rooted when she should flee. Visible cost: her curiosity leads to her capture. Strong integration; the desire is both told and dramatized through her choice to engage.</comment>
