<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivations are clear and her choices under pressure are earned—rationing ink pellets, seeding messages across centuries, accepting dissolution. Her internal life is vivid: "she sometimes wondered if 'living' still applied to her condition" embodies existential weight without therapy-speak. The "regally unpretentious" attribute is gestured at but not tested by a visible choice-fork with cost. Minor deduction for the ending's swift acceptance of dissolution, which feels somewhat announced rather than fought.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira's purpose is fulfilled, the library dissolves, and she "let[s] go" with visible cost (her own existence). The lens is Causal-Accumulative hybrid: her deliberate ink-seeding across time causes Valdris's downfall, which triggers library dissolution. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs: the library trembles, Valdris's throne sunders, and Mira accepts the void. Cost is legible in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The library "suspended in the pause where constellations shifted" functions as both metaphysical anchor and constraint: its drift-rune mechanic enables Mira's method, and its dissolution is causally tied to purpose exhausted. Sensory details—dust settled for millennia, pearl-grey void, constellation pressure-shifts—are filtered through Mira's perception. The ink pellet dissolving "its dark, corrosive bloom" grounds the abstract space in tactile action. The environment charges the final image: the library's breath-out and Mira's release are inseparable.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: unmask Valdris, the false god. Escalation is visible in accumulative pressure: three celestial alignments of message-seeding culminate in priests facing unanswerable questions and the blood-rite demanded. The reversal is the library's trembling—not violence but release—which forces Mira's final renunciation with visible cost (her existence). Agency is renunciation that forecloses all paths. The tightening is driven by protagonist action (her ink work) rather than coincidence, and the price is paid on-page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges concretely: power built on deception collapses under patient, overlooked resistance. The "diminutive titan…overlooked and underestimated" motif charges the closure without overt moralizing. Ink and drift become thematic carriers: corrosive truth disseminated through "dangerous books." The final image—"let go"—offers a resonant answer to the cost of toppling false divinity without stating a moral. Subtext operates in "the graceful collapse she had always known would come," implying foresight and acceptance earned through exile.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Single POV is stable; distance remains close-third with Mira's perceptual signature throughout ("she felt it like a change in pressure, a breath drawn and held"). Diction is controlled and voice-specific: "regally unpretentious in her exile" balances grandeur and humility without clash. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—widening slightly for backstory, tightening at closure. No dialogue to evaluate. Narrative certainty matches what Mira knows; no head-hopping. Rhythmic control under pressure: the ending's short declaratives ("The library breathed out. And Mira…let go.") heighten finality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Information density is high: nearly every sentence advances character, setting, or stakes. Rhythm varies naturally; paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Opening ("The temple library existed in the spaces between heartbeats of stars") anchors voice and stakes; closing line ("And Mira…let go.") resolves by image. Minor filter-verb presence ("she had been leaving," "she felt") is voice-motivated and does not dull immediacy. No paraphrase loops, synonym churn, or template cadence detected. Figurative language ("dust rose like incense") is precise and pressure-appropriate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise—fallen titan using library drift-books to unmask a false god—is a fresh synthesis of familiar elements (exile, subtle resistance, metaphysical setting). "Diminutive titan" and "dangerous books" avoid stock configurations. The method (cryptic messages seeded across time via drifting volumes) is specific and plot-integrated. Emotional truth in Mira's acceptance of dissolution feels earned rather than convenient. The piece commits fully to its metaphysical logic without retreat. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and quiet ending heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira (diminutive titan) drives all key turns: rationing ink, seeding messages, accepting dissolution. Her choices alter tactics (careful placement of messages) and enable closure (her work completed, she lets go). Present in setup, middle action, and ending. Causal pressure is high; specificity (her stature contrasted with cosmic magnitude) matters. Visible cost tied to her: she dissolves alongside the library.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Iron gall ink pellet appears in two beats: dissolving to write the genealogical message, and mentioned as "one of her last" (rationing). The ink's corrosive property ("eat through paper…slowly enough") is specific and functional. However, the pellet does not return with reweighted meaning at closure; the final image centers on library dissolution and Mira's release, not the ink. Present in setup and one middle beat, but absent from payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The rune of drift is causally essential: it enables books to "slip through the cracks of reality" and deliver Mira's messages across time. Mira traces it on the book's spine, feeling "the familiar tug as the volume began its journey." This action shapes stakes (her method of resistance) and tactics (careful placement within texts). Present in setup (explained), middle (used), and implicit at closure (the library's own drift into dissolution). The concept drives the plot and final image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Regally unpretentious" is applied to Mira's demeanor in exile and later echoed in her patient, unglamorous work. The trait is labeled ("regally unpretentious in her exile") but does not visibly constrain a choice with cost on the page. It colors her characterization—dignified yet humble—but remains descriptive rather than causally active. Present early, thematically consistent, but not tested by a specific fork where that trait forecloses an option.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Sunder" appears twice: Mira's past ability to "sunder empires" and the present result ("Valdris's false throne began to sunder"). The action is the story's climax and closure trigger: the throne sundering causes the library's release and Mira's dissolution. It is irreplaceable; no synonym could carry the mythic weight. Present in backstory setup, reappears at closure with causal force, and directly shapes the ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Cryptic messages left in library books are the story's engine. Mira's method is signaled early ("For three celestial alignments now, she had been leaving messages"), demonstrated on-page (writing "The blood of the true line runs with starlight"), and paid off at closure ("Across a hundred books…she had seeded the truth"). The mechanics matter: books drift, messages find scholars, questions arise, blood-rite is demanded. The method drives every beat and the ending effect.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The ancient temple library shapes all choices: its infinite shelves supply the medium for Mira's resistance, its drift-rune mechanic enables her method, and its purpose-driven existence determines its dissolution. The library "existed in the spaces between heartbeats of stars" and "lost to the memory of time" are not postcard details but constraints that define Mira's exile and tools. The setting's trembling and breath-out are the closure image, inseparable from Mira's release.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Three celestial alignments" and "constellations shifted" track time and create accumulative pressure. The timeframe is not a live ticking clock but an atmospheric rhythm that tightens: "The last constellation shifted. The library breathed out." Time structures the story (setup: past exile; middle: three alignments of work; closure: final shift and dissolution) and modulates urgency. Present in all three beats, though not a hard deadline that alters tactics within a single scene.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to unmask Valdris is dramatized through every action: rationing ink, writing the blood-test message, seeding truths across books. Friction between her goal and cost is visible—she sacrifices her existence to complete the work. The desire is signaled early ("Valdris had taken the celestial throne through deception"), drives middle beats (message placement), and is fulfilled at closure ("her purpose was fulfilled"). Conflicted choices appear in her patience and acceptance of exile's gentleness as a weapon.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Tone of "graceful collapse" is coherent and modulates with pressure: the opening's stately suspension ("spaces between heartbeats of stars"), the middle's quiet determination ("measured grace"), and the ending's elegiac release ("The library breathed out"). Tone charges the final image: dissolution is not violent but a sigh, fulfillment rather than defeat. "Gentle purgatory" and "becoming nothing" embody the graceful collapse without declaring it. The tone is indispensable to the closure effect.</comment>
