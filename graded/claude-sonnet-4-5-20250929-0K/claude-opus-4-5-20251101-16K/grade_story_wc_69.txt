<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation is clear and her philosophy consistently shapes her approach, with embodied emotion in the grandmother's camp reference. The three students are adequately differentiated through their instruments and conflict history, though their individual arcs compress quickly in the final beats. Marcus's baritone-fills-cathedrals/confidence-barely-fills-a-cup contradiction works, but the transition from resentment to harmony feels somewhat telescoped. Internal conflict and micro-choices under pressure are present but could deepen further to reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the rosette frames the vanishing-arts stake, the summoning creates pressure, and the final chord serves as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the three voices choosing to harmonize crystallizes options and reconfigures the relationship with felt cost (vulnerability, pride set aside). Orientation anchors promptly (Eleanor, library, autumn, present action). The closure lands on the page with conceptual cost (each student risks pride to sing together), and the "not yet friends" acknowledgment makes the price legible without false resolution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The velvet library and autumn setting are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (amber light, bronze-and-gold grounds, leaves drifting). The rosette as micro-setting object constrains Eleanor's teaching choice and charges the final image when placed "on the table between them" as a physical anchor. Spatial choreography of the three students entering and the tableau around the rosette remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reconciling fractured voices into harmony—is signaled early and tightens through Eleanor's framing of hatred as learned/unlearnable and the invitation to sing. The students' hesitation and Fatima's "What would we sing?" question mark a meaningful micro-reversal that narrows options. Agency resides in Eleanor's choice to summon them and each student's decision to join the chord; the cost is pride and the foreclosure of continued enmity, legible on the page in their changed looks.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of vanishing arts and the possibility of unlearning hatred emerges organically from the rosette, Eleanor's grandmother's history, and the collaborative singing. The final image of the three looking at each other differently offers a non-literal answer to whether harmony can survive division. Minor slip: "refusing to let them vanish" in Eleanor's reflection edges toward explicit statement, and the "always enough to begin" closing risks a touch of moralizing, though it remains image-anchored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds steady on Eleanor with clean focalization and consistent psychic distance. Voice carries a distinct literary texture ("traveled stillness," "expectantly resigned") that modulates appropriately under pressure. Dialogue is minimal but functional; Fatima's "What would we sing?" advances plot and Eleanor's hum-then-wait beats carry subtext. Slight register elevation in phrases like "denote each other as enemies" feels slightly elevated for spoken thought but remains within the established narrative voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is polished with strong rhythm control and varied sentence structure; the opening anchor is immediate and atmospheric. Information density is high (grandmother's camp, craftsman's death, three students' histories compressed efficiently). Minor loop: "expectantly resigned" appears twice in identical form (opening descriptor, then mirrored near the end); "traveled stillness" similarly recurs. No major artifacts obscure causality or closure, and figurative language ("spiral seeming to pull their gazes inward") supports rather than overwhelms.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The vanishing-arts frame and music-as-reconciliation premise are executed competently but tread familiar thematic ground (art heals division, teacher unites fractured students). The rosette as heirloom token and the intergenerational trauma reference feel conventional. Freshest element: the specific mechanics of "subtracting noise" and the spiral rosette as both object and conceptual anchor. Risk-taking is modest; the piece prioritizes craft and coherence over bold structural or perspectival innovation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eleanor's decision to summon the three students, frame the vanishing-arts lesson, and initiate the singing exercise drives all major beats. Her "expectantly resigned" stance and grandmother's history constrain her teaching method. She is causally active in the middle (rosette reveal, hatred-is-learned speech) and closure (humming the first note).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rosette appears in opening paragraph (Eleanor turns it between her fingers), serves as visual anchor and teaching tool in the middle beat (placed on table, "spiral seeming to pull their gazes inward"), and its spiral pattern is present in the final image as the three students harmonize around it. Specific carved properties (soundhole, intricate spiral) matter to the closure's visual charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vanishing arts frame the entire conflict: craftsman's death, zither tradition, "the art of listening...forgiving...braiding diverse voices." The concept shapes Eleanor's teaching method (showing the rosette as proof certain songs nearly disappeared) and the students' choice to sing something "from a tradition that nearly vanished." Stakes hinge on whether this particular art—harmony despite hatred—will survive in them.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Expectantly resigned" appears twice as a label for Eleanor's demeanor and once implicitly in her teaching approach. It constrains her tactic (she frames the lesson knowing they'll resist, yet proceeds) and colors the closure ("It was enough. It was always enough to begin"). The trait enables her patience under their skepticism but does not visibly foreclose an alternate path with clear cost on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Denote" appears once: "For three months, I've watched you denote each other as enemies." It names the students' marking behavior and sets up the problem Eleanor addresses, but the turn hinges more on their choice to sing than on any dramatized act of denoting. The word could be replaced with "mark" or "label" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Subtracting noise" is explicitly named in Eleanor's philosophy ("harmony arrived not by adding more voices but by subtracting noise") and implicitly enacted in the singing exercise (three voices find the essential chord by listening past discord). The method shapes her teaching tactic and the closure image. It is signaled early and paid off in the final beat.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Velvet library and autumn setting frame the scene with sensory richness (amber light, leaves, bronze-and-gold grounds) and provide the physical space where the rosette is placed and the singing occurs. The setting's "velvet walls seem to lean in and listen" during the chord, charging the closure image. Does not directly alter tactics or constrain a choice beyond providing the tableau.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Across unlearning hatred" is mentioned in Eleanor's interior reflection ("The timeframe stretched before her like sheet music: across unlearning hatred lay all the days ahead...") but remains abstract. No live clock or deadline pressures the scene; the element gestures toward future rehearsals rather than shaping present tactics. It reads as thematic label rather than dramatized constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Eleanor's desire to braid diverse voices into harmony drives her summoning, her rosette lesson, and her invitation to sing. The friction between the students' resentment and Eleanor's goal creates the central conflict. The motivation is tested in Fatima's hesitation and Marcus's shoe-studying, then satisfied in the final chord. Cost is visible: Eleanor risks failure and the students risk pride.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Traveled stillness" appears as descriptor for Eleanor's voice ("that traveled stillness—the calm of someone who had walked through enough storms") and recurs in the final chord description ("traveled and still"). Tone modulates from expectant tension (students' entry, skepticism) to quiet resolution (the chord, their changed looks). The phrase charges the final image by linking Eleanor's earned calm to the sound the students create.</comment>
