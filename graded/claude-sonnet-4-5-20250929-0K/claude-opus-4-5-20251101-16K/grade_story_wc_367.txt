<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and her motivation clear—she seeks to steer futures through ancient light manipulation. However, her agency is limited: she positions the wick and studies shadows but makes only one micro-choice ("tilted the wick three degrees toward hope") without meaningful internal contradiction or cost. The laugh-as-prophecy trait is told rather than tested under pressure, and the final descent feels like ritual completion rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Embodied emotion is present but the peak moment lacks the contradictory impulses required for high-band entry.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—patterns build through the ritual, shadow-reading, and the final tilt. Orientation anchors clearly (lighthouse, Mira, seventeen years) by the second paragraph. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the wick adjustment and the child's smile crystallize the lighthouse's power with implied cost ("fragile futures yet unborn," the weight of choice). The cost is felt but not sharply visible on the page; the final image reweights prior material without a decisive physical turn. One meaningful tightening (the ritual sequence) is present, but the escalation is gentle and the trade-off oblique.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse is vividly rendered with purposeful detail: viridian walls, volcanic crystal wick, total internal reflection creating temporal mirrors. Setting constrains the ritual (wick positioning, lens chamber, spiral stairs) and charges the final image ("crown of stars," "spaces between light and shadow"). The post-newspaper world anchors time without clutter. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mira's reverence. The lighthouse qualifies as micro-setting that alters tactics and fulfills the 9+ gate test, though spatial choreography within the lamp room could be sharper.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: Mira seeks to steer the world toward hope using the ritual. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens—ritual preparation, shadow-pattern interpretation, wick adjustment—but escalation is minimal. The "three degrees toward hope" is the only on-page tightening, and it arrives without visible cost or trade-off in the moment. No reversal or obstacle tests her commitment; the ritual proceeds smoothly. Agency is present but the choice feels more ceremonial than urgent, and the cost ("fragile futures") is asserted rather than demonstrated through forfeited options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: ancient light versus digital silence, steering futures through small adjustments, hope reflecting inward before flooding outward. The shadow-patterns showing "paths, not destinies" embodies the thematic question without stating a moral. The final image—child stirring in sleep, hope building strength—offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the "tiny adjustments with enormous consequences" and "guardian of fragile futures" edge toward thematic echo in the closing paragraphs, and the prose occasionally gestures at profundity ("Light remembering its path") without full dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, anchored in Mira's perceptual signature (ancient rituals, atmospheric pressure, hidden journals). Diction is elevated and consistent ("wind chimes caught in a gale," "constellations," "temporal mirror") with purposeful lyricism. However, register drifts toward narrative omniscience in exposition-heavy passages ("humanity now spoke in wavelengths she barely understood") that feel more explanatory than filtered through Mira's mind. Psychic distance wavers between close interiority and distant summary. No dialogue present; internal voice is coherent but occasionally slips into committee abstraction ("Light teaching itself where to go").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with strong imagery ("viridian walls," "lunar eclipse," "prism of shadows and brilliance"). Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "Light still meant something physical. Light still touched the world" and "the storms always came…the world always seemed to shift" restate without adding pressure. Template cadence in the closing ("She would return tomorrow night, and every night after") and stock metaphors ("crown of stars," "waiting world") slightly dull the final image. No severe artifacts, but figurative language clusters heavily in descriptive passages without always advancing momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse as temporal mirror and the "laughing storm herald" trait offer fresh particulars, and the post-print-newspaper timeframe adds specificity. However, the core premise—lone keeper performing ancient ritual to steer humanity's future through mystical means—follows a familiar template (chosen guardian, sacred object, cyclical ritual, abstract stakes). The emotional arc and physical action would function largely unchanged with different symbols. The "three degrees toward hope" gesture is evocative but not grounded in prior causal pressure or constraint. Some risk-taking in lyric tone, but the piece retreats from concrete cost into abstract affirmation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and makes one key choice (tilting the wick), appearing in setup, middle ritual, and ending. However, her "laughing storm herald" identity is told in backstory and does not constrain or enable any on-page action. The laugh is mentioned ("Tonight, the storms were distant") but does not create a turn or cost. The character shapes the ritual but the ritual itself drives events; her agency is ceremonial rather than tested under pressure. Present in all three gates but causal pressure is weak.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The wick appears in setup (unwrapped from silk), development (positioned in the chamber, catches starlight), and closure (tilted three degrees). It is handled across at least three beats and its mechanics matter: volcanic crystal, lunar-eclipse origin, total internal reflection. The wick's adjustment directly enables the ending's charge. However, its meaning does not evolve—it remains a ritual tool without reweighted symbolic cost. Strong integration but not indispensable; another mystical lens component could substitute with moderate edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Otherworldly routine" frames the opening ("marked the same otherworldly routine") and closing ("otherworldly routine complete"), shaping Mira's seventeen-year practice and the ritual's cyclical nature. It constrains the action to this repeated ceremony and charges the final image of eternal recurrence. However, the concept is more atmospheric than causal; it describes the ritual rather than creating a tactical choice or visible cost. Present in setup and closure with thematic resonance, but not essential to plot logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "accidentally prophetic" laugh is introduced early (storm herald backstory) and mentioned at closure ("She laughed into the darkness"), but it is ornamental. The trait is told ("her mirth always preceded the great tempests") without on-page demonstration—tonight the storms are distant, so no prophecy occurs. The closing laugh is linked to "something dawning" but no cost or constraint is shown. Label-only use across setup and ending; swappable with any other quirky trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Steer" appears in the dominant stake ("how she would steer the world") and in the key action ("tilted the wick three degrees toward hope"). The verb shapes Mira's motivation and the ritual's purpose, and the final image of the child stirring suggests the steering worked. Present in setup, middle reflection, and closure. However, the steering is more asserted than causally demonstrated—no before/after contrast proves the wick's angle changed outcomes. Essential to theme but not irreplaceable in plot mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Total internal reflection" is explained in the middle ritual ("caught starlight and bent it inward through total internal reflection, trapping luminescence in an endless loop") and enables the shadow-pattern reading that drives the wick adjustment. The method is signaled and its mechanics shape the attempt. Present in setup (wick properties) and development (the light-blooming sequence). However, it is more explanatory flavor than a tactical constraint—another mystical optics term could replace it. Functional across two beats but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse is present in every beat: opening image, spiral stairs (spatial choreography), lamp room (ritual space), lens chamber (mechanics), and closing sentinel image. The setting supplies resources (emerald amplification, crystal wick, curved walls for shadow-patterns) and constrains Mira's ritual to this exact structure. The lighthouse's unique properties (total internal reflection, temporal mirror) are irreplaceable for the plot. Strong causal pressure, specificity, and closure linkage. Removing the lighthouse would break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The timeframe ("last print newspaper had crumbled to dust three decades past") anchors the world in a post-print, digital-pulse era and contrasts with the lighthouse's ancient physicality. Present in setup and thematically relevant. However, it does not tighten decisions—no urgency, deadline, or temporal constraint affects Mira's choices. The time is setting flavor rather than a live clock. Mentioned once without development or closure participation. Functional but replaceable with any distant-future marker.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Mira's motivation ("to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows") is stated explicitly in the middle and drives the ritual's purpose. It informs her choice to tilt the wick "toward hope" and frames the ending's image of hope building strength. Present in setup (implicit in her keeper role), development (explicit statement), and closure (the child stirring). However, the desire is told more than dramatized—no visible friction between competing wants or costs tests her commitment. Shapes the dominant stake but without on-page conflict or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Shadowed elation" coheres throughout: Mira's laughter (elation) paired with storm prophecy and shadow-pattern reading (shadowed), the "prism of shadows and brilliance intertwined," joy rising at closure "not for approaching tempests…but for something dawning." Tone modulates from reverent ritual to anticipatory hope and charges the final image ("spaces between light and shadow"). Present in setup, development, and closure with consistent texture. The tone is more than ornamental—it colors perception and supports theme—but does not constrain a choice. Strong thematic integration.</comment>
