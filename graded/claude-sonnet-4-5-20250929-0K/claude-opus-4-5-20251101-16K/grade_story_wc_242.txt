<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera's interiority is established through concrete choices (answering calls, playing the disc, offering listening) and her cultivated estrangement reads as a chosen stance rather than stock isolation. The girl caller's grief is embodied through the forty-seven-minute detail and the loop imagery, though the final exchange skirts therapy-speak ("The loop isn't a trap. It's a door"). The divorce caller arrives too late to test Vera's motives under new pressure. Vera's renunciation of surface connection is credible, but her wisdom feels slightly over-articulated rather than earned through visible mistakes or struggle on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly: underground phone booth, Harrow Street utility tunnel, evening timeframe. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—density increases through the layering of wrong-number calls, the glass harmonica's resonance, and the final callback to the divorce caller, with the closure image ("spiraling upward through the wires like a prayer") reweighting the "endings how to begin" motif. One meaningful deepening occurs when Vera's purpose crystallizes through the girl's release. Cost is conceptual and felt: Vera's namelessness forecloses personal connection, though the price could be more viscerally legible in the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tunnel setting is vivid and specific—"cables hung like sleeping serpents," "copper and old rain," amber emergency lights—and the booth's brass-and-glass antiquity anchors the premise. The glass harmonica disc functions as micro-setting, constraining Vera's method and charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clear (alcove, switchboard, disc beneath it). The "hum of streetlamps" timeframe recurs but doesn't alter tactics on the page. Sensory detail is filtered through Vera's professional detachment and serves atmosphere more than choice, keeping the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Vera's mission to "teach endings how to begin" through wrong-number calls. The girl's grief loop provides one meaningful tightening when Vera plays the disc and reframes the loop as a door, narrowing the caller's emotional paralysis. The divorce caller arrives as a second instance but does not escalate pressure or force a new choice from Vera; it reads as a pattern confirmation rather than a test. No visible trade-off or forfeiture constrains Vera's actions, and coincidence (the calls arriving) complicates without forcing renunciation. One deepening is present, but cost clarity remains oblique.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—letting go, transforming grief into beginnings—emerges from Vera's method (the disc, the reframing of loops) and the callers' releases rather than assertion. The glass harmonica's "same note that plays at endings" is purposeful subtext, and Vera's cultivated estrangement charges her role as "purest vessel." The final image ("spiraling upward through the wires like a prayer") offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Minor slip: "The loop isn't a trap. It's a door" skirts explicit theme statement, though it's embedded in dialogue and serves the caller's arc. The piece resists tidy closure and invites reflection on connection through estrangement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited through Vera, with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: the tunnel as "melodically haunted," the calls as "orphaned," the switchboard's "language only she understood." Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; the girl's cracked voice and Vera's minimalist responses advance the emotional beat. Free indirect style is clean. Diction remains within Vera's calm, professional register even under pressure. Minor convergence: the girl's final "Thank you. I don't even know your name" reads slightly generic, but the exchange serves thematic purpose and doesn't disrupt voice coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual and sonic momentum. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme. Minor loop: "melodically haunted" appears twice, once for the disc and once for the tunnel, reducing specificity. The phrase "cultivating her estrangement" recurs in concept across multiple paragraphs without added pressure. Clarity and concision hold; no grammar errors or filter-verb stacks. The final image ("spiraling upward through the wires like a prayer") is vivid and propulsive, though "like a prayer" edges toward stock metaphor. No artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The underground phone booth operator answering wrong numbers is a fresh synthesis of the obsolete-technology premise with grief counseling, avoiding the obvious therapy-office frame. The glass harmonica disc as tool is specific and non-obvious. Vera's cultivated estrangement as a deliberate choice rather than imposed isolation transforms the loner archetype. The "teach endings how to begin" formulation is elegant but approaches platitude; grounding it in the disc's physical resonance and the callers' releases earns it. The divorce caller risks pattern repetition without escalation, keeping the score below 7.5. No close echoes of famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vera (underground phone booth operator) is present throughout, answering both calls and making the choice to play the disc in response to the girl's grief. Her decision to remain nameless and her explanation of the loop as a door shape the girl's release. She frames the divorce caller's arrival and plays the disc again, participating in closure. Setup ✓, Development ✓ (disc choice), Payoff ✓ (final image). Causal pressure: her choice to play the disc narrows the girl's paralysis. Closure linkage: she is the actor in the final beat. Strong integration with visible cost (namelessness).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Glass harmonica disc is present in setup (retrieved from beneath switchboard, described as "melodically haunted"), used in development (played for the girl, tone travels through wires), and charged in closure (pressed to chest, played for divorce caller, spiraling upward). Three distinct beats. Causal pressure: the tone "unstick[s] time" and triggers the girl's release. Specificity: its grandmother's funeral origin and exact-pitch resonance are unique properties. Cost connection: Vera's use of it embodies her method and forecloses ordinary comfort. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Cultivated estrangement is seeded early ("chosen this life deliberately"), developed through her namelessness and refusal of surface connection, and charged in closure ("existing only in the spaces between"). It shapes Vera's stance and tactics (remaining faceless, becoming a vessel). Causal pressure: her estrangement enables her purity as listener. Closure linkage: the final paragraph reprises "estrangement not to escape connection but to become its purest vessel." Two beats (choice, reprise). Moderate cost (forecloses personal bonds). Mid-high integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Melodically haunted appears twice: once describing the disc ("holding frequencies that resonated at the exact pitch of human longing") and once describing the tunnel ("melodically haunted with the residue of released grief"). Setup ✓ (disc description), Payoff ✓ (tunnel echo). The disc's haunting quality enables Vera's method (unsticking time), a causal role. The tunnel's haunting is thematic resonance without altering tactics. Two touches, one causal. Cost connection is oblique. Functional but moderate integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Loop is present throughout: the girl's grief loop (dialing the old house number repeatedly), Vera's reframing ("The loop isn't a trap. It's a door"), and the meta-loop of Vera's nightly routine ("the loop continued, but it was not the same loop"). Setup ✓, Development ✓ (the girl's release), Payoff ✓ (final paragraph reprise). The loop concept drives the girl's turn and Vera's purpose. Causal pressure: breaking the loop is the girl's stake. Closure linkage: "the loop continued" charges the final image. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Through wrong number friendships is seeded early (calls routed by faulty memories), developed across both calls (girl, divorce caller), and present in closure ("another wrong number"). Vera's method is mechanically clear: the switchboard routes orphaned calls to her booth. Three beats (girl, echo of prior callers, divorce caller). Causal pressure: wrong numbers are the access point for Vera's intervention. Closure linkage: the final call arrives as another wrong number. Cost: Vera's namelessness is tied to this method. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Subway utility tunnel is anchored early (Harrow Street, cables, copper-and-old-rain air, amber emergency lights) and recurs in closure ("beneath their feet," "the tunnel itself seemed to remember"). Setup ✓, Payoff ✓. The tunnel provides spatial grounding and atmospheric charge but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics on the page. The booth within it is the functional setting; the tunnel is the frame. Two touches (setup, reprise), no causal pressure. Moderate integration via atmosphere and closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Between the hum of streetlamps is established in paragraph three ("between the hum of streetlamps flickering to life above and their full electric awakening") and reprised in the penultimate paragraph ("Between the hum of streetlamps above..."). Setup ✓, Payoff ✓. The timeframe signals when calls arrive but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. No middle development. Two touches (setup, reprise), no causal pressure. Lyric resonance without escalation. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle gate; functional lyric reprise lifts to 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>To teach endings how to begin is stated early ("discovered her purpose") and drives Vera's choices across both calls: playing the disc, reframing the loop, offering listening. Development ✓ (disc choice for the girl), Payoff ✓ (playing for the divorce caller, "waiting to become something new"). Three beats. Causal pressure: the motivation shapes her method and responses. Closure linkage: the final image enacts this desire. Cost: Vera's estrangement is the price of this role. Strong integration with visible cost.</comment>
