**Drive Lens:** Hybrid (Accumulative/Textural dominant at closure, with Causal scaffolding). The story builds through layered imagery and conceptual density toward a Conceptual Repricing (CR) where "rescue" is fundamentally reweighted from extraction to preservation/participation.

**Closure Unit:** Conceptual Repricing — Vera picks up the pen, redefining rescue as staying, with the mountain singing as the charged final image.

<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Vera's pivot from extraction to preservation is intellectually coherent but arrives without visible friction or embodied contradiction. She moves smoothly from problem to insight with no genuine struggle—her "carefully resourceful nature finding its true purpose" reads as label rather than earned discovery. The time traveler has more emotional texture (cracking voice, 47 failures) but remains stock. No contradictory impulses act simultaneously; Vera is competent throughout, undermining the sense of a hard-won choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly within the first 120 words. The closure (CR) lands—rescue is reconceived—but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt; we don't know what Vera forfeits by staying. The middle is compressed into summary ("Together, they followed the botanical diary's map, ascending through passages") rather than dramatized. The key exchange with the time traveler ("You'd abandon a child?") resolves in a single beat without sustained friction, making the causal chain feel thin.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The setting concept is vivid and architecturally inventive—nautilus-shell spirals, gaps "where dust hung motionless," a chamber "that existed only in the corner of the eye." The mountain charges the final image ("The mountain sang"). However, the actual ascent from level 47 to 89 is summarized rather than sensorily experienced, and the dominant sense is visual with limited tactile or olfactory grounding. Setting constrains the quest (sustenance carried in, navigating absences) and shapes closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (finding/rescuing the girl) tightens once through the conceptual reframe, but the reframe arrives without on-page friction—Vera's single exchange with the time traveler is the only resistance, resolved immediately. No obstacle complicates the ascent; the botanical diary provides a clean map. The moral calculus ("abandon a child" vs. "preserve lessons") is interesting but dispatched rather than pressured. Cost at closure (committing to stay/transcribe) is implied but not concretely felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"How to grieve without hardening, how to change without losing yourself, how to love what you couldn't keep" is a thematic declaration disguised as discovery—abstract aphorisms rather than truths earned through dramatic specifics. "We're rescuing the lessons from being unlearned" states the thesis in near-prompt language (−0.5 for thematic echo). The final image (mountain singing) does resonate non-literally, and the unheard-to-heard symphony arc carries genuine thematic movement, partially recovering from the mid-story declarations.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited through Vera is stable with no head-hopping. The prose has a controlled lyrical register, but it doesn't modulate meaningfully under pressure—Vera's voice before and during the climax sounds identical. Dialogue is functional but the time traveler and Vera share nearly identical diction and register. "His voice cracked" tells rather than embodies. The girl's brief lines carry the most distinctive texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>"Philosophical treaties" should be "treatises"—a real word error in an early beat. "Carefully resourceful as always" is label-speak in an action beat. The abstract lesson list ("how to grieve without hardening...") in what should be the peak discovery moment reads as pseudo-profound rather than specific. Some effective lines—the nautilus shell opening, "the particular exhaustion of someone who had witnessed too many versions of the same tragedy"—but telling often replaces showing in key moments ("The idea settled between them like the first note of a symphony waiting to be heard" overwrites a beat that could be dramatized).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The conceptual framework is genuinely inventive: mapping absences to find deliberately forgotten knowledge, rescue redefined as preservation rather than extraction. The botanical diary as navigation tool through pressed flowers is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. However, the time traveler (shifting-color clothes, weary eyes, multiple timelines) and the infinite library are familiar genre furniture. The resolution—sitting down together to write—is thematically apt but narratively unsurprising given the setup. The "researching gaps" concept is the strongest original element.</comment>
