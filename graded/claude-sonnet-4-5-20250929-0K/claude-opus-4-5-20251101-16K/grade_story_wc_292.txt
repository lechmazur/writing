<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motives are clear and rooted in uncovering family shame, with embodied tension in lines like "that spongey feeling had lived in her since childhood." Her micro-choices—pocketing the nail, decoding journals, drafting the appeal—ground agency. However, interiority occasionally drifts into abstraction ("the need to question everything her family had accepted as shame") without sustained embodied cost at pivotal beats. The final choice to compose the appeal feels inevitable but lacks a visible tradeoff or renunciation on the page that would elevate characterization into the high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when early (weather station, Mira, post-jet-stream-shift) and delivers an Earned Stasis closure: Mira begins composing the appeal despite institutional risk, a stance crystallization that forecloses passivity. The Accumulative lens holds—journals, nail, coordinates layer toward the appeal decision. Cost is present but oblique: "standing before officials who might prefer the old narrative" and inherited shame reframed as courage. The on-page price reads as conceptual rather than visceral, sufficient for mid-7s but not decisive enough for 8+.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The experimental station, damaged journals, and copper nail constrain Mira's choices and charge the final image. The nail's green patina and deliberate bend are specific; the station's groaning instruments and pressure anomalies underscore instability. Spatial choreography is clean (window, worktable, shore debris). The nail as recurring object reweights meaning from coffin artifact to marker/key. Minor penalty: setting detail occasionally stalls momentum with exposition ("After the jet stream shifted, everything changed") rather than filtering through present urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reversing Vera's exile and reclaiming her name—is signaled early and tightens through journal decoding and the nail's discovery. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mira realizes the network saved two thousand people, reweighting the personal quest into systemic challenge. The appeal decision forecloses passive acceptance. However, escalation relies more on accumulating information than on agency-driven reversals under pressure. The cost ("confronting the system") is declared rather than dramatized in a peak beat, sufficient for mid-7s but not visceral enough for 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—inherited shame vs. inherited courage, truth exhumation—emerges through particulars: the copper nail, coded stanzas, Vera's hidden maps. The ending offers a resonant image: "routes drawn in defiance, pathways that refused to drown" reweights the premise without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the nail's patina and the sea delivering evidence. Minor slip: "reversible exile meant something still could be reclaimed" edges toward thematic summary in the final third. The piece invites reflection and resists tidy resolution, landing solidly in the 7.5–7.8 range.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; distance is consistent. Diction is specific ("spongey feeling," "nervously confident hands") and rhythmically controlled. Perceptual signature filters setting through Mira's map-librarian lens. Minor penalty: occasional register drift into expository abstraction ("made an example of her—exile to a territory that was already underwater, a death dressed in bureaucratic euphemism") pulls voice toward summary rather than maintaining immersion. No dialogue; focalization is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with varied sentence structure and purposeful rhythm. Information density is high in journal-decoding beats. However, minor loops appear: "The answer was beginning to emerge" / "a different story" / "the truth could be exhumed" recycle the same conceptual ground. Template cadence surfaces in the middle third with repeated "She [verb]" stems. Stock phrasing ("the simple recognition that Vera had been brave when bravery was treason") in a high-stakes beat dulls precision. Artifacts do not touch closure directly but lower the score by ~0.8 within Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of climate-refugee criminalization, cartographic resistance, and coded poetry is specific and non-obvious. Vera's hidden channels and the nail-as-marker transform the exile trope. However, the frame—lone researcher decoding ancestral secrets to reverse injustice—follows a familiar template without bold structural risk. The emotional arc (shame → vindication) is executed competently but predictably. The piece commits fully to its premise and avoids the safety middle, landing in mid-6s for solid but not exceptional originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout, and her librarian training filters perception ("map librarian by training," decoding verses). Her idealism is asserted in several lines ("her idealism outlasting the weather"). She makes the final decision to compose the appeal, which alters tactics from passive inheritance to active challenge. However, the trait "idealistic" is labeled more than constrained in peak beats—her choices feel inevitable rather than shaped by competing impulses. Setup ✓, development (decoding), payoff (appeal). Causal pressure is moderate; the trait does not narrow options with visible cost. Mid-band 5.5–6.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The copper nail appears in beat one (pulled from coffin three weeks ago), is examined at the worktable ("turned it over, examining the green patina, the deliberate bend"), and is pocketed before composing the appeal. It shifts meaning from relic to marker/key. Setup ✓, development (identification as marker), payoff (pocketed as proof). Three distinct beats; causal pressure (enables decoding and identity proof); closure linkage (present in final decision beat). Specificity high (green patina, deliberate bend). Reaches 7.0–7.5 band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Reversible exile" shapes the appeal's stakes and Mira's goal throughout. It is named explicitly and drives her research (finding evidence to reverse Vera's exile). Setup ✓ (signaled early via "reversible—a clause buried in the emergency statutes"), development (journals as evidence), payoff (submitting the appeal). However, the concept is more thematic backdrop than tactical constraint—Mira's choices are not narrowed by competing interpretations of reversibility on the page. Causal pressure moderate; closure participation clear. Mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Nervously confident" appears once as a descriptor of Mira's hands ("Her nervously confident hands turned it over"). The trait is labeled but does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost. No setup in the opening third; appears in the middle during journal examination. Development and payoff absent—no second beat where the trait alters tactics or charges the ending. Ornamental use; swappable with "steady" or "careful." Cap at 4.6 for missing setup; further lower to ~4.2 for label-only execution.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Question" drives Mira's stance: "driven by the need to question everything her family had accepted as shame" and "her questions carving channels through carefully maintained silence." Setup ✓, development (decoding journals as inquiry), payoff (questioning culminates in composing the appeal). The action is thematic and pervasive but not irreplaceable—"investigate" or "challenge" could substitute with minor edits. Causal pressure moderate; the action shapes multiple beats but lacks high specificity. Reaches 6.5–7.0 band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Coded stanzas are introduced early ("threaded through the pages were poems—strange, stilted verses"), their mechanics explained (Vera encoded locations in verse), and Mira uses them to decode coordinates ("Where copper teeth bite coffin wood, the mapmaker's children understood"). Setup ✓, development (pattern recognition and decoding), payoff (coordinates copied for the appeal). Three beats; high causal pressure (enables the reversal attempt); closure linkage strong. Specificity and irreplaceability high—the method is unique and plot-essential. Reaches 7.5–8.0 band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The experimental weather station is named early and provides spatial coherence (observation window, worktable, monitoring equipment). It signals isolation ("the others had evacuated") and Mira's choice to remain. However, the station does not constrain tactics—Mira could decode journals anywhere. The groaning instruments and pressure anomalies add atmosphere but do not alter the ending. Setup ✓, development (isolation choice), payoff (writing at the station). Lyric resonance present but causal pressure low. Reaches 6.0–6.5 band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"After the jet stream shifted" is established as historical cause (coastlines drowned, currents reversed, refugees exiled) and frames the present crisis. However, it functions as backdrop rather than live clock—no ticking timeline pressures Mira's choices on the page. Setup ✓ (early signal), development (shapes world state), payoff absent (no time-driven urgency at closure). The timeframe is essential to world logic but swappable with any climate-catastrophe marker. Mid-5s for functional but non-urgent use.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mira's desire to honor Vera is named explicitly ("To honor an ancestor's overlooked bravery") and dramatized through journal decoding, nail examination, and composing the appeal. Setup ✓, development (research and realization), payoff (appeal drafting). The motivation is coherent and drives three beats. However, friction between wants and costs is mostly declared ("confronting the system that had buried it") rather than embodied in a peak choice with visible tradeoff. Reaches 7.0–7.3 band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Spongey dread" is introduced explicitly ("That spongey feeling had lived in her since childhood—the sense that something terrible lurked beneath the surface") and colors Mira's perception ("dread pooling in her stomach"). The tone is coherent and modulates with pressure (groaning station, debris arriving). However, the adjective "spongey" is used only once and the tone does not charge the final image—Mira's closing stance is resolute rather than dread-soaked. Setup ✓, development (dread pools as she decodes), payoff weak (tone shifts to determination). Reaches 6.5–6.8 band.</comment>
