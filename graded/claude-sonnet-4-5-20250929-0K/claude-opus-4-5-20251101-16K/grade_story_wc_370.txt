<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's empathetic gift is embodied through concrete past trauma (the train platform scene) and her seven-year retreat creates clear internal contradiction. The final choice to "let go" emerges from established causality, though the epiphany arrives largely through exposition rather than a dramatized micro-choice under pressure. The library guide's therapeutic explanations ("Empathy is not omniscience. Compassion is not control") edge toward diagnostic label-speak in a pivotal beat, and Maren's shift from crumpled-paper-clutching to release feels somewhat telegraphed rather than earned through on-page friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (cafe, clock tower, midnight approach). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Maren accepts her helplessness and chooses presence over withdrawal, with the crumpled invitation's fall marking visible cost. Causal lens holds: invitation → arrival → library entry → guided insight → final release. One meaningful deepening (the library woman's reframing of the mistake) tightens Maren's understanding and narrows her options to stay-while-leaving. Minor cost-legibility concern: the final image of letting the paper fall is poetic but the foreclosed path (continued hiding) could be more viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The impossible library architecture ("shelves spiraled upward into velvet darkness") and the cafe-as-disguise frame the Society's core paradox. Spatial choreography is clear across the transition from cafe to library. The crumpled invitation functions as micro-setting object, handled multiple times and charging the final image when it falls. No occupational systems are required here; sensory detail (velvet darkness, humming book) is selective and purposeful. Gate met: the library's spatial impossibility constrains Maren's conceptual choice at closure (hidden-in-plain-sight mirrors her own stay-while-leave paradox).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (whether to accept the invitation and confront the mistake) is signaled early and tightens once: Maren's decision to stay in the library rather than flee. The library woman's reframing narrows Maren's options from guilt-driven hiding to presence-without-control. No antagonist needed; pressure is internal and situational. Cost is visible in the final gesture (dropping the crumpled paper, foreclosing the retreat option), though the escalation from arrival to acceptance could involve more on-page friction or a second micro-reversal to deepen agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (paradox of feeling everything yet fixing nothing as the human condition) emerges from concrete particulars: the train platform mistake, seven years of isolation, the library's "present absence" architecture. The final image (letting the paper fall) offers a non-literal answer to whether empathy obligates control. Minor slip: "Empathy is not omniscience. Compassion is not control" borders on theme-statement, though it's voiced by a character rather than narration. The nested-paradoxes conceit (hidden/seen, staying/leaving, helplessness/bravery) integrates tightly with Maren's arc and the library's design, reweighting her mistake as misunderstood helplessness rather than moral failure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Maren's perceptual filter (feeling strangers' grief, "replaying endlessly"). The library woman's "enlarged tranquility" voice feels distinct in rhythm and diction. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Minor register drift: "organs of the soul," "calcified guilt," and "tumor" metaphor edge toward elevated philosophical diction that slightly exceeds Maren's established lexicon under peak stress. Purposeful elision (seven years compressed to a paragraph) serves momentum. Dialogue is sparse but functional, carrying the library woman's calm authority without becoming exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high (backstory, stakes, and closure compressed cleanly into ~1400 words). Minor loops: "felt everything" repeated across two early paragraphs, and "the woman" stem recurs frequently in the library sequence without variation. Figurative language is dense ("tumor," "stones into still water," "velvet darkness") and mostly coherent, though "organs of the soul" mixed with "receives/acts" machinery feels slightly strained. No scaffold or synonym churn. Sentence variety supports scene shifts. The crumpled-paper motif is handled visually and tactilely across multiple beats, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The secret-society-for-wounded-souls premise is familiar (echoes of genre templates for magical realism and healing-library tropes), but the nested-paradoxes frame and the specific mistake (empathetic intervention failure) offer a moderately fresh angle. The cafe-as-library disguise and the "present absence" label feel somewhat on-the-nose. Emotional specificity (the train platform beat, "felt alone what they once felt in company") grounds the arc. Transformation test: plot and emotional arc could translate to other mentorship-and-acceptance frames with modest edits, suggesting mid-range originality. No bold structural risk; the piece follows a conventional invitation-to-threshold-crossing arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren (compassionate recluse) drives all key turns: crumpling/retrieving the invitation, choosing to attend, staying through the library woman's reframing, and releasing the paper at closure. Her reclusiveness is motivated by empathetic overload (setup), tested by the invitation's arrival (middle choice), and transformed at closure (staying-while-leaving stance crystallizes). Agency is visible and costly. Three gates met; causal pressure and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The crumpled invitation appears in beats: opened/crumpled twice (anger, fear), smoothed on thigh at cafe, clutched during library tour, dropped at closure. Its physical state (soft as cloth from repeated handling) embodies Maren's prolonged ambivalence. Setup (paragraph one), development (carried into library), payoff (final release reweights it as symbol of letting-go). Irreplaceability high; removing it would break the closure gesture. Cost connection clear (dropping it forecloses retreat). Causal pressure and closure linkage both strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Nestled paradoxes (hidden-in-plain-sight, staying-while-leaving, helplessness-inside-bravery) shape the library's architecture and Maren's final stance. The concept is signaled early (invitation text) and articulated explicitly by the library woman. It constrains Maren's choice at closure (accept paradox or remain stuck). Setup and payoff gates met; middle development is present but somewhat expository. Specificity is moderate; the label "nestled paradoxes" could apply to many contemplative fictions. Closure linkage is strong, but the concept operates more as thematic frame than on-page tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Maren's empathy trait is established (feeling strangers' pain, subway/train examples) and drives her retreat into isolation. It enables the train platform intervention and her recognition of its failure. Cost is visible (seven years of solitude). Setup (first page), development (library woman's reframing links empathy to the mistake), payoff (staying-while-leaving accepts empathy's limits). The trait is label-heavy ("keenly empathetic" repeated) and could be more fully embodied in micro-choices during the library tour. Causal pressure moderate; closure linkage present but not decisive.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Hiding (the action) is the dominant prior stake and the closure reverses it: Maren moves from cabin isolation to presence in the library and acceptance of feeling-without-control. The library woman's line "You've been hiding" names it; the final paper-drop enacts the shift. Setup (seven years in cabin), development (choice to attend despite hiding), payoff (staying-while-leaving replaces pure hiding). Two beats; causal pressure strong. Specificity high; the arc pivots on hide-versus-stay. Irreplaceability solid; swapping "hide" for another withdrawal verb would weaken the nested-paradoxes frame.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Staying while leaving" is named by Maren as her past ghost-mode (paragraph after library entry) and reappears in the library woman's prescription ("remain open to others' pain while releasing your grip on outcomes"). The final paper-drop enacts it as acceptance rather than evasion. Setup (mid-story), payoff (closure), but middle development is thin—no on-page beat where Maren tries this method and adjusts tactics based on its mechanics. Lyric reprise reweights the concept, lifting it into the 5.5–6.3 band, but the method is more thematic label than dramatized tactic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The library (hidden-in-plain-sight via cafe front) appears in setup (cafe paragraph), development (impossible architecture as teaching moment), and payoff (Maren welcomed into the Society). The space embodies the nestled-paradoxes concept and provides the setting for the library woman's reframing. Moderate causal pressure: the library enables the guided insight but does not constrain Maren's choice tactically (she could receive the same wisdom elsewhere). Specificity moderate; the "shelves spiraling into darkness" and "SORROWS, SURVIVED" label are vivid but the library functions more as symbolic space than tactical resource.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Midnight is mentioned (clock tower chimes half-hour before, final paragraph marks midnight tolling), framing the scene temporally. Setup present, payoff weak. No middle development where the approaching deadline tightens Maren's choice or alters her tactics. The timeframe is decorative rather than pressuring; removing it would not change the closure. Swappability high (could be any threshold hour). No visible cost tied to the clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Maren's desire to understand her mistake drives the entire arc: invitation acceptance, library visit, guided insight, and final reconciliation. The motivation is embodied in the train platform flashback and the repeated crumpling/retrieving cycle. Friction is visible (anger, fear, sleeplessness). Setup (invitation text "wisdom in what went wrong"), development (library woman's reframing "wisdom nested in your mistake"), payoff (acceptance that empathy ≠ control). Three gates met; causal pressure and closure linkage strong. Cost clear (foreclosing guilt-as-identity).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The library woman's "enlarged tranquility" is described explicitly and her calm voice anchors the tone in the second half. The opening (crumpled invitation, fear, chiming clock) carries more urgency than tranquility, but the library sequence shifts into contemplative stillness. Tone modulates purposefully with pressure (anxiety → guided calm → release). The final image (paper drifting, "staying, finally, while letting go") charges the tranquil close. Setup mid-story, payoff strong. Coherence across turns is mostly maintained, though the opening cafe tension and the library's vast calm feel slightly unintegrated in rhythm.</comment>
