<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's internal world is concrete and particular—pressing the river stone to her forehead for "cool certainty," her grandmother's legacy driving present choices. The decision to guide rather than destroy the shadows is earned through observation and reflection, though the final choice arrives quickly without visible internal struggle between competing impulses. Her sharp-eyed noticing translates into meaningful agency at closure, but the "luminous regret" feels more asserted than embodied in contradictory action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens early: Mira's repeated observations build density toward a pattern-breaking choice. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly within the first paragraph. Closure arrives as Charged Poise—opening the first unclaimed sphere and beginning transformation—with visible cost in "all the hope already faded" and the persistent regret. The decision forecloses the destruction protocol and commits her to an uncertain guardianship role, making before/after legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The Blooming Library is vividly particular: paper flowers growing from spine and margin, rose-tinted shelves, golden haze ceiling. The setting constrains Mira's choice—she works within the library's protocols and uses its unclaimed spheres as the solution. The river stone functions as micro-setting, handled twice (forehead press, desk placement) and charging the final image with its underground-water symbolism. Spatial choreography across wings and stacks remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving hope's structure against shadow-fed erosion—is signaled early and tightens when Mira discovers the shadows feed on hopeful dreams specifically. The comparison protocol provides one meaningful deepening: she moves from documentation to understanding their hunger, then to action. Her choice forecloses the destruction option with visible cost (already-faded hope, ongoing regret), though the shadows' transformation feels more conceptual than tested under immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: hope as geometry, shadows as metamorphosed desire, preservation as tending rather than freezing. The river stone's return—from ancient flowing waters to underground persistence—reweights the opening without stating a moral. "Some things must be preserved even as they change" is earned through Mira's action rather than asserted. The piece asks whether transformation is loss or continuity, and the final image answers through the settled shadow and placed stone without resolving into binary simplicity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and textured: "softly deliberate intention," "sharp eyes trained to catch the exact moment light surrendered to shadow." Psychic distance remains stable in close third. The phrase "luminous even in their darkness" and "regret she couldn't name" create purposeful compression that charges rather than obscures. No dialogue appears. One small slip: "She understood now what was happening" tells understanding that the next paragraph then shows, creating minor redundancy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies effectively; information density is high. The surveillance-footage paragraph demonstrates strong propulsion: "2047 flowing into 2067, then into 2087. The flowers...bloomed and wilted in cycles. Librarians came and went like ghosts." Two minor loops: "softly deliberate" appears twice (opening description of shadows, then Mira's decision); "preserve/preservation" cluster in the grandmother/closure section without added pressure. No figurative muddle, clean grammar throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The Blooming Library and shareable-dreams premise offer fresh synthesis. The shadows-feeding-on-hope concept transforms a standard "corruption spreading" plot through the specific geometry-of-hope framing and Mira's grandmother's Sharing Wars backstory. The choice to guide rather than destroy avoids the destroy-the-anomaly template. However, the "dusk noticer" role and paper-flower library risk precious aestheticization, and the emotional beats (aching chest, luminous regret) approach familiar contemplative-fantasy registers without full transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's sharp-eyed observation drives the comparison protocol discovery and final choice. Her noticing creates the key turn from documenting to understanding to guiding. Present in setup, middle investigation, and closure action.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The river stone appears in three beats: Mira holding it (opening), pressing to forehead (decision point), placing on desk (closure). Its "cool certainty" and grandmother's legacy charge the preservation theme, but it doesn't constrain the choice—Mira could decide identically without it. The final placement offers lyric resonance but not causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Shadow unbound" shapes the central problem and stakes throughout. The shadows' autonomy drives Mira's investigation, their feeding narrows her options, and her choice to guide them provides closure. Present in inciting observation, escalation (feeding discovery), and transformation action. The concept is load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Softly deliberate" describes both the shadows' browsing and Mira's decision-making. It appears twice but functions more as atmospheric consistency than constraint. The trait doesn't create visible tradeoff—nothing in the text shows what slower or more impulsive action would cost. Label-present but not pressure-active.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Metamorphosis is the story's hinge: shadows metamorphose from passive to active/hungry, and Mira's solution is to guide their metamorphosis into guardians. The concept appears in setup (first separations), understanding (transformation insight), and closure (opening the sphere to begin transformation). Removing this exact action collapses the resolution logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The comparison protocol is signaled early, executed on-page with specific detail (decades, accelerated footage, same corner), and yields the key discovery that shadows multiply over time and target hopeful dreams. The method matters: static observation wouldn't reveal the pattern. It shapes the middle investigation beat and enables the final choice.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The library provides the dream spheres Mira uses, the protocols she must choose between, and the unclaimed dreams that enable her solution. The "above the clouds" isolation and golden haze create tone. The Children's Wing and Remembrance Wing offer spatial variety. Setting supplies resources and constraints, though it doesn't create urgent pressure—Mira's timeline is self-imposed.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The shareable-dreams era establishes the premise and makes the library's collection possible. The "after dreams became shareable" framing anchors the world but doesn't tighten decision pressure—no deadline or escalating timeline forces Mira's choice. The four-decade span in the footage matters for pattern discovery but remains background texture.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Preserving hope's shape motivates Mira's grandmother sending her, drives her investigation, and determines her final choice (guide rather than destroy). The motivation creates friction: she must accept already-faded hope as cost. It's tested on-page when she watches shadows feed and must choose between protocols. The geometry-of-hope framing makes the abstraction concrete.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Luminous regret" is established early (shadows moving beautifully, aching chest, unnamed regret) and charges the closure ("regret remained, luminous and persistent"). The tone modulates: clinical observation in the footage section, aching witness at the Children's Wing, acceptance at closure. It coheres through pressure and the final image makes it structural rather than decorative.</comment>
