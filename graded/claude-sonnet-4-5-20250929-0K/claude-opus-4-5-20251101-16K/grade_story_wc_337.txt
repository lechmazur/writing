<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's interior life is specific and embodied—trembling hands, fractured reflection—with clear motivation rooted in past trauma. The work itself demonstrates her skill and endurance under the constraint of her damaged hands. Sela functions primarily as witness rather than pressure source, limiting relational friction. The final choice to continue working is consistent but carries minimal visible cost on the page beyond solitary acceptance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece establishes orientation cleanly (prism sanctuary, Mira's trade, Sela's arrival) and builds through the knot-unraveling sequence toward the final image of Mira resuming work—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) where her solitary endurance forecloses rest with visible cost ("lucid unrest"). Escalation occurs through density increase as each knot releases adds layers of inherited silence. One meaningful deepening is present, though the cost could be more visceral in the closing beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary is vivid and purposeful: starlight fractures into colors, walls breathe with stillness, and the space actively absorbs released silences. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mira's professional lens. The fisherman's net as micro-setting object constrains the work physically (bone-colored fibers, resistant knots) and charges the final image when Mira picks up another net. No orientation debt; spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing Sela's mother from inherited silence—is signaled early and tightens through the knot-unraveling sequence. Each knot released narrows options as the sanctuary absorbs more grief, creating accumulative pressure. The resolution is earned by Mira's skill and endurance, but the cost is largely atmospheric rather than a choice that forecloses a live option with felt consequence. One meaningful deepening occurs, scaled appropriately for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme of inherited silence and unspoken grief emerges organically through the net's knotted history and the sanctuary's function. The final image—Mira continuing her work "accumulating silence, until the stars gave way to dawn"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates effectively in the prisms absorbing grief and Mira's fractured reflection. The piece resists tidy resolution while maintaining clarity, though the thematic weight slightly outpaces the on-page dramatic cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Mira's perceptual signature is distinct: she recognizes grief in Sela's face, reads silence in objects, and sees her own brokenness reflected in prisms. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, advancing both exposition and relationship. Diction remains controlled and voice-appropriate throughout. Minor register elevation in explanatory passages ("sediment in the cracks of old things") fits the contemplative tone without breaking character.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is clear and purposeful with strong imagery (net "the color of bone," needle "like a sliver of dawn"). Rhythm modulates appropriately between action and reflection. Some passages border on overwriting ("lucid unrest—awake, aware, forever mending") and "interlaced hush" appears multiple times without always earning the repetition. Information density is high; no paraphrase loops detected. The final paragraph's rhythm effectively closes the accumulative arc.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The premise—restoring masks/faces of the dead through physical object work—offers a fresh synthesis of grief counseling and craft. Specific details (fisherman's net, prism sanctuary absorbing silence) ground the fantastical elements. The emotional core of inherited trauma feels earned rather than derivative. However, the framework follows a familiar mentor-teaches-seeker structure, and the closing image of continuing solitary work is somewhat predictable given the opening. Risk-taking in the magical-realist mode is confident but not bold.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira appears in opening, drives the net-unraveling work across multiple beats, and her decision to pick up another net shapes the closure. Her brokenness (trembling hands) creates visible constraint during the needle work. The trait is both label and demonstrated action with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Tapestry needle appears early, is actively used through the knot-unraveling sequence (first knot, another knot, last knot), and Mira sets it down before picking up another net. The tool's specificity matters—its steel length catching prismatic light, requiring precision despite tremor. Present in closure frame through the ongoing work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Interlaced hush" is named and explained early, shapes the sanctuary's function (prisms weave silences together), and appears in the closing image. It constrains Mira's work by requiring her to process silences for the sanctuary. However, it functions more as setting rule than active stake-changer; its mechanics could be replaced with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Accumulates silence" drives Mira's occupation, appears in multiple beats as she frees each knot (sanctuary "absorbing" silences), and returns in the final line ("accumulating silence, until the stars gave way to dawn"). The attribute creates visible cost—Mira's perpetual wakefulness and solitary burden. Specific to her role and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Exhume" is stated explicitly ("They're asking to be exhumed") and drives the method: freeing hidden truths from knots rather than bodies from ground. The concept shapes Mira's explanation to Sela and the sanctuary's purpose. Present across beats but could be reworded to "reveal" or "release" with modest structural impact; the specificity adds thematic weight more than mechanical necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Unraveling knots in the fisherman's net is introduced early, demonstrated across multiple beats (first knot, another, another, last knot surrenders), and each release creates causal consequence (presences emerge, sanctuary absorbs). The method's mechanics matter: patience required, fibers resist, needle threading. The net's centuries-old history and Mira's explanation of generational silence make this method indispensable to the story's logic and closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prism sanctuary is established in opening, actively participates by absorbing released silences ("prisms pulsed with starlight"), and provides the containing logic for Mira's work. Starlight is mentioned throughout and frames the closure ("until the stars gave way to dawn"). The setting's function—transforming grief into peace through prismatic absorption—is irreplaceable; removing it would break the story's mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Across sharing a secret" frames Sela's journey and Mira's warning ("something will change in you"). The secret is delivered through the knot-unraveling demonstration and Sela carries it away at the end. However, time itself doesn't tighten decisions—the work unfolds at craft pace without urgency. The frame is present but functions more as thematic container than pressure mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"To ground restless spirits" is Mira's stated purpose, demonstrated through action (unraveling the net to free trapped presences), and validated at closure when Sela asks "Will she sleep now?" The motivation creates friction through Mira's damaged hands and perpetual wakefulness. Cost is visible: her solitary, endless work. The motivation is irreplaceable—it defines both her trade and her sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Lucid unrest" is named in the final paragraph and maintained throughout: Mira's trembling hands against precise work, the sanctuary's accumulated stillness holding "screaming world outside," her fractured reflection. Tone modulates appropriately from Sela's desperate arrival through contemplative explanation to resigned endurance. The final image charges this exact tone—"awake, aware, forever mending"—making it indispensable to closure effect.</comment>
