<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera's interior world is vivid and her profession shapes perception ("sharp, clean frequency" vs. "softer, more malleable"), but her seventeen-year arc compresses into telling rather than dramatized contradiction. The final refusal stems from sudden transformation—"she could feel the difference"—rather than earned ambivalence acting in scene. Felix remains a hollow cipher whose only choice is to wait, limiting relational pressure. The motivation shift lands as epiphany without prior on-page struggle between profit and empathy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (who/where/what by the opening paragraphs). The piece reads under a Hybrid lens: causal setup (Vera's absorption process) leading to an Accumulative/Textural closure where density of absorbed emotions reweights her understanding. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Vera's self-understanding shifts and she refuses the sale), but the cost—giving away her "final transaction" and sitting in "static-charged silence"—is more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page. The transformation completes off-stage during "months" of absorption; the on-page beat is declarative rather than a causal narrowing of options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The amber grotto's honey-and-shadow atmosphere is lush and consistent, anchoring the opening and closure. Sensory detail is strong but leans visual; the "static electricity" mechanic and the blotter petal are described more than used to constrain choice. The grotto itself does not force a tactical decision—it's a beautiful container rather than an active pressure. No clear occupational or spatial detail alters Vera's final move.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Vera's final transaction and her hidden project to "fuse insight with empathy"—is signaled early but unfolds via summary ("for months, she'd been absorbing fragments") rather than on-page escalation. No credible reversal or tightening occurs; Vera's realization arrives as a threshold crossed off-stage, and her refusal to sell carries no visible cost (Felix's hollow state and their shared silence are atmospheric, not a foreclosed path). The piece declares transformation but does not dramatize a narrowing choice or trade-off under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—authenticity vs. counterfeit, the cost of true feeling—emerges cleanly from image and action without overt thesis. The blotter petal's glow and the final silence offer a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the closing line's "affectionate detachment" and "exactly what they both deserved" edges toward authorial summary rather than letting the image speak. The story resists moralizing but flirts with neat epiphany ("something worse, something better") where ambiguity would deepen.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and the prose carries a distinct, poetic texture ("amber grotto caught the dying light," "soft as shed skin"). Perceptual signature is controlled: Vera's sensory vocabulary (static, frequency, charge) anchors her professional lens. The phrase "affectionate detachment" recurs as both tone and self-description, creating a purposeful echo. Dialogue is minimal but functional. Under peak pressure the voice stays consistent, though "something worse, something better" briefly tilts abstract.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is mostly coherent ("cathedral and a crime scene," "static-charged silence"). Line-level clarity is strong with no loops or scaffold. One density slip: "Real joy hurt. Real grief sang. Real love was terrifying in its totality" stacks three declarative epiphanies in a row at the climax, flattening what should be the story's most charged beat. The closing paragraphs toggle between image and summary ("a woman who finally knew what she'd been missing"), slightly diluting propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The "emotion dealer" premise is a familiar SF trope, but the story personalizes it through Vera's seventeen-year arc and the blotter-petal mechanics. The half-truths framing and the static-electricity sensory method add specificity. However, the transformation follows a predictable path: dealer becomes vessel, counterfeit becomes real, final refusal grants authenticity. The turn feels more competent than surprising. No bold structural risk or non-obvious moral calculus elevates the design beyond a well-executed template.</comment>
