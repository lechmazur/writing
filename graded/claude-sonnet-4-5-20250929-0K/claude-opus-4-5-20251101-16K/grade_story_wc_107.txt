<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vera's interiority is concrete and character-particular through her narration habit, with embodied emotion in visible breath and the warming metaphor. The bookmark and her father's legacy motivate her present actions clearly. However, the internal arc from "frozen" to "melting" relies heavily on metaphor rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final stance feels more asserted than earned through on-page struggle with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through interleaved past (father's teachings, frozen years) and present (thawing, glasswork, emerging purpose). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Vera commits to her safe-zone project with visible cost in the shift from survival to vulnerability. The lens holds through the final image of melting ice and self, though the cost could be more tangible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The control room's high ceilings and central location directly enable Vera's choice to build a safe zone at the convergence point. Sensory details—dripping water, dead monitors, groaning ice—are selective and purposeful, tracking the thaw's progression. The portable torch and silica ground the glassblowing in tactile action. The environment both mirrors internal state (thawing) and constrains choice (space, resources, migration routes), charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: building a place for inquiry as the thaw enables reconnection. The tightening occurs through Vera's shift from mere survival to vulnerable openness, with the glass vessel as concrete proof of commitment. However, the escalation is more thematic deepening than tactical pressure—no antagonist or external complication tests her resolve on the page. The cost is conceptual (abandoning frozen self-protection) but could be more visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the glass-thaw-abandon constellation without stated morals. The bookmark, vessels, and narration habit are particular to Vera's world and constrain her choices. "Abandon" shifts meaning from loss to necessary release, and the final image (melting ice, melting self) reweights prior material without summary. The piece resists tidy closure while maintaining coherence. Strong integration of concept and action, though the epiphany about abandon feels slightly over-articulated in the middle section.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent: Vera's dramatic narration of the mundane creates a character-particular perceptual signature. POV distance remains stable; her knowledge and inference are plausibly bounded. Diction reflects her father's influence (vessels, curiosity, inquiry) without register drift. The self-narration device modulates effectively under emotional pressure. Minor slip: "thawing heart" in the father's notebook quote feels slightly too on-the-nose for the story's own metaphor, risking echo rather than organic emergence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high with most lines advancing character and atmosphere. No loops or scaffold detected. Some figurative language clusters near the middle ("frozen," "softening," "melting") but the repetition serves the central metaphor without muddling. Minor density loss in expository reflection about her mother and "the necessity of mere survival" that could compress further. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The glassblower-as-teacher in post-catastrophe setting is a fresh synthesis, grounded in specific craft detail (silica, copper oxide, thermal shock). The narration-as-survival-method device transforms a familiar trope. The transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on these exact particulars. The "thawing heart" metaphor risks proximity to common usage but is earned through concrete glasswork and environmental detail. Bold risk in the quiet, accumulative structure; the piece commits fully to its lyric mode.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Present throughout; Vera's choices to claim the control room, make vessels, and prepare for wanderers shape the narrative arc. Her decision to shift from survival to building a safe zone is the story's core turn. However, much action is contemplative summary rather than multiple distinct pressure beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Appears in three beats: pocket retrieval, the father's documentation context, and final return to pocket with thematic weight. It anchors Vera's motivation and reappears with modest reweighting at closure. However, it's not handled or used in ways that alter tactics; it remains primarily symbolic reminder rather than active tool.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Shapes stakes and tactics throughout: the physical thaw enables migration routes and Vera's safe-zone timing, while the metaphorical thaw drives her internal shift from frozen survival to vulnerable openness. The concept constrains her choices (she must act now, before passes clear) and charges the final image. Integral to both plot and theme.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The trait manifests in her narration habit ("dramatically narrating the mundane") which kept her "thoughtfully spirited when despair would have been easier." It enables her survival mechanism and current teaching role. However, it's more label-stated than demonstrated through contradictory on-page choices with visible tradeoffs.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Abandon" appears explicitly and implicitly across multiple beats: her mother abandoned them, the world abandoned sense, she nearly abandoned hope, and crucially she must "abandon control" to let glass (and people, and the era) become what they need to be. The reweighting of abandon from terror to release is the story's central turn and directly shapes the final image of melting/letting go.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Signaled in the opening ("This was her method") and demonstrated throughout with specific examples ("the glassblower prepares," "She selects," "The artisan must know"). The narration habit explains her survival, establishes voice, and frames the teaching role she'll inhabit. It shapes how she processes experience and prepares for her future role. However, it doesn't face dramatic pressure or cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The control room's high ceilings enable glassblowing, its central location at three migration routes dictates Vera's strategy, and its dead monitors contrast with her living purpose. The setting is chosen for tactical reasons (space, location) and its transformation from abandoned to inhabited mirrors theme. Dripping water and ice track time pressure. Essential to plot logic and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Present throughout: ice melting, passes clearing, rivers returning, birds calling. The accelerating thaw creates urgency (she must prepare before wanderers arrive) and parallels Vera's internal thaw. However, the timeframe functions more as backdrop and metaphor than as a ticking clock that alters specific tactical choices with immediate cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dramatized through concrete actions: claiming the space, building vessels for seeds/medicine/questions, preparing for wanderers. Rooted in her father's legacy and her own shift from survival to purpose. The motivation drives plot choices and shapes the ending. Modest friction appears in the risk of vulnerability ("dangerous and necessary"), though the cost remains more conceptual than embodied.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Coherent throughout: dramatic narration provides lightness ("the hope of a fool") while dead monitors, decades of ice, and grief anchor weight. Tone modulates purposefully—playful self-narration against survival stakes, lyric hopefulness tempered by acknowledged loss. The final image balances both registers (water running, bird calling, yet "cracked" bookmark, "refuses to remain empty"). Charges closure effectively.</comment>
