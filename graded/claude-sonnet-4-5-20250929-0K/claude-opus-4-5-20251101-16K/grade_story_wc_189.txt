**Drive Lens (inferred):** Accumulative/Textural — the story layers images (tidal pools, hermit crabs, cicadas, stars) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the young woman's request to be taught crystallizes a new configuration. Cost: Mira relinquishes the jade cicada heirloom; the young woman accepts uncertainty over certainty about her father.

<question>1</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira has genuine depth through the revelation that she once hated her grandmother for the same indirect approach she now practices — a real contradictory impulse that enriches the characterization. However, she operates smoothly within the wise-elder archetype; there's no visible cost or hesitation in giving away the heirloom. The young woman converts from resistance ("What does that have to do with anything?") to acceptance too quickly, without the friction that would make the encounter feel earned. Micro-choices (the indirect approach, sharing personal loss) are present but lack genuine struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, stakes) land by ~80 words. Under the accumulative lens, layered metaphors converge cleanly toward a Charged Poise closure: the young woman asks to learn Mira's way of watching, reconfiguring the encounter from seeking certainty to embracing liminality. The cost — giving away a generational heirloom, accepting the impossibility of a direct answer — is legible on the page. Structure is a single continuous scene with clean progression, though the causal chain is essentially conversational persuasion without complication.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The grotto is efficiently established with selective sensory anchors (fractured stone ceiling, salt air, starlight in wet eyes, distant waves). The jade cicada functions as a micro-setting object whose physical detail ("wings carved with such precision that light passed through them like stained glass") charges the closure. Setting serves thematic purpose as liminal space. However, the environment remains more atmospheric container than active constraint — it doesn't alter tactics or impose limits on choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Under the accumulative lens, density increases through layered metaphors, and Mira's personal revelation about her dying mother serves as the story's single meaningful intensification. But pressure remains gentle throughout — the young woman's resistance dissolves after one exchange, and no option is truly foreclosed or narrowed. The "escalation" is rhetorical rather than felt; the cost of accepting uncertainty is stated more than dramatized. No moment forces a genuine trade-off between competing goods.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The liminality theme develops well through particular images (hermit crab between shells, cicada's seventeen-year darkness), but is significantly undermined by explicit thematic statement throughout, especially in closing passages: "these between-spaces are not empty—they are where transformation happens," and the near-moralizing "holding space for all the uncertain, precious transitions yet to come." The final paragraph's "textured and tender and terribly beautiful" is explicit thesis language where a resonant image should stand alone. The metaphors work; their interpretation doesn't need narration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Mira with appropriate contemplative distance. Dialogue is differentiated — the young woman's terse directness ("Did your mother survive?") contrasts Mira's metaphorical indirection. However, expository interiority explains what's being shown: "Mira had learned to foresee not through prophecy but through this tangential approach, circling toward truth like water circling a drain" tells us the method rather than trusting the scene to demonstrate it. The perceptual signature (natural-world filter) is consistent but occasionally narrated rather than enacted.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong images in the middle section (hermit crab between shells, light through jade wings), but the final third weakens: "another transition, another threshold, another patient becoming" is a triple restatement; "textured and tender and terribly beautiful" is overwrought alliterative ornament; "holding space" reads as therapy-speak in a peak beat. Synonym churn around the transition concept (threshold, between-space, pause, in-between, liminal) accumulates without adding pressure. The closure beat carries the heaviest line-level debt.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The wise-elder-imparts-wisdom-through-nature-metaphors template is well-worn, and this story doesn't sufficiently transform it. The transformation test applies: different metaphors and a different symbolic object would produce essentially the same emotional arc. The tidal-pool chronicler concept and specific natural history (cicada's seventeen years, hermit crab's shell transition) provide particular texture but don't subvert the underlying pattern. The giving-of-the-heirloom-to-the-apprentice is a recognized archetype executed competently but without a non-obvious turn.</comment>
