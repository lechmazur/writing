<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's trembling hands and jittery nature are embodied consistently throughout, and her internal contradiction—rushing through moments while longing to extend them—drives her arc. The mentor's absence creates authentic motivation, and the final choice to stop and plant seeds feels earned by prior causality. Minor slip: the transformation from nervous courier to patient observer occurs swiftly in the final third without sufficient intermediate micro-choices showing the shift under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: the pendant hums, the aurora intensifies, and Mira's heartbeat slows in a pattern that builds toward the planting moment. Orientation anchors (ridgeway, aurora, courier) arrive within the first paragraph. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Mira's hands still, she plants seeds, and she adopts Tessoran's way of being with visible cost (she no longer rushes, forgoing efficiency). The cost is felt in the final image: she walks on but transformed, carrying the pendant's lesson.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The aurora-lit ridgeway with ancient stone markers provides vivid sensory grounding. The nightroot gathering scene uses micro-setting (herbs, silver light) to anchor the encounter. The pendant vibrating "sympathetically with the aurora" and the impossibly quick green shoots both constrain and charge the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the single continuous scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning to extend moments and embody Tessoran's presence—is signaled early and tightens when the pendant hums and the old woman appears. The reversal occurs when Mira stops instead of passing by, then deepens when she kneels to plant seeds and her hands still. The cost is legible: she forfeits her courier efficiency and rushes, accepting the slower path. One meaningful deepening is sufficient at this length, though the pressure could escalate more sharply in the middle third.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the pendant's sympathetic vibration, the nightroot seeds, and Mira's shift from rushing to staying. "Routine is where wonder hides" and "the fade from memory to myth is not a loss, but a transformation" are articulated on the page but grounded in the planting action and the aurora-charged moment. The final image—Mira walking on but no longer rushing—offers a resonant answer to the central question without stating a moral. The green shoots "as though time had folded itself" reweight prior material with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Mira's perceptual signature: "Most deliveries were mundane" and "she might have imagined it" filter the world through her courier lens. The old woman's dialogue ("Grows only when the lights dance") carries natural rhythm and subtext. Minor slip: "Understanding bloomed within her" edges toward filter-heavy summary at a peak beat, though the surrounding concrete action (pendant vibration, seed planting) maintains immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high: the opening paragraph establishes character, setting, and stakes efficiently. "The dragonfly-wing pendant rested against her chest" and "a handful of small seeds" are specific and concrete. Minor deductions: "You must learn to stay" in the flashback and "remain there, trembling hands stilled at last" in the climax echo each other's theme too closely (paraphrase loop, −0.2); "she felt her heartbeat slow despite herself" and "felt it resonating with her own bones" cluster filter verbs in a high-pressure sequence (−0.3).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—mentor's absence teaching presence through a sympathetic-vibration pendant—offers a fresh angle on the apprentice-inherits-wisdom trope. The aurora-lit ridgeway, nightroot seeds that germinate instantly, and the boundary between "real and story" grow thin create specific, non-generic grounding. The turn (Mira stops instead of passing by) is earned in hindsight by the pendant's hum and Tessoran's prior teaching. Risk-taking in the final third (the old woman vanishing, seeds sprouting impossibly fast) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's jittery nature is present from the opening line and her decision to stop beside the path (rather than rush past) creates the key turn. Her final choice to kneel and plant seeds, then walk on without rushing, alters her tactics and forecloses the path of haste. Setup clear, middle choice present (stopping for the old woman), closure participation strong (planting and walking transformed). Causal pressure moderate; the trait enables the ending but does not narrow options sharply in the middle third.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The pendant appears in the opening third, hums subtly in the middle, then vibrates strongly at the climax and is touched once in the final line. It enables Mira to feel time stretch and her heartbeat slow, constraining her perception and enabling the stopping choice. Closure linkage solid: "she touched the dragonfly-wing pendant once, feeling it thrum with sympathetic light" charges the final image. Three beats (setup, intensification, reprise), causal pressure present, irreplaceable mechanics (sympathetic vibration), minor cost (her reliance on Tessoran's gift).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tessoran's absence is established in the opening ("vanished three summers past") and her teaching ("You must learn to stay") frames Mira's struggle. The old woman's line "Tessoran said you would come" and the seeds "have been waiting" tie the absent mentor to the climax choice. Closure participation strong: Mira internalizes Tessoran's way of being and "the fade from memory to myth" becomes the resolution. Causal pressure moderate; the concept shapes stakes but does not create a visible tradeoff in the middle third.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Extends brief encounters" is Tessoran's signature trait, explained in flashback and modeled when Mira stops for the old woman. The attribute constrains Mira's default behavior (she would have "nodded and passed by") and enables the climax action (she "remained there...as long as she could"). Closure participation present: she walks on "no longer rushed." Setup clear, middle choice enabled, cost visible (efficiency sacrificed). Modest causal pressure; the trait is more thematic accent than mechanical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Germinate" appears in Mira's dialogue ("she said it could germinate dreams"), in the old woman's teaching ("coax it out gently, like seedlings from dark soil"), and in the climax action when seeds sprout impossibly fast. The seeds' instant growth redefines the pendant's power and Mira's understanding. Closure participation strong: the green shoots visualize the transformation. Causal role moderate; the action resolves the story but does not create multiple mid-story turns. Swappability low; the organic metaphor is specific to the wonder-from-routine theme.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sympathetic vibration is signaled early ("a vibration so subtle she might have imagined it"), explained at the climax ("by vibrating sympathetically with the world, extended moments"), and reprised in the final line ("feeling it thrum with sympathetic light"). The mechanics shape Mira's perception (heartbeat slows, time stretches) and enable her stopping choice. Closure linkage solid. Causal pressure moderate; the method is more explanatory than constraining in the middle beats. Irreplaceability high; the physics metaphor is unique to this story.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ridgeway with ancient stone markers and aurora overhead is established in the opening and the aurora intensifies at the climax ("colors bleeding into one another"). The nightroot "grows only when the lights dance" ties setting to action. The setting charges the final image ("aurora-lit ridgeway," "dancing night"). Setup clear, middle involvement moderate (the old woman gathers herbs under the aurora), closure participation present. Causal pressure modest; the setting provides atmosphere more than constraint. Two gates solid, one moderate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe is announced thematically ("the fade from memory to myth") and embodied in Tessoran's three-summer absence and the instant seed germination ("as though time had folded itself"). The concept reweights the ending: Mira understands transformation as process, not loss. Setup present (Tessoran's disappearance), closure participation strong (final paragraph articulates the theme). Development weak; the middle beats do not dramatize fading or myth-making in action. The timeframe is more conceptual frame than live constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Mira's desire to coax wonder is established through Tessoran's teaching ("You rush through moments") and the old woman's line ("routine is where wonder hides"). The climax dramatizes the friction: Mira must sacrifice efficiency to plant seeds and extend the moment. Closure participation strong: she walks on "no longer rushed," learning "that wonder lives in pausing." Setup clear, middle choice present (stopping for the old woman), cost visible (courier speed forfeited). Causal pressure moderate; the motivation is more thematic through-line than acute want-versus-cost trade-off.</comment>
