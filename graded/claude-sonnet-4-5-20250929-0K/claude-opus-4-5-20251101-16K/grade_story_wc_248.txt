<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation—rescuing her mother's promise—drives her actions throughout, but her analytical intuition is mostly label-only, asserted rather than demonstrated through micro-choices under pressure. Internal contradiction is thin; she moves from searching to reunion without visible emotional trade-offs or genuine struggle that would narrow options. The reunion itself unfolds without cost: no foreclosed path, no renunciation, just validation. Vera's twenty-year survival is declared plausible via "sustainable gardens" but never tested against Mira's expectations or doubts in a way that creates felt friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where by the opening paragraph; the drive lens reads Causal (trail → clues → reunion). A decisive change occurs on-page: Mira finds Vera alive. However, the cost is unclear—years of arson and sacrifice are mentioned in summary, but the reunion itself imposes no visible price or foreclosure. The final beat validates all prior choices without reweighting options or meaning, landing closer to wish-fulfillment than earned closure. One meaningful tightening (the vandalized portrait as code) narrows the path, satisfying minimal escalation, but the ending lacks the felt cost required for high-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The Archive of Kaleth is vivid and purposeful: obsidian tablets, phosphorescent moss, and underground waters provide concrete atmosphere. Spatial choreography is clear (corridors, eastern gallery, bridge, dwelling). The archive supplies resources (monitoring chambers, gardens, water systems) that enable Vera's survival, though these are told rather than shown constraining a live choice. The tapestry fragment and vandalized portrait function as micro-setting objects that guide Mira's final move, meeting the 9+ gate criterion. However, the setting does not pressure Mira's choices in real time—she decodes at will without environmental resistance—so the score remains mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reuniting with Vera—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira decodes the vandalized portrait, narrowing her search to the eastern gallery. Yet escalation is thin: Mira encounters no obstacles in the archive itself, no decision between competing goods, no moment where her analytical gift imposes a trade-off. The reunion unfolds without cost; no path is foreclosed, no want conflicts with need. Agency at closure is present (she runs to the dwelling) but the action is reactive rather than a choice under pressure. Luck (Vera's survival, the archive's resources) enables rather than complicates, violating the coincidence-may-complicate-not-resolve rule.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—love's trail through impossible places, art as message—emerges from images (fires, tapestry, vandalized portrait) rather than statement. The final reunion offers thematic resonance: "Every fire you set was a signal I could track" reweights Mira's arson as communication, not destruction. However, the ending tidy-ties the moral question without ambiguity or cost: both mother and daughter are validated, no flaws confronted, no wisdom earned through struggle. The phrase "volcanic tenderness" recurs as a thematic label but does not constrain choice or deepen complexity. Subtext operates in the vandalized portrait, but dialogue in the final scene ("I knew you would come") tells rather than implies.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV held cleanly; no head-hopping. Psychic distance is stable, and perceptual signature is present: Mira reads patterns, sees "meaning where others saw only ash." Voice carries distinct texture ("ember-warm," "lava cooling into new earth") though elevated diction occasionally drifts from the POV's implied register ("analytical intuition," "volcanic tenderness" as repeated phrase). Dialogue in the reunion scene is functional but borders on expository ("My art revealed secrets powerful people wanted buried"). The final exchange tells emotional stakes directly rather than embedding subtext. Filter verbs ("seemed to dissolve," "felt like lava") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Purposeful compression is absent; the piece unfolds in straightforward chronology.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings are mostly distinct. Information density is adequate, though the opening two paragraphs summarize backstory that could anchor in present action. "Volcanic tenderness" appears twice as a stock phrase without fresh grounding each time (−0.3). The reunion beat summarizes Mira's emotional release ("years of searching dissolving into tears") rather than dramatizing it with embodied action. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs detected. Metaphors are coherent if elevated: "lava cooling into new earth" works, but "ember-warm" and "amber light" stack warm-glow imagery without advancing pressure. Clarity is high; grammar clean. The final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("a masterpiece no one else would ever witness") rather than trusting the image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Premise—arsonist daughter decodes artist mother's hidden trail—is specific and synthesizes familiar elements (lost parent, coded messages, hidden archive). However, core beats follow a predictable template: clues → decoding → reunion without obstacle or surprise. The vandalized portrait as deliberate code is a solid turn, but the resolution (alive, waiting, validating) is the safest possible outcome. Emotional specificity is present in the mother-daughter bond, yet the ending grants full satisfaction without irony or cost. Transformation test: swap names and the arc remains unchanged. No bold risk-taking; the piece executes competently within genre expectations but does not subvert or deepen them.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and her role as arsonist frames the backstory. However, on-page she decodes and runs; no key turn results from a choice she makes under pressure in the archive itself. The arson is summarized, not dramatized, and does not constrain her final move. Functional but largely passive within the present action.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The tapestry fragment appears early (paragraph 5), is handled ("held"), and guides Mira's final journey by matching obsidian records. It returns with reweighted meaning at closure: the trail it represents is validated. Two beats (initial study, matching records) and closure linkage place it mid-band. However, the fragment itself does not constrain a choice or impose cost—Mira decodes it without friction—so it remains under 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The vandalized self-portrait is introduced mid-story (paragraph 6), and Mira decodes the slashed pattern as deliberate code, narrowing her search to the eastern gallery. This causal role in one key turn satisfies mid-band criteria. The portrait also reappears in the final paragraph ("the vandalized self-portrait remained") with thematic reprise ("not destruction but direction"). Setup is delayed but development and payoff are clear, and the portrait's specific pattern (black paint slashes) matters. Swappability is low; removing it breaks the decoding beat.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Analytically intuitive" is asserted in paragraph 2 and again when Mira studies the portrait ("analytical mind… intuition screamed certainty"). Yet no on-page action demonstrates the trait constraining or enabling a choice with cost. She decodes successfully without visible trade-off or failure. Label-only use without dramatized friction or visible price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Portray" appears as Vera's method: she "portrayed [Mira's] face in everything" and embedded her name in each piece. This action drives the entire trail mechanic and is causally active across beats (library artworks, tapestry, portrait). The ending hinges on this method—Mira's ability to recognize her mother's visual language. Removing "portray" would require a different signal system. Two beats (artworks, portrait) plus closure linkage and irreplaceability push it into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The trail of artistic creations is signaled early (paragraph 2: "series of artistic creations scattered across institutions") and shapes Mira's journey throughout. Multiple beats: library fires to salvage works, tapestry fragment, vandalized portrait. The trail's mechanics matter—only Mira can decode the hidden messages—and it culminates in the handwritten note and reunion. Causal pressure across beats and closure participation. Specificity is high; the trail is irreplaceable. All three gates present.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The Archive of Kaleth is introduced early (paragraph 1), supplies resources that enable Vera's survival (gardens, water, monitoring chambers), and houses the decoding action (obsidian tablets, eastern gallery, underground bridge). The setting pressures Mira's choices by containing the final clues and shaping the reunion's spatial choreography. Three beats (arrival, decoding chamber, eastern gallery) plus closure participation. Removing the archive would break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"After going off the grid three years ago" anchors the timeframe early (paragraph 1). However, the three years function as backstory; they do not tighten present decisions or create a live clock. The archive sequence unfolds without time pressure—Mira decodes "through the night" but no urgency alters tactics. Setup present, but no middle or closure involvement. Cap applies for missing development and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mira's motivation—to rescue the promise ("I'll find my way back to you")—is dramatized early (paragraph 3) and drives every choice: the fires, the search, the final run to the dwelling. The promise recurs at closure when Vera acknowledges it ("You rescued my promise"). Two beats (opening frame, final acknowledgment) and closure linkage. However, the motivation is never conflicted on-page—no moment where Mira weighs abandoning the search or questions the cost. Desire is clear and coherent but lacks internal friction or visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Volcanic tenderness" appears twice as a phrase (paragraphs 6 and 13) and describes the story's intended emotional register: fierce love, fragility, immense pressure. The tone is coherent through the reunion. However, it does not modulate meaningfully—Mira's emotional state remains elevated throughout without contrast or breakdown. The phrase itself is asserted rather than embodied in rhythm or action. Functional but static; one modest reprise without causal charge at closure.</comment>
