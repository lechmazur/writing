<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's weariness is embodied through "weariness had become her second skin" and her inadvertent stubbornness drives the central choice to repair the lens despite retirement. The interiority is concrete and character-particular ("she could never quite let go of things that needed mending"). The final renunciation—giving her own archive's light to create a new beacon—carries visible cost and forecloses rest. Minor slip: the spirits' doubt feels ornamental rather than a genuine obstacle that complicates her choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "the stillness had stopped running. And so had she." The cost is felt—her weariness, stubbornness, and need for peace are absorbed into the lens, creating a new beacon while she remains unrested. Orientation anchors quickly (Drowned Archives, Maren's desk, underwater library). One meaningful deepening occurs when she presses her archive to the lens, transforming distress into purpose. The final image reweights prior material (chased stillness now caught) with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The impossible-space architecture constrains movement and charges atmosphere: "Corridors existed in the gaps between water molecules" shapes how Maren navigates. The broken lens as micro-setting drives the repair choice. The Hall of Unfinished Stories provides the spatial crucible for closure. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("salt dark," "glass shards littered the seafloor"). The library's impossible geometry returns at the ending to frame her stillness, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: giving the trapped spirits rest (and by extension, her own need for closure). One meaningful tightening occurs when the lens cannot be repaired—"too much was missing"—forcing Maren to sacrifice her own archive. The choice is protagonist-driven and forecloses the path of remaining detached from fieldwork. Cost is legible: her weariness and need for peace are consumed to create the new beacon. The spirits' inability to find their books without guidance raises urgency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the need to give others the peace one cannot find for oneself. The broken lens → repaired beacon → chased stillness progression reweights the opening without stating a moral. Maren's paradox (an undertaker who cannot bury her own exhaustion) is explored through concrete action—pressing her archive to the lens. The final image offers a resonant answer: she stops chasing, though weariness remains. No thematic echo; the ending trusts the image. The phrase "distress signals...like heartbeats instead of screams" reconfigures suffering into livable rhythm.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Maren notices through the lens of care and repair ("fingers kept tracing its cracks, inadvertently stubborn"). Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and purposeful: "chased stillness" and "motion that had finally caught what it pursued" create rhythmic coherence. Under peak stress (the repair scene), compression serves pressure without losing clarity. Free indirect style is clean: "Not for the dead themselves, but for what they needed." Voice modulates appropriately from weary observation to quiet resolve at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "kelp and silence" establishes underwater setting and tone). Rhythm varies purposefully: short declaratives at key turns ("She was still weary. Still inadvertently stubborn.") contrast with longer syntactic patterns earlier. Minor loop: "distress signals" appears frequently without always advancing new meaning. The phrase "occupying impossible spaces" recurs but each use adds specificity. No figurative muddle. Sentence openings vary. The final paragraph's repetition ("Still...Still...Still") is pattern-taught and charges closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The underwater-library-as-archive concept is transformed through specificity: "books wrote themselves with the memories of those who died mid-sentence" feels fresh. The choice to repair via self-sacrifice rather than technical fix avoids generic solutions. "Chased stillness" as both premise and resolution offers a non-obvious angle. Minor proximity concern: the "impossible spaces" phrasing echoes common SFF tropes without full transformation. The ending's reversal (stillness stops running when she stops) feels earned in hindsight. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren drives all key turns: choosing to descend, gathering shards, pressing her archive to the lens. Her weariness and stubbornness constrain tactics throughout. Present in setup, middle beats, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Appears in opening beat, middle (gathering shards), and closure (warm in her lap). Its cracks and distress signals drive the repair choice. Reweighted at ending: from frozen distress to purposeful glow. Irreplaceable; the story's logic depends on this exact object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Distress signals shape stakes (three trapped spirits) and tactics (the need to repair the beacon). Present throughout: opening pulse, overlapping cacophony in the Hall, final softened heartbeats. The concept alters options and is reweighted at closure (screams → heartbeats).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Inadvertently stubborn" enables the core choice: "her fingers kept tracing its cracks" leads to descent despite retirement. Visible in the refusal to let go and the final repair. The trait constrains her rest and drives the sacrifice. Cost: she remains weary.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Revitalize" defines the climactic turn: pressing her archive to the lens transforms broken light into new purpose. This action could not be swapped; repair was impossible, revitalization redefines the solution. Shapes the closure image directly.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Signaled early ("walk sideways through reality, slipping into crevices"). Used during the repair: "occupying the impossible spaces between their jagged edges." Shapes one key turn but could be more causally central; the method enables but does not complicate the solution.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The Drowned Archives and Hall of Unfinished Stories provide both resources (the archive's pages) and obstacles (impossible geometry). Setting pressures movement and supplies the repair's raw material. The library's nature (cataloging the dead) is indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The package's arrival frames the opening and triggers descent. Time is present but not tightened into urgency; the weaker distress signals add mild pressure. The timeframe structures causality but does not constrain tactics moment-to-moment.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Maren's desire to give rest a permanent address is dramatized in every choice: recognizing the signature, descending, gathering shards, sacrificing her archive. Friction is clear—she gives others peace she cannot touch herself. The motivation drives the ending and carries visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Chased stillness" is seeded early, modulates through the repair sequence ("motion that had finally caught what it pursued"), and charges the final image: "the stillness had stopped running. And so had she." Tone is coherent and purposeful throughout, reweighting the premise at closure.</comment>
