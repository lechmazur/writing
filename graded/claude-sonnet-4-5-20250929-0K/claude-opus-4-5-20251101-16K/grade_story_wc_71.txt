<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is richly textured and embodied—the orris root warming in her palm, her understanding of absence through survival rather than study. However, the piece leans heavily on reflective summary ("inadvertently profound in her understanding of absence") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice to place the orris root and whisper "I see you" feels more like completion of a meditation than a decision that forecloses a live path with visible cost, leaving agency somewhat diffuse.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the story gathers fragments (displaced objects, the hush-shard, grandmother's envelope) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Maren's act of noticing sanctifies the space. Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (Maren, Alcott house, spring evening). The closure—"I see you" and the house exhaling—delivers a felt shift in stance with cost implied (years of loneliness, the decision to stay through the night), though the price reads more atmospheric than stark. One meaningful deepening occurs when she discovers the hush-shard and understands houses collect silence, reweighting her quest.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The attic bay window, the specific violet scent of aged orris root, and the displaced objects (teacup on windowsill, sock in grate) are vivid and purposeful. The "shard of hush embedded in the window frame" functions as micro-setting that charges the final image—Maren touches it, hears "nothing so loudly," and places her own offering there. The quiet bay holding the moon's reflection anchors the closure moment with concrete sensory weight, and the spring setting subtly mirrors Maren's own seasonal return and emotional thaw.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: "why some houses feel alive." Pressure accumulates through the discovery sequence (displaced objects → attic → hush-shard) and tightens when Maren realizes the sanctification method and commits her own offering. The final act—placing the orris root and whispering recognition—narrows options (she stays through the night, completes the circuit) with a cost legible in her solitude and the years spent seeking this answer. However, the escalation reads more as deepening understanding than a decision that trades away a concrete alternative, keeping the stakes more contemplative than urgent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: houses as vessels of accumulated silence, noticing as an act of love, sanctification through displacement rather than ritual. The orris root's violet scent "dormant until warmth released it" mirrors the house waiting for witness, and "I see you" answers the central question without moralizing. The piece resists tidy resolution—Maren's loneliness persists even as she completes the sanctification—and the final image (spring indifferent, house exhaling) reweights the premise with quiet resonance. One slip: "inadvertently profound" borders on thematic self-commentary, though it's attributed to her nature rather than an epiphany.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and controlled: "creeping normality noticer," "streetlights were daydreaming," "hushed blaze of presence." Psychic distance remains stable in close third, and the prose reflects Maren's perceptual signature—she notices incremental shifts others miss. The phrase "inadvertently profound" reads slightly meta but stays within character. Diction remains consistent (no register drift), and the rhythm modulates effectively between reflective passages and the discovery beats in the attic. No dialogue present to evaluate, but internal voice is specific and sustained under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high in key beats (the displaced objects catalogued with precision, the hush-shard description). However, several passages loop: "inadvertently profound" appears twice, both times with nearly identical framing; "the way houses held the people who'd left them" and "abandoned things...waiting" restate the same idea across paragraphs. The phrase "hushed blaze" in "a hushed blaze of presence" feels contradictory (hush implies quiet, blaze implies noise/heat) without resolution. Figurative density is high throughout without always advancing pressure, especially in the middle third where metaphor stacks ("liquid state between function and forgetting," "dusk's knife-edge") without tightening stakes.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Shard of hush" as a quasi-physical phenomenon is a fresh synthesis, and the method of sanctification through displaced objects offers a non-obvious angle on haunted-house material. The orris root detail—three years aged, violet scent dormant until warmth—demonstrates specific knowledge that grounds the mysticism. However, the core emotional arc (lonely observer finds meaning by witnessing an abandoned space) follows a familiar template, and the transformation hinges more on Maren's realization than on a choice with competing costs. The piece commits fully to its premise and executes at a high level within accumulative mode, elevating familiar loneliness through sensory specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maren as "creeping normality noticer" is established early (pier creeping closer, dialect softening) and her observational stance drives the discovery sequence: she notices the displaced objects, identifies the pattern, finds the hush-shard, and completes the sanctification. However, observation itself is the primary action—her decisions (entering the house, climbing to the attic, placing the orris root) feel more like steps in a meditative process than choices that alter tactics under pressure. The trait enables the closure but doesn't constrain her with visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orris root appears in three distinct beats: Maren carries it in her pocket with backstory (grandmother's envelope, prior use in her childhood home), she withdraws it in the attic as her own displaced object, and its violet scent blooms as part of the sanctification. The shard's aged quality and dormant-until-warmth property mirror the house's waiting state, charging the final image. Its placement on the windowsill completes the circuit and is causally essential to the closure. Could score higher if the middle beat (feeling the wood grain shiver) were dramatized rather than summarized, but the element is strongly integrated.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Shard of hush" shapes the story's central logic: Maren seeks to understand why houses feel alive, discovers accumulated silence crystallizes into something "almost physical," and finds a literal fragment embedded in the window frame. The concept drives her recognition ("This was why houses felt alive"), reweights her understanding of absence and presence, and anchors the closure moment when she touches it and hears "nothing so loudly." The hush as both metaphor and quasi-material object is indispensable—removing it would collapse the story's explanatory stakes and the tactile final image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Inadvertently profound" is mentioned twice but functions more as a label for Maren's reflective nature than as a trait that constrains or enables action. The term appears in the phrase "inadvertently profound in her understanding of absence" and again when she whispers "something inadvertently profound" at closure, but both instances describe rather than demonstrate. The attribute doesn't create a visible tradeoff or alter her choices—she could be "deeply insightful" or "intuitively wise" without changing the story's mechanics. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Sanctify" is signaled early ("someone had been trying to sanctify the space"), drives Maren's recognition of the displacement method, and structures her final act: placing the orris root as an offering to "make the silence holy." The action redefines the story's stakes from passive observation to active consecration, and the closure hinges on this exact verb—"sanctifying the ordinary hush into something worth believing in." Removing "sanctify" in favor of "bless" or "honor" would dilute the specificity of ritual-through-displacement. The concept is causally essential and appears in at least three beats with evolving weight.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The method of displaced objects is signaled early (teacup, sock, earring, marble catalogued as "each object wrong, yet each placed with care") and Maren explicitly understands it: "through things that didn't belong but somehow did." She replicates the method by placing her own displaced object (orris root) on the windowsill, completing the pattern. The mechanics matter—displacement is the means by which sanctification occurs, not prayer or ritual. However, the method's causal pressure is modest: Maren doesn't struggle with how to displace or what cost it extracts; she simply follows the established pattern. Present across beats and shapes the ending, but could be more urgent.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The quiet bay in spring anchors the story's atmosphere and appears in key moments: Maren returns "this spring," the bay is "softened to the color of old photographs" visible from the attic window, and the final image shows "the quiet bay hold the moon's reflection." The season subtly mirrors Maren's emotional state (years alone, spring as renewal). However, the setting functions more as backdrop than constraint—it doesn't pressure her choices or supply resources that alter outcome. The bay charges the final image with its patient holding of the moon, but this is primarily lyric resonance rather than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"While the streetlights daydream" is introduced in the opening paragraph ("daydreaming...amber glow softened to a dim pulse") and returns at closure ("the streetlights flickered toward true darkness, their daydream ending"). The timeframe marks dusk's passage and brackets Maren's vigil, but it doesn't tighten decisions or create urgency—she stays "through the spring night" without a clock pressuring her moves. The metaphor is poetic and coherent, but time remains atmospheric rather than a live constraint. Present at beginning and end with thematic weight, but doesn't alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The desire "to understand why some houses feel alive" is stated early and drives every beat: Maren enters the house to answer this "haunting" question, interprets the displaced objects as clues, discovers the hush-shard as the answer, and completes her understanding by sanctifying the space. The motivation is dramatized through action (climbing to the attic, touching the shard, placing her offering) and complicated by her own loneliness ("her own house feeling emptier every year"). Cost is present—years of solitude spent seeking this answer—though the friction between want and price could be sharper. The quest is causally essential and resolved on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Hushed blaze" is present in the phrase "a hushed blaze of presence that warmed without burning" and implicitly throughout the piece's tonal balance: quiet accumulation (hush, silence, dust motes suspended) layered with intensity (the house exhales, ears ring from hearing nothing loudly). The tone modulates from contemplative in the displaced-object catalog to charged at the attic discovery, then resolves to reverent stillness at closure. However, "hushed blaze" as a phrase contains an unresolved contradiction (quiet versus combustion) that the text doesn't fully reconcile. The tone is coherent and supports pressure, but the exact formulation feels more ornamental than structurally load-bearing.</comment>
