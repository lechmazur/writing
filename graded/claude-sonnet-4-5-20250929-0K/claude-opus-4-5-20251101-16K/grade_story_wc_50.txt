<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority shows consistent peripheral focus applied to locks and echoes, and her motivation (preserving wonder against grief) drives the harvest obsession. The apprentice's death and workshop loss provide stakes, but the grief remains abstract—no embodied contradiction or mistake under pressure. The final choice to release one echo feels inevitable given her established trait, but we never see her wrestle with competing impulses in a single scene. Competence is unbalanced: she succeeds at every step without visible struggle or cost that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of echo-collection across weeks, building density through chalk tracings, crystal captures, and the timer's reverse-engineering. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Maren emerges with seventeen crystals and continues her trade, the harvest stored against despair. Cost is visible—she visits the cellar "when grief threatened to calcify"—and the final image reweights wonder as mappable magic. One meaningful deepening occurs when she discovers the timer contains "frozen sound waves," which reconfigures her method. Orientation is clean (locksmith, autumn-to-winter, marble cavern beneath monastery) by the second paragraph. A single continuity slip: "her own laughter from years ago, still echoing from some forgotten visit" implies she'd been there before, but the opening presents this as a new descent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The marble cavern's acoustics are integrated throughout: morning light yields low echoes, afternoon warmth raises them, evening compresses. These time-dependent reflection angles directly enable her harvest method (studying angles, tracing paths with chalk). The crystals function as micro-setting objects that constrain her technique and charge the closure image (seventeen sealed, one released). Spatial choreography is clear (chamber's heart, upper fissures, walls marked with chalk). The only thinness: the monastery and valley plague are mentioned but never affect a present choice—decoration rather than constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserve wonder against grief by harvesting echoes. The plague's losses (workshop, apprentice, certainty) are declared but never test her on the page; she succeeds at each step without a visible trade-off or tactic shift. One tightening occurs when she discovers the timer's mechanism mid-process, which deepens her understanding and enables the crystal sealing. No reversal or complication: the echoes cooperate, the crystals work, she emerges victorious. The final act (releasing one echo to counter despair) narrows a live option—she could hoard or spend recklessly—but the price is told, not shown. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres but does not escalate with felt cost until the summary ending.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges clearly: wonder and reason can coexist when magic is understood, not dissolved by examination. The peripherally-focused method (locksmith's sidelong watching) becomes a motif that brackets the piece and charges the closure ("that peripheral space where both can exist"). The timer's reverse-engineering concretizes the idea: frozen oscillations released gradually. Subtext operates in "store wonder in the cellar of reason, for later"—an image of deferred survival. One weakness: the final paragraph states the theme overtly ("she had learned, grow stronger when you find where reason and mystery intersect"), risking a thematic echo. The ending image (releasing one echo, "preserved not by magic she didn't understand, but by magic she did") reweights the premise non-literally and avoids outright moralizing, keeping the score in the high 7s rather than capping lower.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Maren throughout; no head-hopping. Voice is controlled and distinct: "catch time and release it later," "wounded season," "calcify into despair." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer during discovery of the timer's mechanics, wider during the summary harvest weeks). Two frictions: (1) "asymmetric phrase structure and elevated diction ("oscillations—frozen sound waves pressed into crystalline form") clash slightly with the locksmith's practical idiom established early, though the shift tracks her growing obsession; (2) no dialogue on the page, so that test is not applicable. Free indirect style is clean. Perceptual signature (peripheral focus, reflective turning-over of problems) remains consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the timer-discovery beat ("captured oscillations—frozen sound waves pressed into crystalline form. Her grandmother had somehow known how to solidify the intangible"). Two line-level issues: (1) Minor paraphrase loop in paragraph 4: "watching the edges" and "catching them sidelong" restate the same tactic without added pressure (−0.2); (2) "wounded season" recurs three times (title paragraph, "wounded weeks," "wounded season passed") without evolving meaning—template cadence rather than taught pattern (−0.4). The closure image is clean and propulsive. Grammar and tense are consistent. No filter-verb stacks or register drift in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The synthesis—locksmith's peripheral focus applied to echo-harvesting via reverse-engineered timer crystals—feels specific and earned. The premise (harvesting sound as physical substance) transforms a familiar "magic has rules" trope through the marble cavern's acoustics and the timer's frozen oscillations. Emotional truth (grief seeking wonder's preservation) anchors the fantastical mechanism. One point of safety-hedging: Maren succeeds at every step without visible failure, avoiding bold risk. The final image (releasing one apprentice-echo, "preserved not by magic she didn't understand, but by magic she did") offers a non-obvious emotional inflection that grows from the locksmith's trade. Transformation test passes: swapping names/places would lose the cavern's acoustic specificity and the timer's crystalline logic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maren's reflective nature is stated early and demonstrated throughout (turning problems over, never looking directly at echoes). Her choices create the key turns: descending to the cavern, reverse-engineering the timer, sealing seventeen crystals, visiting the cellar when grief threatens. The final decision to release one echo alters her tactic from hoarding to measured use. Setup (first paragraph), development (multiple middle choices), and closure participation (she continues collecting, releases one echo) are all present. Specificity: her peripheral focus directly enables the harvest method. Friction: observation dominates; the only on-page decision with visible cost is the release, which is summarized rather than dramatized. Cost connection is light—visiting the cellar is mentioned but not shown as a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The timer mechanism is introduced in the first paragraph, handled across multiple beats (laid out in pieces, discovered to contain frozen oscillations, reconstructed), and returns at closure ("seventeen crystals and a reconstructed timer"). Its unique property—releasing preserved moments gradually—shapes Maren's method and enables the crystal sealing. Setup, development, and payoff are all present. Causal pressure: without the timer's mechanics, she cannot harvest echoes. Closure linkage: the reconstructed timer and crystals are the tangible proof of her success. Friction: the timer is described and understood but not physically used in a second distinct beat after reconstruction; it enables rather than complicates a choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Harvesting echoes is the story's engine: Maren traces sound paths, captures standing waves in crystals, and stores them for later release. The concept frames stakes (preserve wonder) and shapes tactics (studying angles, speaking into darkness, sealing phrases). Setup (paragraph 2, "echoes could be harvested"), development (paragraphs 8–9, collecting specific echoes), and closure ("harvest in a cellar," releasing one echo) are present. Causal pressure: without the harvest, no story. Friction: the harvest succeeds at every step without complication; it is more theme than contested stake. Cost connection is indirect—the echoes counter despair but their collection does not incur a visible price.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Peripheral focus is introduced in the first paragraph ("effective at her craft was being peripherally focused") and applied twice: watching locks' edges and catching echoes sidelong. The trait enables her method (paragraph 4, "never looking directly at the echoes but catching them sidelong") with a trade-off implied—direct attention would fail—but not tested on the page. Setup and development are present; closure participation is weaker (the final image mentions "that peripheral space" but the trait does not constrain the ending choice). Cost: the trait enables rather than limits, so no visible price. Specificity is high; removing it would break the mechanics. One friction: label-only in the final paragraph ("that peripheral space") without new action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Reverse-engineering drives the middle: Maren lays out the timer (paragraph 3), discovers its mechanics (paragraph 6, "frozen sound waves"), and reconstructs it (paragraph 10, "reconstructed timer"). The action is signaled early and recurs across beats. Setup, development, and payoff are present. Causal pressure: understanding the timer's oscillations enables the crystal-sealing method. Closure linkage: she emerges with a "reconstructed timer," though it is not used in the final image. Friction: the reverse-engineering succeeds without complication; it unlocks the method but does not force a tactical shift or cost. Swappability test: "study" or "decode" could replace it with minor edits, lowering irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Studying reflection angles is introduced in paragraph 5 ("studying reflection angles at different times") and demonstrated (morning/afternoon/evening light changes echo behavior). The method shapes her approach and is signaled early. Setup and development are present; closure participation is absent—the final image does not return to angle-study. Causal pressure is moderate: the angles enable echo-tracing but do not constrain a later choice. Friction: the method is described once in a single beat, not revisited or complicated. Cost connection is missing. Swappability: "studying echo patterns" could replace it with minor edits. One beat involvement, no closure linkage, moderate specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The marble cavern is introduced early (paragraph 2, "marble cavern beneath abandoned monastery," "Resonance Hall") and its properties shape tactics throughout: veins catch light, acoustics enable echo-tracing, marble warms by afternoon affecting sound. Setup, development (paragraphs 5 and 8, chalk on walls, "marble darkness"), and payoff (paragraph 10, "emerged from the marble cavern") are present. Causal pressure: without the cavern's resonance, no harvest. Closure linkage: she emerges from it with the crystals, though the setting does not charge the final cellar image. Friction: the cavern enables rather than complicates; it is a resource, not a constraint. Micro-setting (crystals, chalk) charges beats more than the cavern itself.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe ("twilight of a wounded season—autumn limping toward winter," "across those wounded weeks," "when winter finally arrived") is signaled early and brackets the piece. Setup is present; development is vague—"days" and "weeks" lack specific pressure. Closure participation: "the wounded season passed. Others followed" summarizes time but does not tighten a decision. Friction: time is atmospheric, not a constraint; no deadline or clock forces a choice. The "lull" suggests slack rather than urgency, matching an Accumulative design but lowering stake tension. Cost connection is absent. Swappability: any long span could replace it. One structural role (framing), no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is stated in paragraph 7 ("store wonder in the cellar of reason, for later") and contextualized (plague losses, grief, lost certainty). The desire drives the harvest obsession and shapes the ending (visiting the cellar when grief threatens, releasing one echo). Setup, development (collecting seventeen echoes), and closure (she continues the practice) are present. Friction: the motivation is told more than dramatized—she never wrestles with conflicting wants on the page. Cost connection is present but light: grief's threat is mentioned, not shown as a trade-off during collection. Specificity is high; "store wonder" is more vivid than "preserve memories." The motivation frames stakes but does not force a mid-story choice with visible price.</comment>
