<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Madeline's interiority is vivid and consistent—her psychometric gift and personal grief create clear motive. The backstory about her mother arrives late (past midpoint) but successfully reframes her search for unused love with embodied cost. Internal contradiction is present: she seeks repository for unexpressed emotion while carrying her own calcified grief. Minor deduction for the epiphany moment feeling slightly over-articulated ("She understood now why…") rather than purely dramatized, but the final release scene earns the shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through stacked psychometric readings until Madeline's own grief breaks through. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (release/transformation) with visible emotional cost—she speaks aloud what she'd withheld, joining the reservoir of unexpressed love. Orientation anchors (vintage palace, projection booth, Madeline's trade) arrive cleanly in opening paragraphs. One meaningful deepening occurs when her readings pivot to her own unwritten letter. The "post office for the heart" final image successfully reconfigures the premise with felt cost, though the explanatory summary in the penultimate paragraph slightly dilutes immediacy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The projection booth is rendered with concrete specificity: twin projectors as sentinels, rusted canisters, amber light through grimy windows, iron scent of machinery. Madeline's spatial imagination (mapping "every shadow, every angle") directly enables her navigation and psychometric work. The booth functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges the closure—it becomes the literal repository she sought, and her work there enables her release. Setting detail is purposeful and filtered through her professional lens throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: finding where unused love is stored. Pressure accumulates through each film strip reading, deepening from historical love letters to Madeline's personal grief. The meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes the booth's purpose matches her own need. Agency is renunciation/release with visible cost: speaking aloud what she'd withheld "calcifying inside her chest." Under Accumulative lens, the escalation works through density increase and pattern break (shift from reading others' letters to speaking her own). No antagonist required; the design fits situational pressure forcing stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of unexpressed love as energy that must transform rather than vanish emerges through concrete particulars—the film strips, the booth as incubator, Madeline's withheld words. The "post office for the heart" final image offers non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in the shift from observer to participant. Minor slip: "There was so much unused love in the world, and someone had to help it find its way home" edges toward thesis statement, though earned by prior dramatization. The physics metaphor ("Energy could not be destroyed, only transformed") integrates concept with character motive effectively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single POV with stable third-person limited focalization throughout. Perceptual signature is distinct: "spatially imaginative mind mapping every shadow," professional lens of psychometry, metaphors drawn from physics and film. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—closer during vision sequences, pulling back for summary of overnight work. Voice carries consistent texture: "hushed thunder," "cataract of accumulated tenderness," "calcifying inside her chest." Free indirect style is clean. No dialogue present, so those bullets don't apply. Diction remains within character's plausible register—professional, metaphysically inclined, grief-touched.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies effectively; opening establishes voice with "walls that remembered a thousand matinees." Information density is high in vision sequences. Two friction points: "liminal moment when forgotten lyrics search for their tune" extends the required timeframe element but reads as authorial insertion rather than character thought. Template cadence appears in the film-strip sequence: "She saw… She reached… Strip after strip, she worked…" creates repetitive stems across adjacent paragraphs, triggering −0.4. No loops or substantive scaffold. Figurative language is controlled but occasionally dense ("cataract of accumulated tenderness" stacked near "calcifying inside her chest").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Premise—psychometry applied to film strips holding actors' unexpressed emotions—offers fresh synthesis of familiar elements (haunted theater, medium character, grief processing). The projection booth as literal repository transforms the metaphor through specific world logic. Risk: sustained reflection-heavy design could flatten momentum, but interleaved readings maintain texture. Transformation test: the story's emotional arc depends on this exact confluence of film preservation, psychometry, and Madeline's mother-grief. Minor deduction for the "post office for the heart" conclusion feeling slightly neat given the complexity of the setup, and the prompt elements (crystal gazer, film strip, psychometry) cluster in ways that suggest template rather than inevitable organic discovery.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Crystal gazer trait established early; her psychometric gift drives every reading beat and enables the climactic self-revelation. She makes the key choice to speak her own goodbye letter aloud, altering her stance. Present in closure as "keeper, reader, witness." Loses points for "crystal gazer" being stated but never constraining action—she explicitly "never owned a crystal ball," so the label doesn't shape tactics. The psychometry does the causal work; "crystal gazer" functions more as occupational flavor.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Film strips appear early (workbench discovery), drive multiple middle beats (man in uniform, actress readings, overnight sequence), and are present in closure logic ("last film strip surrendered its secrets"). Handling is concrete: lifted to amber light, pressed between palms, coiled in rusted canisters. Meaning evolves from historical artifact to conduit to mirror of Madeline's own need. High integration, though not fully indispensable—story could theoretically work with other object types (letters, photographs) with moderate structural revision.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Goodbye letters concept frames opening quest, structures middle readings (letter never sent, glances as coded farewell), and crystallizes at closure when Madeline speaks her own unwritten letter. Shapes stakes directly: finding and releasing these letters is the dramatized goal. Her mother's absence = unwritten goodbye = core wound. The booth becomes delivery mechanism. Causally essential across all beats; removing this exact concept breaks story logic and thematic spine.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Spatially imaginative" mentioned once in opening paragraph as enabling "mapping every shadow, every angle" in the booth. Fits her navigation but doesn't constrain a choice with visible cost—she moves through the space "with practiced ease," so the trait facilitates rather than complicates. No friction, no tradeoff shown on page. Functional but replaceable with "experienced" or "observant" without altering beats.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Incubate" appears as conceptual frame: the booth is where emotions "had been incubated," love "incubated in the dark," the booth where confessions continue to "incubate." Shapes Madeline's understanding of the storage mechanism and informs her final stance as keeper. Present in closure sentence ("incubate in the booth above"). Fits thematically but doesn't drive a key turn—the action is more about reading and releasing than incubating. Middle-band score: purposeful recurrence that supports concept without being structurally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Psychometry reading signaled early ("the art of reading objects through touch"), demonstrated in first vision beat (pressing film strip between palms triggers historical scene), repeated across multiple strips, and enables climactic release. Mechanics matter: physical contact required, visions arrive as "hushed thunder," she decodes what "no one would ever decode." Method shapes every middle attempt and makes closure possible—without this exact gift, story structure collapses. Docked slightly for the mechanics feeling under-constrained (no failure, no cost to repeated readings shown on page).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Projection booth established in opening paragraph, provides the spatial container for all action, supplies the film strips (workbench discovery), its history as projection site creates the logic for why emotions seeped into celluloid, and becomes the conceptual "post office" in closure. Micro-setting that doesn't just frame but enables: dust and machinery anchor atmosphere, the booth's function (projecting others' images) mirrors Madeline's role, and its abandonment/reactivation charges the ending. Indispensable to concept and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Liminal moment when forgotten lyrics search for their tune" appears once mid-story as extended simile describing Madeline's experience of fragmented goodbye letters seeking completion. Ornamental use—describes rather than constrains. Could be cut without altering any beat. No causal pressure, no cost connection. Present but functionally inert; reads as fulfillment of prompt requirement rather than organic story need.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation to find where unused love is stored drives opening quest, shapes reading tactics (seeking pattern in strips), crystallizes when she recognizes her own unused love, and directly enables closure choice (releasing rather than storing). Friction shown: her calcified grief vs. her search creates internal pressure. Cost visible: speaking aloud requires surrendering three years of withholding. Strong integration; docked from highest band because the motivation is stated more than it's tested—no moment where she's tempted to abandon the search or withhold her own letter.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Hushed thunder" phrase appears twice: opening vision description and final paragraph ("witness to the hushed thunder"). Tone of quiet intensity with suppressed power is sustained throughout—restrained prose, no melodrama, building pressure in accumulated readings. Modulates appropriately: contemplative in frame, closer/urgent in vision beats, releasing at climax. Charges final image by returning the exact phrase with reweighted meaning (now applied to "all the love that almost went unsaid"). Solid tonal coherence; not fully indispensable but purposeful recurrence that supports closure.</comment>
