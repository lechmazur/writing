<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and character-particular—her "quietly enthusiastic" stance is embodied in her ritual coin-casting and her choice to continue witnessing despite cosmic futility. The decision to reject the lots' answer ("she smiled anyway, because cast lots decision makers knew something the universe had forgotten: randomness was not truth. It was permission") earns the closure through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Minor deduction: the self-aware articulation "stellar doubt had grown around it like frost" edges toward diagnostic label-speak, though it remains metaphorical rather than clinical.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (closure lands via cadence shift and reweighted purpose rather than causal reversal). Orientation anchors WHO/WHERE/WHEN by paragraph two cleanly. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mira crystallizes her purpose as witness rather than agent, forecloses the path of seeking change, with visible cost in her acceptance of cosmic futility. One meaningful deepening occurs when she rejects the lots' negative answer and claims permission to choose meaning anyway. Cost is legible in the final image: she will return tomorrow to remember "everything" despite the prophecy running backward and doubt burning cold.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ambered observatory deck functions as micro-setting that charges the final image—"preserving this moment as it preserved all moments—frozen in golden light at the edge of everything." The coins as recurring objects constrain her ritual choices and charge closure when she gathers them "slowly, reverently" as map of dead civilizations. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "static hissed," "coins clicked," "amber floor" catching "dim light of distant galaxies." No occupational depth needed here; the body-and-tool setting suffices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: finding purpose/meaning in a dying universe, signaled early and held throughout. One meaningful tightening: the backwards prophecy shifts from revealing only immutable past deaths to describing *her* role as witness, narrowing her options to acceptance or refusal. Agency crystallizes when she rejects the lots' "no" answer and chooses to witness anyway, forecloses the path of seeking change with visible cost (her doubt remains "vast as the contracting cosmos"). The coins' eight heads (even number = no) create a micro-turn that she consciously overrides, demonstrating protagonist-driven escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the backwards-prophecy conceit and coin mechanics: meaning arises not from changing fate but from bearing witness with "permission" rather than truth. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer—she will "remember everything" in the contracting cosmos—without stating a moral. The coins as motif constrain her ritual choices and charge closure when repocketed for "the next casting." Minor slip: "wavelength align with purpose" verges on prompt-echo abstraction, though it's embedded in her specific search through static rather than floating free.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Mira notices cosmic phenomena through the lens of her order's beliefs and her purpose. Voice is controlled and apt, with purposeful elevation ("stellar doubt," "contracting cosmos") fitting the philosophical SF register. Mild register drift: "wavelength align with purpose" and "understanding static bursts as fluently as others understood language" edge toward explanatory abstraction rather than embodied perception. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings diversify. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (world-building, character, pressure). Minor loop: "The backwards prophecy" receives three near-identical constructions across paragraphs 4–6 without pattern-teaching. Template cadence: "She [verb]" opens five sentences in the opening third. Figurative language ("like a dying star's final gasp," "like a small flame cupped against wind," "like frost") appears frequently but remains coherent and voice-motivated. No clarity breaks at closure; artifacts are minor and non-closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The backwards-prophecy conceit is fresh and the coin-casting ritual transforms the "decision under uncertainty" trope through specific mechanics: randomness as permission rather than truth. The combination of contracting universe + oracle who witnesses rather than changes + coins from extinct civilizations synthesizes into a coherent whole. Risk-taking in the quiet, refusal-based closure elevates. Minor derivative note: "cast lots decision maker" and "ambered observatory" read as prompt-fulfillment rather than organic invention, though they're well-integrated once present.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Present in title/opening third; enables two distinct beats (first casting → continue listening; second casting → question prophecy truth); drives closure choice when she rejects the lots' answer and claims "permission" to choose differently. Causal pressure: her order's identity shapes tactics and the final stance crystallization. Closure linkage: the rejection of randomness-as-truth is the hinge of her Earned Stasis. Irreplaceability: the specific mechanic (odd/even heads) matters. Cost: she continues despite "stellar doubt." No swappability; removing this exact role would break the closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Present by paragraph two. Handled in three beats: first toss (seven heads), second toss (eight heads), final gathering/repocketing. Development: the coins' answers narrow options and the eight-heads result creates the micro-turn she overrides. Closure: gathering them "slowly, reverently" as "constellation map of dead civilizations" charges the final image and ties to witness-purpose. Causal pressure: each toss alters her immediate choice. Specificity: "Sumerian shekels clicked against Roman denarii, Byzantine solidus" supplies irreplaceable texture. Cost: she repockets them for "the next casting," embodying her endurance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Present by paragraph four. Shapes stakes: prophecies reveal "what already had" rather than future, creating the story's central tension (what use is such prophecy?). Development: the static tonight carries a different message—describing *her* witness role—which tightens her options. Closure: the prophecy's reweighting of her purpose from agent to witness is the thematic hinge. Causal pressure: her decades of listening and the new message drive her final stance. Swappability: "any oracle that reveals the past" would work with minor edits; the backwards-time mechanic is elegant but not indispensable to the closure as written.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Present by paragraph three ("quietly enthusiastic about this work once…That enthusiasm remained"). Mentioned again in the final section ("quietly enthusiastic, remembering everything"). Label-only in both appearances; no on-page action or choice is dramatized as constrained or enabled by this specific trait. The enthusiasm is told rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure. No felt cost tied to maintaining enthusiasm versus doubt. Could be replaced with "persistent" or "stubborn" without altering any beat. Lyric reprise (early → final) reweights meaning slightly but lacks mid-scene causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Present by paragraph four. Central to two beats: she "distills meaning from…chaos" and "distills their backwards wisdom" in the final section. Development: the act of translating static into memory shapes her witness-purpose. Closure: "distilling" appears in the penultimate paragraph as the action she will continue, tied to her final stance. Causal pressure: her skill at distillation enables her to receive the new prophecy. Cost: the work continues despite futility. Swappability: "interpret" or "translate" would serve; "distill" adds connotation (reduction, essence) but is not mechanically unique. Early signal and closure presence elevate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Present by paragraph four ("understood the static bursts now, had learned their grammar"). Enables the middle beat: she receives the new prophecy because she can parse the static. Mechanics matter: "mentally flip each phrase" shows the method in action. Closure: she "listens to the static bursts and distills their backwards wisdom" in the final section. Causal pressure: fluency enables plot progression. Swappability: "translating prophecy" would work; the static-burst idiom is atmospheric but not mechanically indispensable. Early signal and closure involvement place it solidly mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Present in opening paragraph. The deck supplies the stage (coins scatter on amber floor; dome shows galaxies) and the final image ("ambered deck glowed around her, preserving this moment"). Development: the amber-preservation conceit mirrors her witness-purpose thematically but does not constrain a choice. Closure linkage: the "frozen in golden light at the edge of everything" image charges the ending. Causal pressure: minimal; she could perform the same ritual anywhere. Lyric-resonance allowance applies (early seed → final reprise reweights stake). Cost is thematic rather than tactical. Swappability: "crystallized viewing station" or "isolated observatory" would serve.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Present in opening paragraph ("universe had already finished its long exhale, collapsing inward"). Mentioned in final section ("space continued its slow collapse"). Shapes stakes conceptually (cosmic entropy = futility) but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page. No live clock; "cycles meant little now" explicitly removes time pressure. Development: absent—no choice is constrained by contracted time. Closure: the setting's decay colors mood but does not drive the stance crystallization. Functional but replaceable; "end of time" or "heat death" would work. Thematic presence without mechanical necessity.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Present by paragraph five ("spent her life trying to wavelength align with purpose"). Development: the prophecy tonight offers an answer—her purpose is witness—which tightens options. Closure: "wavelength aligning with a purpose she had finally understood" drives her final stance and the Earned Stasis. Causal pressure: the search motivates her ritual and her choice to continue. Cost: doubt persists even after alignment. Dramatized in the middle (she receives the prophecy answer) and closure (she accepts witness-purpose). Minor friction: "wavelength align" is told abstraction rather than embodied friction between wants; no on-page moment shows her *choosing* alignment over another desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Present by paragraph three ("stellar doubt had grown around it like frost"). Recurs in final section ("doubt would still burn cold between the stars"). Modulates with pressure: initial doubt surrounds hope; final doubt coexists with stubborn purpose. Coherence: the tone threads through turns without static mood. Closure: "doubt…stellar…burned cold" charges the final image as she chooses to continue despite it. Cost: the tone itself is the felt cost of her endurance. Swappability: "cosmic despair" or "vast uncertainty" would serve; "stellar" ties to setting but is not mechanically unique. Lyric-resonance reprise (early → final) reweights meaning.</comment>
