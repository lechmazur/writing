<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mattias's interior drive is clear and specific: he weaponizes rhetorical questions to expose hidden assumptions. The method of illuminating Corrine's unworthiness belief is embodied through layered loops and gray symbols. Her micro-choice—"No, I was just a child"—feels earned by the prior pressure. Minor slip: the entity's voice ("she believes she deserves nothing") could have been dramatized through Corrine's own resistance rather than declared, reducing one layer of interiority.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors immediately: Father Mattias, dimensional anchor, loop pedal, possessed Sister Corrine. The causal lens holds: possession enters through unworthiness → Mattias questions the assumption → Corrine rejects the lie → entity loses anchor. Closure is a clean Decisive Change with visible cost: Corrine's belief collapses, the entity dissipates. The tightening is meaningful (from color-cycling possession to human brown eyes) and the cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dimensional anchor is vividly particular: walls shift between stone, water, light, void, breathing skin depending on angle. The Threshold Gray palette and loop pedals function as micro-setting that constrains Mattias's method. The anchor's "unraveling stillness" re-weaves as Corrine's voice loops, directly affecting the exorcism's success. The environment charges the final image: "dimensional anchor hummed…its stillness restored."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: save Corrine before integration completes in twenty minutes. The tightening is causal: Mattias's questions → Corrine's micro-revelations ("my mother said I was too much") → rejection of unworthiness → entity expelled. Agency belongs to both: Mattias's method and Corrine's on-page choice to disbelieve. The time pressure is live and the cost—collapsing a lifelong wound assumption—is visible and felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete action: possessions require invitation through hidden assumptions. The gray symbols, loops, and rhetorical method embody the theme without stating it. The final exchange—"we need to hear our own truth repeated before we can believe it"—risks moralizing but lands as method reflection rather than sermon. The closure image (capturing silence for the next soul) reweights prior material: silence is architecture, not absence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third, anchored to Mattias. His perceptual signature is consistent: he sees auras, tracks wall shifts, wields silence as texture. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; Corrine's "I was just a child" carries subtext (reclaiming innocence). Minor slip: "wind through broken glass" for the entity's voice trends toward stock metaphor but remains legible. Diction stays within Mattias's professional-mystical register throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; the opening loop-pedal image anchors voice and stakes. Information density is high: most lines advance exorcism mechanics, character state, or thematic weight. Minor loop detected: "unraveled stillness" in paragraph one and "stillness restored" at closure is purposeful reprise, not artifact. Small deduction for "patient ghost" and "wind through broken glass"—functional but stock figurative choices in adjacent beats. No scaffolding or template cadence detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>The synthesis of exorcism-as-therapy, loop pedals, dimensional anchor, and rhetorical method feels specific and non-obvious. The premise transforms possession tropes through grounded mechanics: sound architecture, threshold pigment, and Socratic questioning. Transformation test passes: the emotional arc depends on this exact method and world logic. Risk-taking (multi-sensory setting, sound as cage) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Fresh inflection: the entity cannot anchor in a host who rejects the lie.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Mattias is present from the opening beat and drives every major turn. His choices—layering loops, painting symbols, asking rhetorical questions—narrow the entity's hold and enable Corrine's rejection. He shapes the closure directly: pressing the pedal to capture silence "for the next soul." Swapping him for a generic exorcist would require rewriting mechanics, tone, and method. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; irreplaceability is high.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The palette appears in three beats: introduction on the altar, tracing a symbol on Corrine's forehead, painting over her heart. Its single color (Threshold Gray, "neither dark nor light") is specific and tied to dimensional membrane logic. The symbols "fade into her skin like absorbed medicine," affecting her state. Closure participation is indirect—symbols enable the exorcism but do not appear in the final image. Strong beat involvement and causal role; modest closure linkage caps the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Unraveled stillness" is introduced early (paragraph one: "the anchor…its stillness…no longer unraveling") and returns at closure ("its stillness restored"). It shapes the dimensional anchor's state as a tactical constraint: possession tears gaps, Corrine's looping voice re-weaves them. The concept alters options—Mattias cannot complete the exorcism until stillness is restored. Lyric reprise charges the final image with cost (re-stabilization). Strong setup and closure; moderate middle development.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Decorates with silence" appears in the opening beat ("decorating with silence the spaces between moments") and the closure ("pressed the pedal once more, capturing the silence, saving it"). The trait constrains Mattias's method: he wields silence as architecture and captures it for future use. It enables a key tactic (the silence crash after crescendo) that forces the entity out. Visible tradeoff: silence must be built through loops before it can be deployed. Strong causal work and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Plumb" (to sound depths) drives the core turn: Mattias plumbs Corrine's hidden assumption ("What do you believe you deserve?") and her answer reveals the wound. The rhetorical probing is causally necessary—without it, the entity's anchor remains. The action appears in multiple beats: questioning worthiness, probing the mother's lie, asking "Was she correct?" Swapping "plumb" for generic "ask" would flatten the method's specificity. Strong causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhetorical devices (questions) are signaled early: "Through rhetorical devices, he would plumb the depths where assumptions lived." The method is dramatized across multiple beats: "What do you believe you deserve?" "And if love must be earned…who profits?" "What if worthiness was never the question?" Each question narrows the entity's hold and forces Corrine's micro-choices. The mechanics matter—declarative commands would not work in this exorcism logic. Strong setup and beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The dimensional anchor appears in every major beat and supplies unique resources: five-reality walls, the altar, and "unraveling stillness" that must be restored. It constrains Mattias's method—he cannot leave until equilibrium returns. The setting's state evolves causally: possession tears gaps → loops re-weave threads → closure restores the hum. The anchor charges the final image directly. Swapping it for a generic chapel would break the story's logic and stakes. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The timeframe ("twenty minutes before the integration completed") is signaled early and tightens decisions. It creates live pressure: Mattias must work quickly, and Corrine's cycling eyes and convulsions show progression toward deadline. The clock shapes tactics—he layers loops to build a cage before time runs out. Closure participation is indirect; the story does not return to the clock at the end. Strong setup and middle pressure; modest closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mattias's motivation (illuminate hidden assumptions) is dramatized through every question he asks. It drives his method—rhetorical probing rather than commands—and creates friction when the entity resists. Corrine's realization ("No, I was just a child") is the direct result of his illumination. The motivation is causally necessary: without it, the exorcism would fail. It shapes the closure: he saves the silence "for the next soul who would need" the same method. High causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Muffled clarity" is established early: Mattias's voice cuts "through the accumulated sound with muffled clarity." The tone is consistent—vivid but subdued, precise but layered—and modulates with pressure (whispered prayer, silence crash). It charges the final image: the dimensional anchor "hummed" with restored stillness. The tone fits the concept and method. Minor cap: the tone supports but does not independently drive a key turn; it enriches rather than alters tactics.</comment>
