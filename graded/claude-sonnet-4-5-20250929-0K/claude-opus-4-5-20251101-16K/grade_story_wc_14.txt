**Inferred Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates sensory and conceptual density around a single dawn ritual; closure should land as a pattern break, cadence shift, or reweighting with cost.

**Closure Unit:** Attempted Earned Stasis — Miriam will return as she always does. The three commissions attempt a Conceptual Repricing by making abstract "invented histories" concrete and emotionally charged.

<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Miriam is defined by craft and method but never makes a micro-choice under pressure or reveals contradictory impulses. She follows a routine without struggle — no blind spots, no genuine obstacles, no felt cost to her isolation. She functions as a concept-vehicle rather than a character whose values are tested. "Earnestly studious" is a label without tradeoff. The strongest character beat — "hands that worried differently than modern hands worry" — suggests lived understanding but remains observational.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored by line 2). The Accumulative/Textural lens is legible by midpoint. However, closure fails the cost proof test: "passing bakeries and banks and people who had no idea" implies isolation but no sentence makes cost undeniable. The Earned Stasis ("she always did") doesn't foreclose a path — nothing was at risk. The three commissions are the strongest structural beat but arrive as a list, not as a turn that reconfigures options. The story reads as descriptive exposition with a ritual frame rather than narrative with meaningful tightening.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The setting is the story's chief asset. The fluorescent lamp "mounted incongruously above a stone worktable" is a terrific detail that crystallizes the story's tension between technology and antiquity. Sensory engagement is vivid and POV-filtered: "leather cover soft as old skin," dew-laden branches refracting dawn light. However, setting remains atmospheric rather than constraining — no choice is forced by the physical environment, which blocks the 9+ gate. The bonsai labyrinth is lived-in but decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No conflict, no obstacle, no tightening under any lens. Miriam arrives, records successfully, descends. Even under Accumulative/Textural criteria, there is no density increase that reweights the dominant stake — the dawn moment delivers exactly what was promised without surprise or price. The three commissions add concrete detail but don't narrow options or create pressure. No want-vs-need tension exists; the story is a portrait of unimpeded competence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"A child's drawing from a plague year that knew no plague" is the story's most resonant moment, hinting that Miriam's invented histories are acts of imaginative compassion. However, the final paragraph moralizes explicitly: "quietly rewriting the textures of what might have been." The bonsai-as-miniature-centuries mirror is on-the-nose. "Labyrinth of small trees and large impossibilities" reads as a tagline. Theme is stated rather than emerged from dramatized friction, and the ending replaces earned resonance with summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited is stable throughout. POV filtering is professional — Miriam notices textures, frequencies, material properties. "Not forgeries, exactly" provides a welcome conversational beat. However, register drifts toward jacket copy: "museums of alternate futures, archivists of abandoned timelines" sounds promotional rather than character-perceived. Limited modulation across the piece — the voice stays at one lyric altitude without responding to shifts in intensity. "Most people never noticed" edges toward omniscience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Strong individual lines ("hands that worried differently than modern hands worry") coexist with paraphrase loops and template cadence. The ending's triple parallel ("The lamp would wait... The bonsai would continue... And Miriam would return...") echoes the earlier "The lamp hummed. The bonsai bloomed." — a refrain that's taught but still creates drumbeat monotony. "Labyrinth of small trees and large impossibilities" is forced antithesis. Several descriptive paragraphs (cherry blossoms, junipers) fail the paragraph-cut test. Closing line ("echoes that only she could hear") relies on a familiar construction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The core premise — extracting temporal echoes from a fluorescent lamp's hum to fabricate papers carrying invented histories — is genuinely inventive and non-obvious. The synthesis of electricity, dawn acoustics, and artisanal papermaking is fresh. The transformation test is satisfied: this concept is specific and irreplaceable. However, the execution structure (gentle artisan-at-work vignette) is a well-worn literary mode, and the lack of dramatic pressure means the originality lives in concept rather than narrative action.</comment>
