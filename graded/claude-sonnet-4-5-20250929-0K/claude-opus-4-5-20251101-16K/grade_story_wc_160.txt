**Drive Lens Inferred:** Accumulative/Textural — pressure builds through layered reinterpretations of the father's legacy, culminating in Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as Mira crystallizes her stance and the chain reweights prior material.

**Closure Unit:** Charged Poise — Mira commits to arguing for the harder path; the chain's chiming links recharge the entire story's premise about coded love. Cost: six months of work, likely guild rejection, and the irrecoverable years of misunderstanding her father.

<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Her motivation crystallized: to harmonize conflicting values" is diagnostic label-speak at a peak beat (−0.5). Contradictory impulses (duty vs. memory, logic vs. love) do act in scene, and the micro-choice to reread schematics "for what they protected" is genuinely earned. The trembling hands are somewhat stock, but the looping of the chain around her wrist and the pat on the stone seat show embodied, character-particular action. The father's portrait through objects is strong, though Mira's articulation of her own emotional states is too tidy for a crisis moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is excellent by ~30 words. The accumulative chain (adhesive analysis → repeated resealings → rereading schematics → margin villages → chain as love measurement → auxiliary channel) is well-linked. The auxiliary channel discovery is compressed ("Three hours later") and somewhat convenient — the causal bridge from "followed his uncertainty" to finding a natural conduit does heavy lifting without dramatization. Closure is legible Charged Poise with felt cost (six months, guild resistance), though "They would likely choose efficiency" softens the stakes. BRR reflective content (~30%) passes the exception test: anchored to present stimuli and producing micro-choices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The amphitheater-in-a-dormant-volcano is vivid and causally integral: thermal vents create the engineering conflict, volcanic heat warms the brass chain, dust sifts from stone seats as physical evidence of structural stress. Sensory filtering through Mira's machinist POV (she reads the building's rhythm, notices "hesitation marks" in schematics) is strong. The building's "breathing" works as a unifying conceit though it risks overuse. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The chain warming from volcanic pulse charging the final image meets the 9+ constraint test, but the auxiliary channel's geography remains vague.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (guild safety vs. heritage preservation) is signaled by paragraph three and deepened through each accumulative discovery. The tightening occurs when the adhesive analysis transforms her understanding, foreclosing the option of easy dismissal. However, the guild remains entirely off-stage, weakening the opposition's immediacy. The auxiliary channel resolves the dilemma somewhat conveniently — cost is stated (six months) rather than viscerally dramatized. The moral calculus (competing goods, not good vs. evil) is effective, and the decision to argue for the harder path does foreclose the easy route with real risk.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The central conceit — love encoded in precision — is genuinely moving in its particulars (village names in margins, chain as amphitheater diameter). However, the story over-articulates its theme: "Encrypted compassion—that was his entire legacy, love hidden in careful measurements" states it outright. The whispered final line, "It finds a way around obstacles. So do we," is thematic echo in the closing paragraphs (−0.7). The final triplet ("Each one a word he'd never spoken. Each one, now, finally heard") borders on moralizing rather than trusting the image. The strongest thematic moments are the specifics: "fifty-three links, each one irreplaceable."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Stable third-person close with a distinct perceptual signature: Mira reads structures, adhesive patterns, and hesitation marks the way she reads engineering problems. The line "He couldn't say 'I loved her.' He said 'fifty-three links, each one irreplaceable'" is excellent voice work — sharp, compressed, character-driven. The "dappled resolve" definition passage ("not blind certainty, but the patient conviction of someone who'd learned that light could filter through doubt") reads as authorial insertion rather than Mira's natural idiom. The whispered dialogue is effective and restrained.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Covered in volcanic dust and determination" is a stock concrete+abstract construction (−0.2). The "dappled resolve" passage overexplains its own metaphor across three lines (−0.3). "Between silence and understanding, between loss and its careful, coded redemption" stacks paired abstractions. The building-breathing motif is pattern-taught and pays off legitimately at closure. Several lines achieve high density — "His compassion had been encrypted in the only language he trusted: precision" does double thematic and character work. The final triplet's parallelism is borderline template cadence but reads as intentional literary effect.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The specific synthesis — geothermal engineering + amphitheater archaeology + envelope forensics + coded paternal love — is genuinely fresh. The surveyor's chain as a love letter (measuring the distance his wife walked to meet him) is an original and moving image. The adhesive analysis revealing multiple resealings transforms the familiar "dead parent's letter" template through precise, profession-specific detail. The "find a third way" resolution is standard, but the particular mechanism (following the father's hesitation marks) roots it in character inheritance rather than convenient discovery.</comment>
