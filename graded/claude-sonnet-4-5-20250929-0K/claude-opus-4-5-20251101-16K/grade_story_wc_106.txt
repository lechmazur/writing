<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mira's motivations trace cleanly from her grandmother's training through the stolen portraits to her mother's coded message. The revelation unfolds through concrete action (uncorking the jar, holding portraits to moonlight) with embodied response ("hands trembled"). However, the final transformation—from thief to "translator" and "guardian"—arrives primarily through summary rather than a micro-choice under visible pressure. The interior voice remains consistent, but the peak decision at the end is asserted more than dramatized with immediate cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (Emerald Station, Mira, tonight's train). The Drive Lens reads as Causal: flower code → seat fourteen → portrait → moonbeam reveal → reinterpretation decision. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira realizes the portraits are prophecies, not just art, narrowing her options from collector to guardian. Closure registers as Charged Poise—she plans her next theft with new purpose, the cost implied in "not for profit this time" and the final line about catching light before it disappears. The because/therefore chain holds, though the final choice could be sharpened with on-page forfeiture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Emerald Station's jade tiles under dual sunset/moonlight establish a vivid threshold setting. The jar of moonbeams functions as both object and tool, its coldness noted, its silver glow transforming the portrait. Spatial choreography (platform seven, third car, seat fourteen) tracks cleanly. The micro-setting of the train compartment constrains the revelation scene effectively. The final image of Mira's palm on the cold window reinforces bodily engagement with the environment, and moonlight serves as a recurring sensory anchor that charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake signals early: understanding the portraits' whispered secrets. One meaningful tightening occurs when the moonbeam reveals her mother's message, converting passive collection into active prophecy-reading. The politician portrait with tomorrow's assassination date raises immediate new stakes. Agency reads as decision—Mira chooses to become a guardian rather than remain a profit-driven thief—though the cost is more implied than paid on the page. The final choice to plan "her next theft" forecloses the mercenary path with felt weight, even if not yet enacted.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the motif of illuminated moments capturing destiny, encoded in golden-hour portraits. The mother's hidden message—"They scream warnings"—reweights all prior thefts without moralizing. Mira's realization that she's been "gathering prophecies without knowing how to read them" offers thematic resonance through specific action. However, the final reflection "Destiny...was something you caught, like light" edges toward summary wisdom rather than letting the image speak. The conceptual repricing is legible but could trust the reader more.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single POV remains stable; Mira's perceptual signature (noticing codes, light quality, illuminated souls) is consistent and character-specific. Focalization is tight—no head-hopping. Diction stays within Mira's register, blending practical thief vocabulary with lyric attention to light ("amber and honey," "silver and strange"). The phrase "luminous disbelief" in the text matches the tonal requirement. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, closer during the portrait revelation, pulling back slightly for the final planning beat. Filter verbs are present but voice-motivated ("she understood," "she realized") without dulling immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Rhythm varies appropriately, tightening during the moonbeam reveal. Minor scaffold appears in the opening: "she'd traded three stolen portraits for it" could integrate more fluidly. The phrase "caught in an illuminated moment, when the soul rises briefly to the surface" edges toward purple but stays within the lyric register. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Sentence openings vary. One near-redundancy: "All those stolen portraits, all those golden-hour faces" could compress. Propulsion remains strong through the revelation sequence with no opacity at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The premise—portraits as encoded prophecies readable by moonlight—offers a fresh synthesis of art-theft and divination tropes. The grandmother's flower-code lineage and the mother's self-portrait add specificity. However, the "chosen one discovers their destiny" frame is familiar, and the transformation from mercenary to guardian follows a recognizable arc. The moonbeam jar and golden-hour timing provide original texture, and the politician assassination detail shows the premise's implications concretely. The piece commits fully to its logic without hedging, but the emotional beats (orphan discovers parent's legacy, assumes their mantle) do not fully transform the template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira (golden-hour portrait thief) is present throughout and drives all major turns. Setup: established in opening line. Development: her theft skills enable the flower-code reading and portrait collection. Closure: her decision to continue thieving "not for profit this time" but to "press harder against that door" directly shapes the final image. The thief identity constrains her initial mercenary stance and enables the reinterpretation action. Two distinct beats (flower code navigation, moonbeam use) and closure participation earn strong integration, though the character's arc could show more visible cost in the ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Jar of captured moonbeams appears in beat one (station platform, "hummed against her hip, cold and patient"), beat two (train compartment uncorking), and closure ("sealed the jar, tucked the portraits away"). Its mechanics matter: only moonlight can reveal the hidden text, reinterpreting what sunlight hid. The coldness is noted twice, reinforcing its sensory presence. The jar's function drives the key revelation (mother's message) and enables the second portrait test (politician assassination). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Irreplaceable: no substitute method is offered.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Core concept (illuminated moments) is seeded early ("portraits painted during golden hour," "the moment of my death, illuminated") and returns in the mother's encoded message: "Every portrait captures more than a face. They capture the moment where past and future touch." The concept shapes the stakes—Mira must understand these moments—and the final line ("something you caught, like light, in the fleeting moments before it disappeared") reprises it thematically. However, the concept functions more as theme than as a tactical constraint that alters Mira's choices on the page. Present across beats but not irreplaceably mechanical.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Attribute (quietly savvy) is mentioned once: "She was quietly savvy about such transitions—had built her entire career around them." The trait is asserted rather than demonstrated through a choice with cost. Mira's actions (reading flower codes, using moonbeams) could illustrate savvy, but the text does not explicitly link this attribute to those decisions. Label-only mention without visible tradeoff. Not signaled in closure. Cap at 4.6 for missing closure participation; further reduced for ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Action (reinterpret) is seeded when Mira "had to reinterpret everything" after the mother's message. The moonbeam application literally reinterprets the portraits: "Under the lunar glow, the portrait transformed. The brushstrokes rearranged themselves into text." She then reinterprets the politician portrait, revealing an assassination. The action drives the major turn from ignorance to prophecy-reading and shapes the closure decision to become a "translator." Three beats (mother's portrait, politician portrait, final planning), high causal pressure, and closure linkage. Irreplaceable: the entire plot hinges on this action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Method (codes in flower arrangements) appears in one beat: "three white, one yellow, two pink angled northwest...meant: third car, seat fourteen, tonight." Setup present (grandmother's training mentioned). The code enables Mira to find the portfolio, driving the inciting action. However, no middle development—flower codes do not recur or constrain later choices. Not present in closure. Functional but limited to one beat. With setup and one development beat, eligible up to ~6.0. Rounded down to 5.9 for single-use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Setting (Emerald Station by moonlight) is described vividly in the opening: "jade-tiled walls gleaming under the dual assault of a fleeting golden sunset and the rising moon...where day surrendered to night." The threshold quality of the station mirrors Mira's transition. However, the station does not constrain Mira's choices or resurface in closure; the train compartment becomes the active micro-setting. The station functions as atmospheric setup without tactical pressure. Early signal +0.5, but no middle or closure linkage. Cap at 4.6 for missing closure; lyric resonance (threshold theme) lifts slightly.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Timeframe (fleeting golden sunset) is present in the opening: "fleeting golden sunset and the rising moon" at Emerald Station, and referenced in "the last desperate gold of sunset" as passengers board. The mother's message notes "the evening light." However, the sunset does not function as a ticking clock that tightens Mira's decisions; once on the train, time pressure dissolves. No middle beat where the timeframe alters tactics. Not present in closure. Early signal only; no causal pressure. Cap at 4.6 for missing closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Motivation (press your ear against destiny's door) appears in the mother's message: "I saw you...pressing your ear against destiny's door, trying to hear what comes next." The metaphor reframes Mira's career and the final line echoes it: "to press harder against that door her mother had first opened. Destiny...wasn't something you heard." Seeded mid-story, reprised at closure with reweighting (hearing → catching). The motivation drives Mira's final decision to continue thieving as a guardian. Strong closure linkage but late first appearance (~60% mark). Causal role in ending decision. Late penalty −0.4, lifted by closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Tone (luminous disbelief) is named explicitly: "Mira sat in luminous disbelief as the train carved through the night." The tone coheres through the revelation sequence—wonder mixed with shock—and modulates with pressure (trembling hands, breath caught). Imagery of light (silver moonbeams, golden portraits, amber brushstrokes) sustains the "luminous" quality. However, "disbelief" flattens slightly after the initial revelation; Mira quickly moves to practical reinterpretation. The tone charges the middle beats more than the final image, which shifts toward resolve. Present across two-thirds of the piece with coherent modulation, but not fully integrated into closure.</comment>
