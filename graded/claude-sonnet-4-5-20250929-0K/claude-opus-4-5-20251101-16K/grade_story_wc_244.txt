<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's character arc from running to staying is legible, but the transformation relies heavily on exposition about her pattern rather than dramatized internal contradiction in the present scene. The seven-year backstory with the moon rock and her disaster work is told efficiently but doesn't create visible friction in her current choices—she simply listens and then decides. The "believing that accepting it would trap her" motivation is asserted rather than tested through on-page resistance that costs her something in the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to acceptance) with visible cost: Mira relinquishes the moon rock and commits to staying, foreclosing her elusiveness. The causal lens holds—her arrival, the testimonials, and her final gesture form a motivated sequence. However, the testimonials arrive conveniently without dramatized resistance from Mira; she absorbs them passively until the final beat, which slightly weakens the earned quality of the turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ivy-wrapped station with fairy lights and mismatched chairs on Platform 2 establishes polite-anarchy atmosphere and provides spatial grounding for the circle gathering. The moon rock's physical presence ("pressing against her thigh," "held to the fading light") anchors Mira's body in space. The recurring Platform 2 and the station's transformation in the final paragraphs charge the closure image, though the setting itself doesn't constrain a tactical choice during the peak moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether Mira will accept reciprocity and stop running—is signaled early and tightens when the gray-haired woman recognizes her, forcing the testimonial sequence. The pressure accumulates through named witnesses, but the escalation is largely situational (people speaking) rather than driven by Mira's active resistance. Her placement of the moon rock forecloses her elusiveness with visible cost, though the path to that decision lacks a meaningful on-page struggle or competing option tested in the moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the reciprocity network, the moon rock as traveling witness, and the station as node for mutual aid. The final placement of the rock in the circle offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the loneliness question without moralizing. "The cure for loneliness wasn't a thing to find. It was a weight to finally accept" teeters near articulation but is immediately grounded in the concrete act of placing the stone, and the piece resists tidy resolution by showing the ongoing practice ("people still gathered") rather than declaring triumph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Mira with clean focalization and no head-hopping. Voice carries distinct texture through selective detail (moon rock "smooth as grief and twice as heavy") and rhythm modulation. Dialogue feels natural and carries subtext, particularly the gray-haired woman's "Awful joke. Best soup I ever tasted, though." The psychic distance shifts purposefully between close interior and wider social observation, though some reflective passages ("she understood: she'd been bound by reciprocity all along") lean toward direct articulation rather than letting the realization emerge through image alone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean, propulsive, and information-dense with strong sentence variety and clear causality. Opening and closing images anchor well ("They called her the Quartermaster" / "the elusive logistician had finally let herself be found"). Minor loop: "Take what you need. Leave what you can" appears twice within a short span, the second time feeling slightly mechanical. No major artifacts touch the closure beat, and the figurative language ("smooth as grief and twice as heavy," "ivy rustled its quiet applause") remains coherent and voice-motivated without overwriting the peak moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise of a disaster-relief worker fleeing gratitude until a rumor network brings her to a mutual-aid station offers a specific angle on chosen-family and gift-economy material. The moon rock as traveling witness and the third-Tuesday gathering ritual provide fresh particulars. However, the emotional arc—loner learns to accept community—follows a familiar template, and the testimonial structure (strangers recognize her one by one) is well-worn. The "polite anarchy" frame and the improbable-chain mechanics add texture but don't fundamentally transform the arc's predictability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira appears early, her elusiveness shapes the setup, and her final decision to stay and place the moon rock drives closure. However, most of her disaster-relief work is backstory; the on-page choice (listening, then placing the rock) involves limited visible resistance or tactical complexity in the present scene.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The moon rock is introduced early (paragraph 3 rumor, paragraph 5 Mira's pocket), handled on-page ("pressing against her thigh," "held to the fading light"), and its placement in the circle concludes the arc with symbolic and physical transfer. It shapes two beats (carried burden, released offering) and charges the closure image, though it doesn't alter Mira's tactics before the final gesture.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Reciprocity is the structural spine: Mira's evasion of it drives her running, the testimonials enact it, and her acceptance ("she'd been bound by reciprocity all along") reframes the stake. The concept constrains her past choices (vanishing before thanks) and enables the final turn (placing the rock as mutual exchange). It appears in setup, middle realization, and closure payoff.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Desperately jocular" is demonstrated early ("What did the tsunami say to the shoreline? Nothing, it just waved") and recurs when the gray-haired woman calls the final gesture a "Terrible joke, Quartermaster" and Mira replies "Wasn't joking this time." The trait signals her deflection pattern and its abandonment at closure, but doesn't constrain a specific tactical choice or create visible cost beyond characterization.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Catalyze" is enacted through the testimonial sequence (people speaking catalyzes Mira's shift) and the rumor chains (Mira's past actions catalyzed the gathering). Her placement of the moon rock catalyzes the ongoing practice. The verb is integral to the causality and appears in setup, middle, and closure, though the mechanics of catalysis are more thematic than tactical—no on-page attempt fails or requires adjustment.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The improbable rumor chain is signaled early ("someone had told someone who had told someone else"), demonstrated in Mira's arrival path (Bangladesh → Portugal → Morocco → London), and returns in the closing paragraphs ("That rumor spread through the same improbable chains"). The method shapes the story's connective tissue and thematic design, though it doesn't constrain Mira's present choices or create friction—she simply follows the chain to arrival.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The disused railway station with ivy, Platform 2, fairy lights, and mismatched chairs is established early and houses the entire present-scene action. It provides spatial grounding for the circle gathering and symbolic resonance (reclaimed space, mutual aid). The setting charges the final image ("Platform 2 grew more chairs") but doesn't constrain Mira's tactical choices—the circle could function in another gathering space without altering her arc.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"When the story changes" appears as a structural marker ("This was the moment when the story changes") and closure note ("the Quartermaster had finally stopped running"). The timeframe is more thematic than tactical—no clock or deadline pressures the decision. The "third Tuesday of odd-numbered months" recurs but doesn't narrow Mira's window; she could arrive and choose on any visit.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The motivation to cure loneliness is established through the sister's claim, Mira's desperate laughter, and her pattern of running from connection. The desire drives her booking a ticket and frames her realization ("The cure for loneliness wasn't a thing to find. It was a weight to finally accept"). It appears in setup, middle understanding, and closure, though the friction between want and cost is more told than tested through competing on-page options.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Polite anarchy is demonstrated through the hand-painted sign ("Please take what you need. Please leave what you can"), the leaderless efficiency, and the mutual-aid mechanics. Tone remains coherent across setup, testimonial sequence, and closure ("practiced their polite anarchy of mutual aid"), modulating from Mira's jokes to communal exchange without tonal rupture. The phrase charges the thematic design and final image, embedding the concept in both atmosphere and structure.</comment>
