<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivations are legible—wilting near lies, searching for lost words—but her micro-choices lack contradiction. The mother's final message is emotionally earned, yet Mira's decision to create a map feels like smooth resolution rather than a path foreclosed. The interior voice leans toward therapy-speak ("candor in small moments," "gilding isn't a curse") without embodied cost. The ancient attendant appears solely to deliver plot information, applying no meaningful pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal with accumulative texture; orientation anchors within the first 120 words. Closure lands on-page: Mira finds her mother's message and begins the map, a Decisive Change that reorients her purpose. The cost is visible—she accepts wilting as purpose rather than curse—but the turn from searching to sharing feels smoothly inevitable rather than foreclosing a live option. The Repository discovery solves the quest it created without prior friction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Veridium's greenhouse domes, toxic sky, and dried oasis create vivid constraints. The zinc-etched postal plate and shredded map function as micro-setting objects that shape Mira's search. The Conversation Hall's collapsed stage and crystalline Repository containers charge the final third. Spatial choreography remains clear across locations, and sensory detail (gold-veined tendrils, filtered light) is selective and purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding her mother's lost words—is signaled early and drives the search. The Repository discovery tightens knowledge but arrives late and resolves the quest it introduced. Mira's agency is investigative (piecing, searching, entering) rather than decision under competing costs. The closing choice to map the Repository for others is generous but lacks visible sacrifice or foreclosed alternative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme—truth preservation, candor's value—emerges from the Repository's mechanics and Mira's physical response to lies. The mother's message ("let them make you wilt, then bloom again") risks didacticism but is anchored in the body-trait. The final image of gold-leaf cartography offers resonance, yet the piece leans toward affirming the search's premise rather than reweighting it. The toxic sky and oasis collapse remain backdrop rather than thematic pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with Mira's perceptual signature (gold-leaf wilting, filtered light). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("candor in small moments," "Repository of the Unfinished") that feels prompt-adjacent rather than character-owned. The attendant's dialogue is functional but generic. Psychic distance is controlled, and no head-hopping occurs. Dialogue serves exposition cleanly without naturalistic friction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Prose is clear with purposeful rhythm, but template stems recur ("She found," "She understood," "She carried"). Stock metaphors appear without transformation: "ferns retreating from frost," "something hungry." The phrase "candor in small moments" repeats across paragraphs as thematic echo rather than varied application. Information density is high in the Repository sequence; earlier beats carry more scaffold. No paraphrase loops touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The body-as-truth-detector (wilting leaves) and Repository of lost conversations offer fresh synthesis. The zinc postal plate and shredded map add tactile specificity. Yet the core premise—magical archive of unfinished words—follows familiar fantasy-of-retrieval templates. The emotional arc (loss → search → found message → sharing) is competent but predictable. The toxic-sky greenhouse setting remains underutilized for pressure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira's choices drive three beats: deciding to piece the map, speaking truth to enter, and creating her own map. Her decision at closure to share the Repository path is caused by finding her mother's message. The character is not swappable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The postal plate fragment appears when found under floorboards, is examined ("zinc-etched," coordinates, phrase), and Mira carries it back through the city at the end. It signals the Repository's location but does not constrain a mid-story choice or return with reweighted meaning. Two beats (discovery, carry-back) with moderate causal work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Candor shapes the door's entry requirement (speak truth to enter) and the Repository's preservation logic. Mira's wilting trait embodies the concept. It appears early and at closure but does not create tactical friction or narrow options on the page. The concept is more thematic echo than pressure-maker.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Wilts-near-dishonesty triggers observable reactions: leaves curl when the merchant lies, contract in the studio, unfurl at the authentic artifact, and "wilt in their presence, then recover" near liars. The trait enables Repository discovery ("That's why you found us") and shapes Mira's final purpose. Visible cost and constraint across multiple beats.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rereading occurs three times: partial treasure-map instructions, the postal plate phrase, and the mother's transcript. Each instance advances knowledge and drives the next beat. The climax hinges on rereading the mother's words. Swapping for "examined" or "studied" would weaken specificity but not break causality.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Piecing shredded papers under warped floorboards is signaled early (yesterday discovery, now surrounded by fragments) and shown on-page with partial assembly. The method generates the coordinates and Repository clue. It does not constrain middle attempts or create friction; once assembled, it solves directly. Setup and payoff present; middle development light.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse city supplies rationed moisture, amber domes, pneumatic tubes, abandoned Conversation Hall, and Repository beneath. Toxic sky and dried oasis create scarcity context. The collapsed stage hides the entrance; the Repository's crystalline containers hold the closure. Environment constrains movement and charges the ending. Indispensable to stakes and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Three months post-oasis collapse frames urgency and drought context. The timeframe is mentioned early and referenced (yesterday's discovery, now) but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. Time passage exists as backdrop rather than escalating pressure. Setup and thematic color; no middle or closure constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Finding where lost conversations go drives every beat: searching archives, piecing the map, entering the Repository, and locating her mother's words. The desire is dramatized through action and embodied in wilting. The closure fulfills and transforms the quest into sharing. Friction between personal loss and public purpose emerges at the end. Causally essential.</comment>
