<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior journey shows embodied contradiction—faith as hollow space versus cautious enchantment—and the final choice (placing the stone, committing to return) earns visible cost through foreclosed alternatives. Internal conflict operates through simultaneous impulses: academic detachment vs. ancestral pull, grief vs. rebuilding. Minor weakness: some interiority edges toward label-speak ("cautious enchantment" as repeated frame rather than varying perception), and the grandmother's death functions more as backdrop than dramatized pressure that compounds choices on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through layered images (roots threading bones, fruit from ancestors, sundial as interrupted journey) and the final decision to return reweights prior material with felt cost (abandoning academic distance, accepting fragmented faith). Orientation anchors clearly by paragraph two. One meaningful tightening occurs when the sundial discovery shifts Mira's stance from researcher to participant. Cost is legible in the final stone-placing and return commitment, though the price (what specific path she forecloses, what she risks by staying connected) remains more implied than on-page concrete.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard—roots threading bones, light through root-gaps painting amber and rose—constrains multiple choices: purposeful wandering as method, pomegranate harvest as ritual participation, the traveler's grave as final destination. Spatial choreography stays coherent across depths and surfaces. Sensory detail (compacted earth, particular silence, heavy fruit) reflects Mira's academic-then-reverent attention shift. The setting charges the final image: placing a stone on the grave among the roots that will carry the dead into next season's fruit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (restoring lost faith) signals early and tightens once: the sundial discovery transforms academic excavation into personal reckoning, narrowing options from detached research to embodied participation. Agency operates through accumulative micro-choices (learning prayers, harvesting fruit, wandering at dusk) rather than a single high-stakes turn. The final commitment to return forecloses the escape route of academic tourism with visible cost (she must now sustain fragile reconstruction). Escalation under the Accumulative lens is sufficient but gentle; a sharper price or obstacle would push higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme (continuity over certainty, return through interruption) emerges from concrete particulars: roots feeding fruit, the traveler's circular journey, Mira's stone-placing. The sundial as interrupted-then-resumed journey avoids overt allegory; its meaning accumulates through action and image. Final image (roots threading bones, promising next summer's return) offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Minor slip: "faith might be something other than what she had imagined" edges toward thematic statement rather than letting the image carry all weight, though it recovers quickly through the continuity/certainty reframe.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV stable; close third with consistent access to Mira's perceptual signature (warmly curious, archaeological precision softening into reverence). Diction modulates appropriately—academic terms early ("purposeful wandering," "sundial base") yield to prayer-language and embodied ritual by the end. No head-hopping. Minor weakness: some filter verbs ("She thought about," "She wondered") in reflective passages slightly dull immediacy, and a few phrases ("the hollow space inside her chest where faith had once lived") feel more writerly than character-specific under stress. Dialogue absent, so those bullets don't apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings avoid template runs. Information density high in the orchard description and sundial excavation. Two minor loops: "interrupted journeys" recurs across three paragraphs in similar phrasing without added pressure; "cautious enchantment" / "cautiously curious" / "warmly curious" cycles as a label rather than showing varied perception. No figurative muddle or clarity breaks at closure. The final paragraph ("Time could be measured...") stacks metaphoric constructions but stays coherent. Proofreading clean; no simultaneity errors or tense drift.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard (tree roots cradling bones, fruit fed by ancestors) offers a vivid, specific synthesis. The sundial as portable timepiece for an ancient returner adds fresh inflection to the diaspora-return frame. Emotional arc (hollow space to cautious rebuilding) avoids both tidy resolution and cynical hedging. Transformation test: the orchard's physical logic and Mira's academic-to-participant shift are integral. Minor derivative note: the "grief dismantles faith, ancestor-site restores it" premise follows a familiar template; the execution elevates through specificity (pomegranate harvest, prayer shawl symbols, stone-placing custom) but does not fully escape the template's gravity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira (diaspora returnee) is present throughout and her decisions—applying to the excavation, tracing roots, learning prayers, placing the stone, committing to return—drive all major beats and closure. Setup immediate (paragraph one), development across excavation and harvest, payoff in final stone-placing and return vow. Causal pressure: her outsider-insider status enables purposeful wandering and charges the final act of continuity. Cost visible: she forecloses academic detachment. Strong integration; a sharper on-page trade-off in the closure beat (what specific path she abandons by staying) would push toward 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sundial base handled in discovery beat (paragraph five), examined across weeks, documented for museum, and its meaning ("interrupted journeys") seeds the final commitment. Three-gate presence: setup at discovery, development through the traveler's backstory, payoff as Mira identifies with the circular return. Causal role: the sundial reframes her own interrupted journey and enables the stone-placing as conscious parallel. Moderate specificity; the octagonal base and missing gnomon are concrete but the sundial's unique properties (portable, traveler's tool) do not constrain a middle choice—it functions more as symbolic anchor than tactical lever. Swappability test: another artifact of return (e.g., a prayer book, a piece of jewelry) could serve similarly with modest edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Interrupted journeys" shapes stakes from the sundial discovery onward: Mira recognizes her own stalled path and the ancient traveler's completed circle. Setup in title of the concept (paragraph five), development through the backstory fragment, payoff when Mira decides to return next summer, resuming her interrupted journey with visible cost (fragile faith, ongoing reconstruction). Causal pressure: the concept narrows options from one-time visit to sustained engagement. Cost tied: she accepts the fragmentation rather than demanding certainty. The concept charges the final image but operates more as thematic lens than on-page tactical constraint; a moment where the interruption itself forces a choice would push higher.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Warmly curious" / "cautious enchantment" appears as repeated descriptor ("warmly curious instincts," "cautious enchantment," "cautious and enchanted") but rarely constrains a choice with cost. Setup implicit in "purposeful wandering" methodology, mentioned again at excavation and dusk visits. The trait enables her exploratory approach but does not force a visible trade-off—she never pays a price for curiosity (e.g., breaching protocol, missing a deadline, offending the team). Functional but replaceable: "patient" or "reverent" could substitute with minor edits. One mid-band causal link: curiosity leads to following roots and finding the sundial, but the cost of that curiosity is not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Rebuild" anchors the entire arc: Mira rebuilds prayers, harvest participation, dusk wandering, and the hollow space in her chest. Setup immediate ("how she hoped that digging...might help her rebuild"), development through learning prayers and harvesting, payoff in "she would return next summer" with ongoing reconstruction. Causal pressure: each rebuilding micro-choice (morning prayers, pomegranate harvest) narrows the academic detachment path. Cost visible: rebuilding is "painstaking" and "cautious," not triumphant—she accepts fragmentation. Strong irreplaceability; "restore" or "repair" would not carry the same constructive, iterative texture. The action drives closure but could score higher if a specific rebuilding attempt failed on the page with dramatized consequence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Purposeful wandering" named as methodology (paragraph four), enacted through tracing roots and following instincts, and echoed at dusk visits. Setup clear, development shows her following the method to the sundial discovery, payoff when the wandering becomes ritual (dusk visits, return commitment). Causal role: the method enables the key find. Moderate specificity: "purposeful wandering" is presented as a named alternative to rigid grids, but the mechanics (what makes it purposeful vs. aimless) remain abstract. Cost: no visible price for abandoning academic rigor until the final commitment. Swappability: "intuitive excavation" or "guided exploration" could substitute; the phrase's contribution is more tonal than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard (roots threading bones, fruit from ancestors) is setup in paragraph three, shapes multiple choices (wandering methodology, harvest participation, dusk visits for light through root-gaps), and charges the final image (roots continuing their work, next summer's return). Causal pressure: the orchard's physical logic (roots as continuity, bones as nourishment) enables Mira's conceptual shift from academic to participant. Cost connection: accepting that the dead feed the living requires her to accept fragmented faith. High specificity: the orchard's dual nature (burial site and harvest ground) is irreplaceable. Strong integration across setup, development, and closure; very close to indispensable tier.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Across excavating a tomb" provides loose frame: seven days to sundial discovery, "following weeks" of excavation, "last day" for stone-placing. Setup and payoff clear, but middle development is summary ("over the following weeks"). Time pressure is minimal—no live clock tightens choices, and the excavation duration does not force trade-offs. Functional but replaceable: "across several visits" or "during the season" could substitute. The timeframe enables accumulation (learning prayers, harvest, dusk visits) but does not constrain tactics; Mira never races a deadline or sacrifices one task for another due to time limits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Restore lost faith" is setup immediately ("the hollow space inside her chest where faith had once lived"), developed through prayers, harvest, and wandering, and payoff in "cautious and enchanted, something that felt remarkably like coming home." Causal pressure: the desire drives every choice from application onward. Friction visible: she cannot force certainty, must accept continuity instead, and the rebuilding is painstaking. Cost: she forecloses the option of academic detachment and accepts ongoing fragility. Strong integration; one notch below indispensable because the motivation is told more than dramatized in conflicting impulses—she moves steadily toward faith without a visible moment of doubt or backsliding that would test commitment with on-page cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Cautious enchantment" coheres through diction ("warmly curious," "cautious enchantment," light "painted," roots "patient"), modulates with pressure (academic precision early, reverent attention at closure), and charges the final image ("cautious and enchanted, something that felt remarkably like coming home"). Setup in methodology description, sustained through sensory detail (amber and rose light, particular silence), payoff when the tone itself becomes the emotional state. The tone supports accumulative escalation and reweights the stake without melodrama. Minor redundancy: "cautious enchantment" is named twice in similar phrasing rather than shown through varying cadence. Very close to indispensable tier; the tone is the story's signature texture.</comment>
