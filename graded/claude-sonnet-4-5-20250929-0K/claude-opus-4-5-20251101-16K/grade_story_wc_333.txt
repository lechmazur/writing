<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The locksmith is characterized through her occupation and repeated gestures (waiting, reading strands) but lacks embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The mother's grief is labeled ("hope and grief warring") rather than shown through contradictory impulses. Interior access is shallow—"understood," "learned long ago"—relying on summary rather than present tension. The final choice to "disorient the fear" happens off-stage in abstraction, with no visible cost that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who the locksmith is and where the nexus exists remain vague well past 120 words, though disorientation is not taught as a pattern (−0.4). Closure hinges on the mother receiving the glowing hair, but the locksmith's work occurs in summary ("she worked her ancient trade") with no on-page decisive change or visible cost to the protagonist. The piece ends with the locksmith waiting again—Earned Stasis is signaled, but no live option is foreclosed on the page. Drive lens is ambiguous between Accumulative and Situational, never clarifying by closure (−0.3).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "shadowed nexus" and "starlight" anchor atmosphere but remain generic postcard description. The lock of hair functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image (glow, light spilling from ribbon coils), meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Spatial choreography is thin—no clear room, tools "unseen by ordinary eyes," and the mother's departure lacks grounding. Sensory detail defaults to visual (stars, bruising sky) with minimal texture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—freeing the child's trapped voice—is signaled early. Pressure remains static: the locksmith waits for twilight, receives a hint, then works in summary without on-page complication. The "disorient the fear" tactic is told, not dramatized, so escalation never materializes. No reversal or meaningful tightening occurs; the mother's tears signal resolution but without the locksmith paying a visible price or making a trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Theme (the cost of silence, longing to be loved differently) is declared in the hair-reading beat rather than emerging from action. The final paragraph sermonizes: "the only work worth doing" and "tender of the world's most fragile cargo" replace earned resonance with overt thematic statement (−0.6). The child's secret is resolved as "not a terrible thing at all," flattening complexity. Recurrence of "enveloped secrets" and "nexus" feels ornamental rather than reweighting prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and attempts a lyric register ("soft as moth wings," "hemorrhaged into night"), but diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("architecture of the soul," "hush of cosmic possibility") that feels generic rather than character-specific. The mother's dialogue is brief and functional. POV remains stable third-limited on the locksmith with no head-hopping. Psychic distance fluctuates without clear purpose—zooming into "she had learned long ago" summaries, then pulling back to cosmic observation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "enveloped secrets" / "wrapped in the ribbon like a gift no one dared open"; "unassumingly bold" label recurs without dramatization; "shadowed nexus" and "liminal space where anything could become" restate the same concept. Template cadence appears in the final two paragraphs with repeated "she waited" / "she would be ready" stems (−0.5). Overwriting in peak beats: "hemorrhaged," "bruising," "flickered in a pattern" stacks figurative density without clarity gain (−0.4). The closure beat—light spilling from ribbon—is clear, capping non-closure deductions at −0.8 total.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The core premise—locksmith who frees psychological prisons—fits a widely used metaphor-as-occupation template without transformation through specific world logic or moral calculus (−0.8). The "first star at twilight gives a hint" and "reading trauma in hair strands" borrow fantasy tropes without fresh synthesis. Emotional territory (child's silence from shame) is earnest but generic. The nexus and cosmic framing add atmosphere but no structural originality. No bold risk that heightens stakes beyond the template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Present throughout and labeled "enigmatic locksmith," but her choices are passive (waiting, receiving, interpreting) rather than creating key turns. She decides to "disorient the fear," but this occurs off-stage in summary. No visible cost or trade-off tied to her agency. Swappable with "wise healer" or similar archetype with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Appears in beat one (mother brings it), middle beat (locksmith unravels and reads it), and closure (glows, returned to mother). The ribbon shifts from inert to luminous, reweighting its meaning. However, its mechanics are vague—"tools unseen" and abstract trauma-reading—so causal pressure is limited. Charged reprise at closure elevates it into the 6-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Mentioned repeatedly ("enveloped secrets," "wrapped in the ribbon," "secret finally exhaled") but remains abstract theme rather than shaping on-page tactics. The locksmith's method of freeing the secret is summarized, not dramatized. Label-only use without cost (−0.3). Functional presence but swappable with "hidden truths" or similar concept.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Labeled twice ("unassumingly bold," "reached into impossible places") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. No moment where boldness trades off against caution or humility. Ornamental descriptor that could be removed without altering choices or momentum.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Named explicitly ("make it lose its bearings") and described as the method ("spinning it in circles until it forgot"), but the action occurs off-stage in summary. The tactic is told rather than dramatized with micro-steps. Present in the middle beat and shapes the resolution, meeting two gates. Causal role is asserted but not shown, limiting the score to mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Introduced early (locksmith says "we must wait for the hint"), appears at the midpoint (Venus flickers, delivers message), and directly enables the disorient tactic. The mechanics are clear: three pulses signal "beneath the door." Signaled in setup, shapes middle choice, and linked to closure method. However, the hint itself is abstract—no cost or constraint tied to waiting for it—so causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Present throughout ("nexus where paths converge," "shadowed nexus under starlight") but functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining choices. No moment where the setting's properties (shadow, convergence, starlight) alter tactics or supply a resource. Postcard description trends low. Late final-paragraph repetition feels ornamental (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Mentioned in one phrase ("across the hush of cosmic possibility") that appears twice, but time is not tracked or tightened. "Twilight approaches" signals a wait, but no urgency or deadline pressures the locksmith's work. Vague and untracked time trends low. No live clock that alters moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Stated explicitly (mother wants "whatever she's holding inside" freed) and drives the locksmith's work. The motivation is present in setup, middle, and closure. However, the locksmith's own desire is never conflicted or tested—she simply performs her "ancient trade" without friction between want and cost. Dramatized minimally; no visible trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Tone is signaled ("improbable work," "she had always believed in improbable things") and recurs in the final paragraphs. The longing is asserted rather than embodied in charged choices under pressure. Tone remains static—lyric and wistful throughout—without modulation to reflect escalation or cost. Present and coherent, but does not charge the final image with new weight. Mid-band.</comment>
