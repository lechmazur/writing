<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's interior is consistently grounded: "errant because she had stopped believing the legends she was meant to chronicle" shows clear trait development. The contradiction between idolization and disillusionment drives her choices, and the dive decision forecloses her prior stance with visible cost. The final moment—sundial pressed to chest—embodies understanding rather than declaring it. Minor: the father's corruption arc is told rather than tested on-page, limiting felt contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Elara surfaces with evidence, and the final image (sundial against chest, secrets heading to daylight) constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration with visible cost—she has dismantled her father's legacy and accepted the emotional price. Causal lens holds: discovery of journals → doubt → dive → evidence → acceptance. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening (crates reveal weapons, not supplies) tightens the dominant stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The canal and barge micro-setting constrain choice: the darkened depth signals deliberate burial, and the submerged hold delivers the climactic evidence. Sensory detail is purposeful—"water that had become thoughtfully clear," "trees leaned over the water like mourners"—and filtered through Elara's reflective stance. The sundial (useless at night) charges the final image by returning with reweighted meaning. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the descent and surfacing.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding her father's lies—is signaled early and tightens once via the dive that reveals weapons. The discovery narrows options (she can no longer protect his legend) and the final acceptance forecloses denial with felt cost. Agency is clear: Elara chooses to dive, document, and carry the truth home. Escalation is modest but sufficient for this length; the weapons discovery is the single decisive pressure point that reweights all prior reflection.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme (the architecture of lies vs. truth) emerges organically from the crates, journals, and sundial without meta-commentary. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "secrets that would finally see the sun" reweights the sundial's earlier uselessness and her father's shadow-work. Hindsight clarity is enacted rather than stated—"In hindsight, it was all so clear"—and the final image charges prior material. No overt moralizing; complexity (fear, loyalty, corruption) is acknowledged without false equivalence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV distance is stable; Elara's reflective register fits her chronicler background. Perceptual signature is consistent: "serene upheaval," "lies with load-bearing walls and elegant arches" show an architectural bias. Marek's brief dialogue feels natural and distinct. Minor slips: "the silence of morning radio" appears twice in identical phrasing (loop), and "that strange peace that comes from accepting…" edges toward over-articulation for a moment of crisis. Psychic distance modulates appropriately as she dives and surfaces.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and propulsion is generally strong. However, two paraphrase loops appear: "hindsight clarity" is repeated conceptually in adjacent paragraphs ("In hindsight, it was all so clear"), and "the silence of morning radio—that strange hour…" recurs verbatim. Template cadence emerges in reflection: "Not artifacts. Not reputation. Understanding." reads as scaffold. Mixed metaphor: lies have "load-bearing walls" yet are also "crushed beneath" the truth—architectural logic wobbles. These artifacts touch a high-pressure beat (the reflection before dive), triggering −0.6 and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—diver exposes covered-up shipwreck—is familiar, but the choice to focus on a daughter's reckoning with her chronicler father's complicity adds specificity. The sundial motif (useless at night, symbol of her father's former integrity) offers a fresh angle. Emotional complexity (understanding "not just what her father had done, but why") avoids simplistic vindication. However, the scuttled-ship-with-weapons twist is well-worn, and the story does not fully escape template territory. Execution is confident but not bold.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her choices (agreeing to the dive, documenting the crates, surfacing with evidence) create the key turn. "Errant" and "seeker" are dramatized: she has stopped believing yet continues searching. The final decision to bring secrets to light is causally earned and forecloses her prior protection of her father's legend.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The sundial appears in three beats: pocket mention, turned over in twilight ("useless for telling time in this darkness"), and pressed to chest at closure. Its "uselessness" charges the irony of her father's former integrity, and the final reprise reweights it. However, it is not handled or used in a way that constrains choice; it remains primarily symbolic. Two touches plus charged reprise place it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Hindsight clarity" is the organizing principle: Elara's journals discovery, the dive, and the final understanding all enact retrospective illumination. The concept shapes her motivation and the story's structure (past lies → present evidence → future disclosure). However, it also appears as a label in the text ("the hindsight clarity that others deserved," "In hindsight, it was all so clear"), which lowers irreplaceability. The concept drives stakes but is somewhat told.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Thoughtfully clear" modifies the canal water in one image and does not return or constrain action. The attribute does not enable a choice or impose a cost; it is decorative description. Label-only use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Salvage" is signaled early ("Now she was here to salvage what remained"), enacted in the dive (photographing the crates), and charges the ending ("salvage the truth they had crushed beneath them"). The action is causally central: without the salvage dive, the climax and closure do not occur. The word's double meaning (recovering wreckage / recovering integrity) is purposeful and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Training instincts" is mentioned twice: "she had trained her instincts over years of doubt" and "Her instincts, trained through years of questioning, kept her hands steady." The method is labeled but its mechanics are not shown—how does she identify dissonance in stories, and how does that skill operate underwater? It appears as background rather than shaping on-page attempts. Present but not causally active.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The twilight canal is the sole location and provides the key resource: the darkened depth where the Starling rests. The barge enables access, and the canal's "forgotten stretch" isolates the discovery. The setting constrains choice (two-hour limit, cold water) and the submerged hold delivers the climactic evidence. Twilight tonally charges the serene/upheaval mood. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"The silence of morning radio" bookends the story: mentioned in the backstory discovery and again when she surfaces ("the morning radio hour had come"). The timeframe marks a threshold (night dive → dawn return) and tonally supports the hindsight/revelation theme. However, it does not tighten decisions or impose a live clock that alters tactics. Two touches with thematic reprise, but no pressure role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"To understand the architecture of lies" is dramatized: Elara dives not for revenge but for understanding, and the final moment ("She understood now") pays off that goal. The motivation is signaled early, drives the key choice (the dive), and is tested against emotional cost (her father's corruption). The architectural metaphor recurs and charges the closure. Desire is enacted with visible friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Serene upheaval" is purposefully sustained: "that strange peace that comes from accepting that everything you believed has crumbled" and the opening's "thoughtfully clear" water establish the oxymoronic mood. Tone modulates as she dives and surfaces, and the final dawn image ("carrying secrets that would finally see the sun") maintains the calm/charged duality. However, the tone is more asserted than embodied in syntax; rhythm does not shift under pressure. Coherent but not fully realized in craft.</comment>
