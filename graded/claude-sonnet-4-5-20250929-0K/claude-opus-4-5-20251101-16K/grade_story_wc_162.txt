<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's interior life shows genuine complexity—her investigation of the desk grain and cross-referencing multiple sources demonstrates motivated agency. The father remains well-characterized through absence and artifacts, though his "transcendence" epiphany arrives through reflection rather than dramatized contradiction. Her final resolve to "stop searching" and "start building" feels psychologically earned but lacks embodied struggle in the present frame. Minor slip: "featherly determined" appears as decorative label rather than trait that constrains choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure unit is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Maren renounces the search with visible cost ("she could not follow him") and the final decision to descend and build her own labyrinth reweights her seventeen-year lostness. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens, building density through nested patterns (mazes, thresholds, grain analysis) that converge at the ending. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes his death was deliberate transcendence, not accident, which narrows her options and forecloses following him.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace functions as micro-setting that charges the final image—its suspension and drift mirror her investigative state and her decision to "descend" gains weight from the physical elevation. The desk's wood grain is handled tactilely across multiple beats and directly enables her method of investigation. Spatial choreography remains coherent (terrace above, cornfields below, mountains between) and the evening light progression tracks time naturally. The terrace's prismatic quality refracts meaning at closure ("refracting the first stars into something almost like language").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding her father's disappearance and her own lostness—is signaled early and tightens once when she decodes his deliberate flight into the storm, which forecloses the option of viewing his death as accident or abandonment. The "butterfly effect" discovery operates as backstory frame rather than on-page pressure, but her present investigation (logbook, grain analysis, cross-referencing) demonstrates agency. The final choice to build her own maze rather than follow him constitutes renunciation with felt cost. Escalation is modest but legible under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of "necessary distances" emerges organically through nested particulars—maze architecture, cockpit thresholds, the terrace's literal elevation, and the conceptual space between living and dying. The final image offers a resonant answer without moralizing: "sometimes the only way to honor the dead is to stop searching for them and start building the paths they never could." Her shift from decoding his thresholds to designing her own labyrinth reweights the opening lostness with undeniable pressure. Minor slip: "necessary distances...makes love bearable" verges on abstraction in the penultimate paragraph but recovers through the concrete plan to build.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV control is stable throughout with a distinct lyric-textural voice that modulates naturally with reflection and present observation. Perceptual signature is consistent—maze-architect's vocabulary ("dead ends," "thresholds," "passages") colors her investigation. Register occasionally drifts into elevated philosophical diction ("theology," "transcendence") that feels slightly above the dramatic pressure, but remains voice-motivated given her reflective frame. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. The compression and patterned repetition (thresholds, grain, distances) are taught early and pay off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high with most lines advancing understanding or atmosphere. Several template-cadence runs appear: "She had developed...She had noticed...She would have to..." and "He had written...He was obsessed...He built." Minor paraphrase loop: "necessary distances" and "space that makes love bearable" restate the same idea in adjacent paragraphs. The grain-reading method is established but never shown in concrete sensory detail—we're told "pressure of his hands, direction of his strokes" without demonstration. Figurative language is controlled but occasionally clusters without clear escalation ("fractured hush," "featherly determined").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of maze architecture, pilot's weather codes, and wood-grain analysis as investigative method is specific and non-obvious. The terrace setting and the reframing of "lost child" through necessary distances rather than abandonment show fresh angles. Risk-taking in the lyric-reflective structure and the decision to render the father's death as "transcendence" rather than tragedy elevate the piece. Slight deduction for the "butterfly effect" frame feeling like convenient naming rather than earned metaphor, and the wood-grain method remaining more assertion than demonstration.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maren as "corn maze architect's lost child" frames the opening and her identity crisis, appears in her investigation choices (cross-referencing maze measurements), and directly shapes the closure decision to design her own labyrinth. Present across all three gates with causal involvement, but the "lost child" framing is more thematic container than active constraint on tactics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The pilot logbook appears in paragraph two, is actively consulted mid-story ("she found a new code"), and the decoded message (deliberate flight) triggers the key realization that narrows her options. Handled in two distinct beats with evolving understanding. Closure decision references it indirectly but the logbook itself does not appear in the final image, limiting top-band eligibility.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Necessary distances" is introduced early as "her theology," constrains her understanding of her father's choices, reappears in the decoding revelation, and is directly restated in the penultimate paragraph as the principle underlying her future maze design. Shapes tactics (acceptance rather than pursuit) and charges the closure stance. Strong thematic and tactical integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Featherly determined" appears once in the grain-investigation paragraph and once in the final paragraph as resolution descriptor. No on-page action demonstrates how this particular quality (light but strong) constrains or enables a choice differently than "determined" alone would. Decorative trait mention without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Intuit" governs her investigative method throughout—intuiting from wood grain, cross-referencing codes, and the final line "prepared to intuit her way home." The action is present in the opening third, drives the middle decoding beat, and charges the ending. However, the mechanics of intuition remain abstract; we see results but not the embodied process of pattern recognition, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Analyzing wood grain is introduced by paragraph four, explicitly described as her accidental method, and referenced at closure ("pressed her palm once more against the sacred grain"). Appears in two beats and provides the investigative frame. However, the method is asserted rather than demonstrated—we never see her trace a specific stroke or pressure pattern and draw a conclusion, keeping it functional but somewhat replaceable with any symbolic decoding method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace frames the entire story, supplies the investigative sanctuary, and its elevation above the landscape enables the maze-pattern recognition. The decision to "descend" gains weight and cost from this specific setting. The prismatic light appears in opening and closing beats, refracting meaning both times. Integral to spatial logic, tone, and closure image. Strong causal and atmospheric integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"After the butterfly effect" (three years post-crash) establishes the reflective frame and is referenced explicitly as the journals discovery. The timeframe enables the investigation and distance necessary for understanding. Present in setup and informs the closure decision, but does not create on-page urgency or alter tactics—it's a permissive frame rather than a tightening constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Discovering why some thresholds feel sacred motivates both father's obsession (journals) and Maren's investigation. The motivation drives her cross-referencing and grain analysis, and her realization that "her sacred thresholds were different" directly shapes the closure decision to build her own maze. Present across beats with clear causal role, though the desire itself faces no friction or competing want that would create visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Fractured hush" is established in the opening paragraph's scattered rainbows and dying sun, deepens with "the fractured hush of evening settled around her like snow," and charges the final stance ("The fractured hush remained, but within it now lived something featherly determined"). Tone coherently supports the reflective-investigative mode and modulates subtly from grief-investigation to resolve. The recurring phrase reweights from atmospheric descriptor to emotional state container.</comment>
