<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's quietly analytic trait shapes perception and micro-choices consistently—she photographs evidence methodically even as impossible implications emerge. Her relationship with death and the mother's disappearance anchor motivation with embodied history. Internal contradiction surfaces when clinical detachment meets personal revelation: "she would never share the true discovery." The snow globe moment could be more embodied; the hand "closed around" reads generic where tactile specificity would sharpen character-particular noticing.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—"letting go" reweights to "displacement" and "non-linear existence" through the discovery, charging the final ascent with cost (keeping secret, accepting paradox). Orientation anchors quickly: Elara, 300m depth, SS Meridian library, post-Earhart discovery. The temporal paradox (Persephone message in 1939, ship built 1999) lands with clarity and the snow globe reprise charges the ending image. One tightening: the radio log discovery narrows options from general salvage to personal reckoning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The forgotten library setting constrains choice—rusted door, oilcloth preservation, filing cabinets—and supplies the radio log that drives closure. Depth pressure ("companionable"), headlamp beam, and the glowing snow globe charge spatial awareness. Sensory detail stays selective (water movement in globe, darkness, beam). The library's dual-crew occupation recurs at closure to weight "simultaneous dead." Micro-setting (snow globe as recurring object) charges the final image when it glows impossibly during ascent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: understanding her mother's disappearance, signaled early through the twenty-year backstory anchor. The radio log discovery tightens pressure by collapsing closure into paradox rather than simple retrieval. Agency crystallizes in the renunciation: "she would never share the true discovery"—a visible cost that forecloses the path of public validation. The Earhart frame promises clean mystery-solving but Elara's choice refuses that template. One deepening suffices at this length; cost is legible in secrecy and solitary knowledge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme of non-linear loss and "physics of letting go" emerges through the temporal fold, snow globe recurrence, and the mother's message—concrete particulars rather than abstract claim. The Earhart discovery frames expectation (clean closure) that the ending subverts: "mysteries could be solved cleanly. But Elara knew better." Final image (glowing lighthouse, ascent toward "question") offers non-literal answer without moralizing. The "simultaneous dead" and "frequencies the living could not always detect" risk abstraction but remain tethered to the radio log and depth setting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature: clinical noticing ("methodical work," "analytic by nature") modulates under emotional pressure when the mother's message appears, yet diction stays controlled. Free indirect style clean: "She understood now, by untangling threads"—no filter clutter. Sentence rhythm tightens during discovery ("Her hands trembled as she photographed the page") then opens for reflection. The "first name basis with death" frame recurs purposefully at closure. Minor slip: "the way death itself had become companionable" reads slightly elevated for in-scene pressure at 300m.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density high; most lines advance discovery or reweight meaning. Rhythm varies—short urgency ("And then she found it") against longer reflective moves. Loop present: "mysteries could be solved" / "mysteries could be solved cleanly" across paragraphs; "simultaneous" recurs three times in final section without added pressure. Template opener "She placed it" / "She tucked" / "She smiled" stacks similar stems. Metaphor mostly clean but "fold of time" + "folded like paper cranes" mixes mechanics. No clarity break at closure. Deductions stay within non-closure cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Temporal-fold premise (ship from 1939 receives message from 1999 vessel built later) offers fresh physics on lost-expedition trope. Snow globe as heirloom/anchor across impossible time shows specific synthesis. The Earhart frame cleverly sets expectation then subverts it. Risk: the paradox mechanics are asserted rather than explored—no visible constraint from the fold itself, only the emotional reweighting. The "first name basis with death" and clinical-diver voice feel lived-in. Transformation test: the core could work with different names, but the lighthouse/snow globe/radio specificity adds irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara ("first name basis with death") drives all key turns: chooses to continue dive after finding snow globe, photographs the impossible log, decides to withhold discovery. Present in setup (opening frame), middle choice (log decision), and closure (ascent with secret). Causal pressure: her analytic nature enables the discovery yet her personal history makes secrecy the costly choice. Cost legible: professional validation foregone.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Snow globe appears in three beats: discovery (wrapped in oilcloth, swirling sediment), recognition (mother's desk heirloom), closure (glowing impossibly during ascent, tucked against chest). Setup early, reweighted at midpoint via memory link, charges final image. Specific properties (lighthouse, fragility across generations, impossible glow) matter causally—it's the proof of temporal fold. Removing it breaks the heirloom thread and weakens closure charge. Just shy of indispensable because the radio log alone could carry plot.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Last transmission" drives dominant stake and discovery: the radio log from Persephone is the core turn, delivering the mother's message that redefines "letting go." Present in title expectation (Meridian's last state), middle climax (log discovery), and closure reweighting (transmission "still echoing across decades"). The concept shapes tactics—Elara's methodical cataloging seeks transmissions—and alters options by collapsing retrieval into paradox. Cost: she must accept non-linear existence rather than linear closure. Indispensable to plot and theme.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Quietly analytic" mentioned once as trait ("she was quietly analytic by nature") and demonstrated through methodical photography, clinical logging, decision to withhold. Enables discovery (patience, precision) and constrains emotional display even under revelation ("hands trembled" but she still photographs). Visible in setup and closure choice. Cost: emotional isolation, colleagues' misreading. Functional but approaches swappability—"methodical" or "detached" would serve similar role with minor edits. Mid-band for demonstration without irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Note" action (Elara notes artifacts in dive log, "noted in her dive log the precise location") frames her clinical method and recurs at closure when she logs "clinical details" while withholding truth. Enables the professional mask that makes secrecy costly. Present in two beats, shapes final choice. Could be replaced with "record" or "document" without breaking logic. Solid causal role but moderate swappability keeps it mid-to-upper band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Untangling threads" method signaled early ("untangling threads of evidence from the chaos"), executed during discovery (wire recordings, coded messages, captain's shorthand), and reappears at realization ("by untangling threads that stretched across impossible distances"). Shapes middle attempts (methodical sorting) and charges closure understanding. Metaphor earns literal work—she physically sorts documents. Removing it would require different method framing. Strong development and payoff; setup could be earlier for higher score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Forgotten sunken ship library supplies discovery resources (sealed door, filing cabinets, oilcloth protection, radio log) and pressures via depth/darkness. Mentioned in setup, active in middle discovery beats, returns at closure ("library held its secrets, its simultaneous dead"). The "remarkably preserved" state enables plot; removing this exact setting (e.g., open deck wreck) breaks access to documents. Spatial constraint (300m pressure) and the dual-crew grave charge final image. Essential across beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After finding Amelia Earhart's plane" timeframe mentioned twice: opening context ("six weeks after") and closure contrast ("world that had just found Amelia Earhart"). Sets thematic expectation (clean closure now possible) that ending subverts. Does not tighten dive decisions or create time pressure within scene. Functional framing but swappable—any recent high-profile recovery would serve. Mid-band for thematic setup without tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Understand the physics of letting go" motivation drives Elara's twenty-year search, appears in mother's message ("physics of letting go require acceptance"), and reweights at closure (ascent as trust rather than release). Desire dramatized through choice to dive, withhold discovery, accept paradox. Friction: professional closure (share discovery) versus personal acceptance (keep secret). Cost legible in final solitude. Present across all three gates, with visible tradeoff. Strong integration; just under indispensable because plot functions without the exact phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Sophisticated melancholy" tone sustained through controlled diction ("companionable" death, "whispers of two crews"), measured revelation pacing, and reflective closure without sentimentality. Modulates appropriately: clinical during discovery, trembling at mother's message, quiet resolve at ascent. Charges final image: "surface waited like a question." Coherent through all pressure points. Removing tone—shifting to thriller urgency or romantic catharsis—would break the "physics of letting go" thematic register. Nearly indispensable for conceptual integrity.</comment>
