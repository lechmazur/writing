<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera's interiority is concrete and embodied through constellation tattoos that "gave their light," and her grief is enacted through the journey rather than merely declared. The twenty-year timeline and the baby-crying crisis establish clear motivation, but the emotional progression feels too smooth—grief to tears to closure—without the contradictory impulses or messy irrationality that would elevate the work. The amber's final message "NOT YOUR FAULT" arrives as convenient absolution rather than emerging from Vera's own earned struggle; she receives wisdom rather than forging it through on-page conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The story delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Vera tethers her guilt to the amber, preserving it without letting it poison her further, and the constellation tattoos dim as visible cost. The causal lens holds—amber enables translation, translation reveals the baby's pain, revelation allows tethering—but the closure beat relies on the amber's unexpected second message rather than Vera's own action or renunciation. The "meteor hush" frame and time-folding setup create atmospheric coherence, yet the laboratory's mechanics (haunted firmware, tethering process) are introduced and resolved within a single visit without complication or reversal.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The laboratory is vividly rendered with spectral data, haunted processors, and an antique secretary desk, and the setting actively enables the plot through its translation attribute and tethering machinery. The constellation tattoos function as micro-setting that recurs (sleeves, console, dimming) and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (entrance, desk, console, exit), and the "meteor hush" tone modulates pressure effectively. The amber as recurring object constrains the tethering choice and carries the insect's forty-million-year backstory, making it indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—silencing guilt over the untranslated baby cries—is signaled early and drives Vera's journey. Pressure tightens once: the firmware translates the cries (PAIN, STOMACH, HELP), proving the baby was sick and Vera missed it, which deepens her culpability before the amber's absolution message releases her. Agency is limited; Vera follows instructions (letters, amber placement) rather than making high-cost tactical choices under fire. The resolution depends on the amber's second message—a gift from the object—rather than Vera's internal alteration or renunciation, weakening protagonist-driven escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the laboratory's archive of silenced voices and Vera's untranslated grief: "The cries we cannot translate are not our failures." The amber's dual message (baby's pain, insect's release) layers meaning without overt moralizing, and the constellation motif recurs with purpose (inking stars, connecting circuits, dimming at closure). The final image of guilt preserved in amber rather than erased avoids false comfort and offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Minor slip: the insect's "NOT YOUR FAULT" message veers close to stating the theme directly rather than leaving it fully implicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is controlled and distinct, with purposeful compression ("meteor hush," "haunted firmware") and a perceptual signature filtered through Vera's grief and tattooist past. Psychic distance modulates cleanly, tightening during the translation reveal ("small, desperate, terribly familiar") and opening for reflection. No dialogue appears; interiority carries the load without filter-verb stacks or therapy-speak. The prose maintains its texture under pressure, and the final note Vera writes feels earned rather than expository, though it edges close to theme summary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. The opening ("space between heartbeats," "pages in a forgotten book") and closure image (constellations dimmed, laboratory humming) frame the piece with purpose. Minor loop: "the crying began" / "hours of wailing" and "the baby had been trying to tell her something" / "failed to translate" repeat the same idea across adjacent beats. Some phrases ("terribly familiar," "meteor hush of the laboratory wrapped around her") edge toward stock lyricism, but they remain voice-coherent and do not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—haunted firmware in a laboratory of lost sounds—synthesizes archive fiction, grief narrative, and speculative technology in a fresh frame, and the amber-as-tether mechanism adds specificity. The constellation tattoos and forty-million-year-old insect anchor the fantastical elements in tactile detail. However, the emotional arc (guilt → translation → absolution) follows a familiar template, and the insect's message delivers resolution rather than forcing Vera to forge it herself. The laboratory's potential for deeper world-building (other visitors, other sounds, the architect's full story) remains ornamental rather than integral to Vera's stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Vera's role as constellation tattooist is mentioned (opening, closing) but does not constrain or enable on-page choices; she could be any grief-stricken seeker. The tattoos recur as motif (glowing, connecting to circuits, dimming) and charge the final image, but Vera's past occupation does not shape her tactics or create friction.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The amber appears early (sister's estate sale), returns at the tethering beat (touching console, glowing), and provides the insect's final message that enables closure. Its forty-million-year preservation mirrors Vera's suspended guilt and makes the tethering mechanism specific. Removing it would break the closure logic; no other object carries this dual temporal weight.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Haunted firmware is introduced early and enables the translation attribute on the page (baby cries → text output). It shapes the laboratory's atmosphere and provides the mechanism for Vera's revelation. However, the firmware itself does not constrain Vera's choices or create tactical friction; it functions as a passive tool that delivers answers when activated, making it more atmospheric than structurally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The translation attribute drives the central revelation: firmware decodes the baby's cries into HUNGER, COLD, PAIN, STOMACH, HELP, proving the baby was communicating and Vera missed it. This output directly shapes Vera's emotional turn and primes the tethering choice. The attribute appears in the closure sequence and creates visible cost (confirmation of her failure). Without this exact function, the guilt resolution collapses.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Tethering is seeded in the handwritten letters, enacted at the console (binding guilt to amber), and completes Vera's arc by suspending her guilt without erasing it. The action defines the closure and differentiates this resolution from simple forgiveness. However, the tethering process is described rather than dramatized in granular steps, and Vera follows instructions without significant on-page struggle or cost during the act itself.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The handwritten letters appear early (antique secretary desk), describe the tethering process, and Vera adds her own note at the end, creating a purposeful frame. The method provides specific instructions (amber as anchor, tethering mechanics) that guide Vera's action. Yet the letters function as exposition delivery rather than shaping Vera's attempts or creating friction; she reads and executes without complication, making the method functional but replaceable by other instruction forms.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The laboratory frames all action, provides the firmware and console that enable translation and tethering, and embodies the story's theme (archive of silenced voices). The setting's "meteor hush" and spectral data create coherent atmosphere, and the antique desk supplies the letters. Removing the laboratory would collapse the plot entirely; no other setting offers these affordances and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Time-folding is mentioned at the opening and closing ("time began to unfold again") and establishes the laboratory's liminal accessibility. However, the timeframe does not tighten Vera's decisions or create urgency; the laboratory remains open for the duration of her single visit without complication. The concept is atmospheric rather than constraint-generating, making it swappable with other "rare access" mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vera's motivation—to hush the dissonance of old guilt—is signaled early, drives her journey to the laboratory, and is tested when the firmware reveals the baby's pain (deepening guilt before release). The tethering choice enacts this motivation on the page. Friction exists between her desire for silence and the cost of confronting the specific failure (PAIN, STOMACH, HELP), though the amber's absolution message reduces the tension somewhat.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Meteor hush is invoked explicitly ("that cosmic silence that follows catastrophic passage") and the prose maintains a hushed, elegiac register throughout—no jarring tonal breaks. The tone modulates subtly (grief to revelation to release) and charges the final image (laboratory humming, Vera stepping back into forward time). However, the tone is somewhat static rather than escalating in pressure; a single mood dominates without sharp cadence shifts that would elevate it further.</comment>
