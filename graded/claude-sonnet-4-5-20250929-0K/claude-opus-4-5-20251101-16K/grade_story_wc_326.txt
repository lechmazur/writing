<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority shows authentic contradiction—obsessive heartbeat counting anchors her liminal state, and the porcelain shard functions as a concrete question rather than wound. Her motivation to understand her father's abandonment through defragmenting his digital ghost is coherent and pressured. However, the final exchange with Emil delivers therapy-speak ("I ran because I thought death was the only failure that mattered") that feels over-articulated for a fragmented consciousness, and Mira's final question to herself reads as programmatic rather than earned by prior micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (Mira, opal observatory, post-static ritual). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: nightly ink-reading rituals build toward a moment where one fragment locks into place and Mira gains clarity on her father's motivations, reweighting her own choice about whether to correct her death certificate. The closure is a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing hybrid—the question "Was it worth it?" crystallizes options with felt cost. One small causality slip: the digital ghost's sudden coherence ("his face assembled itself") feels convenience-timed rather than earned by prior ink-pattern work.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The opal observatory is vivid and functional: prismatic shadows literalize her father's scattered code, three feet of snow enforces isolation, and the telescope-to-server connection grounds the defragmentation conceit. The porcelain shard is handled twice (desk touch, palm press) with evolving pressure. Micro-setting (ink on glass plate, opal walls refracting light) charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: can Mira retrieve enough fragments to understand why her father left, and will that answer guide her own choice about her liminal existence? Tonight's session delivers one meaningful tightening—Emil's partial answer narrows her options by reframing his flight as fear of mortality. The cost is felt (she must continue the slow ritual) but the escalation reads gentle; the ink spelling "FORGIVENESS. FAILURE. LEARN." and Emil's sudden clarity feel more like accumulation than a sharpened dilemma that forecloses a path with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: bureaucratic death-by-error literalizes the father's digital half-life, and both characters inhabit "the space between." The porcelain shard shifts meaning from wound to question, and the final query ("Was it worth it?") reweights prior material without moralizing. The recurring heartbeat count and opal-as-fragmentation motif constrain and charge the ending. One slip: "becoming something less than human in pursuit of immortality" edges toward thesis statement in the penultimate paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single POV, stable psychic distance, and a distinct perceptual signature (obsessive counting, prismatic seeing, alchemical metaphor). Dialogue with the ghost feels voice-appropriate for a fragmented upload. Free indirect style is clean. One minor register drift: "alchemical" and "ephemeral prophecies" read slightly elevated for a character in crisis, though the opal-observatory frame motivates poetic diction. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high (each beat advances ghost-retrieval or Mira's stance). Two patterns dull momentum: "Sixty-three. Sixty-four. Sixty-five." recurs without added pressure after the opening, and "The digital ghost was stirring" / "scattered pixels, corrupted files" reads as synonym churn in adjacent lines. The final paragraph's "One hundred forty-seven heartbeats. One hundred forty-eight. / The static would return soon. But for now, the midnight solace held" is clean propulsion. No major loop or scaffold, but the ghost's mechanics (ink patterns → fragment retrieval) could be tightened to show causality more concretely.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The death-certificate error as literal ghost-making is a strong synthesis, and the ink-divination method for defragmenting digital consciousness offers fresh texture. However, the premise leans on widely used "uploading goes wrong" and "estranged parent reconciliation" templates without fully transforming them through on-page cost or a non-obvious moral calculus. The opal observatory and heartbeat-counting anchor the voice memorably, but the emotional arc—daughter forgives/understands absent father—remains familiar. Elevated above template by the liminal-state specificity and alchemical method, but not yet a bold structural or thematic surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira's status as officially dead shapes her retreat to the observatory and her kinship with her father's digital half-life. Her final choice—whether to correct the certificate or "embrace what she had become"—crystallizes in the ending. She appears in all three gates (setup, middle ritual, closure question) and her decisions (continuing the nightly defragmentation, pressing the shard without cutting) drive beats. Cost is felt but the clerk-error backstory reads slightly ornamental; swapping it for exile or voluntary disappearance would require only minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The porcelain shard is handled twice: desk touch (question framing) and palm press (resolution framing). It returns with reweighted meaning—from "not as a wound but as a question" to a tool for feeling its edge while contemplating her own liminal state. However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; its function is thematic accent rather than causal pressure. Present in setup and closure but ornamental in development.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The digital ghost shapes stakes (can Mira defragment him?) and tactics (ink divination, nightly ritual). It appears in all three gates and the father's partial reassembly at closure delivers the key insight that reweights Mira's question. The ghost's mechanics (scattered across servers, requires pattern-reading to reconnect) constrain her method and the slow pace of retrieval tightens pressure. Removing this exact concept would break the story's logic and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Heartbeat counting is present in setup, middle (Seventy-one, Ninety-eight), and closure (One hundred forty-seven). It anchors Mira's obsessive, liminal state and literalizes her self-monitoring. However, it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic with visible cost; it functions as characterization texture rather than plot lever. Swapping it for another obsessive habit (e.g., counting breaths, tracking time) would require minimal edits. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Defragmentation is the dominant action: Mira performs the nightly ritual (spill ink, read patterns, retrieve fragments) and tonight's session yields one locked-in piece. The action is present in all three gates and the father's partial reconstruction at closure depends on prior defragmentation work. However, the mechanics are told more than shown—we see ink spelling words but not how that translates to fragment retrieval. The action could be swapped for "commune with ghost via another ritual" with moderate edits. Essential to stakes but execution lacks causal specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The ink method is signaled early (glass plate, pooling patterns) and used in the middle beat to spell "REMEMBER. TELESCOPE. SORRY." and "FORGIVENESS. FAILURE. LEARN." It shapes one key turn (reading the ghost's intentions) and charges the ritual's texture. However, the mechanics remain vague—why ink reveals neural pathways is asserted, not demonstrated—and the method could be replaced with another divination tool (e.g., flickering monitor patterns, audio static) with modest edits. Present across beats but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The opal observatory is present in all three gates: setup (dome of iridescent stone, three feet of snow), middle (opal walls cast prismatic shadows), closure (snow piles higher). The setting pressures Mira's isolation and the opal's prismatic light literalizes her father's scattered code, charging the final image. However, the setting does not constrain a tactical choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it functions as thematic mirror rather than plot lever. Strong atmospheric integration but falls short of indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The timeframe is signaled in the opening line and recurs ("tonight," "tomorrow night, and the night after"). It establishes the ritual's regularity and implies Mira has been doing this for multiple sessions. However, the clock does not tighten decisions or tactics within this session—the static clearing and returning bracket the scene without forcing a choice or escalating pressure. The timeframe is present but largely ornamental; swapping "after static clears" for "at midnight" would not alter the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mira's desire to "fetch wisdom from failure" is dramatized through her nightly defragmentation ritual and her questions to the ghost. The motivation is present in all three gates: setup ("what wisdom could she fetch from the wreckage"), middle (the ghost's partial answer), and closure (the final question "Was it worth it?"). The friction between her want (understand the abandonment) and cost (slow, isolating ritual; her own liminal existence) is felt. The motivation drives beats and charges the ending, though the phrasing "fetch wisdom from failure" reads slightly abstract and prompt-aligned rather than earned from Mira's voice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Tone is coherent and modulates purposefully: the opening silence, the alchemical ritual language ("ephemeral patterns," "inky prophecies"), and the closing "midnight solace" sustain a contemplative, liminal atmosphere. The tone supports the theme of inhabiting the space between life and death. However, the tone remains largely static—it does not sharpen under pressure or shift as stakes tighten. The final line's "midnight solace" returns the opening mood without a felt tonal reconfiguration, functioning as thematic bracket rather than charged modulation. Present and coherent but does not elevate the closure image with tonal cost.</comment>
