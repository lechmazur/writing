<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's grief-to-action arc is legible and her light-painting ability provides concrete embodiment. Internal contradiction appears when she both "kept it secret" yet uses it as her defining method, weakening causal texture. The choice to paint again reads as rediscovery rather than a decision under competing pressures; her grandmother's voice ("pensive mirth") supplies the epiphany rather than scene-forged insight. Motivational clarity is present but the peak choice lacks visible cost that forecloses an alternative path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a mosaic pattern early (fog-memory-fragment-network) and pays it off through density increase and cadence shift. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira walks out with glowing fingertips and the commitment to "keep creating...each day," reweighting her prior grief-locked stance. Cost is felt but oblique—she must sustain effort daily rather than find joy as a "dropped coin." Orientation anchors arrive cleanly. One meaningful deepening (touching the fragment, seeing the past, painting on fog) satisfies escalation for this lens and length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Pale Orchard is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (moss, fog that "breathed," luminous fruit) and the fog itself becomes a tool—Mira paints on it, and it holds images like exposed film. The fresco fragment is handled twice (touch/warmth, then pocket pulse) and its warmth constrains her choice to continue. Micro-setting (body, fragment, fog-as-canvas) charges the final image when her fingertips glow. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the district walk and return.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: rediscovering joy. The fragment's warmth and the knowledge-network pulse provide one meaningful tightening that narrows Mira's tactical choice to paint with light again. Agency appears in the decision to raise her hands and paint, and the cost—daily creation rather than permanent recovery—is legible in the final paragraph. Escalation fits the Accumulative lens (density increase via fragment → network → painting → glowing hands). No false antagonist or coincidental resolution; pressure coheres through the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete action: joy as sustained creation rather than found object, encoded in the light-painting and the network of fragments. The exposed-film concept provides a non-literal vehicle that reweights the orchard's "ruin" as patient memory. Subtext operates in the grandmother's inherited gift and the choice to stop using it during grief. The final image (glowing fingertips, painting "in that strange space between memory and hope") resonates without stating a moral. Minor slip: "pensive mirth" is named rather than fully dramatized in gesture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited focalization with strong perceptual signature: Mira notices warmth, luminous fruit, pulse. Diction is controlled and lyric without register drift. Internal voice remains coherent under pressure. Filter verbs ("she realized," "she understood") appear but are voice-motivated and do not obscure immediacy. No dialogue on the page to evaluate. Psychic distance shifts intentionally from close interiority to wider reflection in the final paragraphs, supporting the Accumulative lens and charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the middle beats (fragment/network/painting). Minor paraphrase loop in paragraph 8–9: "The secret...they'd used light itself" echoes "she could paint with light" from the prior paragraph without added pressure (−0.2). Stock metaphor "knowledge network" recurs but is pattern-taught and pays off. Final image is vivid and propulsive. Clarity and concision are strong; no major scaffold or template cadence runs. Read-aloud ear is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of light-painting, fog-as-film, and intergenerational knowledge network offers a fresh angle on artist-grief narratives. The exposed-film concept is specific and non-obvious, and the orchard's patient waiting (not ruin) reframes familiar "lost place" tropes. Emotional arc (grief to daily creation) is grounded in concrete action rather than epiphany alone. Slight derivative echo: the artist-rediscovers-gift-in-magical-place frame is recognizable, but specificity (light medium, fresco fragments, fog canvas) transforms it sufficiently. No close echo of famous lines; bold risk in the fog-painting beat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and makes two key decisions: to touch the fragment (triggers vision) and to raise her hands and paint (peak choice). Both alter tactics and the final stance. She is signaled early and shapes the closure image (glowing fingertips). Swappability is low; removing her arc breaks the story. Cost is oblique (daily effort) but present. Setup, development, payoff all present; causal pressure moderate; closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The fresco fragment is handled in three distinct beats: found/touched (warmth), understood (message/network node), and carried against chest (pulse/heartbeat anchor). It enables the vision, feeds images during painting, and is physically present in the closure move. Introduced early, constrains middle choice (to paint), and charges the exit. Irreplaceable: no other object type would carry the ancient network. Visible cost: she carries it as ongoing commitment.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Exposed film appears explicitly ("like exposed film finally developed") and shapes the stake: the orchard "holds memories in fog, waiting for someone with the right light." The concept enables Mira's tactic (painting on fog) and reweights the orchard from ruin to latent potential. Setup is late (mid-story metaphor); no earlier cue. Development and payoff present. Causal pressure moderate; could be swapped with "darkroom" or "negative" with minor edits, reducing irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Paints with light" is established early as inherited gift, stopped during grief (cost: dimness), and resumed in the peak beat when she raises her hands. The trait constrains her choice (only she can activate the fog-canvas) and enables the display. Visible tradeoff: using it again means confronting grief. Present in three beats (backstory anchor, active painting, glowing fingertips at closure). Irreplaceable: removing it breaks the causal chain and closure image.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Display" occurs in the painting beat (paragraphs 10–11) and the fade/echo in the exit (paragraph 13). It drives the middle turn (Mira creates the murals) and shapes the closure consequence (glimpses remain). The action is signaled as goal early ("rediscover joy") and paid off when she paints "more vivid than anything she'd made in years." Could be replaced with "performance" or "projection" with moderate edits, capping irreplaceability. Setup, development, payoff all present; causal pressure solid.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The knowledge network is introduced early (paragraph 2), reappears when the fragment pulses (paragraph 6), and is explained as spanning time through objects (paragraph 7). It enables Mira's understanding (the network "fed her images") and shapes her tactic (she joins the network by painting). Mechanics matter: fragments as nodes. Present in or shaping the ending (other fragments reveal themselves). Setup, development, payoff all present. Swappability moderate (could be "archive" or "gallery"); causal pressure solid.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ruined orchard district with centuries-thick fog is established in the opening and pressures every beat: fog obscures, then holds images; the district supplies fragments, hollow trunks, archways as discovery points. Fog becomes the canvas (Mira paints on it) and the medium of closure (thinning fog, glowing hands). The setting constrains choices (what can be seen, where fragments hide) and charges the final image (fog releasing its hold). Setup, development, payoff all clear; irreplaceability high.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Within the fold of a daydream" appears once (paragraph 4) as a descriptor of the temporal shift when fog thickens/thins and Mira sees the past. Time feels "folded strangely" (paragraph 11) but is not tracked or used to tighten decisions. No live clock; no cost from time pressure. The phrase supplies atmosphere but does not constrain tactics or alter outcome. Setup present, development absent, payoff absent. Swappable with "vision" or "trance."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rediscovering lost joy is stated early (paragraph 1) and dramatized through grief (stopped painting), the fragment's warmth (rekindles memory), and the choice to paint again (paragraphs 10–11). The final paragraph articulates the cost: joy is "something she'd have to keep creating...each day," not a found object. Friction between desire and daily effort is present. The motivation drives all three acts and is reweighted at closure. Setup, development, payoff all present; causal pressure solid; cost legible.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Pensive mirth" is named once (paragraph 8: "laughter...tinged with something between sorrow and delight"). Tone modulates across the piece: grief (opening), wonder (vision), joy-in-effort (painting), quiet hope (exit). The laugh itself embodies the tone and charges the middle beat, but the label arrives as external description rather than sustained tonal texture. Coherent through turns; final image (glowing hands, "strange space between memory and hope") extends the tone. Setup, development, payoff present; closure linkage moderate.</comment>
