**Drive Lens: Accumulative/Textural.** Pressure builds through layered fragments, overheard stories, and a crystallizing encounter. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mira shifts from scattering regret to carrying it whole, culminating in a charged final image of the camera wheel lifted toward light.

<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and character-particular—"held them in her chest like small coins she might spend someday"—and the micro-choice to sit with whole regret is earned by prior accumulation. However, the peak-beat passage ("She was chronologically confused because she had scattered herself deliberately. Every misplaced memory was a refusal to stand in one moment and feel the full weight of regret") reads as diagnostic self-awareness that no one has mid-crisis, triggering the label-speak penalty. The ghost functions more as thematic instrument than as a pressuring second character with distinct interiority.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Orientation anchors land cleanly within the first paragraph. The accumulative structure—routine scavenging → camera wheel → triggered memory → ghost encounter → realization → acceptance—traces a legible arc with because/therefore linkages within the textural mode. Closure cost is on the page: "The regret arrived whole." The ghost's appearance is slightly convenient (she "looked up and saw herself"), and the revelation that she stopped the carousel is somewhat handed to her rather than earned through dramatic friction, but the lens holds and closure lands with legible cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The setting is genuinely distinctive: thermal currents carrying objects and voices upward, water falling into clouds, a carousel that once turned seasons. Physical details constrain action—the lagoon resists then relents as Mira wades toward the ghost. The camera wheel's serrated edges catching light in the final image charge closure. Sensory economy is strong (developer fluid, mist, dripping water), though the world's surreal physics are established more through assertion than dramatized discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (unresolved relationship with abandoned ambition) is signaled early and tightens through the ghost's redirection: "I'm not the one you need to negotiate with" narrows Mira's options by eliminating the externalized solution she'd planned. The shift from fragments to wholeness constitutes meaningful accumulative deepening. Cost is legible but arrives somewhat through insight rather than dramatic pressure—the "regret arrived whole" line is powerful but partially told. Agency is present in the final choice to sit with it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from world-logic: scattered time mirrors scattered regret, collecting fragments mirrors avoidance, wholeness requires acceptance. The final image (lifting the camera wheel toward light, imagining photographs) is a resonant non-literal answer. However, "wondered if this was how peace began—not by scattering the weight, but by finally agreeing to carry it" explicitly states the thesis in the penultimate section, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty (−0.5). "Everyone regrets something they didn't become" also trends toward direct statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited is stable with a distinctive perceptual signature: Mira notices fragments, small objects, whispered voices. "A memory struck her sideways, arriving from the wrong direction in time" is characteristic of this specific mind. Prose rhythm modulates appropriately—shorter sentences during the realization, expansive ones during routine. Dialogue is spare but functional; the ghost's directness contrasts with Mira's searching tone. No head-hopping or distance breaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Strong individual lines ("the hours scattered like startled birds," "the distant drip of water falling upward into clouds") carry high information density. The final sentence is clean and resonant. However, the fragmentation/wholeness metaphor is slightly overworked across the piece, and "She was chronologically confused because she had scattered herself deliberately" is expositional scaffolding that dulls the moment rather than dramatizing it. Some synonym proximity between "fragments," "scattered," "fractured" across adjacent paragraphs verges on conceptual redundancy without added pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cosmology—carousel-as-timekeeper, thermal-current stories, lagoon above clouds—genuinely transforms the familiar "confronting your younger self about abandoned dreams" template. The camera wheel as specific trigger is well-chosen and irreplaceable. The world's physics organically embody the psychological state without feeling allegorical. The emotional resolution (acceptance rather than transcendence) resists easy comfort. The ghost encounter itself, however, follows a recognizable template without fully subverting it.</comment>
