<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena's interior is concrete and embodied—scars traced by a child's fingers, the weight of fire heritage meeting water's stillness. Her choice to scatter the black sand and press the coin to her lips reads as earned endurance with visible cost (carrying her father's legacy without becoming it). Minor weakness: the final paragraph's "scars had sung their strange and necessary song" edges toward summary of what was already dramatized. Contradictory impulses (love of fire vs. healing instinct) act simultaneously in the lagoon scene, satisfying the 9+ threshold for characterization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elena accepts she is "not her father's fire but her own element entire," forecloses the path of self-doubt, and the cost is legible in the three-year journey and the ritual relinquishment of the black sand. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density increases through layered images (coin, sand, clouds, scars) that converge at the lagoon to reweight her relationship to her father's destruction. Orientation anchors cleanly by the second paragraph (Elena, dunes, migration of clouds, autumn). One minor slack: the phrase "heritage was not destiny" slightly over-articulates theme, but the surrounding images carry the weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon functions as micro-setting that charges the closure: its "darkness was not absence but depth" directly reframes Elena's scars and enables the ritual scattering. Black sand, coin, red thread, and the body's burn scars all constrain and enable her final act. Sensory details are selective and POV-filtered: "lacquered" stillness, sand "like crushed obsidian," clouds as "aerial whales." The migration of clouds provides atmospheric pressure but does not materially constrain a choice on the page, keeping this just under the 8.5 threshold.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: Elena seeks peace with her father's fire legacy. The descent through dunes during cloud migration provides external tightening; the lagoon ritual—coin lowered, sand scattered—narrows options by transforming inherited destruction into chosen preservation. Her agency is renunciation and endurance (she will not become her father), and the cost is visible: three years carried the sand, seventeen rescues borne on scarred shoulders. One tightening deepens into closure without multiple reversals, fitting the Accumulative lens. Meets the 8.0+ standard for foreclosing a path with trade-off; falls just short of 8.8+ because the price, while felt, is more retrospective than immediate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete images—grafting metaphor, scars as rivers, black sand joining sediment—without thesis statement until the final beat. "Heritage was not destiny" is the sole moment of slight over-articulation, but it's embedded in action (kneeling, pouring sand). The lagoon's darkness as depth, the coin as vein, and the clouds' indifference all answer the central question: destruction and creation share heat but can aim differently. Final image (coin warm, black water memory, scars' song) reweights prior material with non-literal resonance. Strong enough for high 8s; the single thematic echo in the middle section prevents 9+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, perceptual signature consistent: Elena notices pressure shifts, fire's whisper, the way texture and light map her world. Diction stays character-particular ("breathing time," "grafted something else onto it"). No head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—intimate at the lagoon, wider for backstory anchoring. Minor slip: "she had finally learned to listen" in the closing line slightly over-explains what the prior image already conveyed. Meets 9+ threshold for perceptual signature and rhythmic control; the single summary phrase in the final beat caps at 8.5.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence. Information density high: most sentences layer character, image, and theme. Opening anchors voice and stakes; closing image ("coin warm against her chest and the memory of black water steady in her heart") recharges earlier motifs. Two minor artifacts lower from 8.5+: "she had inherited that love without the madness—or perhaps she had grafted something else onto it" uses em-dash hedge that slightly dulls momentum, and "Peace did not arrive as triumph. It came the way kelp drifted" is a micro-paraphrase loop. Both are brief and non-closure, capping deduction at −0.3 total.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The arsonist's-daughter-turned-firefighter premise is familiar but transformed through specificity: volcanic black sand, drilled foreign coin, cloud migration as ritual window, the grafting metaphor extending from rootstock to skin to legacy. Emotional truth (scars as rivers, not badges) avoids generic redemption templates. The lagoon as judgment-free depth is a strong image. Freshness is present but not radical; the fire/water opposition and heritage-vs.-choice arc are well-executed genre conventions rather than bold inversions. Solid high-7 work; would need a more surprising turn or deeper moral calculus for 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena's dual identity (arsonist's daughter, firefighter) drives the dominant stake and frames every choice at the lagoon. Her decision to scatter the sand and accept herself as "her own element entire" is the closure act. Present in setup (paragraph 2), developed through backstory of seventeen rescues and scars, and active in the ending ritual. The character is indispensable: swap her for a generic "haunted rescuer" and the fire/grafting/heritage logic collapses. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; falls short of 8.5+ only because the character's choices are more endurance than sharp decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Black sand appears in three beats: carried in pouch against heart (setup), poured into her palm at lagoon (middle), scattered across water to join sediment (closure). Its volcanic origin ties to fire heritage; scattering it is the ritual act of release. Charged reprise with evolving use. Could score higher if the sand constrained an earlier choice or imposed visible cost beyond symbolic weight; as written, it enables the closure gesture but does not narrow options mid-story.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Unyielding compassion" is named on the page ("the unyielding compassion that would not let her rest while someone needed reaching") and shown through seventeen rescues and bearing falling beams. It motivates her choice to become a firefighter rather than follow her father's destructive path. Present in setup (firefighter identity), developed (rescue examples), and implicit in closure (she walks ready for the next fire). Scores mid-6 because it operates more as characterization than as a pivot that alters tactics; removing the phrase would not break the story's logic, though it enriches theme.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Gracefully alert" is labeled in paragraph 2 ("practiced stillness, gracefully alert in the way firefighters learned to be") and tied to sensing pressure shifts. It colors her descent through dunes but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. The trait is present and consistent but swappable with "vigilant" or "attuned" without structural impact. Functional but replaceable, landing in mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The grafting metaphor anchors the story's logic: "heritage was not destiny. You could take the wild rootstock of your past and graft onto it whatever fruit you chose to bear." It's introduced early, returned in the scars-as-maps moment ("skin grafts that had healed into ridged maps"), and implicit in the closure (Elena as her own element). Two beats with thematic charge. The action is conceptual rather than physical, which limits irreplaceability slightly—yet remove it and the fire/transformation arc loses coherence. Strong integration, shy of 8.5+ because the grafting itself is metaphor rather than a plot-driving deed.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The coin is present in all three gates: introduced mid-story (grandmother's gift at graduation), used in the lagoon ritual (lowered into water by red thread), and pressed to lips before scattering sand. The red thread as "vein carrying life into stillness" charges the image. Two distinct beats (lowering, pressing). Scores mid-6 because it arrives after the 40% mark (past the dunes descent) and could be replaced with another ritual object (shell, stone) without breaking the closure. The thread's color and foreign origin add specificity but do not impose mechanical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon is the spatial anchor for the entire closure sequence. Its stillness, black water, and volcanic stone enable Elena's ritual; its darkness-as-depth metaphor reframes her scars and legacy. Present in title-level prominence, developed through "dark mirror," "lacquered" surface, and "no judgment" depth, and active in closure (sand scattered into sediment, coin returned). The setting constrains by offering the necessary symbolic/physical space for transformation. Indispensable: remove the lagoon and the story's central image collapses. Strong integration across all gates with causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The migration of clouds provides atmospheric texture ("three-day window in autumn," "breathing time") and frames Elena's journey timing. It's present in setup and mentioned at closure ("clouds continued their ancient migration"). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; Elena could perform the ritual under any sky without structural loss. The clouds enrich tone but remain ornamental. Mid-5 for lyric resonance without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To prove that scars can sing" is stated directly mid-story ("This was what Elena had come to prove") and dramatized through the child tracing scars ("They look like rivers") and the final line ("Her scars had sung their strange and necessary song"). The motivation drives her three-year journey and the lagoon ritual. Present across beats with emotional cost (carrying doubt, needing proof). Scores mid-7 because the proof is more self-addressed than tested by external friction; a stronger obstacle or conflicting desire would elevate to 8+. Still, the desire is legible and shapes closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Kelp-drift peace" is named explicitly ("Peace did not arrive as triumph. It came the way kelp drifted—slowly, gently, without announcement") and woven through imagery: lagoon stillness, clouds drifting "like kelp on an invisible current," gradual acceptance. Tone modulates from urgency (descent, fire heritage) to meditative calm at closure. The kelp image charges the final paragraph's serenity. Coherent and purposeful, with clear cadence shift. Scores low-7 because the phrase itself is slightly precious and the kelp metaphor, while apt, is introduced late (final third) rather than taught early; earlier seeding would strengthen integration to 8+.</comment>
