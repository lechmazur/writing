<comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and character-particular—her hands glowing phosphorescent, her fifteen years of diligent copying—but her central choice (to broadcast tonight) lacks visible cost or contradiction in the present frame. The piece establishes her risk awareness ("She knew what she risked") yet no on-page action forecloses a path or tests competing impulses. The final act of singing is prepared by backstory but not dramatized as a difficult present choice with embodied hesitation or trade-off. Internal conflict remains summary-level rather than acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: lyric accretion of images (embers, mist, glowing hands, dust) building toward the broadcast. Orientation anchors who/where/when by ~120 words (waive penalty). Closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of dust learning to speak reweights prior material, but the cost remains conceptual and asserted rather than dramatically legible on the page. The broadcast itself is not a turn—it was always the plan—so no meaningful tightening occurs. Cost proof test fails: no exact sentence shows a price paid or option foreclosed at the ending beat.</comment>

<comment>The ember alcove is vivid and purposeful: banked coals keep mist at bay and ink from freezing, establishing both atmosphere and practical constraint. The shortwave radio, phosphorescent ink, and mist all return with reweighted sensory detail. The alcove does not constrain a choice at closure—Maren's broadcast proceeds as planned—so the micro-setting functions as charged backdrop rather than pressure point. Sensory hierarchy (orange glow, grey mist, green fingers) is POV-filtered and consistent, supporting tone without forcing symbolic weight.</comment>

<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: ending the story famine by smuggling narratives via broadcast. No on-page reversal or tightening occurs; Maren executes her established plan without complication, coincidence, or cost. The regime's threat is backdrop only—patrols never appear, no listener is dramatized, and no tactical adjustment happens. The final act of singing does not narrow options or force a trade-off; it fulfills intent without visible price. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through pattern or cadence shift; here the texture remains static from midpoint to close.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: stories as survival, dust as collective forgetting, small voices answering silence. The final image—"dust, in its patient way, was finally learning to speak"—reweights prior material (library pyres, ash, grey matter) without stating a moral. The phrase "teaching dust to tell stories" recurs with purpose, and the fisher-girl/tide-king tale encodes transformation and possibility. Minor slip: "simple stories were the most dangerous" edges toward thematic summary, but the context (grandmothers, bedtime) roots it in lived detail. No Thematic Echo penalty applies; the conceptual cost (risk to Maren, collective hunger) is implicit but undramatized.</comment>

<comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Maren; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices embers, phosphorescence, the mist's breathing presence. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("thistled calm," "something liquid and living"), with purposeful compression in lyric passages. Minor register elevation ("elusive song lyrics woven into the melodies") fits the narrator's educated idiom. Psychic distance is intimate without filter-verb stacks. The piece sustains a distinct textural rhythm, modulating from expository reflection to present-tense broadcast without confusion.</comment>

<comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings avoid template cadence. Information density is high in the opening third, establishing world rules through image rather than exposition. Loop check flags minor paraphrase: "She had known other broadcasters. She had attended their quiet funerals" restates risk without added pressure (−0.2). Figurative language is purposeful but occasionally stacks: "pooling across her desk like something liquid and living" followed by "the mist pressed…like a curious beast" within close proximity risks ornamental accumulation. Clarity remains high; no causality obscured. Propulsion slows mid-piece as backstory density exceeds the BRR 30% guideline without always tilting present stance.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Core synthesis—music as smuggling vessel, phosphorescent ink encoding hidden text—is specific and non-obvious. The ember alcove, shortwave broadcast, and coded melodies cohere as a singular world logic. Transformation test: the emotional arc (risk, persistence) could transfer to other resistance narratives, but the particular mechanics (lichen ink, intervals between notes, tide-king tale fragments) anchor freshness. Proximity check passes; no close echoes of famous lines. Minor penalty: the regime-burns-books premise is widely used; the story transforms it through the copyist's prior legitimacy and the dual-layer broadcast method, restoring mid-band range. Risk-taking (lyric accumulation, quiet ending) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity (+0.2 within band).</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Maren's diligence is seeded early ("had always been diligent") and her fifteen-year copying career establishes skill. Her choice to broadcast is prepared by backstory but not dramatized as a difficult present decision with visible cost. The character drives the premise but does not make a key turn on the page—she executes her established plan. Setup present, development indirect (her method is explained), closure participation passive (she sings as intended). Two-gate integration: early signal +0.5, one beat (the broadcast) +0.4, but no causal pressure narrowing options. Swappable with "resistance archivist" or similar role (−0.5). Score: 5.8.</comment>

<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>The radio dial glow appears in two beats: illuminating her workspace and intensifying as she finds the frequency. It returns with reweighted sensory detail ("amber light pooling") and charges the final third's atmosphere. Setup early, development (she adjusts the dial), closure participation (the broadcast travels through the static). Three-gate integration: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage (the melody travels through the radio) +0.7. Specificity moderate—"shortwave" and "dial glow" are concrete but the object does not constrain a choice or impose cost. Score: 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The pirate broadcast is the dominant stake, shaping Maren's tactics (every third night, coded lyrics) and the ending action (she begins to sing). Setup early ("Every third night…she became a voice in the silence"), development (method explained, frequency found), closure participation (the melody carries its cargo into unseen homes). Three-gate integration: early signal +0.8, two beats (preparation, broadcast) +0.9, causal pressure (the broadcast is the mission) +1.0, closure linkage (she sings, listeners decode) +1.2. Cost connection: risk acknowledged but not dramatized (−0.3). Score: 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>4.2</grade>
<comment>Secretly luminous hands are described vividly (phosphorescent ink stains, faintly green glow) but constrain no on-page action. The attribute is kept gloved during daylight and revealed in the alcove, yet this does not alter a choice or impose cost—it functions as atmospheric detail. Setup present (mid-story), no development beat, no closure participation. One-gate integration: late first appearance (−0.4), ornamental use (description without action pressure) (−0.7). The trait could be removed without affecting causality. Score: 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>"Cloak" as action is realized through "cloak stories in music" and the encoded melodies. Setup early ("She had only begun to cloak stories in music"), development (the method is explained: lyrics woven into melodies, intervals encoding names), closure participation (tonight's broadcast carries the final movement). Three-gate integration: early signal +0.6, two beats (method explanation, broadcast execution) +0.9, causal pressure (the cloaking enables the mission) +0.8, closure linkage +0.9. Swappability test: "encode" or "hide" could replace "cloak" with minor edits (−0.5). Score: 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The method—song lyrics woven into melodies—is signaled early and its mechanics detailed: phrases tucked into arrangements, words hidden in bass lines, names encoded in intervals. Setup present, development (mechanics explained), closure participation (the melody carries its coded cargo). Three-gate integration: early signal +0.5, two beats (explanation, broadcast) +0.9, causal pressure (the method is how she smuggles stories) +0.9. The method shapes attempts but is not tested or complicated—it succeeds as planned. Cost connection absent (−0.4). Score: 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>The ember alcove is established early with purposeful detail: carved into hillside, banked coals keep mist at bay and ink from freezing. Setup present, development (it provides warmth and concealment for her work), closure participation (the mist and embers frame the broadcast moment). Three-gate integration: early signal +0.6, two beats (workspace, broadcast frame) +0.9, micro-setting (body/tool/object level) constrains work conditions +0.4. The alcove does not pressure a choice at closure—it is backdrop rather than obstacle. Score: 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>5.3</grade>
<comment>"After the story famine" is seeded in the opening line and provides historical context (books burned, scripts purged, fifteen years of purges). Setup early, development (the famine motivates her mission and explains the regime's silence), no closure participation—time does not tighten the broadcast decision. Two-gate integration: early signal +0.6, one beat (the famine as cause) +0.4. The timeframe is backdrop rather than live clock; it does not alter tactics or escalate pressure at the ending. Swappable with "after the censorship" or similar (−0.6). Score: 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>The motivation—"to teach dust to tell stories"—is dramatized through Maren's actions (copying, encoding, broadcasting) and internalized as a phrase that "came to her one evening." Setup present (mid-story crystallization), development (the broadcast is its enactment), closure participation (dust learning to speak in the final line). Three-gate integration: early internalization +0.4, two beats (reflection, broadcast) +0.9, causal pressure (the desire drives the mission) +0.8, closure linkage (the final image echoes the phrase) +0.9. Friction: the want is not conflicted on the page—no cost or fear complicates the choice (−0.4). Score: 6.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.0</grade>
<comment>"Thistled calm" appears once explicitly ("The thistled calm of the night wrapped around her") and is sustained through the piece's texture: stubborn warmth against grey, patience edged with thorns, mist pressing like a curious beast. Setup mid-story, development (tone pervades the alcove scene and broadcast preparation), closure participation (the mist holds its breath, dust speaks patiently). Three-gate integration: signal mid-story (−0.2), tone coheres through turns and modulates with the broadcast's quiet intensity +1.2, charges the final image +0.9. The tone is not static—it shifts from reflective to enactive—and the oxymoron ("calm" with "thorns") is purposefully sustained. Score: 7.0.</comment>
