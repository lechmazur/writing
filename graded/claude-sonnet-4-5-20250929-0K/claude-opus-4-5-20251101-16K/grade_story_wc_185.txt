<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vela's motivation is coherent and embodied through her mapkeeping practice; her choices (seeking the Deep Resonance, placing the stone, singing) drive the narrative forward with clear intent. The energy beings remain abstract presences without interiority, which fits the premise but limits relational crucible. Her grandmother's teaching and the concept of "hammered repose" provide character-particular depth. Minor slip: the final micro-choice (pulling out charting tools) reads as summary rather than a decision under pressure that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accumulates through sensory layers (sound, ice fracture patterns, light) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where the bloom of hush reweights the cave's state and Vela's future task. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. Cost is visible: the bloom requires continual tending ("tomorrow she would conjure another bloom"), and the quiet is explicitly temporary, foreclosing any permanent resolution. The accumulative design lands cleanly with undeniable pressure in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The harmonic caves function as constraint and resource: sound pooling, echo nesting, thermal fluctuations from the beings' energy, and ice formation all shape Vela's tactical choices. The echo chamber stone and ice fracture patterns anchor micro-setting that charges the closure. Sensory detail (screaming frequencies, breath clouding, gently luminous stone) is filtered through Vela's professional lens as mapkeeper. The environment drives the placement choice and the final image of new ripple marks on water, directly charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (creating pockets of peace for both refugees and caves) is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when Vela reads the chaotic ice patterns and commits to the stone placement, narrowing her options under the Accumulative lens. The cost is legible: the bloom is temporary, requires repositioning as beings move, and commits her to ongoing labor ("tomorrow she would conjure another bloom"). Minor gap: the energy beings' response (light steadying, one drifting closer) feels more like acknowledgment than a pressure test that deepens the stake.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: "hammered repose," bloom of hush, crack patterns as sound architecture, and the closing insight "learning to storm together" all arise from Vela's enacted process rather than declaration. The final image (recording new ripple marks) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of coexistence without stating a moral. The echo chamber stone's transformation (absorbing, holding, releasing voice) functions as earned metaphor. "The quiet in the storm was not the absence of storm" operates at the line between insight and abstraction but stays rooted in the preceding action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Voice is controlled and distinct: Vela's perceptual signature filters the world through mapkeeping idiom (ripple marks, nodes of cancellation, architecture of sound). POV remains stable; psychic distance is consistent. Diction stays within her professional-contemplative register ("frequencies that had once been gentle," "waves might meet and nullify"). Brief direct address to the beings ("I need to conjure something") reads natural given their inability to understand words. Minor note: "gently luminous" recurs as a descriptor for both beings and the awakened stone, creating slight lexical echo without functional consequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is clean with strong momentum and purposeful rhythm variation. Information density is high: most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or world logic. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Figurative language (living auroras, petals unfurling, bloom of hush) is coherent and sustained without muddle. Minor textural slip: "That silence had died three moons ago when the energy beings descended, their forms gently luminous, their presence a storm that never ceased" stacks three parallel clauses in a way that slightly slows the beat without clear payoff. Otherwise, line-level craft is exemplary.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of mapkeeping-as-peacemaking, acoustic cartography through ice fracture patterns, and the bloom-of-hush concept feels specific and non-obvious. The transformation of echo chamber stone from diagnostic tool to active mediator is earned. Risk-taking in the quiet, lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Partial limitation: the energy-beings-as-refugees frame and the "learning to coexist" thematic territory are familiar in speculative fiction; the story transforms this through Vela's particular craft and the sensory architecture, but does not fully escape the template's gravitational pull.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vela's choices (seeking the Deep Resonance, reading ice patterns, placing the stone, singing specific tones, beginning to record) create the story's key turns. Her mapkeeping expertise constrains and enables the solution. She is present in all major beats and drives the closure image. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The echo chamber stone appears in setup (carried in satchel with backstory), development (becomes gently luminous, is placed at fracture intersection), and payoff (absorbs and transforms Vela's voice to create the bloom). Its specific property (capture and contain sound) enables the tactical solution. Two distinct on-page uses with reweighted function (from testing tool to active mediator). High integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The bloom of hush shapes stakes (creating peace within noise), tactics (singing specific tones, precise stone placement), and the ending ("bloom would need tending"). The concept is enacted on the page through concrete process rather than merely echoed as theme. Its temporary nature and need for ongoing work provide visible cost and constrain future options. Indispensable to the story's logic and closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Gently luminous" describes both the energy beings (setup, multiple mentions) and the echo chamber stone when awakened (middle beat: "now gently luminous in her hands"). The trait signals the beings' energy and later marks the stone's activation, enabling Vela's recognition that the surrounding energy has charged it. Present across beats but the specific property does not constrain a choice with visible cost; it functions more as atmospheric marker than tactical limiter.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>To conjure is the action Vela announces ("I need to conjure something") and executes (placing stone, singing to create the bloom). The verb recurs at closure ("tomorrow she would conjure another bloom"), framing the resolution and future stakes. Major turns trace to this action: the bloom's expansion softens the screaming harmonics, the beings' light steadies, and Vela commits to extending the architecture of peace. Removing "conjure" would require fundamental rewrites; it defines her agency and the story's central act.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Examining crack patterns in ice is signaled in setup (grandmother's teaching, method passed down), enacted in the middle beat at the Deep Resonance (tracing fracture lines to find nodes of cancellation), and shapes the tactical choice (placing stone at intersection of three fracture lines). The method's mechanics matter: reading ice as sound architecture enables the solution. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The harmonic caves pressure choices throughout: sound pooling and echo nesting inform Vela's maps; the beings' presence creates thermal fluctuations and ice formation; the Deep Resonance provides the basin and fracture patterns that guide stone placement. The caves amplify frequencies (a constraint) and reflect the gentled harmony back (enabling the bloom's spread). The setting is indispensable to both problem and solution, with the ending image of new ripple marks charging closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The timeframe (after the energy beings arrive, specifically "three moons ago") anchors the problem and Vela's motivation. The temporal marker creates urgency (the silence "died," the caves now "scream") and the ending explicitly references ongoing time pressure ("tomorrow she would conjure another bloom"). Present in setup and closure, shaping the stakes, though the on-page action unfolds in a single continuous window without a ticking clock that alters immediate tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>To find the quiet in the storm drives all of Vela's choices: seeking the Deep Resonance, reading ice patterns, placing the stone, singing specific tones. The motivation is dramatized through action rather than merely told. Friction between want (create peace) and cost (the bloom is temporary, requires continual tending, commits her to ongoing labor) is legible on the page. The closing line ("learning to storm together") reframes the motivation with earned complexity.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Hammered repose is named explicitly near the end ("that was what her grandmother had called this state. Peace beaten into shape through patient work") and tonally present throughout: the measured, contemplative voice; the painstaking process of reading, placing, singing; the acceptance of imperfection ("it would not last forever"). Tone modulates subtly from the opening urgency (caves "screamed") to the ending's measured acceptance. Coherent and purposeful, charging the final image with the concept of peace as ongoing labor rather than achieved state.</comment>
