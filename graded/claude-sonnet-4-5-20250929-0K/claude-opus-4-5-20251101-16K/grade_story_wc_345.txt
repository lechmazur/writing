<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and her arc from observer to community leader is coherent, but interiority remains thin—most emotional moments are told through summary ("panic spread") rather than embodied contradiction. The ghost is a functional catalyst but lacks internal conflict; her choices feel predetermined by role rather than weighted by competing impulses. The bell discovery and final ringing provide action-based choices, yet the resolution feels ordained rather than earned through visible struggle with foreclosed paths.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal with some Accumulative scaffolding (recurring messages, bell ritual). Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly by the opening paragraph. The closure unit—Mira's decision to ring the bell and unite the community, followed by the ghost's release—lands on the page with visible action (fleet departure, ghost fading). However, the cost is gestural: we see evacuation but not what specific relationships, holdings, or individual dreams are sacrificed. The bell's unearthing shifts knowledge and triggers the communal pivot, satisfying minimal causal escalation, but the emotional or opportunity cost remains abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating arches, amber skies, and orchard terraces create a vivid macro-setting that constrains the final choice (crumbling arches force departure). The bell—buried beneath the oldest apple tree—functions as micro-setting that charges the closure image (Mira rings it to summon community, then again at farewell). Spatial choreography is clean across marketplace, rooftop, and grove. Sensory selection favors visual sweep over tactical texture; under peak pressure (discovery, final shuttle loading) description remains painterly rather than urgent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake (survival vs. abandonment of home) is signaled early and tightens when Mira sees the cracked arch. One meaningful deepening: the ghost's message reframes flight from individual escape to collective exodus. Agency is present but diffused—Mira digs, rings the bell, shows charts—yet the community's fracture and reunion happen largely off-page ("The work began that night"). Cost is visible in the planet's destruction but individual trade-offs (which families hesitated, what personal losses) are omitted, leaving escalation clean but not charged.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of tended hope and collective survival emerges organically from the ghost's messages and the bell as召唤 symbol. The final image of butterflies in the nebula offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. However, lines like "Brambled hope was still hope" and "she was preparing us for this moment" edge toward stating the thesis. The botanist's note ("I stayed to help you grow") makes subtext overt. The piece invites reflection on sacrifice and community but occasionally explains rather than trusts the dramatized particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV through Mira is stable; no head-hopping. Narrative distance modulates appropriately (close during the bell discovery, wider during the fleet's departure). Diction is clean and consistent, though occasional phrases ("the bones of forgotten giants," "foreign constellations") tilt literary-decorative without voice-specific texture. The ghost's chalk messages and final note are mechanically clear. Perceptual signature is present but generic—Mira notices what the plot requires rather than what a particular personality would filter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean and rhythmically varied; no major loops or scaffolding. Opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively. Some stock constructions appear under pressure: "panic spread through the settlement like fire through dry brush" is serviceable but unoriginal; "She told them... She showed them... She asked them" repeats a syntactic stem at a key beat. Figurative language is competent ("woman-shaped shimmer," "amber sky") but not inventive. Information density is adequate; lines advance story without padding, though peak moments (the bell ringing, the ghost's farewell) could carry more sensory or tactical immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ghost-as-botanist and butterfly bell offer a fresh synthesis on the benevolent-spirit trope, grounding altruism in horticultural care. The "Nebula of Respite" as myth-made-real and the orchard planet with floating arches provide specific world detail. However, the emotional arc (fractured community reunites under trustworthy guide) and the chalk-message mechanic follow familiar beats. The transformation test is borderline: swap the orchard for another agrarian setting and the arc holds. Risk-taking is moderate—unconventional perspective (altruistic ghost's orchestration) heightens stakes but does not fundamentally challenge reader expectations.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The altruistic ghost is present early (opening framing) and her messages drive two key beats: the twelve-cycles warning and the bell burial directive. She shapes the ending by releasing Mira (visible farewell) and her orchestration frames the entire evacuation. However, her choices are recounted rather than shown in scene—we never see her decide to bury the bell or compose a particular message under pressure. Causal role is strong but execution is summary-heavy, capping the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The butterfly garden watering bell appears in two distinct beats: unearthed discovery and final ringing at farewell. It carries specific properties (brass, green with age, summoning function) that tie to the botanist's identity and the story's metaphor. Early signal is present (setup in discovery beat). The bell enables the communal turn (Mira rings it to silence arguments) and charges the closure image (rang "one last time" to release the ghost, butterflies glimpsed in nebula). Swappability test: another召唤 object could serve, but the butterfly link is purposeful. Closure linkage is strong; middle development is lighter.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The nebula of respite is introduced as myth in the urgent chalk message, functions as the escape destination throughout the middle (chart research, trajectory calculations), and appears in the ending as the fleet's glowing target. It redefines the stake from "flee individually" to "reach shelter together," altering tactics on the page. The concept is irreplaceable—swapping for another destination would break the mythic-hope layer. Cost linkage: leaving Veridian-7 is the price of reaching the nebula. Specificity is adequate; the nebula's properties (stable space, healing) are dramatized through navigation rather than exposition.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Strangely trustworthy" is labeled early ("strangely trustworthy in ways the living rarely managed") and demonstrated through the ghost's unfailing warnings. It enables on-page action: Mira believes the twelve-cycles message despite its enormity because the ghost has never lied. The trait constrains skepticism and accelerates the communal pivot. However, the attribute is told more than tested—no beat shows a character doubting the ghost's advice and facing consequence. Cost is implied (trust without verification) but not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Reexamine" appears verbatim in the chalk message and drives the major turn: Mira digs beneath the tree, finds the bell and note, and revisits the ship's archives to locate the old star charts. The action is causally central—without reexamination, the nebula remains myth and the community fractures. It redefines options from "flee or stay" to "flee together to a real destination." Early signal (urgent message), middle development (chart work), and closure participation (fleet navigates using discovered charts) satisfy all three gates. Specificity is adequate; "reexamine" is not deeply unique but the beats it enables are essential.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The method (chalked messages on deserted sidewalks at dawn) is signaled in the opening and recurs across multiple beats: irrigation/frost warnings, the twelve-cycles alarm, the bell burial directive. It shapes the ghost's identity (disembodied care, nocturnal labor) and the community's daily rhythm. However, mechanics are ornamental—chalk could be replaced by carved signs or voice whispers without structural cost. The method does not constrain the ghost's capabilities or force a trade-off. Closure participation is indirect (messages guide repairs) but the final image centers the bell, not the chalk.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The orchard planet with floating rock arches is established in the opening line and pressures the climax: Mira sees a cracked arch, proving the ghost's warning, and the arches' failure forces evacuation timing. The orchards anchor the community's investment (what they've "bled to cultivate") and the loss at departure. Setting enables the ghost's role (botanist tending groves) and the bell's召唤 function. Micro-setting (oldest apple tree) supplies the discovery beat. Closure participation is strong (fleet threads between failing arches). Swappability test: another agrarian colony with a different hazard could work, lowering irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The timeframe ("after strangers become family") is signaled early and frames emotional stakes—these are not random refugees but a formed community. It informs the ghost's long presence ("since the early desperate years") and the grief at leaving. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions on the page. The twelve-cycle countdown is the live clock; the "strangers-to-family" arc is backstory. Middle beats do not show time altering tactics. Closure participation is thematic (unity enables escape) but not tactical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The ghost's motivation (to orchestrate collective effort) is demonstrated through the progression of messages: daily care, then survival warning, then unity call. It drives the middle beats (bell burial to prove intent, chart guidance to enable coordination) and is articulated in Mira's speech ("she was preparing us for this moment"). Closure participation: the successful fleet departure proves orchestration succeeded. However, the motivation is told in summary ("Every message... was preparing us") rather than shown through the ghost's conflicted choices. Cost is implied (her prolonged unrest) but not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tone of "brambled hope" is coherent from the opening (floating arches like bones, practical care in harsh conditions) through the middle (fractured community, cracked arches) to the ending (nebula as "not a paradise, but a chance"). The tone modulates with pressure: urgent during the panic, tender at the ghost's farewell, bittersweet as Veridian-7 crumbles. The final line ("somewhere in that light, Mira swore she saw butterflies") charges the image with earned fragility. The explicit phrase "Brambled hope was still hope" is on-the-nose, slightly deflating the tonal work, but overall the thorny-optimism register holds without collapse into sentimentality or cynicism.</comment>
