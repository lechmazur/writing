<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira's internal contradiction between obligation and freedom is embodied concretely through her dock work and the scrimshaw's pull. Her choices—listening to confessions, accepting weight, finally surrendering—show a hierarchy of values with visible cost. The transformation feels earned by seven years of carrying others' pain. Therapy-adjacent phrasing ("something wounded seeking shelter," "fighting themselves") in reflective passages slightly weakens interiority under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The closure lands cleanly: Mira's detachment sequence and wade into the sublittoral constitutes a Decisive Change with visible cost (dock community, human posture). The accumulative lens holds—density increases as whale call, island shimmer, and transformation converge. Orientation anchors promptly (docks, seven years, scrimshaw). One meaningful deepening (obligation-cage realization) tightens to the swim toward peace. Cost is on-page: she leaves behind workers who needed her, carrying their confessions into the deep.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe functions as both literal threshold and conceptual space where Mira waits nightly, pressuring her choice through its "neither fully land nor sea" nature. Sensory detail is selective (kelp, anemones, murky water, brine). The scrimshaw constrains choice by pulsing warm and glowing at the whale's call. Dock choreography remains clear. However, the disappearing island itself offers postcard shimmer more than tactical constraint—it appears when she's ready rather than forcing navigation or cost during approach.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (freedom vs. obligation) is signaled early and tightens through one decisive turn: recognizing obligation as cage. The combative/tender internal split creates authentic friction. Agency is renunciation with visible cost: she leaves the workers, sheds human armor, forecloses return. The whale's call and scrimshaw glow provide the tightening that narrows options to one path. No reversals needed under the accumulative lens; the deepening from exhaustion to surrender reweights the stake and charges the swim with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—ceasing self-combat to find peace—emerges through Mira's carrying confessions, the scrimshaw map-to-self, and the island where "violence becomes impossible because everyone had finally stopped fighting themselves." The final image (silhouette dancing toward something real, workers feeling lighter) offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Minor slip: "unlocked their hearts... unlocked her own" in the closing beat edges toward summary statement rather than pure image, and "combated their grief" feels like a reach for prompt-term echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited to Mira; perceptual signature (grace, fluid precision, fierce gentle attention) is distinct and consistent. Diction modulates appropriately under rising pressure. No head-hopping. The prose carries a mythic-realist texture that fits the premise. Brief convergence toward elevated register ("sublittoral fringe," "disappeared yourself") reads intentional given the transformative frame. Filter verbs ("felt," "understood") appear but serve the reflective mode without dulling immediacy at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift; information density is high. Clarity remains intact through the transformation sequence. Minor loop: "combative" / "tender" / "fighting" recur as conceptual anchors but risk synonym churn (combative noise, combative part, combated grief). "After the wars... after the blood" and "strange... strange" show light paraphrase. Figurative language is controlled except one mixed vehicle: scrimshaw "pulsing warm like a second heartbeat" then "glowing"—heat and light conflated without clear logic. No scaffold or major template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—non-human dock worker guided by scrimshaw to a peace-island—synthesizes mythic and working-class specificity in a fresh way. The transformation through detachment (apron, boots, posture as armor) is concrete and earned. Risk: the lyric-realist hybrid heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. However, the "violence becomes impossible" formulation and "unlocking hearts" lean toward abstraction and echo writing-prompt templates. The pirate Vessels backstory and seven-year docks tenure provide grounding, but the island's mechanics remain more metaphor than world-logic, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mira's choices create the story's key turn: she decides to wade in, detach human layers, and swim toward the island. Her grace on the docks, listening without judgment, and nightly vigil at the fringe all constrain her situation and enable the final act. Present in setup (dock work), development (accepts confessions, waits nightly), and payoff (transformation swim). Causal pressure is clear; the element is indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The scrimshaw appears in three beats: Vessels' deathbed gift, Mira's nightly waiting with it, and the glow/pulse when the whale calls. It depicts the unmapped island, pulses warm as second heartbeat, and vibrates to unlock the island's appearance—irreplaceable mechanics. Shapes two beats (gift/waiting, whale call) and charges closure by being pressed to her lips before the wade. Visible cost: carrying the map meant seven years of exile waiting. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The disappearing island frames the dominant stake (freedom) and appears on-page at closure, shimmering into existence and then vanishing with Mira. Signaled early through scrimshaw carving. However, it functions more as destination than constraint—it "waits for someone willing to see it" rather than imposing tactical difficulty. The island's mechanics (appears when ready, violence impossible there) are told more than tested. Lyric reprise with some causal weight, but swappable with another refuge.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The attribute is demonstrated on-page: Henrik weeps and confesses, Suti shows scars, workers confide despite finding her strange. This trait enables the middle development (she accepts their pain, which weighs her like anchor chains) and primes closure (she carries confessions into the deep, leaves them lighter). However, the unlocking is passive reception rather than active choice under pressure. Present across beats but the cost is more cumulative burden than a single visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Detachment is the climactic action: she sheds apron, boots, human posture-as-armor in a specific sequence, transforming skin to iridescence and lungs to water-breathing. This act is the hinge of closure—without it, no swim, no peace. Irreplaceable: no synonym action would deliver the same embodied stakes. Shapes the final image and forecloses return. The sequence is dramatized beat-by-beat with visible cost (human belonging renounced). Essential and indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The whale's call is signaled early ("By the call of a whale from the deep, Vessels had said") and triggers the scrimshaw's glow and the island's appearance—clear mechanics that matter. It vibrates through the scrimshaw, resonates in Mira's bones, and the whale surfaces with "ancient and knowing" eye before diving toward home. Shapes the decisive beat (call → island appears → Mira swims). Present in setup (Vessels' instruction) and payoff (call and whale). Necessary but somewhat passive as trigger.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe is Mira's nightly threshold ("where harbor's murky water met kelp forests") and the physical space of her transformation wade. It is signaled early, returns as her habitual refuge, and is the literal stage for closure. The "neither fully land nor sea" quality mirrors her liminality. However, it does not impose navigational cost or constrain tactics—she simply wades deeper. Micro-setting with thematic charge and closure presence, but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After violence becomes impossible" describes the island's condition, not a timeframe that tightens on-page decisions. Mira seeks a place where fighting stops, but no clock or deadline pressures her choice—she has waited seven years and could wait longer. The phrase appears in Vessels' dying words and in the island description, more thematic label than temporal constraint. Present but ornamental; does not alter tactics or pace.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The motivation is dramatized through friction: obligation (workers need her) versus truth (her non-human nature, exhaustion from fighting for belonging). Mira's internal conflict—combative part wants to stay, tender part knows fighting brought only exhaustion—creates visible cost when she chooses surrender. The desire shapes the arc from nightly waiting to final swim. Present in setup (carrying confessions), development (recognizing cage), and payoff (transformation). Conflicted and essential to closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tone braids combative (rough dock work, suspicion, violence, wars, scars) and tender (longing, fierce gentle attention, confession-carrying, wounded seeking shelter) throughout. It modulates under pressure: combative part versus tender part at the choice beat, then resolves in "dancing toward something real" and the workers' lighter grief. The paradox charges the final image (combated their grief, tenderness that combated). Coherent through turns, purposeful, and integral to theme.</comment>
