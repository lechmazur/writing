<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is specific and grounded in her perceptual stance ("tranquilly perceptive awareness of the thin membrane between what was and what lingered"), and her decision to stop the scavenger shows character-driven agency. However, her motivation remains largely static; she observes and guards but undergoes no internal conflict or transformation on the page. The scavenger's arc is more dynamic—his shift from greed to grief is concrete—but his epiphany feels somewhat delivered rather than fought for, with Elara functioning as oracle rather than participant in genuine friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a situational lens: the scavenger's arrival tests Elara's covenant of silence, and his choice to leave carrying unspoken words constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) with visible conceptual cost. Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph (who, where, when), and the covenant mechanism is signaled early through contextual layering. The closure image—"carrying his unspoken words with him like precious cargo"—reconfigures the premise's weight with felt cost, though the transformation hinges more on Elara's persuasion than the scavenger's earned internal wrestling, which slightly softens the causal pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The oasis setting is vivid and purposeful: "skeletal trees still held the shapes of shade," "stone channels…dry as bone," and the stained glass box at the apiary's heart all constrain the encounter and charge the final image. The scorched wasteland frames the oasis as a cupped palm of preserved silence, and the ghosts' routines supply atmospheric pressure. The environment operates as more than backdrop—it embodies the covenant's logic and makes the scavenger's choice spatially legible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether the scavenger will take or honor the box—is signaled early and escalates when he reveals his daughter's death, creating a meaningful choice between greed and grief. Elara's intervention narrows his options by reframing silence as weight worth carrying, which deepens the stakes from material to existential. However, the scavenger's turn feels more persuaded than wrestled; the story delivers the insight rather than forcing him to earn it through on-page friction, which caps the pressure's felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars: the covenant's mechanics, the ghosts' silent rituals, and the stained glass box's hum all dramatize the premise that "some things mattered precisely because they were never voiced." The final image—unspoken words as "precious cargo"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Elara's closing stance, "She would guard them until the world remembered that," risks summary but stays grounded in her perceptual role and the world's scorched context, avoiding the overt thesis statement.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV remains stable and tonally consistent, with Elara's perceptual signature ("tranquilly perceptive," "read him through contextual clues") anchoring the narrative distance. The scavenger's dialogue is natural and goal-driven, and his aborted confession—"I never told her—"—carries subtext and advances the thematic conflict. Minor register elevation appears in phrases like "shapes us, shapes the people who never hear it," which tilts toward essay rather than interiority under stress, but the overall voice maintains coherence and purpose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clean and purposeful, with strong concrete images ("forever walking toward a well that had dried generations ago," "hummed with the weight of everything unsaid"). Some paraphrase loops appear: the covenant's mechanism is restated across multiple paragraphs ("promise the unspoken words," "everything unsaid," "silence has its own eloquence"), and the final paragraph's "Some things mattered precisely because they were never voiced" is a thematic summary that could be cut. Information density is high overall, but the closure beat leans slightly toward tell rather than pure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—a recluse guarding a covenant of unspoken words in a post-apocalyptic oasis—offers a fresh synthesis of post-collapse setting and abstract thematic stakes. The stained glass box as repository of silence is specific and non-obvious. However, the philosophical stance ("silence has its own eloquence") trends toward familiar territory, and Elara's role as static keeper rather than active participant in transformation limits the story's ingenuity. The scavenger's arc provides the necessary movement, but his conversion feels slightly template-driven: arrive greedy, reveal wound, leave enlightened.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara ("astonished recluse") is present from the opening and her perceptual stance shapes the entire frame. Her key choice—stopping the scavenger from speaking his confession—drives the thematic turn and forecloses his path to conventional catharsis. However, she remains largely observational; the scavenger undergoes the transformation while Elara functions as catalyst rather than participant in friction. Her reclusiveness and astonishment-turned-tranquility are established traits but do not constrain or alter her tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The stained glass box appears early ("The stained glass box sat at the heart of the ruined apiary"), is handled in two distinct beats (Elara's backstory discovery and the scavenger's greed), and returns with reweighted meaning in the closure image where it "caught the last light of day and hummed with the weight of everything still unsaid." Its physical properties—amber and gold bees, violet and green flowers, the hum when light touches it—are specific and charge the covenant's mechanics. It is integral to the scavenger's choice and the final image, though slightly ornamental in the middle section where it is mostly described rather than actively used.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The "tangled covenant" is signaled early, explained through Maren's bargain, and directly shapes the story's central conflict: whether the scavenger will break or honor the covenant by taking the box or speaking his grief. Elara's intervention—"Don't. That weight is yours"—dramatizes the covenant's logic on the page, and the scavenger's choice to leave carrying unspoken words constitutes covenant adherence with visible cost. The covenant mechanics constrain both characters' options and enable the thematic closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's "tranquilly perceptive" nature is established early and colors her observations throughout ("She read him through contextual clues"). It enables her to diagnose the scavenger's grief and intervene at the right moment, constraining his path by reframing silence as sacred weight. However, the trait functions more as lens than as active constraint; it does not force a tradeoff or visible cost on the page. It is label-heavy rather than embodied through contradictory impulses or tactical friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Gazing is Elara's dominant action throughout: "she simply gazed," "Elara watched," "Elara gazed at him," and the closing "watching the ghosts." The scavenger's key turn hinges on his eyes going "to the stained glass box, and his expression shifted," which is observational mirroring. However, gazing is passive; the story could substitute "observe" or "witness" with minimal structural change. The action suits the tone but does not redefine options or create a unique tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Through contextual clues" is explicitly named twice and demonstrated on the page: Elara reads the scavenger's wedding band, his glances at the ghost-child, and his tremor to infer his unspoken grief. This method enables her intervention and is integral to the covenant's logic (she has pieced together the covenant's rules through decades of observation). However, the method itself is not pressured or tested; it succeeds without friction or cost, which limits its causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "abandoned beekeeping oasis in a scorched wasteland" is anchored early and supplies both spatial constraint (the scavenger walks into it at dusk, Elara emerges from a dead pomegranate tree) and thematic charge (the oasis as "cupped palm in the cracked earth"). The setting's particulars—empty hives, dry channels, skeletal trees—embody the covenant's logic and pressure the scavenger's choice by making the strangeness immediate and legible. The ghosts' silent routines within the oasis heighten the atmosphere and constrain modern scavenging logic, making the location indispensable to the story's stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "after ghosts become visible" is established in the opening and provides world-context pressure: "most people fled to the cities" while Elara remained because "she had always sensed them." This situates the encounter as post-collapse normalcy and explains the scavenger's reaction to the ghost-child. However, the temporal frame does not tighten decisions or impose a clock; the scavenger's choice unfolds at his own pace without time pressure. The timeframe functions as backstory rather than active constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's motivation "to preserve the weight of unspoken words" is dramatized through her refusal to let the scavenger confess ("Don't. That weight is yours") and her final stance as guardian. The motivation directly drives the thematic conflict and forecloses the scavenger's path to conventional release, creating visible cost (he leaves still carrying grief). However, the motivation is more stated than internally conflicted; Elara does not wrestle with competing desires on the page, which keeps the friction external rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The tone of "mute eloquence" is sustained throughout: Elara's tranquil perception, the ghosts' silent rituals, the covenant's unspoken terms, and the scavenger's aborted confession all enact rather than declare silence's weight. The prose modulates appropriately—Elara's calm interjections contrast with the scavenger's urgency—and the final image ("hummed with the weight of everything still unsaid") charges the tone with conceptual pressure. The tone is coherent through turns and integral to the story's thematic closure.</comment>
