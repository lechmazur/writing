<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena's interior is concrete and specific: the embodied awareness of customer grief through "tremors in hands, pauses before speaking." Her transformation from aromatherapist to emotional cartographer is motivated and her final gesture—repositioning the screw—reflects consistent values. The customer's arc from grief to gratitude is dramatized through physical tells and tears, though she remains more conduit than crucible. Minor deduction: the grandmother's parallel screw functions more as symbolic validation than a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Elena repositions the screw so "her message stays where she placed it," a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights her repair work as legacy translation with visible cost (she must engineer around the obstruction). The lens reads Accumulative/Textural—fog, water clocks, and the screw build toward a final cadence shift. Orientation anchors early (shop, dawn, fog). One meaningful deepening when Elena decodes the daughter's intentional jam; the customer's gratitude shift completes the reconfiguration. Cost is felt in Elena's renunciation of her former sensory practice, now replaced by this quieter witnessing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The water clock shop functions as both workspace and thematic engine: the "ambient dripping" anchors every beat, clepsydras measure "drops rather than ticks," and Elena's repair tools constrain her tactile discovery of the screw. The fog recurs purposefully, "occluding views" that mirror Elena's investigative method, and lifts at closure to signal clarity. Micro-setting (the workbench, the drawer, the screw itself) drives the plot turn. Sensory hierarchy is consistent: Elena's lost smell is replaced by visual and tactile detail. Minor note: the "old district" remains generic, but the shop interior does active work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: decode the daughter's hidden message and relieve the customer's grief. One meaningful tightening when Elena identifies the screw as a midwife's tool, narrowing interpretation and enabling her thematic reading. The resolution is earned by Elena's expertise and empathy; her choice to reposition rather than remove the screw carries visible cost (mechanical compromise for symbolic preservation). Agency is present in her diagnostic moves and final repair decision. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens, though no second reversal appears—the single turn is sufficient at this length but holds the score just under 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—legacy hidden in broken things, grief as puzzle—emerges organically from the screw's discovery and Elena's lost-sense backstory. The final image offers a non-literal answer: "she measured her life in births, not hours" reweights time itself without moralizing. Subtext operates in Elena's drawer touch (her own talisman) and the water clocks' patient rhythm. The piece resists tidy closure: the customer leaves with "gratitude replacing grief," but Elena sits in "trembling calm," still waiting. No thematic echo or thesis statement mars the ending. The screw-as-message motif is specific and irreplaceable, earning full thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elena; perceptual signature is distinct (tactile and observational after losing smell). Dialogue is sparse, natural, goal-driven: "I was told you repair unusual pieces" and Elena's soft explanations carry subtext and avoid exposition. Free indirect style is clean: "Elena had developed what she called mapping emotional terrain" integrates thought without filter clutter. Diction remains character-appropriate; no register drift into corporate jargon. Compression is purposeful: "Two weeks before she died" economically anchors backstory. Minor slip: "This was her motivation: to unveil ordinary miracles" briefly tilts toward meta-commentary rather than pure dramatization, though it recovers quickly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual flow. Clarity is high, information density strong: "a small, distinctive screw with a flattened head" does double work (plot object and symbolic seed). Strategic telling compresses Elena's accident efficiently. Two minor artifacts: "her voice barely rising above the shop's ambient dripping" stacks modifiers without sharp propulsion, and "trembling calm" + "tremors in hands" echo each other within six paragraphs. No loops or template cadence runs; the closure image is clean. Figurative language (fog as veil, water as patience) remains consistent and voice-motivated, avoiding muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The water-clock repair premise is fresh; pairing lost smell with emotional cartography offers a non-obvious synthesis. The screw's dual identity (midwife tool, daughter's puzzle) feels earned in hindsight and specific to this story. Transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on these exact choices. However, the bereaved-customer-finds-message frame is familiar grief-work territory, and the resolution—decoding a loved one's intentional symbolism—follows a recognizable template. Risk is present in the quiet ending and the sensory inversion, but the emotional calculus remains comfortably redemptive without deeper moral friction. Solid craft elevated by particular detail, stopping short of bold singularity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena's lost smell is signaled early ("ended her aromatherapy practice") and returns at closure ("Once, she would have offered calming scents"). It shapes her present method: unable to distinguish lavender from rosemary, she now reads grief through gesture. The attribute enables her empathetic diagnosis and constrains her toolkit, but no on-page choice hinges directly on *not* having smell. Present in setup, development (implicit in her tactile/visual focus), and payoff (explicit callback). Functional across beats with thematic charge, but the cost is retrospective rather than pressing a live decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The screw appears in three distinct beats: discovery (jams the valve), identification (midwife's tool), and resolution (repositioned to preserve message). It drives the central turn—Elena's recognition unlocks the daughter's intent—and the final repair choice hinges on keeping it inside. Early signal (within first third), causal pressure (blocks flow, triggers investigation), closure linkage (her tactical compromise), high specificity (a "midwife's birthing clamp screw" is irreplaceable). The twin in Elena's drawer charges the final image. Removing this object would collapse plot and theme. Exemplary integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Reading between lines" is named early ("Elena had learned to read between lines in other ways") and drives her method: she deciphers the customer's unspoken grief, the screw's hidden meaning, and the daughter's intentional puzzle. It shapes stakes (decode the message) and her interpretive tactics. The concept returns at closure when she unveils the ordinary miracle. However, it functions more as thematic frame than tactical constraint—no moment where *failure* to read between lines would foreclose a path. Strong thematic presence and clear linkage to her expertise, but causal pressure is implicit rather than decisive.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Maps emotional terrain" is introduced early as Elena's post-accident skill, observing "tremors in hands, pauses before speaking." It enables her diagnosis of the customer's sorrow and her decoding of the screw's message. The trait is demonstrated on the page rather than label-only, but no scene shows a visible tradeoff—what does she *miss* by focusing on emotion instead of scent or surface? Present in setup and development; implicit at closure. Functional and character-specific, but lacks felt cost or a moment where this focus constrains another choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Humanize" appears explicitly: "She had learned that witnessing without judgment was a way to humanize both the griever and the grief itself." It drives Elena's stance—she "didn't look away" when the customer cries—and her choice to reposition the screw (honoring the daughter's intent rather than imposing mechanical purity). The action is thematically load-bearing and shapes the ending's emotional register. Setup (Elena's practice), development (her witnessing moment), payoff (repair choice that honors both message and mechanism). However, the action could be reframed as "honor" or "witness" without major edits; specificity is slightly soft. Strong integration, minor swappability friction.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Occluded views" anchors in the fog imagery: "fog pressed against the windows, offering only occluded views of the street" and "Through the occluded views of grief and morning mist, Elena finally saw clearly." The method reflects her investigative process—partial information clarifies into meaning—and the fog lifts at closure, signaling resolution. Setup and payoff are clear; the method shapes her interpretive tactic (patient observation until pattern emerges). However, the middle development is thin: no beat where occlusion actively blocks or delays a choice. Lyric reprise with thematic charge, but causal pressure is light. Scores in the resonance allowance range.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The water clock repair shop anchors every beat: the "ambient dripping" provides sonic texture, the clepsydras offer the thematic hook (time measured in drops), and the workbench is where Elena discovers and repairs the screw. The setting supplies her expertise and tools, constrains her repair options (she must work around the obstruction), and charges the final image ("surrounded by time made visible"). Setup (dawn opening), development (repair workspace), payoff (shop as metaphor for patient time). The shop is indispensable; removing it would break both plot and theme. High integration, strong causal and thematic pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Within the hush of morning fog" frames the opening and the fog "lifted like a curtain" at closure, bracketing the encounter. The timeframe creates atmosphere (quiet, liminal) and mirrors Elena's gradual clarity. However, the fog's presence does not tighten decisions or impose a deadline—the repair unfolds at an unhurried pace. Setup and payoff are clean; the element is purposeful and charges the final image. Missing middle pressure: no moment where the fog (or morning) constrains a tactic. Lyric reprise with thematic coherence, but the timeframe does not escalate stakes. Functional, borderline essential for tone, but causal role is passive.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Elena's motivation—"to unveil ordinary miracles hidden in broken things and bereaved hearts"—is named late (two-thirds in) but demonstrated throughout: she decodes the screw's message and reframes the customer's grief as discovery. The desire drives her repair choice (preserve the message) and her final reflection (touching her own talisman, waiting for the next miracle). Friction is present: she cannot use her former aromatherapy tools, and her current work is quieter, less immediately gratifying. Setup (implied in her patient repair practice), development (the unveiling act), payoff (explicit statement and continued waiting). Cost is visible in her renunciation of scent-based comfort. Strong thematic integration; late naming and slight tell-heaviness hold it under 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Trembling calm" appears explicitly at closure ("Elena sat in trembling calm") and is embodied throughout: the shop's dripping rhythms, Elena's patient observation, the customer's fractured voice against quiet. Tone modulates purposefully—grief intensifies when the customer cries, then eases into gratitude—while maintaining the underlying stillness. The tone charges the final image: Elena's composed waiting, tinged with fragility ("trembling"). Setup (morning hush, fog), development (quiet dialogue and repair), payoff (explicit phrase that crystallizes the mood). Coherent and integrated, tone supports rather than dominates. Strong execution, just shy of indispensable.</comment>
