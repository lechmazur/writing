<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's arc from "forgiving skeptic" to someone who chooses wonder is earned through concrete micro-choices: touching the tooth, sitting beside the figure, asking to be taught. Her interiority is specific and embodied ("bone setting, the slow, painful realignment"), and the contradictory impulses—dismissing her mother's stories while being drawn to the maze—act simultaneously in scene. The brother-figure's "shrewdly innocent" voice is consistently realized through diction and the strange physicality ("moved carefully, as if his body was something he'd borrowed"). Minor slip: the phrase "nostalgic innovation" arrives as unearned interiority rather than dramatized realization, pulling toward label-speak at a peak beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by the opening (who: Maren; where: estate and secret garden; when: after the body is found). The piece commits to an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered images (the stock, the tooth, the fountain) and the closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Maren's "Teach me the new maps" crystallizes her stance shift with felt cost (foreclosing rational certainty). Cost is legible in "the cleft in her certainty...wasn't something to close. It was a doorway." However, the middle section relies heavily on expository dialogue that tells rather than dramatizes the mother's contradictions, slightly flattening escalation. The closure image (garden breathing, "remembering and becoming") reweights prior material but borders on abstract; a sharper concrete anchor would lift it further.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The secret garden functions as micro-setting that constrains Maren's choice: she must navigate the hedge maze (a physical and symbolic threshold) to reach the clearing, and the moonflowers, stone bench, and fountain return with reweighted presence at closure. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("smelled like her childhood, like her mother's perfume and the herbs she'd grown"), and the garden's "breathing" at the end charges the final image. The spatial choreography of the maze and clearing is coherent. The tooth as object-as-setting works: "cold, heavier than it should have been" gives it tactile weight that anchors the moment of belief-shift. The hedge maze's turns ("Left, left, right, through the archway of thorns") are specific enough to feel real without excessive detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Maren must reconcile certainty with the impossible evidence of the changeling. One meaningful tightening occurs when she takes the tooth and feels "bone setting, the slow, painful realignment"—a trade-off that forecloses rational dismissal. The brother-figure's offer ("you could dismiss this...or you could forgive") frames the choice with visible cost: accepting wonder means abandoning thirty years of protective skepticism. However, escalation relies heavily on exposition ("She made mistakes—kept me away, tried to burn the stock") rather than on-page pressure that narrows Maren's options beat by beat. The final act reweights cost (the cleft becomes a doorway), but the path there is more told than forced.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—the coexistence of contradictory truths, mistakes as navigation tools—emerges organically from Maren's handling of the tooth and the brother-figure's paradoxical nature ("loved both of us...That's not a contradiction. That's just how love works"). The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "the cleft in her certainty...was a doorway" reweights the premise without moralizing. The recurring image of the tooth and the garden's final "breathing" avoid overt symbolism while charging the closure. Minor issue: "nostalgic innovation" and "turn her mistakes into constellations" veer toward abstraction and thematic echo—phrases that articulate the story's thesis rather than letting it emerge fully through scene pressure. Still, the central insight (belief and skepticism can cohabit) arises from Maren's specific struggle, not from assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV held cleanly; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the tooth moment, slightly wider during exposition). The brother-figure's dialogue carries distinct idiom: "shrewdly innocent" registers in "I've been yearning to meet you properly" and the birdlike head-tilt. Maren's perceptual signature is consistent (she notices the weight of the tooth, the smell of herbs, the fountain's impossibility). Dialogue advances plot and carries subtext ("Thomas was a name you gave to something that wasn't me"). Filter verbs ("noticed," "understood") appear but remain voice-motivated. One slip: during peak emotional beats, diction occasionally elevates beyond Maren's established register ("constellations," "nostalgic innovation" as internal thought feel imposed rather than character-organic).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clean with varied syntax and strong rhythm ("The tooth was cold, heavier than it should be, and something in her chest shifted—bone setting"). Information density is high; most lines serve multiple functions. Opening and closing images are strong. However, minor artifacts cluster: "something shrewdly innocent" uses an abstract construction; "nostalgic innovation, she thought without knowing where the phrase came from" is a scaffolded insertion that explains rather than trusts; "ancient and immediate, remembering and becoming" stacks near-synonyms in the final line. The phrase "both things were true" and similar restatements ("that's not a contradiction") loop conceptually across adjacent beats. Figurative language is mostly apt, but "turn mistakes into constellations" borders on strained metaphor. These issues don't obscure causality but do slightly dull momentum in peak moments.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The changeling premise is familiar, but the story transforms it through Maren's adult skepticism and the mother's contradictory love ("loved both of us"). The brother-figure's physicality ("moved carefully, as if his body was something he'd borrowed") and the baby tooth as proof-object offer fresh specificity. The secret garden and hedge maze are earned particulars rather than stock fantasy props. However, the core emotional arc—adult reconciling childhood wonder—is well-trodden, and the resolution (acceptance over dismissal) follows a predictable path. The "mistakes into constellations" and "old stories might become new maps" phrases feel derivative of workshop idiom. The piece executes its premise cleanly but doesn't take bold structural or tonal risks that would elevate originality into the high band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maren as "forgiving skeptic" is present from the opening ("she'd forgiven her mother...forgiven the endless rituals") and drives two key turns: her decision to enter the maze despite disbelief, and her final choice to sit and ask "Teach me the new maps," which forecloses rational certainty with visible cost. The trait constrains her initial resistance and enables the ending's acceptance. Setup early, middle choice (taking the tooth), and closure participation all present. However, the skepticism-to-belief arc is somewhat predictable, and the middle beat (taking the tooth) is more receptive than decisively risky, keeping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tooth appears in two beats: the brother-figure offers it mid-scene, and Maren holds it at closure ("still in her palm...closed her fingers around it"). It carries reweighted meaning (proof vs. permission slip for wonder) and its physical properties ("cold, heavier than it should have been") trigger Maren's internal shift ("bone setting"). Setup slightly delayed (not until mid-scene), but it enables a middle choice and charges the ending image. The object is specific and irreplaceable (a changeling's baby tooth ties directly to the premise). It does not resolve a problem it didn't help create. Scores solidly but lacks the early signal and three-or-more beat involvement that would push it higher.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"A cleft in certainty" is introduced early ("opened a cleft in her certainty she couldn't close") and shapes Maren's dominant stake: how to reconcile the impossible evidence. It reappears at closure, reweighted as "a doorway, same as the gap in the hedge," constraining her final choice to accept wonder rather than dismiss it. The concept enables tactics (she follows the maze despite disbelief) and charges the final image. However, the concept operates more as thematic scaffolding than as a visible on-page constraint that narrows options beat by beat; it's articulated rather than pressuring. Strong lyric reprise but middle development is somewhat implicit.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Shrewdly innocent" is attributed to the brother-figure ("His voice held something shrewdly innocent") and demonstrated through his dialogue and gestures (offering the tooth, the birdlike head-tilt, "wise and wondering at once"). It enables his credibility and constrains the confrontation (he can't be dismissed as purely manipulative). However, the trait is more observed by Maren than enacted with visible cost or tradeoff; it characterizes rather than pressures a specific choice. Present in setup and ending (his smile at closure), but the middle causal work is thin. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Yearn" appears explicitly ("I've been yearning to meet you properly") and implicitly in the brother-figure's long waiting and Maren's draw to the maze. It motivates the encounter and the garden's preserved state. However, the action is more backdrop than pivot; the major turns trace more directly to Maren's choice to accept the tooth and her final request to learn. "Yearn" sets up the meeting but doesn't itself redefine options or generate new complications. Present in setup and thematically at closure, but middle causality is weak. Swappable with "wish" or "hope" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Bone setting" appears once as internal metaphor ("bone setting, the slow, painful realignment of everything she'd believed") during the tooth moment. It characterizes Maren's internal shift but is not signaled as a method beforehand and does not shape attempts or tactics on the page. The mechanics are metaphorical rather than literal; no prior setup or later application. Present only in the middle beat, absent from closure participation. Functional as imagery but not essential to story logic; could be replaced with another healing metaphor without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The secret garden behind the hedge maze is introduced early (Maren's memory, "she had stopped believing in it"), pressures her choice to enter ("drawn to the overgrown labyrinth"), and is the locus of the entire confrontation and closure. The maze functions as threshold (the turns she memorized), the clearing supplies the bench and fountain that return at closure ("water began to trickle, impossible but undeniable"), and the moonflowers lean toward the brother-figure, charging the final image ("the garden seemed to breathe with them"). Setup, middle constraint (navigation required), and closure participation all present. The setting is irreplaceable; removing it breaks the story's logic and symbolic architecture. Small deduction: the maze's navigation detail could be slightly sharper to show real difficulty.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the substitute body was found" anchors the story's opening and frames Maren's insomnia and return. It sets up the stakes (the discovery reopened certainty) and implicitly tightens the timeline (estate settlement). However, urgency is more atmospheric than tactical; no live countdown alters Maren's moves beat by beat. The "thirty years" of skepticism and the mother's recent death create temporal pressure but don't constrain choices within the garden scene itself. Present in setup and thematically relevant at closure (Maren moves forward from the discovery), but middle development is static. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To turn mistakes into constellations" is articulated by the brother-figure mid-scene ("Your mother wanted to turn her mistakes into constellations") and echoed at closure in Maren's acceptance of the "cleft" as doorway. It motivates the mother's garden-keeping and Maren's final choice to learn rather than dismiss. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants; Maren's internal friction is more about belief than about how to honor mistakes. The concept is thematic scaffolding more than a pressure-generating desire. Setup delayed to mid-scene, minimal middle friction, present at closure but not causally driving it. Lyric reprise without strong causal teeth.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Nostalgic innovation" is modeled in the opening (Maren's memories vs. surveyor practicality), named explicitly mid-scene ("she thought without knowing where the phrase came from"), and embodied at closure (the garden "ancient and immediate, remembering and becoming"). The tone is coherent: longing for childhood wonder braided with adult reframing. It modulates with pressure (wistful in the maze, charged at the tooth moment, resolved in the final breath). However, the explicit naming feels scaffolded and slightly forced, and the tonal consistency is occasionally undercut by expository flatness in the dialogue. Strong thematic fit and closure charge, but the on-page execution is not seamless.</comment>
