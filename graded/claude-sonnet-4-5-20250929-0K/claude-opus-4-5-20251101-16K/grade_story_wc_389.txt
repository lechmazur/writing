<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation burns steady across seventeen years, and her final choice to descend and release control demonstrates earned transformation. Internal contradiction appears in her simultaneous need for isolation and broadcasting prophecies, embodied in "lonely visionary by necessity, not choice." However, the arc relies heavily on summary ("seventeen years," "word spread slowly") rather than dramatized pressure points that force micro-choices. The shift from interpretive broadcasts to raw static feels asserted rather than causally earned through on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: static whispers accumulate, followers gather, factions fracture, then Mira shifts broadcast method and descends. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure—Mira's descent and acceptance that "shaping a new dawn never meant controlling it"—qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: she renounces control). Cost is present but soft: she leaves the observatory, but we see no visceral forfeiture or trade-off that alters her body, relationships, or immediate options on the page. The piece teaches its pattern early, but the final reconfiguration feels thematically declared rather than materially dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory, cobalt glass portico, and salvaged radio equipment create vivid sensory anchors filtered through Mira's priorities ("rusted needle through gray silk," "electric light wash through her"). The portico constrains and charges multiple beats: altar, faction argument stage, and final light-scattering at descent. Spatial choreography is coherent; the mountain's vertical axis (peak, shoulders, valleys) governs movement and power dynamics. The setting directly shapes the final image when the portico catches "first true light in seventeen years," reweighting the observatory's role from Mira's prison to a beacon for those below.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Mira's drive to shape a new dawn using prophecies. One meaningful tightening occurs when factions fracture and she shifts to broadcasting raw static, forcing followers to find their own patterns—this narrows her control and tests her commitment. The twist that "variant allegiance could be a gift" reweights the conflict. However, escalation relies on summary ("Pilgrims began appearing: first one… then dozens") rather than on-page confrontations that dramatize rising pressure. The descent pays off the arc under the Accumulative lens, but the cost—leaving the mountain—reads conceptual rather than viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—prophecy as offering rather than control—emerges from Mira's shift from interpretation to raw static and her final realization that "shaping a new dawn never meant controlling it." The cobalt glass and fragmented frequencies accumulate meaning across the piece, and the closing image of blue fire scattering like radio signals offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Minor slip: "prophecy was never about being right. It was about being heard across the noise" articulates theme too directly in the penultimate paragraph, edging toward stated moral rather than pure dramatization. Still, the particulars (static, factions, descent) carry the weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mira; perceptual signature is consistent ("static sing its broken lullabies," "drowned men fighting over treasure"). Diction modulates purposefully: lyric compression at storm peaks, plainer syntax in the radio room. Dialogue, when present, carries subtext ("You're missing the point… they didn't hear"). Voice coheres under pressure. Minor texture artifact: "lonely visionary by necessity, not choice—though after seventeen years, the distinction had grown thin" reads slightly writerly for a character who's been isolated that long, but remains within tolerance and does not fracture focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, figurative language is purposeful ("rusted needle through gray silk," "flower made of thunder"), and information density is high. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor overwriting in the final third: "imperfect and strange and entirely unpredictable" stacks modifiers; "the dawn… began" ends with a line that leans abstract rather than offering a final concrete image. Propulsion is strong until the descent sequence, which compresses seventeen years of backstory into quick beats without dramatizing the tactile details of leaving. Still, clarity and momentum remain intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—prophet who renounces control, fragmented radio as oracle, factions unified by confusion—feels fresh and specific to this story. The cobalt glass portico and the shift from interpretation to raw static are non-obvious turns. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative rather than confrontation-driven) heightens thematic stakes. However, the "lonely prophet on a mountain" frame is familiar, and the emotional arc—acceptance of impermanence—trends toward a well-worn insight. The particulars (radio frequencies, blue glass, faction dynamics) elevate the premise into the 7-range, but full originality is limited by the archetypal scaffold.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira's choices—standing beneath the portico, shifting broadcast method, descending the mountain—create key turns. Setup is immediate (opening line). Middle development: her decision to broadcast raw static alters faction dynamics. Closure: her descent and renunciation of control are the climactic act. Cost is present but soft (leaving vs. staying is conceptual rather than viscerally dramatized). Two gates strong, closure participation solid, causal pressure moderate. No major frictions beyond cost clarity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cobalt glass portico appears in at least four beats: initial description as altar, site of faction argument, Mira's reflection moment, and the final light-scattering at dawn. Setup is early (paragraph five), middle development shapes faction conflict staging, closure participation is strong (final image depends on it catching light). It returns with reweighted meaning (from Mira's private altar to a beacon for the world below). Causal pressure is moderate; it constrains movement and charges emotional beats. High irreplaceability: "cobalt glass" and "blue fire" are specific and tied to theme.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Variant allegiance is present: factions (Interpreters, Synthesists, Returners) emerge and fracture. Setup occurs mid-story (paragraph ten), development shows faction argument, and it shapes Mira's pivot to raw static broadcasting. Closure linkage is weak: the final image focuses on Mira's descent and scattered light, not faction dynamics. The concept enables one turn (broadcasting shift) but does not constrain later choices or charge the final image. Swappable with "conflicting interpretations" or similar; lacks unique causal teeth.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Lyrically prophetic" is embodied in the static's cadence ("The shadow lengthens eastward… new ones shall drink the morning") and Mira's voice ("gritty sound, worn smooth by solitude"). Setup is immediate, development occurs in multiple broadcast beats, and it colors the ending's tone. However, the trait enables rather than constrains: it does not impose a visible cost or force a trade-off. It distinguishes voice and atmosphere but remains more label than active pressure. Mid-band for solid presence without causal teeth.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Unfold" appears in "old magic unfold like a flower made of thunder" and implicitly in the unfolding prophecies and factions. Setup is early, middle beats show prophecies manifesting and factions emerging, and the closure hinges on Mira's acceptance that the dawn will "unfold" beyond her control. The action is metaphorical and distributed rather than a single decisive physical act, which limits causal sharpness. It reweights the premise at closure but could be swapped with "reveal" or "emerge" with minor edits. Solid lyric reprise without full irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Fragmented radio frequencies are signaled immediately ("radio equipment… crackled with fragmented frequencies") and shape multiple beats: static whispers, Mira transcribes, rebroadcasts attract followers, shift to raw static alters faction dynamics. Setup is early, development constrains Mira's methods (she must listen, transcribe, broadcast), and closure depends on the metaphor of "scattered radio signals finding their home." The mechanics matter: fragmented signals → interpretation → raw transmission is a causal chain. Irreplaceability is high; the radio is not swappable with generic "visions." Cost connection is moderate (no visible sacrifice tied to using the radio).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory appears in every major beat: opening anchor, altar site, isolation enforcer, faction gathering point, and departure locus. Setup is immediate (paragraph two), development shows it constraining access (pilgrims must climb) and enabling Mira's solitude, and closure is Mira's descent from it. The altitude and lightning pressure Mira's body and choices ("thin as the oxygen"). The observatory's verticality structures power dynamics (Mira above, followers below). High irreplaceability: "stormlit" and "above clouds" are specific and tied to theme. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Across the rise of a prophet" is present: seventeen years pass, pilgrims arrive, factions form, Mira descends on an anniversary. Setup is early (paragraph four: "seventeen years"), development is tracked through narrative summary ("word spread slowly," "last winter"), and closure anchors to "the anniversary of her arrival." However, time is summarized rather than dramatized; no live ticking clock tightens decisions in scene. The timeframe enables the arc (long isolation → followers → renunciation) but does not constrain moment-to-moment tactics. Mid-band for structural presence without pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira's desire "to shape a new dawn using ancient shadows" is stated explicitly (paragraph four) and drives her actions: transcribing static, broadcasting, standing under the portico. Setup is early, development shows her methods (interpret prophecies, gather followers), and closure reweights the motivation when she realizes "shaping a new dawn never meant controlling it." Cost is present (she leaves the mountain, renounces control) but soft. Friction between want (shape the dawn) and cost (lose control) is thematic rather than viscerally dramatized. Solid thematic spine without embodied trade-offs in peak beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Tone blends gritty detail ("water-stained notebooks," "rusted needle," "gritty sound") with whimsical imagery ("flower made of thunder," "drowned men fighting over treasure," "blue fire"). Setup is immediate, tone modulates across beats (lyric during storms, plainer in the radio room), and the closure image—blue fire scattering like radio signals—fuses both registers. The tone charges the final image and remains coherent under pressure. Minor slip: whimsy occasionally edges toward precioseness ("whimsy in accepting"), but overall the fusion is purposeful and enhances theme.</comment>
