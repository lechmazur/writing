<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera's interiority is concrete and particular ("I have nothing but questions," her refusal of prescribed meaning), and her weeping at the discovery feels embodied. The micro-choices—lifting the lens, ringing the bell, leaving the lens behind—constrain later options with visible cost. However, the arc from suspicion to connection relies heavily on a single epiphany beat rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure, and the final paragraph edges toward diagnostic self-awareness ("the texture of connection...was not uniformity but difference") that abstracts the earned moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors early (Vera, laboratory, post-stabilization) and the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through the lens object, bell harmonics layer with archived voice, and the final courtyard ringing reweights the premise with conceptual cost (pilgrimage authenticity found through questioning). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Vera's understanding forecloses naive compliance and charges the final image with the ghost of the child's voice. One visible slip: the Restoration Council setup and Soren's backstory slightly dilute focus in the first third without pressing choices until the lens encounter.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The laboratory is vividly anchored with acoustic chambers, wax cylinders, golden light through dust-caked windows; sensory detail is selective and purposeful. The miner's lamp lens constrains Vera's final choice—she leaves it but carries its lesson—and the courtyard stones at closure are "warmer" with the ghost-song, charging the final image. Spatial choreography (corridors, central chamber, courtyard) remains clear. The golden-shadow motif recurs with thematic weight rather than ornament.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering authentic connection—is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful deepening: the lens encounter transforms Vera's understanding and forecloses her passive compliance with mandated ritual. Agency is clear (she questions, experiments, weeps, leaves the lens), and the price is conceptual: she can no longer perform pilgrimage as prescribed. The escalation is more deepening than reversal, fitting the Accumulative lens, but the single pivot (lens + bell experiment) carries the entire pressure arc without secondary complication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—connection as rough-edged encounter across time rather than committee-manufactured uniformity—emerges from particulars (the lens, the child's voice, the bell harmonics) without overt statement until the final paragraph, which edges toward thesis ("the texture of connection...was not uniformity but difference"). The final courtyard image reweights the premise non-literally: the ghost-song in her bells answers the central question with resonance rather than moral. Subtext operates in Vera's tears and Soren's quiet observation. The piece resists tidy resolution but the closing philosophical summary slightly undercuts earned ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is clear (Vera notices acoustic and harmonic detail, questions prescribed meaning). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; Soren's understatement and Vera's direct inquiry carry subtext. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("powerfully gentle—a paradox she had cultivated"), though occasional elevated register ("propel conversations into unexpected depths") slightly tensions the otherwise grounded narration. No head-hopping; psychic distance modulates intentionally with emotional intensity. Free indirect style is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high in the lens-experiment beat. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor scaffold: "The texture of connection, she now understood" in the penultimate paragraph repeats the concept stated two paragraphs earlier, creating a small conceptual loop. Figurative language ("fractal patterns," "golden shadows") is vivid but occasionally dense without pattern-teaching payoff. Proofreading is clean; clarity and propulsion are strong in peak beats, though the closing two paragraphs slightly over-explain the earned insight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The prism-song bell ringer and laboratory of lost sounds offer fresh specificity; the miner's lamp lens as acoustic artifact is a non-obvious synthesis. The artificial-pilgrimage premise risks template territory (mandated ritual vs. authentic discovery) but is elevated by the lens encounter and temporal-connection angle. Emotional truth (Vera's tears, her refusal of easy answers) anchors the concept. The final reweighting feels earned in hindsight. One weakness: the Restoration Council frame and "prescribed meaning" language echo familiar dystopian/bureaucratic tropes without full transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vera's choices—asking questions, lifting the lens, ringing bells through it, weeping, leaving the lens—create all key turns. Setup clear, middle experimentation drives the central beat, and her final courtyard ringing with the ghost-song shapes closure. Agency visible throughout; decisions alter tactics and foreclose passive compliance. High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The lens appears in the locked cabinet (~30% mark), is handled and used in the central experiment, and its lesson is carried (without the object) to closure, where it charges the final ringing. Two distinct beats (discovery, experiment) plus closure participation. Causal pressure high: it transforms the bells' sound and Vera's understanding, narrowing options. Slight late penalty (~30% first touch), but irreplaceability and cost connection elevate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Artificial pilgrimage frames the stakes from the opening and Vera's questioning of it drives the middle choice. Closure reweights it: she performs the expected ritual but now with authentic ghost-song, transforming the premise. Setup, development (her suspicion constrains choices), and closure participation all present. Causal pressure moderate; the concept shapes tactics but could be rephrased without breaking logic (e.g., "mandated ritual"). Solid integration but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Powerfully gentle" is defined once ("a paradox she had cultivated through years of listening. She could shatter certainties without raising her tone") but remains label-only. It does not constrain or enable any on-page action with visible cost; Vera's dialogue and choices would read identically without this trait. Ornamental use; swappable descriptor.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Propel" appears twice: once in Vera's trait description (she could "propel conversations into unexpected depths") and crucially when "the lens was propelling the sound outward in patterns that defied her training." The second use drives the central turn—sound scatters into new frequencies, enabling the temporal connection. Two beats, causal pressure clear, closure linkage (the ghost-song in the final ringing traces to this mechanics). Strong integration, though the verb could theoretically be replaced with "scatter" or "project" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Questioning assumptions is signaled early ("I have nothing but questions"), shapes the middle choice (she questions why connection requires living participants, why pilgrimage means movement through space), and the final courtyard ringing embodies the method's payoff (authentic discovery through deep questioning). Three beats; the method's mechanics matter—her questions reframe the lens experiment and alter her stance. High causal pressure and closure linkage; the mechanics are specific and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The laboratory is established in paragraph two with acoustic chambers, resonance vaults, wax cylinders, magnetic tapes, and recording devices. It supplies the lens (locked cabinet), the central chamber for experimentation, and the courtyard for closure. Three distinct beats; the setting provides resources (archived sounds, equipment) that enable the temporal connection and alter Vera's understanding. Causal pressure high; micro-setting (central chamber) directly shapes the middle choice. Strong irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After the power grid stabilizes" anchors the opening ("three days after...when the hum beneath the world finally settled") and explains why recording devices awaken during the experiment. Two beats (setup, middle complication). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create a live clock; it functions as backstory context rather than active pressure. Functional but replaceable with minor edits (e.g., "after the war," "in the new silence").</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The desire to discover authentic connection (stated as "something real, something with texture she could feel beneath her fingers") is dramatized in Vera's refusal of prescribed ritual and drives the lens experiment. She questions the nature of connection across three beats, and the final image embodies the discovered texture (rough edges where eras meet). Friction between want (authentic connection) and cost (foregoing committee approval) visible. Setup, development, and closure participation all present; causal pressure solid.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Golden shadows" appears in paragraph two ("Golden light filtered through dust-caked windows, casting everything in amber warmth cut with long shadows"), recurs in the lens beat ("the golden shadows of the laboratory warped and stretched"), and charges the final image ("the golden shadows that fell across the stones seemed warmer for it"). Three touches across setup, middle, and closure; tone modulates subtly (distortion under stress, warmth at resolution). Coherent through turns and the final reprise reweights the motif with the ghost-song's presence. Solid lyric integration, though not indispensable to plot logic.</comment>
