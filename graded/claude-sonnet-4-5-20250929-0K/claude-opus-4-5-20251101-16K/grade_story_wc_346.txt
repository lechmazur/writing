<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's grief-driven motivation is clear and her micro-choices (pressing the puppet head to the pane, singing the lullaby) anchor the emotional core. However, interiority leans heavily on abstraction—"nested patterns of grief and duty," "the wound"—rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice to leave the puppet head as offering feels more lyric than causally earned by prior struggle; we see ritual more than genuine internal conflict acting in scene. The voice remains consistent but lacks the visceral specificity that would push this higher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) as closure: Mira's lullaby is vouchsafed across the pane, the doomsday clock shifts "deeper," and the final image crystallizes her stance with conceptual cost (she cannot save the world but ensures the song persists). Orientation anchors adequately by ~120 words (Mira, lighthouse, dusk, clock adjuster role). The lens holds and the closure reweights the premise—not salvation but witness—with undeniable pressure. Cost is felt but remains abstract; the puppet head placement and lullaby function as rituals rather than decisions that foreclose concrete alternatives, which prevents entry to the high 8s.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse, lantern room, and "pane of hush" are vivid and purposeful, grounding the speculative frame. The puppet head is handled twice (pocket, then pressed to pane) and charges the final image as an offering. Sensory details—"copper across the horizon," "purple bruise of dusk"—are selective and support tone. The micro-setting (the pane itself) constrains Mira's action at the climax, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for object/constraint participation. However, spatial choreography remains minimal (we never leave the lantern room) and the world's logic (how the clock "works") is asserted more than demonstrated through tactile interaction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Mira's need to send her message across time to Celeste—is signaled early and persists to closure. Pressure accumulates through the evening's "different" air and the clock's discordance, tightening to the lullaby beat. Agency is present (she chooses to vouchsafe the message rather than merely adjust), and the cost is conceptual: she cannot save the world, only ensure the song persists. The tightening is meaningful but not visceral; no live alternative is dramatized and refused on the page. The abstract framing ("nested patterns," "hush") diffuses the escalation, keeping this in the mid-6 band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—"not salvation, but tenderness; not victory, but witness"—emerges organically from Mira's ritual and the puppet head motif without overt moralizing. The final image (puppet head on ledge, lullaby spreading) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to love beyond loss. The piece resists tidy closure and embraces complexity through the doomsday frame. Subtext operates in gesture (pressing the pane, the "warmth" answering) and avoids explaining itself. The conceptual cost is legible: accepting the end while ensuring memory persists. Minor deduction for reliance on abstract vocabulary ("nested patterns," "ripple") that occasionally substitutes for concrete dramatic particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person-limited on Mira; no head-hopping. Diction is lyric and controlled—"beautifully flawed," "bruised awe," "pane of hush"—with a distinct rhythmic texture. Perceptual signature is present (Mira senses the clock's "wobble in the stillness" like a mother senses breathing). However, elevated register persists even in peak emotional beats without variation, and some constructions lean passive or abstract ("She approaches," "Through nested patterns, Mira sends"). The voice is consistent but borders on uniformly poetic rather than modulating with pressure. Free indirect style is clean; filter verbs are sparse and voice-motivated. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically varied and imagistically dense ("sun bleeds copper," "purple bruise of dusk," "time folding into itself like origami"). Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. However, several paraphrase loops and abstract synonym chains appear: "nested patterns" recurs six times without evolving meaning; "silence and surrender," "hush," "stillness" cycle through adjacent beats; "The lighthouse doesn't warn ships. It marks the distance..." is a tell-show pairing that could be compressed. Template cadence in the final third: "She cannot save... But she can ensure... Every atom... Every scattered particle..." stacks parallel declaratives without causal linkage. Apply −0.6 for loops and template cadence touching the closure zone. No filter-verb stacks or major grammar breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of grief ritual, speculative mechanics (doomsday clock, pane of hush), and the puppet head motif offers a fresh angle on "mother mourning child." The lighthouse-as-metaphysical-boundary and "nested patterns" frame feel purposeful but border on familiar SFF lyric templates. Emotional specificity (the lullaby, the crack in the puppet head) grounds the abstraction. The piece commits fully to its premise without retreat, and the final image—song persisting in scattered atoms—is non-obvious. However, the "doomsday clock adjuster" role and "time's final ripple" lean on stock apocalyptic imagery without transforming it through verifiable world detail or a surprising moral calculus. Transformation is partial; the core remains recognizably template-adjacent.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira (doomsday clock adjuster) is present throughout and makes the key choice to vouchsafe the lullaby rather than merely adjust the clock. Setup is immediate (title, first paragraph). Development: she senses the discordance, approaches the pane, presses the puppet head. Payoff: she sings the lullaby and places the puppet head as offering, shifting the clock "deeper." The role shapes her unique access (she can adjust time) and her final stance (witness, not savior). However, the "adjuster" mechanics remain abstract; we never see her adjust tactically before the climax, so the role functions more as lyric frame than causal lever. Two beats (sensing discordance, performing the ritual) plus closure linkage, but swappability is moderate—another liminal role (lighthouse keeper, time custodian) could serve similarly. Causal pressure is present but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The broken puppet head appears early (in pocket, first third), is handled in two distinct beats (lifted and pressed to pane, then placed on ledge as offering), and charges the final image with its "beautifully flawed" crack catching light. The crack's symbolic weight ("like the universe itself, like love that persists beyond reason") ties to theme without forcing. Closure linkage is strong: the placement reweights prior grief as witness. Setup, development (handling), and payoff all present. Causal pressure is moderate—it enables Mira's emotional focus but does not constrain tactics or alter options mechanically. Specificity is high (the crack, Celeste's favorite toy). Slight swappability: another personal relic could serve, though the "beautifully flawed" crack is well-integrated. Strong ~7.0 integration with closure charge pushing it slightly higher.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "pane of hush" is introduced early (lantern room, first third) and is the physical site of the climax: Mira presses her palm and the puppet head against it, whispers through it, and feels the answering warmth. It is described as "not glass, not liquid, not light. Something older" and functions as the boundary between now and never. Setup, development (Mira approaches and interacts), and payoff (the lullaby passes through, the pane trembles) are all present. The concept shapes the peak action—vouchsafing requires the pane—and its unique properties (membrane, permeable to memory/song) matter. However, the mechanics remain abstract; we are told it works through "nested patterns" but never see Mira navigate a tactical constraint it imposes. It is present and causal but not irreplaceable—another metaphysical threshold could substitute. Strong setup and closure linkage lift it above mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Beautifully flawed" is applied to the puppet head's crack and linked thematically to "the universe itself" and "love that persists beyond reason." It appears early and recurs at closure ("The crack catches the dying light"). However, it functions as descriptive label and theme marker rather than a trait that constrains or enables action with cost. The flaw does not alter Mira's tactics or create a visible tradeoff; it is symbolic resonance only. Setup is present, but development and causal payoff are absent. The attribute enhances tone and theme but remains ornamental to plot pressure. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development and swappability; minor positive lift for thematic coherence and closure reprise.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Vouchsafe" (to entrust the silence with a message) is Mira's explicit motivation and the action that defines the climax: she presses the puppet head to the pane, whispers "I remember," and sings the lullaby to send it across time. Setup is clear by mid-story ("she wants to vouchsafe something across the barrier"). Development: she lifts the puppet head and presses it to the pane. Payoff: the message is transmitted, the pane trembles, the clock shifts deeper, and the lullaby spreads "through nested patterns." The action drives the peak turn and is irreplaceable—no other verb captures the ritual's blend of trust, gift, and transmission. Causal pressure is strong: the choice to vouchsafe rather than merely adjust redefines Mira's relationship to her role and her daughter's memory. Visible cost: she accepts she cannot save the world, only witness. Strong integration across all three gates with high specificity and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Through nested patterns" is the method by which Mira adjusts the clock and sends the lullaby. It is introduced early ("nested patterns of grief and duty," then visualized as "time folding into itself like origami"). Development: "Through nested patterns, Mira sends her adjustments" and later "spreading through nested patterns like light through water." Payoff: the lullaby reaches "every moment Celeste ever lived" via this mechanism. Setup, development, and payoff are all present. However, the method remains abstract and unexplained; we are told it works but never see its mechanics constrain or enable a tactical choice. It functions as lyric motif rather than causal lever. The phrase recurs but does not evolve or impose friction. Swappability is moderate—"through quantum echoes" or "across temporal threads" could substitute. Present across beats and tied to closure, but the lack of concrete constraint or cost limits integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The "hidden lighthouse at dusk" is established in the opening line and frames the entire piece. Setup is immediate. The lighthouse "exists across the hush of time's final ripple" and "doesn't warn ships" but "marks the distance between now and never," anchoring the speculative stakes. Mira climbs the spiral stairs to the lantern room (spatial detail) and the lighthouse beam awakens at closure, "cutting through dusk toward futures that may never arrive." The setting is thematically charged and provides the unique space (lantern room, pane of hush) where the climax occurs. However, the lighthouse itself does not constrain Mira's choices or supply resources that alter outcome; it is the stage rather than a lever. Dusk is present throughout (tone, sensory anchor) but does not tighten decisions. Strong thematic and atmospheric integration with closure linkage, but limited causal pressure or tactical constraint. Micro-setting (pane, lantern room) functions more actively than the lighthouse frame itself.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Across the hush of time's final ripple" describes the lighthouse's temporal location and the condition under which Mira operates ("moments pool and eddy rather than march"). It appears early and recurs thematically ("time moves strangely here," "seven years ago, or seven centuries"). The timeframe is tied to Mira's ability to adjust the clock and her perception of time as non-linear. However, it does not tighten decisions or impose a live clock that alters tactics. There is no countdown or urgency; "tonight feels different" is asserted but not dramatized through time pressure. The phrase is present in setup and thematic throughout, but development (middle constraint) and causal payoff are weak. It enriches atmosphere and world logic but remains abstract and passive. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development; slight lift for thematic coherence and world-building contribution.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira's motivation—"to whisper a lullaby across a thousand lifetimes"—is signaled explicitly mid-story ("Her motivation crystallizes in the sound") and drives the climax. Setup: grief for Celeste, the broken puppet head, taking the lighthouse role "to stay close to the wound." Development: she lifts the puppet head, presses it to the pane, and begins the lullaby. Payoff: the lullaby is sent, the pane answers with warmth, and Mira's stance crystallizes as witness rather than savior. The desire is dramatized in action (singing, pressing) and the cost is visible (acceptance that she cannot save the world, only ensure memory persists). Internal friction is present: "wants more than adjustment" shows escalation from duty to personal need. The motivation is specific, irreplaceable, and shapes the final image (lullaby spreading through nested patterns). Strong integration across all three gates with causal pressure and felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Bruised awe" is invoked explicitly in the penultimate paragraph ("She stands in bruised awe of what remains possible") and pervades the piece through diction and imagery: "sun bleeds copper," "purple bruise of dusk," "beautifully flawed," tenderness coexisting with apocalypse. The tone is coherent from opening ("maps forget to mark," "edge of the world's last exhale") through turns (the pane trembles, warmth answers) and modulates appropriately—wonder tempered by grief, reverence without sentimentality. Setup is immediate via voice and imagery. Development: tone remains stable through the ritual beats, supporting rather than undermining pressure. Payoff: "bruised awe" is named and then demonstrated in the final lines (stars hesitate, sea forgets to crash, "tenderness" and "witness" rather than salvation). The tone charges the final image and aligns with the Charged Poise closure. No tonal breaks or false notes. Strong coherence and modulation with explicit closure linkage; the naming risks didacticism but the prior imagery earns it.</comment>
