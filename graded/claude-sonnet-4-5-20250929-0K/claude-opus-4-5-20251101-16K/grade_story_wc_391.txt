<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sera's interior landscape is vivid and embodied—"rage she has learned to compress into something harder and more useful than flame"—but the piece lacks on-page micro-choices under immediate pressure. Her brother's death and her patient methodology are told rather than tested in scene. The final watch of messengers is observation without a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost, leaving agency implied rather than dramatized. Internal contradiction exists (fire vs. patience) but does not create competing impulses within a single beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The closure crystallizes a Charged Poise—Sera's revolutionary patience poised against spring's inevitable thaw—and the lens (Accumulative/Textural) holds through density, cadence, and the glacier metaphor's reweighting. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening. Cost is felt in Alek's death and the three-year wait, though the final image does not show a new forfeit on the page. The connective tissue is causal enough (ice → routes → signal → villages stop) to support the accumulative deepening, but one more on-page micro-reversal would lift this into high-8s.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct are concrete, vivid, and purposeful. The ice "groans" with "restrained wildness" charges the final image and mirrors Sera's interior state without forced symbolism. The viaduct's rain-charged disruption of compasses constrains regime movement and opens tactical windows. Spatial choreography is clean; sensory detail (visual silver, auditory groaning) is selective and filtered through Sera's professional lens as a mapper.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—enabling a patient revolution by mapping safe routes—is signaled early and tightens through the moon-path calculation and signal deployment. Escalation reads as accumulative deepening (three winters of learning → viaduct timing → signal sent) rather than causal reversal, which fits the chosen lens. However, Sera's agency at closure is delivery of a message, not a choice that forecloses a live option with on-page cost. The villages' unyoking is set in motion but not dramatized, so the cost remains prospective rather than paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the glacier metaphor and the patient/impatient dialectic without moralizing. The final image—ice singing under the rising sun, "holding everything in balance until the moment of breaking"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how resistance reshapes power. The unyoking concept (stop feeding the machine) is concrete and specific. Minor slip: "the horizons have shifted while they were looking elsewhere" edges toward thematic summary in the penultimate paragraph, though the final beat recovers with image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is distinct, controlled, and poetic without obscuring clarity: "vigilant horizon mapper," "sculpt patience from impatience." Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Diction remains consistent and elevated yet character-specific. The metaphoric density (fire/ice, glacier, horizon) is purposeful and taught early. Reflection anchors in present stimuli (the ice, the basalt, the moon) and tilts stance. Minor issue: "the method she has refined across countless clear nights" is told exposition rather than shown through a beat, but it does not flatten the voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift. Information density is high, and most lines do multiple jobs. However, several beats loop or paraphrase: "The ice groans… vast power held barely in check" is restated as "That tension lives in her too" within two sentences. "After the lake freezes over" / "three winters here" / "every season since" recycles temporal anchors without adding pressure. Filter verbs ("She thinks of Alek") in a reflective beat are acceptable but stack slightly. No catastrophic artifacts, but cumulative minor redundancy and one mixed metaphor ("frozen flames") keep this out of high-8s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The patient-revolution-as-glacier metaphor and the magnetic viaduct detail are fresh and specific. The unyoking tactic (families simply stop) is a non-obvious synthesis. However, the horizon-mapper-vs-regime frame and the mentor-figure-in-stone-sanctuary setup echo familiar resistance narratives. Alek's death as inciting wound is archetypal. The piece transforms these tropes through lyric voice and the viaduct's physical specificity, but the emotional arc (impatience → patience, fire → ice) follows a predictable template. One bold risk: the ending trusts accumulation over confrontation, which elevates slightly within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Sera as "vigilant horizon mapper" frames her identity early and her charting work appears in multiple beats (moon paths, viaduct timing, signal preparation). However, her choices are largely off-page or preparatory; the on-page action is observation and calculation rather than a decision that alters tactics under immediate pressure. She watches messengers depart rather than making a choice that forecloses a path. Present in setup, development (calculating routes), and payoff (sending signal), but her role is more observer/facilitator than active decider at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The magnetic viaduct appears in two beats: explained as a tactical advantage (rain charges it, disrupts compasses) and invoked in the closure sequence ("the next rain"). It constrains regime movement and opens windows for villages, directly shaping the revolutionary tactic. Specificity is high (iron-stone, porous rock, eastern gorge). However, it is not handled or used on the page—only described and anticipated. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage, but no tactile dramatization of its effect in a live beat.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The patient revolution concept is signaled early ("sculpt patience from impatience"), shapes Sera's three-year methodology, and structures the unyoking tactic (villages stop rather than fight). It appears in setup, development (explaining the slow approach), and payoff (the glacier metaphor, "slow, patient, unstoppable"). The concept changes options—patience replaces Alek's failed raid—and the final image ("glacier") reweights it. However, much of this is thematic assertion rather than dramatized choice under pressure; the revolution is described more than enacted on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Softly purposeful" is applied to Sera's movements in the sanctuary and her overall methodology. It describes her deliberate preparation (gathering charts, sending signals) but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. The trait is label-plus-gesture ("movements through the sanctuary are softly purposeful, deliberate as prayer") rather than a friction that forces a trade-off. Present in setup and development, but its integration is textural rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Unyoke" is the revolution's core tactic: villages stop feeding the regime's machinery. It is explained mid-story, shapes the signal's purpose, and defines the stakes at closure (families will "unyoke" when the message arrives). The action is specific and non-obvious, and the piece commits to it thematically. However, the unyoking itself occurs off-page after the story ends; what we see on the page is the signal's dispatch, not the act itself. Strong thematic and tactical integration, but not dramatized in a live beat with immediate cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Tracking moon paths is introduced early (Sera has "refined" this method), explained in detail (lunar cycle governs patrol rotations, full/new moons reveal/conceal), and used in the closure beat ("plots the next window of darkness"). The method constrains tactics (she must wait for the right moon) and shapes the signal's timing. Specificity is high. However, the actual tracking is summary ("she has mapped the empire's heartbeat onto the sky") rather than a dramatized beat where she performs the calculation under pressure. Present in all three gates with strong causal pressure, but slightly abstract in execution.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary and frozen lake appear in setup (opening anchor), development (ice as "secret highway," learning when it will "sing warnings"), and payoff (ice groaning, messengers crossing). The lake's frozen state enables the revolutionary routes and the setting's volcanic stone/winter juxtaposition charges the fire/ice/patience motif. The ice's groan in the final beat embodies "restrained wildness." Strong micro-setting work: the lake is not backdrop but tactical resource and thematic carrier. Spatial choreography is clear and the environment directly alters what is possible.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The frozen lake timeframe is introduced early ("after the lake freezes over"), governs Sera's methodology (three winters of learning), and tightens the stakes (spring will bring thaw and change the terrain). The frozen state enables the ice roads and the timing creates urgency ("Each frozen night brings them closer"). Time is tracked and shapes tactics. However, no live countdown or immediate clock pressure forces a choice in this scene; the frame is seasonal rather than imminent. Present in all three gates with good causal integration, but the pressure is atmospheric rather than a ticking constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The motivation to "sculpt patience from impatience" is introduced via Alek's failed raid ("That night taught her the cost of impatience") and defines Sera's transformation. It shapes her three-year methodology and the glacier-over-fire choice. The friction between her burning nature and learned patience is asserted ("the burning that never fully cooled, the rage she has learned to compress") but not dramatized in a live choice under competing impulses. The conflict is told as resolved backstory rather than an active, on-page friction with cost. Present in setup, development, and thematically at payoff, but lacks immediate dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Restrained wildness is introduced in the opening ("frozen flames"), sustained through diction ("tension," "compress," "the burning that never fully cooled"), and crystallized in the closing image: "wild and restrained, holding everything in balance until the moment of breaking." The tone modulates with pressure—lyric and patient in reflection, taut in the signal dispatch—and charges the final beat. Coherent through turns, purposeful, and integral to both character and theme. The tone does not just describe; it enacts the central dialectic on the page.</comment>
