<comment>Mireth's interiority is coherent and specific—grief wants to be carried, burdens fight—but her internal conflict remains static across the piece. The woman's burden is vividly rendered through color and weight metaphors, yet she exits without complicating Mireth's stance. Mireth's final reflection on her own infinite imprisonment lands as told epiphany rather than a choice under pressure; no micro-decision alters her present options. The cost of her calling is asserted but not dramatized in a fresh choice.</comment>

<comment>Orientation is clean by the first paragraph (who, where, when). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the grotto's fractal geometry, the calcified sorrows, and the recurring motif of infinite repetition build density toward the final image. However, the closure relies on reflection rather than a fresh on-page reconfiguration; Mireth's imprisonment is stated in the opening third and restated at the end without a decisive shift in options or a new cost paid. The woman's burden is transformed but Mireth's situation does not change, and the final paragraph does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure—it summarizes what we already know. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs under the chosen lens.</comment>

<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The bronze grotto, starlight, and kerosene lamp create a vivid, recursive spatial logic that constrains Mireth's existence—she is "boundary-lessly trapped" by fractal geometry, and the description of infinite repetitions is purposeful and specific. The "whalebone cathedral" and "shingled hush" carry a consistent, voice-filtered tone. The setting does not, however, constrain a single on-page choice; Mireth moves through her ritual without spatial friction. Strong atmosphere and specificity, but the environment remains backdrop rather than active constraint at the moment of decision.</comment>

<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—Mireth's burden-weaving as both purpose and trap—is signaled early. The woman's arrival provides a concrete ritual beat, but the supplicant's sorrow is transformed without complication or resistance that narrows Mireth's options. No reversal occurs; the weaving succeeds as described, the woman leaves lighter, and Mireth returns to waiting. The final reflection on her own imprisonment does not alter tactics or foreclose a path with on-page cost; it restates her situation. Under an Accumulative lens, one meaningful tightening is required—here, the dominant stake remains static from opening to close.</comment>

<comment>The theme of infinite recursion as both gift and trap emerges organically through the grotto's fractal geometry, the calcified sorrows, and Mireth's role. The kerosene lamp and the woman's burden carry thematic weight without overt statement. However, the final paragraph edges into explicit thematic summary—"her purpose, her trap, her solace"—rather than trusting the image to resonate. The closing line "shingled hush embraced her, and she waited" offers a quiet recurrence but does not reweight prior material with fresh pressure; it circles back without advancement. Strong conceptual integration, but the ending leans on articulation rather than implication.</comment>

<comment>The voice is consistent, lyric, and controlled: "whalebone cathedral," "shingled hush," "fractal weaver" all carry a unified perceptual signature. Distance remains stable in third-limited; Mireth's interiority is clean and specific. Dialogue is minimal and functional. The prose modulates between ritual stillness and the woman's grief without losing texture. Minor slips: "Through the grotto's open ceiling, starlight poured down" briefly shifts to architectural catalog before returning to Mireth's filtered perception. Compression at closure—"her purpose, her trap, her solace"—reads as summary rather than embodied perception under pressure. Strong voice control overall, but the final beat slightly externalizes what has been shown.</comment>

<comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; figurative language (whalebone cathedral, shingled hush, calcify) is vivid and mostly coherent. However, several passages loop or paraphrase: "boundary-lessly trapped" is restated in "The grotto extended forever inward…yet its single exit remained perpetually just beyond reach" (same idea, no added pressure). "She thought of her own burden—the one that had brought her here, the one she could never weave away because she was both the weaver and the thread" rehearses the opening's thesis without advancing it. Template cadence appears in the woman's departure beat: "Her eyes remained sad, but she could stand straight now" followed by "Will it stay gone?" and then Mireth's explanation—brief but mechanical. Applying paraphrase-loop (−0.2) and minor cadence slip (−0.3). Information density is high in the ritual sequence, but the reflective passages recycle concepts.</comment>

<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The fractal-weaver premise and the bronze grotto's infinite recursion offer a fresh synthesis of fantasy archetype and spatial logic. The concept of distributing grief across infinite iterations is specific and non-obvious. However, the emotional arc follows a familiar template: the healer trapped by her gift, waiting in her timeless prison. The woman's burden is transformed without complication, and Mireth's recognition of her own trap is stated rather than earned through a fresh choice. The piece commits fully to its premise and executes it with lyric control, but the final reflection retreats to safety—Mireth's stance does not shift, and the ending recapitulates rather than transforms. Elevated by conceptual specificity; limited by conventional emotional resolution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Mireth performs the weaving ritual (middle beat) and reflects on her own imprisonment (final beat). Her choices do not create reversals; she executes her role as described. Early signal clear, two beats present, but no causal pressure—she does not face a dilemma or alter tactics. The final reflection articulates her trap but does not dramatize a new cost or choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>4.2</grade>
<comment>The kerosene lamp appears in the opening ("struck a match and watched flame catch") and once during the weaving ("passed through its flame, the heat beginning the transformation"). Two touches, but the lamp does not constrain or enable a choice; it is ritual furniture. No reweighted reprise at closure. Late middle development only, no closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>"Shingled hush" is introduced early as layered quiet and recurs at the end ("The shingled hush embraced her"). The concept frames the atmosphere and modulates with the woman's arrival, adding pressure through sensory specificity. It does not, however, constrain a choice or alter tactics. Strong lyric reprise that reweights tone at closure, but no causal pressure. Two gates (setup, payoff) plus charged reprise.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>"Boundary-lessly trapped" is introduced early and shapes Mireth's situation throughout: the grotto's fractal exit that remains "one more chamber away" and her recognition at the end that she "could walk for eternity and never leave." The trait constrains her existence conceptually and charges the final reflection. It does not, however, enable or foreclose an on-page choice with immediate cost—it remains descriptive rather than causal. Three gates (setup, middle exposition, payoff), but swappable with similar infinite-prison metaphors.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>"Calcify" is signaled early ("she felt it calcify"), dramatized in the weaving beat ("woven burden hardened in her hands, transforming from fluid anguish into solid stone"), and the calcified sorrows return at closure ("surrounded by calcified sorrows"). The action defines the weaving's outcome and charges the final image with accumulated weight. Three gates, two beats, closure linkage strong. High irreplaceability—removing "calcify" would break the story's central transformation logic. Minor deduction: the action succeeds without complication, so causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>"By orienting properly" appears once in the middle beat: "Kneel here. By orienting properly, I can draw it from you." The method is dramatized (the woman faces the depths), and the mechanics matter—burdens fall inward toward infinity. However, the method does not complicate the weaving or create friction; it is executed as described. One beat, middle development, no closure participation. Functional but replaceable with similar ritual logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The bronze grotto is introduced immediately and provides spatial logic throughout: the fractal repetitions, the open ceiling admitting starlight, the bronze walls that multiply illuminations. The setting constrains Mireth's existence (infinite recursion) and charges the final image ("surrounded by calcified sorrows and the endless bronze repetitions of herself"). Three gates, strong closure linkage. The grotto does not, however, alter tactics in the middle beat—Mireth weaves as planned. High specificity and closure charge, but moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<grade>3.1</grade>
<comment>"After the first snowmelt" anchors the opening and implies seasonal renewal, but the timeframe does not constrain or pressure any choice. The ritual unfolds without a clock or seasonal deadline. Setup only; no middle or closure participation. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>"To collect the weights of different burdens" is dramatized in the weaving beat and reflected upon at closure ("To free others, she had traded her own freedom"). The motivation drives the ritual and frames Mireth's trap. However, no friction between wants and costs is dramatized on the page—Mireth accepts the woman's burden without hesitation, and her final reflection restates rather than complicates her purpose. Three gates, but told-only internal conflict; no choice under competing pressures.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>"Whalebone reverie" is introduced early ("whalebone cathedral") and recurs at closure ("the whalebone reverie of her grotto"). The tone—lyric, recursive, steeped in quiet ritual—remains coherent and modulates subtly with the woman's arrival (grief's "heavy resonance"). It charges the final image with accumulated atmosphere. Three gates, strong closure linkage. The tone does not shift decisively under pressure, remaining elegiac throughout, but the consistency serves the Accumulative lens. High specificity and irreplaceability.</comment>
