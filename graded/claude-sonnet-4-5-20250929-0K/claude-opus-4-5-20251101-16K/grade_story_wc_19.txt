<question>1</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Mira's claustrophobia and her patient corrosion of the seal demonstrate consistent interior logic and embodied struggle. Her choice to plant the vine rather than simply collect silences shows earned character movement with visible cost (leaving the safety of collection for the risk of cultivation). The doll growing heavier with silences and then lighter after the vine sprouts provides concrete emotional anchoring. Minor slip: the mother's transformation into silence feels more asserted than dramatized, weakening the causal chain slightly.</comment>

<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The piece holds an Accumulative/Textural lens throughout, building density through the collection ritual until the gilded hush triggers a Decisive Change (the vine sprouts, redefining Mira's purpose from collection to planting). Orientation anchors (bunker child, inversion hour, trellis) arrive early and remain stable. The closure delivers visible cost: Mira must now return regularly to tend growth rather than passively collect, and the doll's lightening signals irreversible transformation. One meaningful tightening occurs when the vine connects to the trellis and forces the realization about her mother.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The xenial trellis functions as micro-setting with purposeful constraint: it exists only during inversion, creating a ticking clock. The doll as recurring object charges the final image when the vine sprouts from its crack. Sensory detail (mineral quiet, feathered hush, vacuum-silence at the edge) is specific and filtered through Mira's collecting mission. The bunker's "pressed against her skin like a held breath" demonstrates embodied claustrophobia. Does not reach 9+ because the trellis itself does not constrain a mid-scene choice—it enables but does not pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (collecting the rarest silence) is signaled early and drives the ascent. The tightening occurs when the gilded hush pours into the doll and triggers the unexpected sprouting, narrowing Mira's options from passive collection to active cultivation with the cost of repeated dangerous ascents. The inversion hour provides a persistent constraint that shapes all tactics. Does not reach 8.8+ because the escalation is more conceptual repricing than tactical narrowing under pressure—the vine's appearance changes her understanding rather than forcing a hard choice between competing goods.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme (burial versus climbing, enclosure versus openness, preservation through planting) emerges organically from the bunker/trellis opposition and Mira's final choice. The doll's transformation from vessel to seed-source offers a resonant answer to "how do we preserve what we love" without stating a moral. The mother-as-silence revelation reweights prior material (the gift, the vanishing) with conceptual cost. The final image ("preserve it by letting it climb") lands as earned wisdom from specific experience rather than platitude. Minor gap: "intangibly tangible" remains more label than dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Single third-person limited POV maintains stable psychic distance and distinct perceptual signature (Mira notices silences as textures and tastes, filters all setting through claustrophobia). Diction stays consistent and purposeful: "sigh," "tendril of light," "contracted chest stretching" all reflect her sensory collecting frame. No dialogue present; none needed. Slight register wobble in "xenial" (overly Latinate for the otherwise grounded voice) and "intangibly tangible" (meta-commentary intrusion), preventing 9+ entry.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Information density is high; most lines do double work (e.g., "Objects lifted. Dust rose" both describes inversion and sets urgent tone). Rhythm varies purposefully, contracting during the ascent and expanding at the gilded hush. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor deduction for one filter-verb stack ("had modified," "had designed," "had weakened") in the lock-corrosion passage and the phrase "intangibly tangible, her mother had called them" which breaks immediacy with expository past-perfect. Figurative language (vine, silence-as-taste) remains coherent and purposeful throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of inverted gravity, atmospheric trellis, and collecting silences as textures offers a non-obvious fresh angle. The twist (mother became a silence, daughter plants rather than hoards) feels earned in hindsight and specific to this world's logic. Transformation test passes: swapping names/places would collapse the bunker-builder/claustrophobic-child irony and the trellis's hospitality theme. Does not reach 8.8+ because "collecting flavors of silence" echoes existing SFF tropes (synesthesia, intangible harvesting) without a second-order transformation, and the emotional arc (choosing growth over preservation) maps to familiar coming-of-age structure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Mira's claustrophobia and her choice to plant rather than collect create two key turns. Setup early (born in bunker, weeps in vaults). Development through patient corrosion and ascent. Payoff in final stance ("preserve it by letting it climb"). Her agency drives the ending with visible cost (must return, risk exposure). Specific irreplaceability: only a bunker-builder's child would have access to modify the seal and understand enclosure's cost deeply enough to choose openness.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The porcelain doll appears in at least four beats: clutching during ascent, pressing to silences, receiving the gilded hush, sprouting the vine. Setup (mother's last gift, holds silences). Development (grows heavier, then cracks). Payoff (vine sprouts, becomes lighter, "seemed to smile"). Causal pressure: the doll's transformation forces Mira's realization about her mother and redefines her mission. High irreplaceability: the crack (imperfection) enables the sprouting, tying the object's physical state to thematic closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The gilded hush drives the climax: Mira's goal throughout is to find it, and when she does it triggers the vine's sprouting. Setup (stories of the rarest silence). Development (seeks it at apex, half the inversion hour spent). Payoff (pours into doll, causes transformation). Moderate causal pressure: it changes her understanding but does not force a tactical choice under competing pressures. Somewhat swappable: any "rarest silence" could serve the same structural role with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>The attribute "intangibly tangible" is used as a label twice (mother's phrase, the doll holding silences) but does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost. It describes the silences' nature without forcing tradeoffs. Setup present (mother's words). Minimal development: Mira's collection relies on this property, but no scene shows her struggling with the paradox or adjusting tactics because of it. No closure participation: the vine's sprouting does not hinge on the silences being intangibly tangible specifically.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>The sprouting vine is the story's decisive change: it redefines Mira's purpose from collecting to planting and reveals her mother's fate. Setup (none, which is a purposeful surprise). Development (occurs at climax when gilded hush enters doll). Payoff (the vine "reached toward the trellis's framework" and generates new growth; Mira understands and chooses to return). High causal pressure and irreplaceability: removing "sprout" collapses the closure entirely. The action is the hinge between collection and cultivation, burial and climbing.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The method "by limiting exposure" shapes Mira's patient corrosion of the seal over time. Setup early ("limiting exposure of the lock mechanism to the moisture in her breath each day—a patient corrosion"). Development implicit: this method determines how she escapes and sets up her resourcefulness. Payoff indirect: her ability to ascend daily depends on this prior work. Moderate causal pressure: it enables the plot but does not create a mid-scene tactical constraint. Some swappability: other slow methods could replace it with edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The xenial trellis provides the location for the climax and embodies the story's hospitality theme. Setup ("structure of ancient hospitality," "during inversion, travelers from different bunkers would gather there"). Development (Mira climbs to its apex to find the gilded hush). Payoff (the vine winds through its lattice, creating new growth; the trellis becomes the planting site). Causal pressure: the trellis's height and framework enable the vine's connection. High specificity: "xenial" (hospitable) directly opposes the bunker's enclosure, charging the thematic closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>The inversion hour creates a hard time constraint that tightens all of Mira's choices. Setup ("once each day, when gravity inverted for an hour"). Development (tracked live: "inversion hour was half spent," "neared its end"). Payoff ("Gravity would soon reclaim her" forces her descent, and the daily return becomes her new mission). High causal pressure: the clock drives urgency and shapes the story's rhythm. Irreplaceability: removing the hour-limit would collapse the ticking tension and the cost of returning.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Mira's desire to collect silences drives the plot and is shown through repeated action (pressing the doll, ascending during inversion, seeking the rarest). Setup ("She came to collect the flavors of different silences"). Development (dramatized through the collecting ritual and the search for gilded hush). Payoff (the collection transforms into planting, with visible cost: she must now return to tend rather than simply gather). Moderate friction: the want itself is not conflicted—she wants to collect and succeeds—but the transformation introduces new costs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>Tone moves from constriction (bunker, "held breath," "pressed against her skin") to expansion ("contracted chest stretching," "preserve it by letting it climb"). The modulation is coherent and supports the thematic arc. Setup (claustrophobic oppression in opening). Development (breathes during ascent and trellis scenes). Payoff (the final image of climbing versus burial charges the release). Does not reach 8+ because the tonal shift is somewhat schematic (tight → open) rather than surprising, and "stretching contracted" as a phrase is more label than embodied modulation in the prose rhythm itself.</comment>
