<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera's core motivation (recovering names/memory) is established and her mechanical arm moment with the child shows past choice with cost. However, interiority leans heavily on abstract statements ("memory was not merely sentiment. It was infrastructure") rather than contradictory impulses in scene. The retrocognitive episodes are described rather than experienced with embodied sensory breakdown. The final choice to continue the work reads as continuation rather than a path-foreclosing decision with visible on-page cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors early (who/where/when within opening). Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure accumulates through the retrocognitive vision, the recovered name, and the closing image of ongoing work. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Vera places the tessera in her satchel and continues her work with the stakes and cost reweighted. The cost is conceptual (lifetimes of labor) and felt in "The work would take lifetimes. She would give it all of hers," though the before/after shift is modest—continuation rather than decisive alteration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The shattered sky, ash-stained plaza, and broken minaret create vivid post-apocalyptic atmosphere. The tessera functions as micro-setting/object that constrains her retrocognitive journey and charges the final image when placed in the satchel with hundreds of others. Sensory detail is selective (ash on tongue, warmth vs. heat distinction) and filtered through Vera's priorities. Spatial choreography is clear throughout her movement across the plaza.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recovering lost names to rebuild memory-infrastructure) is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful deepening occurs in the retrocognitive vision when Safiya's name surfaces, narrowing Vera's abstract mission to specific recovered identity. The mechanical arm detail and past rescue constrain present action (steel holds what flesh cannot). However, the escalation reads as additive example rather than a tightening that forecloses options; the ending crystallizes her commitment but doesn't dramatize a trade-off or visible price paid in this scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (memory as infrastructure, mercy as persistence) emerges from the tessera work and the steel-arm/tenderness duality without overt statement until the reflection block. The warmth/heat distinction and "aberrant mercy" phrases risk thematic echo but are grounded in Vera's specific actions (saving those who burned her books). The final image—continuing across the plaza with fragments in her satchel—offers a non-literal answer to what rebuilding requires. The Safiya vision particularizes the abstract mission, though the closing paragraph edges toward summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (librarian-turned-arsonist diction, focus on names and history). Psychic distance is consistent. However, elevated register occasionally clashes with urgency ("aberrant mercy," "infrastructure," "renaming") in a way that feels authorial rather than Vera-specific under crisis. The single whispered line "I see you" carries goal and subtext effectively. Free indirect style is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with purposeful imagery (shattered sky, tessera, steel arm). However, several phrases loop conceptually: "broken" appears in multiple forms (broken plaza, shattered sky, broken present), and the warmth/heat distinction is stated then re-explained. Template cadence is mild but present in the reflection block ("To rebuild...you needed to know...You needed to cradle"). The "dangerous in her softness, revolutionary in her refusal" and "memory was not merely sentiment. It was infrastructure" read as thematic statements rather than discoveries. Information density is moderate; some lines restate rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The retrocognitive-trauma mechanic and post-apocalyptic name-recovery mission offer a fresh angle. The steel-arm/tenderness synthesis and the warmth-vs-heat distinction are specific to this story. However, the librarian-radical archetype and the "gentle revolutionary" frame are familiar, and the core emotional arc (continuing difficult memorial work) doesn't transform the premise through unexpected cost or turn. The Safiya vision provides one particularized beat, but the overall shape follows a contemplative-continuation template without sharp risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Vera ("gentle radical") is the protagonist and her decision to continue the work shapes the ending. However, her radical mercy is told in backstory (saving the child, sheltering condemners) rather than tested in this scene. The on-page choice is to place the tessera and walk on—continuation rather than a turn that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tessera appears early (plaza's heart), is handled in the retrocognitive vision (grows warm, triggers Safiya's memory), and placed in the satchel at closure, reweighting its meaning from isolated chip to named fragment among hundreds. It constrains the retrocognitive process and charges the final image. Present across setup, development, and payoff with evolving use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Aberrant mercy" is named explicitly and exemplified in backstory (saving those who condemned her), but it does not shape an on-page tactical choice or create a visible trade-off in this scene. It functions more as thematic label than a pressure that alters options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Retrocognitively trapped" is introduced early, constrains her touch (every surface might pull her backward), and enables the Safiya vision. The cost is described (drowning in others' memories) and shapes her careful handling of the tessera. However, the tradeoff is told rather than dramatized with visible consequence in this moment—she completes the vision without struggle or loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Rename" (finding lost names) is Vera's mission, drives the tessera investigation, and culminates in whispering "Safiya" and adding her to the chronicle. It frames the stakes and the ending continuation. However, the renaming itself is a single instance without opposition or cost visible on the page; the action could be "remember" or "record" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Via the chipped patterns on a mosaic stepping stone" is signaled early (she walks across mosaic stepping stones, examines the tessera's patterns) and the patterns trigger the retrocognitive vision. The method matters to the mechanics, though the exact phrase "chipped patterns" is more atmospheric than functionally distinct—any fragment could serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The "ancient plaza beneath a shattered sky" anchors every beat, pressures the work (ash, broken stones), and supplies the tessera resource. The shattered-sky image recurs and charges the closing lines. The setting is present across setup, development, and payoff, shaping Vera's physical journey and the apocalyptic stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"After the great fire" establishes the post-catastrophe timeframe and motivates the recovery work. However, it functions as backdrop rather than live pressure—no urgency or ticking consequence tightens Vera's choices in this scene. The "lifetimes" mention at the end expands rather than compresses time.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To cradle empathy in arms of steel" is dramatized through the mechanical-arm backstory (sacrificed to save the child) and the tessera handling, and it articulates the core want. However, the motivation is more explained than tested—no on-page friction between empathy and the cost of protecting it emerges in this scene. The want drives continuation but not a conflicted choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Warm coldness" is made explicit in the warmth/heat distinction ("Heat had destroyed everything. Warmth might yet restore it") and sustained in the cold plaza where Vera's gesture blooms warmth. The tone modulates from broken desolation to tentative restoration and charges the final image of her walking on. However, the overt statement of the distinction reduces its tonal subtlety.</comment>
