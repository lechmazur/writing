<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Miriam's motivation is clear—grief transformed into music—and her final choice to play the encore is earned by the thirty-year setup. However, interiority leans heavily on abstraction ("steely longing," "strategically creative") rather than embodied contradiction in the moment. The anniversary clock's frozen time and her decision to "rewrite the ending" provide stakes, but the climactic beat relies on metaphor more than visceral internal conflict. The renunciation of return to the empty station carries cost, though it arrives through declaration more than dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The piece infers an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered images (compasses, clock, clouds) and cadence shifts toward the encore. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid)—Miriam chooses to remain, the clock restarts, and she commits to music against silence. Cost is felt (she stays in the arbor rather than descending permanently) and the final image reweights prior material. Orientation anchors early (arbor, pianist, film-reel passage), and the lens holds. One meaningful deepening occurs when the clock chimes and the arbor halts, altering her trajectory.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The tidal arbor is vividly rendered—clouds pooling like ocean tides, floating lattices, woven wood—and the setting constrains choice: the arbor descends at nightfall, imposing a time limit. The piano materializes each evening, the compasses respond to intention, and the station below provides spatial contrast. The clock on the piano's edge and the compasses glowing at closure charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Miriam's grief and purpose.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Miriam's choice to make music against silence and rewrite her grief—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the arbor halts its descent and the clock chimes, narrowing her options to either return or remain. The encore is an act of agency, though the pressure is more accumulative than causally escalated. Cost is legible: she stays in the arbor, choosing music over the empty station. However, the turn relies on metaphor (clock hands reaching, compasses pointing upward) more than concrete tactical friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars—music as defiance of silence, love outliving time—without overt statement. The broken clock's restart and the compasses' reorientation offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question: can grief be transformed into purpose? The final image ("direction was never about geography") reweights prior material without moralizing. Subtext operates in the anniversary clock, the film-reel passage, and the encore as unplanned surprise. Minor slip: "Some encores are worth more than the original performance" edges toward thematic summary, though it remains image-anchored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, anchored in Miriam's perceptual signature: "strategically creative," finding harmonies in discord, composing silent music. Voice is distinct—elegiac, textured with figurative language ("wound in reality," "clouds pooled like ocean tides")—and modulates under pressure without head-hopping. Psychic distance tightens at the encore. Minor register drift: "steely longing" and "strategically creative" feel slightly elevated for peak beats, though they remain voice-motivated. No dialogue, so dialogue bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere or character. However, figurative language appears in nearly every sentence ("dream refusing to dissolve," "wound in reality," "clouds pooled like ocean tides"), creating density that occasionally slows momentum. Mixed metaphor risk: "The tidal arbor rose… like a dream" mixes liquid and ethereal vehicles without clear coherence. Template cadence in the middle third: "She had until… That was the rule… But tonight was different" feels scaffolded. No paraphrase loops, but the overwriting check triggers a −0.5 deduction for figurative saturation in high-pressure beats without clear pattern payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The arbor-above-clouds and film-reel portal offer fresh synthesis, and the broken clock restarting through music is specific. However, the core arc—grief transformed into purpose through art—is familiar, and the piece does not fully transform it through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The compasses and tidal arbor are vivid but function more as atmosphere than as constraints that alter tactics. Risk-taking in figurative density is present but does not heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. Mid-band: fresh inflections without full transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Miriam appears early, frames expectation, and her choice to play the encore drives the climax and closure. She is present across all three gates (setup, development, payoff) and her decision alters the arbor's descent. Two distinct beats: discovering the arbor, playing the encore. Causal pressure is moderate—her intention steadies the compasses, her music halts the descent—but the work is more atmospheric than tactically constrained. Closure linkage is strong; she remains in the arbor. Score: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.2, minus late-middle development −0.3 and swappability −0.5 (another musician could occupy the role with minor edits). Band ~6.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The clock appears early (frozen at 11:47), is carried to the piano, and restarts at the climax—present in setup, development, and payoff. Three distinct beats: introduction, placement on piano, chiming and restarting. Causal pressure: its restart halts the arbor's descent. Closure linkage is decisive; the clock ticking "keeping time with her heart" charges the final image. Specificity is high: 11:47, thirty years, anniversary context. Cost connection: the clock's frozen state embodies her grief; its restart reweights loss into purpose. Score: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.7, cost connection +0.5, minus minor swappability −0.2 (another memento could serve with edits). Band ~7.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Compasses appear early, respond to Miriam's intention (steadying when she understands purpose, pointing upward at the encore), and are present in setup and payoff. Two distinct beats: initial spinning, final glow and upward pointing. Causal pressure is moderate—they signal her shift but do not constrain choice. Closure linkage: they glow at the ending, participating in the final image. However, they could be replaced with another intentional object (e.g., wind chimes, lights) without breaking logic. Score: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.6, closure linkage +1.0, minus swappability −0.8 and lack of mid-scene constraint −0.5. Band ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Strategically creative" is introduced early and described (finding harmonies in discord, building melodies from spaces), but it functions as characterization label more than on-page constraint. It does not enable or constrain a specific action with visible cost; Miriam's piano playing is the action, but the trait is told rather than shown through a tactical tradeoff. Present in setup and payoff but not developed in the middle. Score: early signal +0.4, one beat (playing the encore) +0.4, closure linkage +0.8, minus label-only use −0.7, swappability −0.6 (another musical trait could serve), summary-only −0.5. Band ~4.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Refuge is introduced early (Miriam finds the arbor through the film reel) and shapes the entire premise: the arbor is where she escapes to play. Present in setup, development (she returns each evening), and payoff (she chooses to remain). Two beats: initial discovery, final choice to stay. Causal pressure: the refuge provides the piano and the rule (descends at night). Closure linkage: her decision to remain rather than return to the station is the climax. However, "refuge" is somewhat generic—another safe space could serve with edits. Score: early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.3, minus swappability −0.7. Band ~6.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The film-reel method is introduced early and provides the portal to the arbor. Present in setup (she discovers and steps through) but absent in development and payoff—it does not constrain her later choices or return with reweighted meaning. One beat: the initial passage. No causal pressure in the middle or ending; Miriam's actions in the arbor do not depend on the film reel's mechanics. Score: early signal +0.5, one beat +0.4, minus missing development and payoff gates (caps at ~4.6), late-breaking absence −0.4, ornamental use −0.6. Band ~5.3, lifted slightly by setup strength.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tidal arbor is introduced early, provides vivid micro-setting (clouds, lattices, piano), and constrains choice: it descends at nightfall, imposing a time limit. Present in setup, development (she plays each evening), and payoff (the arbor halts its descent). Three beats: arrival, nightly descent rule, halted descent at closure. Causal pressure: the setting's rule forces urgency; the arbor's halt is the climactic turn. Closure linkage: the arbor's pause charges the final image. Specificity is high (tidal, above clouds, woven wood). Score: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.6, minus minor swappability −0.4 (another magical space could serve). Band ~7.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The timeframe ("until the horizon invites night") is introduced early and imposes a deadline: the arbor descends when dusk arrives. Present in setup and payoff (night arrives, the arbor halts). Two beats: the rule is stated, the deadline is reached at the encore. Causal pressure is moderate—the timeframe tightens urgency but is not tracked sentence-by-sentence. Closure linkage: night's arrival is the moment of the arbor's halt. However, the deadline is somewhat abstract; the story does not show Miriam racing the clock tactically. Score: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.7, closure linkage +1.1, minus abstract tracking −0.5, swappability −0.4 (another time limit could serve). Band ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation to "surprise fate with an unplanned encore" is stated explicitly and drives Miriam's climactic choice to play. Present in setup ("tonight was different"), development (she approaches the piano with this intent), and payoff (she plays the encore). Two beats: the intention is formed, the encore is performed. Causal pressure: her intent steadies the compasses and shapes the music. Closure linkage: the encore is the climax. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized through conflicting wants; the cost (remaining in the arbor vs. returning) is implied rather than fought over in scene. Score: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.3, minus summary-only friction −0.5, told-only internal conflict −0.6. Band ~6.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Steely longing" is introduced early ("steely longing she'd carried for three decades") and modulates through the piece: grief tempered by loss, urgency at the encore, resolution in the final image. Present in setup and payoff, less visible in development. Tone is coherent and charges the final image ("the love that outlives every frozen clock"). Two beats: initial description, final image. However, "steely longing" is label-heavy and could be replaced with another bittersweet register (e.g., "fierce ache," "unyielding yearning") without breaking logic. Score: early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, minus label-only use −0.5, swappability −0.6, static middle −0.3. Band ~6.3.</comment>
