<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority carries specificity—"empty enough to carry it," her learned "sideways" observation, the "fractured lullaby" voice. Internal contradiction surfaces when she's "dreamless" yet carries others' dreams, though the stakes of this split never fully dramatize a difficult choice on the page. Motivation crystallizes during her first month (told rather than shown), and the final vigil reads as endurance without visible cost that forecloses a path. Embodied emotion is spare; the wrist-touch and breath at the door offer texture, but high-stakes moments lean toward poetic summary rather than contradictory impulse acting in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening paragraph. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers image, reflection, and spatial superposition toward a final reprise that reweights "midnight" and "possibilities multiplied." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Mira returns to her vigil, the chess clock stays frozen, and the archive's potential endures. Cost is conceptual and felt (dreamlessness, endless midnight) but remains oblique; the final image recharges prior motifs without a sharp before/after choice that narrows options on the page. One meaningful deepening (her first-month vision of branching threads) coheres under the lens, though the turn is recounted rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The glowing dune, freight car, and crystalline archive anchor space and mood. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "air that tasted of salt and pollen," flowers "fierce luminescence," bare black mountains with returning moss. The chess clock functions as micro-setting, handled twice (wrist-touch, final mention) and charging the closure image. Setting subtly mirrors interiority (soft reality, tangled time-garden) without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is clean across the freight car, dune, and superposition visions. The world rules (wave functions, divergent memory) stay consistent and are shown through action rather than exposition.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—cultivate sparks in unlit corners—is signaled early and accumulates through her archive work. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens via density increase (the archive's vision, coordinate collection, the dune's fierce bloom), yet no single on-page choice narrows options or forces a trade-off with visible cost. Mira's agency is attention and whispered inquiry rather than decision; the ending returns to vigil without a dramatized reversal or tightening that forecloses a path. One deepening (her motivation crystallization) is recounted in summary, not tested in scene. The piece meets the lens's requirements for coherent pressure but lacks escalation through protagonist choice that alters tactics or stakes on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—time as garden, endings as beginnings, potential over closure—emerges through the chess clock, divergent archive, and superposition imagery. The final image (possibilities like unborn stars) offers a resonant answer without stating a moral, and the midnight motif reweights across the piece. Subtext operates in gesture (the wrist-touch, sideways looking) and implication. One slip: "that some endings were also beginnings" edges toward explicit theme statement in the fourth paragraph, though it's anchored to the chess clock rather than free-floating. The piece resists tidy resolution and invites reflection on cultivation versus possession, though the thematic question never faces a concrete on-page test that generates ambiguity or counter-reading.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and apt; distance modulates with Mira's superposition experiences without head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct: "sideways" looking, "fractured lullaby" voice, specificity in crystalline lattice and wave function vocabulary. Diction matches a guard who has learned scientific idiom through proximity. One dialogue line ("Tell me where to look…") carries subtext and goal pursuit. Psychic distance shifts (the "occasionally everywhere" moments) are intentional and voice-motivated. Minor register elevation ("cultivate the sparks," "consensus reality") fits the lyric-philosophical mode without jarring. No filter-verb stacks or POV leakage; the voice remains singular and controlled under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual breath. Information density is high: most lines layer action, image, and interiority. Clarity holds across complex constructions (superposition, divergent archive), and figurative language (time as garden, dune as sleeping beast) is coherent. Two frictions: "She was occasionally everywhere" in paragraph four uses passive phrasing that slightly dulls immediacy, and "Some nights, Mira was occasionally everywhere" then "occasionally—she found a thread" creates a synonym-loop effect across adjacent paragraphs. One paraphrase loop: paragraphs nine and ten both describe her learning to look sideways and charm information, restating the method without added pressure. No scaffold or template cadence; grammar and tense are clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic setting, quantum superposition, and dreamless archivist offers a fresh angle. The chess clock as both mourning object and time-as-garden emblem, the glowing dune's phosphorescent bloom, and wave-function memory feel specific rather than stock. Risk: the lyric-philosophical voice and accumulative structure heighten stakes without obscuring clarity. One derivative friction: the "post-catastrophe wanderer seeks hidden hope" frame echoes widely used templates; transformation arises through quantum mechanics vocabulary and the dreamless-guard inversion, yet the emotional arc (endurance, vigil, no decisive cost) remains familiar. The final image (possibilities like stars) is evocative but not entirely non-obvious. Transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on the specific divergent archive and superposition mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mira appears throughout and her choices (opening the door, whispering coordinates, collecting wave functions) advance the plot. Missing middle development: no single choice in the middle narrows options or alters tactics with visible cost. Closure participation is observational (returns to vigil) rather than decisively active. Early signal and beat involvement lift the score; lack of on-page cost and swappability (another contemplative guard could function similarly) cap it.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The chess clock is handled twice (wrist-touch in paragraph three, heavy on wrist in paragraph eleven) and returns with reweighted meaning in the final section ("Midnight endured"). Setup is early; development is symbolic rather than tactically constraining; closure linkage is present but ornamental (the clock does not drive the final action). The metaphor (midnight as death/birth) charges theme but does not narrow on-page choices. Lyric reprise lifts the score into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The divergent archive shapes stakes (contains branching possibilities) and tactics (Mira learns to look sideways, whisper coordinates, charm without collapsing wave functions). Setup is immediate (paragraph two); development spans multiple beats (her learning, the archive's vision, coordinate collection); closure participation is direct (possibilities multiply in the archive). Causal pressure is moderate: the archive enables her work but does not impose a sharp constraint or tradeoff. Specificity is high (crystalline lattice, quantum measurement, superpositions). Removing it would break story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Occasionally everywhere" appears in paragraph four ("Mira was occasionally everywhere") and is demonstrated through superposition experiences (standing at archive heart and freight door, later on rooftop/well/cave). Setup in first third; development shows the trait enabling her search; closure reprise is absent. The trait enables rather than constrains, and no visible cost or tradeoff is tied to it on the page. Swappability is moderate: "able to perceive multiple locations" could replace it with minor edits. One distinct beat plus causal enabling lift it above ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Charm" appears in title of paragraph six ("learning to charm the archive") and is enacted through patience, whispering coordinates, and looking sideways. Setup by ~40%; development spans two beats (learning, tonight's query); closure linkage is indirect (she returns to her work, but "charm" is not named or visibly enacted in the final image). Causal pressure: the method shapes her approach but does not drive a major turn or cost. Specificity is high ("not through incantation or trickery, but through patience"). Swappability is low within the quantum-archive frame.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Wave functions" appear in paragraphs four (permit superposition), five (locate sparks), and ten (collected coordinates). Setup in first third; development in middle (the archive's method); closure participation is summary-only ("wave functions" are collected but not actively used in the final image). Causal work is moderate: the means enables her search without imposing a sharp constraint. Specificity fits the quantum premise. Swappability within the science frame is low; outside it, "through quantum sensing" could replace with edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The glowing dune opens the piece, is described in detail (phosphorescent flowers, blue-green blooms, fierce luminescence), and closes with "pink and amber light competing with the dune's own glow." Setup is immediate; development is atmospheric (Mira breathes the air, observes the bloom); closure participation is scenic rather than causal (flowers close, but this does not alter her final choice). The setting mirrors theme (new ways to bloom) but does not pressure choices or supply resources that affect outcome. Lyric early–final reprise and thematic charge lift the score; lack of tactical constraint caps it.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After the last forest burned" is stated in the opening line and referenced via bare black mountains and returning moss. Setup is immediate; development is background (the Great Burning, seven starless years); closure participation is thematic (moss returning hints at cyclical renewal) but does not tighten on-page decisions. Time is historical context rather than a live clock; no urgency or deadline narrows Mira's tactics. The frame shapes world logic and tone but is swappable with another post-catastrophe marker. One beat of causal coloring (the chess clock stopped at the Burning) adds specificity.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Motivation is declared in paragraph seven ("To cultivate the sparks in the unlit corners") and dramatized through her work (whispering coordinates, collecting wave functions, tonight's query). Setup by ~40%; development spans two beats (her first-month crystallization, tonight's search); closure linkage is present (she collects coordinates, returns to vigil). Friction: the motivation is recounted in summary ("her motivation had crystallized") rather than shown through a difficult choice with competing wants. Cost is conceptual (dreamlessness) but not tested in a trade-off on the page. The motivation drives action but lacks on-page conflict between desire and price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Fractured lullaby" is named in paragraph ten ("Her voice was a fractured lullaby") and coheres through lyric diction, elliptical phrasing, and accumulative rhythm. The tone modulates with pressure (quiet vigil, fierce bloom, superposition wonder, returning calm) without breaking. Setup is mid-piece but retains consistency from the opening's poetic cadence. Development is textural; closure participation is strong (the final paragraph's rhythm and the lullaby quality charge the "possibilities multiplied like stars" image). No single static mood; the tone reweights the dominant stake (endurance, potential) with felt pressure. Specificity and closure linkage elevate; late naming and lack of sharp contrast under peak stress temper.</comment>
