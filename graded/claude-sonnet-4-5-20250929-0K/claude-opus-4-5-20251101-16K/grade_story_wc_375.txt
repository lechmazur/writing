<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivations are clearly signaled and her interior life is concrete, with the fifteen-year accounting detour establishing stakes. The breakthrough feels earned through prior causality—grandmother's note, hidden works, her own deferred dreams. However, the emotional arc follows a predictable redemption template: suppressed artist rediscovers calling. The final commitment lacks a visible present-scene cost; she decides to exhibit but we don't see what she forfeits now.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal with Accumulative texturing. Orientation anchors cleanly (who/where/when by paragraph two). The broken lock → knife workaround → journal discovery → decision to exhibit forms a clear because/therefore chain. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (resolve to uncork suppressed work) with conceptual cost (grandmother's wasted talent, Mira's fifteen lost years). The cost is legible but muted; the ending tilts toward declaration rather than on-page forfeiture of a live option.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The crystal cave is vivid, purposeful, and charges the final image—bioluminescent fungi casting "auroral light born underground" mirrors the grief-to-hope transformation. Spatial choreography is clean (alcove, wall, hollow). The broken lock's uselessness and the sketching knife both constrain action. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mira's artist priorities (charcoal stains, quartz formations, mineral dust). The cave functions as both memory-anchor and thematic container.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reclaim artistic calling) is signaled early and tightens through discovery of grandmother's suppressed work. The broken lock forces improvisation with the sketching knife—a micro-reversal that narrows tactics. Agency is clear: Mira chooses to exhibit both portfolios. However, escalation is accumulative (journal revelations deepen resolve) rather than a sharpening dilemma. The cost is deferred; no on-page price paid for the commitment itself, only the historical cost acknowledged.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (the cost of suppressing creative calling) emerges organically from grandmother's hidden portfolio and Mira's accounting years without sermonizing. The final image—"sorrow transforming slowly into light"—offers a resonant answer grounded in particulars (charcoal-stained fingers, crystal refraction, the journal against her chest). The grandmother's note avoids platitude by rooting wisdom in specific regret. Minor slip: "inescapable calling" and "compulsion to create" hover near prompt-label territory but stay dramatized through the lockbox and journal.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV distance is stable; third-limited access to Mira's perceptions is clean throughout. Diction is consistently elevated and purposeful ("auroral sorrow," "prismatic whispers," "patient as crystal growth") without register breaks. Perceptual signature reflects an artist's eye (tracing seams, seeing shadows as alive). No dialogue on the page to evaluate. Psychic distance modulates naturally from close interiority to wider reflection. The prose rhythms match emotional intensity, tightening during the lock-opening, expanding in the final paragraph's resolution.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs. However, figurative language clusters densely in non-peak beats: "auroral light born underground," "memories like pressed flowers," "crystalline silence," "prismatic whispers" within a short span risk overwriting. Two minor paraphrase loops: "this compulsion to create that the world calls impractical" echoes "creativity was a luxury she couldn't afford" without added pressure. The "auroral sorrow" coinage in the grandmother's letter feels planted to service the tone requirement. No major artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The suppressed-artist-rediscovering-calling premise is familiar, and while the subterranean gallery twist adds specificity, the emotional arc follows a well-worn template. The broken lock detail is fresh (mechanism shattered, combination irrelevant), and the sketching knife repurposed as lockpick shows ingenuity. The bioluminescent cave setting is vivid but serves primarily as atmospheric backdrop. Transformation test marginal: swap "artist/accountant" for "musician/lawyer" and the core beats hold. No bold structural risk; the narrative follows a linear discover-decide path.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and her choices drive key turns: retrieving the sketching knife, working the lock, deciding to exhibit. Her artist's eye informs how she studies the lockbox and interprets her grandmother's work. The charcoal-stained fingers anchor her identity in the opening and closing beats. However, "portrait sketch artist" is mentioned but not causally tested; the specific medium doesn't constrain action—any visual artist would function identically here.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The broken combination lock appears in two functionally distinct beats: discovery (mechanism shattered, combination useless) and the workaround with the sketching knife. Its brokenness directly shapes tactics—she can't use the memorized code—and its "uselessness feels profound," charging the moment thematically. The lock's state constrains choice with visible problem-solving on the page. Strong integration, though it doesn't participate in the final image, capping potential for highest band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The inescapable calling shapes stakes from the opening ("answering the pull that never released her") through the grandmother's note ("this compulsion to create…is not optional. It will hollow you from the inside if you refuse it") to Mira's final resolve. It drives the decision to descend, to open the box, to exhibit. The concept is dramatized through fifteen years of accounting work as failed suppression. Dock slightly for bordering on prompt-label language in the grandmother's letter; the phrasing feels engineered to match the requirement.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mnemonic gift enables instant recall of the combination and the cave's exact childhood details. It's seeded early (second paragraph) and used functionally in two moments. However, it's convenience rather than constraint—the lock is already broken, so the gift doesn't matter to the central problem. The trait could be removed with minimal rewrites; Mira could simply remember the cave layout and try the combination anyway. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Rectify" appears explicitly in the grandmother's note ("Rectify what I could not") and motivates the final decision to exhibit both portfolios. The action is thematically central—correcting the grandmother's suppression by refusing to repeat it. It's seeded mid-story and drives the closure commitment. However, "rectify" itself is swappable; "finish," "complete," or "honor" would serve nearly identically. The concept matters more than the exact verb, keeping this in mid-high band rather than indispensable range.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The painting-with-something-behind-it is seeded in childhood memory, sought explicitly, and its discovery is the mechanism that unlocks the journal. The method shapes two beats: finding the canvas on the cave wall and lifting it to reveal the hollow. The painting's "simple landscape…unremarkable at first glance" mirrors the grandmother's public versus hidden work, adding thematic charge. Essential to plot logic; removing it would require fundamental restructuring of the discovery sequence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The subterranean crystal cave provides the hidden location necessary for the lockbox, supplies the bioluminescent fungi that create "auroral light," and anchors Mira's childhood memories. It constrains access (she must descend alone after the wake) and charges the final image (crystals refract fungal glow into "prismatic whispers"). The cave's preservation of the secret for thirty years is causally relevant. Strong integration across setup, middle discovery, and thematic closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe ("after the last echo of laughter fades") establishes the emotional moment—solitude following the wake—and creates the opening for Mira's descent. It anchors the opening beat poignantly. However, it doesn't tighten decisions or create time pressure; Mira works the lock "minutes pass in crystalline silence" without urgency. The timeframe could be "after the funeral" or "the evening of the burial" with identical function. Present but not pressuring.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation to uncork suppressed creativity is dramatized through Mira's fifteen-year accounting detour, her current charcoal-stained fingers, the grandmother's hidden works and explicit plea, and the final commitment to exhibit. It's conflicted—Mira "tried" to abandon art, telling herself it was impractical—and the grandmother's note makes the cost of continued suppression visceral ("hollow you from the inside"). The desire drives both the descent and the closure decision with felt historical cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Auroral sorrow" is coined explicitly mid-story ("auroral sorrow washes through her—grief tinged with strange, dawning hope") and established through the auroral-light cave setting in the opening. The tone modulates coherently: solemnity at the wake, reverence during discovery, dawning resolve at closure. The final image—"sorrow transforming slowly into light"—directly charges the tone with the story's emotional arc. The bioluminescent "auroral light born underground" metaphorically anchors it throughout, making tone indispensable to the piece's architecture.</comment>
