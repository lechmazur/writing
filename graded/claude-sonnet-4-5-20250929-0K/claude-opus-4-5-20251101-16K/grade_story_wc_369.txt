<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and her practical knowledge is embodied through her work with the labyrinth's dust and crystallized grief. The astronomer exists only in backstory and his failed quest motivates Mara's present insight, though the piece leans heavily on reflective interiority rather than dramatized choice under pressure. Her decision to transform rather than repair the sextant is signaled but the stakes remain abstract until the final image. The healing hands motif is mentioned but never constrains a live choice on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece accumulates understanding through Mara's night of work, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration when she sees the roots and reframes her role from cleaner to gardener. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening. The closure unit lands with conceptual cost—she accepts perpetual scarring as part of tending transformed sorrow—and the final image of the wandering dreamer trailing silver dust reweights all prior collection work. One meaningful deepening is present and sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The astronomer's tower, the labyrinth passages, and the ancient oaks are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory selection—moonlight healing, storm double-illumination, the pin's bell-like ring. The sextant's physical transformation is detailed and the work is grounded in Mara's scarred hands and practised movements. The final vision of glowing oak roots charges the closure image, making setting a crucible rather than backdrop. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the tower and underground passages.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the meaning of her sweeping work—is signaled early and deepens when Mara deconstructs the sextant and discovers the trees' transformative witness. Pressure is more internal and epistemological than situational; the storm frames the work but does not constrain it. The final realization that she gardens grief rather than merely cleaning it forecloses her prior unknowing with visible emotional cost (accepting perpetual scarring). One meaningful deepening is present, though the piece prioritizes understanding over agonistic conflict.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—grief as nutrient, witness as transformation—emerges organically from the labyrinth's dust collection, the oaks' growth rings, and Mara's reframed vocation. The sextant's transformation from starward to rootward mirrors the astronomer's failed upward gaze versus Mara's successful inward method. The final image of sorrow feeding back as grace avoids moralizing and carries conceptual weight. The piece resists easy resolution while making its thematic question—what becomes of witnessed grief—concrete and earned through Mara's night of work and her acceptance of tomorrow's scars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Diction is controlled and voice-particular: "ledgers of quantified sorrow," "repositories," "mundane miracle" all cohere. Some phrases edge toward elevated register ("perpetually scarred," "threading through the passages") but remain within a maintenance worker who has absorbed decades of contemplative solitude. The astronomer's notebook observations ("distances measured in exhaled sighs") feel slightly ornamental but serve the conceptual frame. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines advance understanding or atmosphere. Two friction points: "His sextant, he theorized, could navigate to that knowledge—if he could only learn to aim it at the right sky. He had failed because he looked upward" is a paraphrase loop that restates the same insight. The phrase "creating a strange double illumination that made the room feel suspended between destruction and peace" leans ornamental. Otherwise, clarity and propulsion are strong, with no template cadence or filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—quantified sorrow as maintenance work, trees as grief-transformers—is fresh and commits fully to its logic. The astronomer's failed starward gaze versus Mara's inward correction offers a non-obvious turn. The sextant's recalibration around dream-dust is specific and integral to the world. Minor proximity caution: "labyrinth as repository" and "witness" motifs echo well-trod Borgesian and ecological metaphor territory, but the piece personalizes them through Mara's embodied labor and the oak roots' luminous payoff.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's choices—deconstructing rather than repairing, recalibrating with dream-dust, reframing her vocation—drive all major beats and the closure realization. She is present throughout and her agency shapes the ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The sextant is introduced early as broken, is physically transformed across the storm's duration, and delivers the rootward vision that charges the closure. It appears in at least three beats (abandoned, deconstructed, transformed) and its unique properties—mirrors, arc—are irreplaceable for the ending's conceptual payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Quantified sorrow frames the opening (glass vials, ledgers) and reappears as crystallized dream-dust used to recalibrate the sextant. It shapes Mara's understanding at closure but functions more as thematic resonance than a live constraint on tactics. Present in first and final thirds with clear lyric reprise.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mentioned twice (discovery years ago, hands regenerating tonight) but never constrains a present choice or alters tactics. The moonlight enables the work temporally but the healing itself is label-only; no cost or tradeoff is dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Deconstruction is the pivotal action: Mara's decision to disassemble rather than repair drives the transformation sequence and enables the final vision. Removing this verb would collapse the story's central move. The process is detailed and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mapping scattered dreams is signaled as the method ("by mapping scattered dreams… she could recalibrate each piece") and the dream-dust becomes the sextant's core. The mechanics matter and are enacted on the page, though the mapping itself is more asserted than shown step-by-step. Contributes to closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The tower provides shelter during the storm, moonlight for healing and clarity, and the astronomer's abandoned tools. The double illumination (lightning + moonlight) charges the atmosphere. The setting enables the transformation work but does not constrain choices in a high-pressure way; it is more crucible than obstacle. Present at setup and payoff with clear purpose.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The pin's ring marks a pivot ("At the moment that pin was heard… something changed") but the timeframe is vague and does not tighten decisions. The storm's duration frames the work but no live clock pressures tactics. The moment is more poetic marker than functional constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Discovering what trees witness is Mara's central drive, inherited and corrected from the astronomer's failed quest. It is dramatized through her night's work and paid off in the rootward vision. The motivation shapes every beat and the closure reframes her vocation with felt cost (perpetual scarring accepted).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Mundane miracles—dust as seed, healing hands, sorrow as nutrient, the "mundane miracle" phrase at closure—saturates tone without sentimentality. The doubled register (practical maintenance + numinous transformation) is coherent and charges the final image. Tone modulates purposefully from storm intensity to dawn acceptance.</comment>
