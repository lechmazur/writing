<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to restore the arbor is clear and her decision to sing is earned by the journal discovery. However, the transformation happens too smoothly—the vines respond immediately without meaningful resistance or doubt that would test her commitment. The internal conflict is present in her initial uncertainty ("voice was imperfect, wavering") but resolves within a paragraph, offering no sustained contradiction. Her grandmother's practices are told rather than shown through micro-choices that reveal competing values under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~80 words. The closure—vines responding, transformation complete—lands on the page, but the cost is vague: what exactly has Mira forfeited or risked? The decision to teach village children is future-framed, not a present sacrifice. The story teaches a pattern (scientific failure → ritual success) but the final beat lacks the felt price required for Resonant Reconfiguration; the arbor's revival feels like pure gain, undermining the "promises kept across generations" theme with no visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The arbor is vividly anchored with "yellowing leaves," "shriveled grapes," "weathered wooden beams." Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric ("gathering hush," "pale" moon, "cool morning air"). The vine tendril's physical transformation—"brown and brittle" to "vital emerald"—constrains the climax and charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, though the arbor functions more as backdrop than active constraint on Mira's tactical choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clearly the arbor's survival, signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira begins to sing and the vine responds, but this is less a narrowing of options than immediate validation. No visible cost: the songs work perfectly, the transformation is total, and Mira experiences only "relief and wonder." The resolution lacks a felt price—what did she give up, what path did this foreclose? Escalation is smooth rather than pressured, with no failed attempt or trade-off visible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme—attention and presence as remedy, sacred practices as continued conversation—emerges clearly from the grandmother's journal and Mira's singing. However, the final paragraph over-articulates this theme ("simply promises kept—conversations continued across generations") where the image alone could carry it. The piece resists a tidy moral in most beats, but the ending explains rather than resonates. The new story Mira composes functions as meta-commentary, restating the theme instead of deepening it through contradiction or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: "stories would not be enough," "colors crept along its length." Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, filtering the arbor's decay through Mira's particular attention. Filter verbs ("could see," "understood") are present but voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. Free indirect style is clean. No dialogue to assess. Psychic distance appropriately tightens during the singing sequence, and the narrative voice modulates purposefully with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual variety. Information density is good in early beats but drops in the final third, where reflection paraphrases rather than advances: "sacred practices were simply promises kept—conversations continued" echoes prior material without adding pressure. Minor template cadence in the opening ("had always been," "had tended," "had tried") but breaks quickly. No major loops or artifacts. The phrase "sacred practices" recurs five times, functional but nearing repetition threshold. Clarity and momentum are solid throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise—restoring an arbor through forgotten songs—offers a modest fresh angle on "old ways vs. technology" material. Execution is competent but doesn't transform the trope: the songs work immediately, validation is total, and the emotional arc follows a predictable path from loss to restoration. The risk is low; Mira's choice to sing has no visible downside on the page. Specificity (grandmother's journal, harvest moon timing) anchors the material but doesn't disrupt expectations. The synthesis is pleasant but not surprising in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mira (whimsical tinkerer) is present throughout. Her tinkering trait is mentioned but not used—she tried "scientific solutions" off-page, then pivots to song. The key turn (deciding to sing) alters tactics, but her whimsy doesn't constrain the choice or add cost. She's framed as a storyteller who learns songs, not as someone whose tinkering impulse shapes the climax. Functional but replaceable with "concerned granddaughter."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vine tendril appears in three beats: initial description (brittle, brown), mid-transformation (uncurling, turning green), and closure (wrapping fingers, rustling). Early signal, development during escalation, and closure participation all present. The tendril's physical transformation is the story's climactic visual proof. Cost is visible: the tendril's revival depends on Mira's sustained singing. Strong causal linkage and irreplaceability; the exact image of the tendril moving charges the key moment.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Harvest moon (core concept) is signaled early ("last harvest moon of the century"), frames the ritual's timing constraint, and dissolves at closure as the transformation completes. It shapes the "when" but doesn't directly alter Mira's tactics—she sings because it's the right time, not because the moon's presence forces a difficult choice. Thematic resonance is strong (moon as witness), but on-page causal pressure is modest. The timeframe it enables is more active than the moon itself.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Spins golden stories" (attribute) is mentioned in paragraph one and returns in the final third when Mira decides to teach village children her stories alongside songs. It doesn't constrain or enable the climactic action—she doesn't use storytelling to solve the arbor problem. Label-only in the key beat; the trait exists to characterize Mira but doesn't shape the remedy or create visible trade-offs. Swappable with any other occupation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Remedy" (action) is the story's spine: Mira tries scientific remedies (off-page), discovers the ritual remedy in the journal, and enacts it by singing. Early setup, middle pivot, and closure all hinge on this action. The arbor's revival is the remedy's visible result. Causal pressure is strong; removing "remedy" would require a full rewrite. The framing as conversation rather than cure adds specificity. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Forgotten songs" (method) are signaled in the journal discovery, prepared through Mira's nights of practice, enacted at the climax, and present in the resolution (teaching children). The songs' mechanics—attention, presence, relationship—are explained and demonstrated on the page. The singing itself is the climactic act; the vine's response validates the method. The songs' "strangeness" and Mira's imperfect execution add texture. High irreplaceability and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Verdant arbor at dawn" (setting) is anchored immediately and supplies the physical space for all action. Dawn timing contributes to the ritual window. The arbor's decay is the problem; its revival is the closure image. However, the arbor doesn't constrain Mira's choices—it's more stage than obstacle. She stands, sings, and the vines respond; spatial pressure is low. The setting shapes tone and stakes but doesn't force tactical adaptation. Solid presence across beats but limited micro-constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"When everything aligns" (timeframe) is signaled early (harvest moon + sunrise convergence) and creates the ritual's narrow window. It tightens the decision—Mira must act now—but doesn't visibly pressure her tactics once she begins. The moon "dissolves into the blue morning" at closure, marking completion. The alignment is more thematic frame than live clock that alters moves. Functional timing constraint with strong thematic resonance but modest tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To restore sacred practices" (motivation) drives the plot from journal discovery to final resolution (teaching children). It's dramatized through Mira's choice to sing despite uncertainty and her decision to continue the practices fully. Minimal friction: the motivation aligns with stakes, and the text doesn't test competing desires (e.g., grief vs. duty, doubt vs. commitment). The desire is clear and causal but lacks internal conflict that would deepen the closure cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Gathering hush" (tone) is established in paragraph three ("that rare silence...when the world holds its breath") and sustained through the singing sequence. Tone modulates appropriately: initial solemnity, rising wonder during the transformation, relief at closure. However, the hush is somewhat static—pressure doesn't visibly degrade it or force tonal contradiction. The final image ("leaves catching the light like small green flames") shifts toward brightness, a purposeful evolution. Coherent but not dynamically charged under peak stress.</comment>
