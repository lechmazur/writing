<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is established and consistent—preservation through ritual action—but her interior life reads as contemplative summary rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The "foxglove regret" is asserted twice rather than embodied through micro-choices that reveal cost. The final weeping moment gestures toward complexity but arrives as label ("not from sadness exactly") instead of dramatized friction between competing wants. No on-page secondary character pressure tests her stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates density through repeated ritual and layered reflection, culminating in a final image (weeping, singing tomorrow) that reconfigures the task as both "sweet necessity and gentle poison." Orientation anchors arrive late (~150 words for clear spatial grounding). The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—refusal of final silence with felt cost—but the cost remains more asserted ("foxglove beauty," "gentle poison") than shown through a specific forfeited path or visible trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The Opal Library and glass orchids are vivid and purposeful, grounding the ritual action. The cracked bamboo tube constrains method and charges the closure by returning warm and "saturated with echoes." Spatial choreography within the library is clear (corridors, archive, individual orchids). However, the "Museum of Extinct Feelings" occupies narrative space without altering Elara's choices; it remains atmospheric rather than a constraint or resource that affects outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preservation of forgotten names against dissolution—is signaled early and sustained. The piece deepens through accumulation (Meridia, Thassen, Corialine) rather than a causal reversal, consistent with the Accumulative lens. The cost is declared ("foxglove regret," "gentle poison") but not dramatized as a specific foreclosed option; we do not see what Elara sacrifices to stay or what leaving would cost. Escalation reads as repetition across orchids rather than a tightening that narrows her options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme—preservation as simultaneously sustaining and poisonous—emerges through the repeated ritual and the final image of weeping. The "foxglove regret" motif charges the ending without overt moralizing. The grandmother's lullaby, with its "imperfect" notes and gaps, becomes a vessel for other losses, a resonant particular. However, the Museum of Extinct Feelings functions more as thematic echo than dramatized pressure, and phrases like "refusing the final silence" edge toward thesis statement rather than letting the image speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single POV is stable; narrative distance is consistent and suited to the reflective, ritual-bound character. Diction ("iridescent corridors," "crystalline petals," "foxglove regret") is purposeful and creates a distinct texture. However, phrasing like "not from sadness exactly, but from the foxglove beauty of her task" reads as clarifying gloss rather than trusting the image. Filter verbs ("watched," "felt") appear in key beats without voice necessity. Perceptual signature is present but leans toward poeticized summary rather than moment-by-moment selection under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is controlled, avoiding metaphor muddle. Information density is high in the ritual beats. However, paraphrase loops appear: "She was the only visitor these deserted marvels ever received. / The library had once welcomed scholars and mourners... / Now only the caretaker remained" restates the same fact across three sentences without added pressure. Template cadence: "Then Thassen. / Then Corialine. / Then names from languages..." uses identical stems without pattern-taught payoff. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull momentum in the final third, applying −0.6 under the patterned-artifact penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The glass-orchid premise and cracked-instrument method offer a fresh synthesis of preservation ritual and lyric world-building. The "foxglove regret" phrasing is specific and memorable. However, the Museum of Extinct Feelings reads as a familiar "lost emotions" trope without transformation through character action; Elara observes it rather than engaging its logic. The emotional arc—solitary caretaker finding meaning in futile labor—follows a well-worn template, elevated by diction but not structurally reweighted.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her ritual choices (positioning the tube, selecting orchids, humming the lullaby) drive each beat. However, these are repeated applications of a method rather than decisions that alter tactics or narrow options. The final choice—"Tomorrow she would do this again"—affirms continuity rather than change. She enables the plot but does not create a turn; her role is observational and procedural. Present in setup, middle, and ending; drives beats but no decisive alteration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cracked bamboo tube appears early (archive find), is used actively in the middle ritual (angling, capturing frequencies), and returns charged at the end ("grew warm... saturated with echoes"). Its fracture is the mechanism that enables the method. Removing it would break the plot's logic. Present in all three gates, drives two beats (retrieval/use, final saturation), and its unique property (crack captures undertones) is irreplaceable. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Deserted marvels" frames the setting (library that "few remembered and fewer could reach") and recurs in "She was the only visitor these deserted marvels ever received." It establishes atmosphere and informs Elara's isolation but does not constrain her choices on the page; the desertion is context, not obstacle. Present in setup and middle mention, but does not shape tactics or participate in closure action. Functional but replaceable with "forgotten sanctuaries" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Gently systematic" is shown early ("walked the iridescent corridors with gently systematic precision") and implicitly informs her ritual method across the middle beats (checking each orchid, moving orchid by orchid). The gentleness paired with system recurs in "She moved gently, systematically, to the next fading orchid." However, the trait never constrains or enables with visible cost; it characterizes her approach without creating friction or trade-off. Present in setup and middle; shapes tone but not a decisive choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Light" (lighting the orchids) is the action that defines every beat: "light from within," "lit the names one by one," "last orchid glowed stable." The resolution—"to light what remained of her"—reweights the action as both present ritual and future hope. Removing it would collapse the plot. Early signal, drives three beats, participates in closure image, and irreplaceable. Strong causal role and charged reprise.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The method—using the echo of the grandmother's lullaby through the cracked tube—is signaled early ("she had spent fifty years learning the method"), demonstrated in the Meridia beat ("raised the cracked bamboo tube... began... echoes traveled... gathered resonance"), and quantified at closure ("By evening... forty-seven times"). The mechanics (angling, directing sound, imperfect repetition) shape her tactics. Present in all three gates, drives ritual execution, and is causally essential. Could score higher with more specificity about what the imperfection enables.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The Opal Library is anchored early and provides vivid sensory grounding (iridescent corridors, opal walls that gather resonance, glass orchids on shelves). The "above the clouds" detail establishes isolation and a timeless quality. However, the setting does not constrain Elara's choices or supply resources that alter outcome; she moves freely within it. Present in setup and woven through middle description, but the environment does not pressure tactics or charge the closure image with spatial specificity. Strong atmosphere, limited mechanical role.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Across the museum of extinct feelings" functions as a spatial descriptor (the museum adjoins or permeates the library) rather than a timeframe. The phrase recurs once in the middle ("Across the museum...") to list catalogued feelings but does not track elapsed time or create urgency. No clock tightens Elara's decisions. Present in setup mention and one middle callback, but missing any temporal pressure or closure participation. Misaligned with timeframe function.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The motivation—"to preserve the sound of forgotten names"—is stated early and frames every action (checking for fractures, singing to restore light). It is tested implicitly by the "foxglove regret" (preservation as "gentle poison") and her final weeping acknowledgment. However, the friction between the want and its cost is told rather than dramatized through a choice that sacrifices something else on the page. Present in setup, informs all middle beats, and recurs at closure ("held Corialine's sound... and called it necessary"). Desire is clear; conflicted choice is asserted, not shown.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Foxglove regret" is introduced mid-story ("familiar foxglove regret—the knowledge that her preservation was also a kind of poison") and recurs in the final beat ("wept... from the foxglove beauty of her task, its sweet necessity and gentle poison"). The tone—bittersweet, charged with both beauty and toxicity—modulates coherently and charges the closure image. However, the phrase is explained rather than embodied through sensory or action beats, reducing its visceral impact. Present in middle and ending, reweights the final image, but leans on declaration.</comment>
