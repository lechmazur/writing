<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera's interiority is specific and embodied through sensory detail ("tumor excised but its absence burning"), and her motivation to read scars as a distancing mechanism shows genuine contradiction. The final realization ("You opened others to heal yourself") arrives with embodied cost (tears watering the ivy). However, key moments drift toward therapy-speak abstraction ("To analyze was to distance") and the epiphany feels somewhat declared rather than fully earned through prior micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens that holds through closure; the displaced-miracle premise creates a coherent constraint that shapes Vera's final action. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (tower, dawn, post-surgery). The closure—Vera accepting the miracle and channeling Iris's love to the garden—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost (tears, acceptance of her own wound). One meaningful deepening occurs when she shifts from analyzing others' scars to reading her own. The cost at closure is legible but somewhat diffuse; the final image reweights prior material without a sharp, unmistakable price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tower setting and ivy provide concrete constraints that shape Vera's choices; the ivy becomes the conduit for her final action, charging the closure image. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful (frosted hourglass, meteor hush, coffee rings). The body as micro-setting (bandaged torso, fresh scar) constrains her reflection and anchors the thematic turn. Setting details accumulate meaning across beats and directly enable the ending's resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Vera's need to confront her own wounds rather than distancing through analyzing others—is signaled early and tightens once through the displaced-miracle complication. The ivy's request creates a meaningful pressure point that forces her to act as conduit rather than analyst, narrowing options. The cost (accepting her own vulnerability, watering the ivy with tears) is felt but relatively gentle for the stake's weight. One credible tightening under the Accumulative lens; escalation is more about deepening than dramatic reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the displaced-miracle premise and Vera's profession: the tension between closure-seeking and wound-opening, between distancing analysis and intimate connection. The final image ("You opened others to heal yourself. Now open yourself to heal them") reweights prior material without overt moralizing, though it edges close to articulating the thesis. The frosted hourglass thawing and the ivy network create resonant non-literal answers to the central question. Subtext operates cleanly in gesture and image (coffee rings as tree rings, tears watering roots).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and voice-controlled; perceptual signature is consistent (professional lens applied to scars, patterns, closure). The prose modulates effectively between clinical observation and lyric intensity. Some moments drift toward elevated register that feels slightly detached from embodied crisis ("the motivation to learn to read the stories in scars, as if bodies were libraries"). Ivy's dialogue carries distinct texture but risks whimsy; the piece mostly manages the tension between literal and figurative without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and imagery is often dense (meteor hush, sand frozen mid-fall, roots speaking to roots). However, the piece carries noticeable scaffold: "She was a closure seeker by trade, though her clients called her something crueler" front-loads exposition; "To read, you must first trace. To trace is to touch" employs mechanical parallelism; the climax drifts toward summary ("She understood then") rather than pure dramatization. Some figurative language stacks without clear payoff ("fog lifting," "static," "impossible lungs" all in quick succession). Information density is generally high but rhythm occasionally slows for thematic clarity at the expense of propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The displaced-miracle premise offers a fresh synthesis: a telepathic gift meant for a dying botanist arrives in the wrong recipient, creating both constraint and moral obligation. The combination of scar-reading, plant telepathy, and miracle-as-mistimed-delivery feels specific rather than generic. However, the emotional arc (analyst learning to accept vulnerability) follows a familiar template, and the closure's thematic articulation ("Now open yourself to heal them") edges toward the safety middle by balancing Vera's wound with her new gift. The piece transforms its elements through specificity but stops short of bold risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Vera as "closure seeker who opens wounds" frames her profession and is present in the opening and closing beats. Her realization that analysis distances her from her own wounds shapes the arc. She makes a key choice to channel Iris's message to the garden rather than remaining passive. The character drives two beats (realization, message delivery) and participates in closure. However, much of the middle is reflective rather than decision-driven; the closure choice feels more like acceptance than a high-cost turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The frosted hourglass appears twice: initially as a static symbol left by Sol, then thawing as the miracle accepts Vera as host. The thawing marks a micro-turn (miracle warming to her grief) and signals readiness. However, the hourglass does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it measures rather than enables. The object is present at setup and closure but remains more metaphorical than causally active. Removing it would weaken atmosphere but not break story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The displaced miracle is the engine of the plot: Iris prayed to hear her garden, died thirty-two seconds before the miracle arrived, and it landed in Vera instead. This creates the central tension and enables the resolution (Vera channeling the message). The concept shapes stakes (moral obligation to a dead woman's wish), constrains tactics (telepathy with plants as the only means), and charges the closure (gift transforming from burden to bridge). The premise is irreplaceable and appears in setup, middle reflection, and climax.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Accidental plant telepathy is signaled early (ivy speaks), shapes the middle beat (Vera questions if it's the drugs, then accepts clarity), and enables the climax (she uses the green network to send Iris's message). The trait imposes a visible constraint (she cannot refuse the gift) and carries conceptual cost (she must embody what she avoided: opening herself). The telepathy is causally necessary and participates in closure. Removing it collapses the resolution.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Tunnel" appears as the ivy's metaphor ("We tunnel through mortar and time") and frames the final action ("tunneling through the boundary that separates the living from the lost"). It recurs with reweighted meaning and shapes Vera's understanding of connection across loss. However, the tunneling is more conceptual than physical; Vera does not literally tunnel, nor does the action itself constrain her tactics. The metaphor charges theme and closure but remains somewhat ornamental to plot mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Examining coffee rings appears once, mid-story, when Vera reads Sol's abandoned cup to learn Iris's final hours and the miracle's mistiming. This method provides key information (the thirty-two-second gap) that contextualizes the displaced miracle. However, it does not recur, constrain later choices, or participate in closure. The mechanics are described but not demonstrated under pressure. Setup and development are present; payoff is missing.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The quiet tower at dawn provides spatial constraint (Vera confined post-surgery, ivy on the walls within reach) and atmospheric coherence (silence, isolation, the meteor hush). The tower's vertical structure matters: Iris died "directly below," and the miracle displaced upward. The setting shapes the inciting realization and enables the ivy contact at closure. Removing the tower would require significant rewrites. Setup, development, and closure participation are all present.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"After the anesthesia wears off" anchors the opening and frames Vera's emerging clarity (sharp mind replacing drug fog). The timeframe establishes vulnerability (fresh scar, post-surgical state) that constrains her movement and intensifies the internal focus. However, the anesthesia itself does not impose a live clock or tighten decisions across beats; once dismissed as a drug question, it does not recur. Setup is strong; development and payoff are light.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Vera's motivation "to learn to read the stories in scars" is present throughout: it defines her profession, drives her reflective arc, and is explicitly confronted at closure when she traces her own scar and hears its message. The desire is dramatized through her habit of analyzing others and shown to be avoidance of her own wounds. The friction between wanting closure for others and avoiding her own creates meaningful cost. The motivation shapes setup, middle reflection, and closure; it is causally essential.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" is introduced in the opening ("the silence of something vast passing overhead, leaving the world below breathless") and modulates with pressure: initial quiet gives way to ivy murmurs, then the garden's rainfall-like gratitude, and finally "birdsong and the gentle rasp of ivy climbing higher" as the hush lifts. Tone coherence is strong and the progression from breathless silence to resumed life charges the closure. The tone is not static and its shift marks transformation.</comment>
