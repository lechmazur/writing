<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Vera's internal journey from conviction to paradox acceptance is credibly rooted in concrete sensory discovery (frost patterns revealing her grandmother's fabrication). The interiority moves through shock, grief, and realization with embodied detail ("laugh until tears froze on her cheeks"). However, the final acceptance—"firmly grounded at last in the paradox"—arrives without a visible micro-choice that forecloses a path; Vera's renunciation of publication is told rather than dramatized as a decision under pressure. The emotional arc is present but the cost at closure feels asserted rather than enacted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation is clean: who/where/when anchored by line 3. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the frost-prism ritual deepens through sensory density until the final image reweights belief itself. Closure is Conceptual Repricing—"truthful lies" reconfigures the premise with conceptual cost (no peer validation, isolated practice). The cost is visible in "never publish" and "tend this garden," foreclosing academic vindication. One slip: the grandmother's deception is delivered via vision rather than tactile discovery, weakening immediacy at the pivot.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The quartz arbor and frost-covered car window constrain Vera's method and charge the closure image (prism scattering rainbows across the pillars). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "shifted hush," "mist pooled thickest," frost "almost deliberate." Spatial choreography is coherent across moves. Minor slip: the arbor's construction detail (grandmother "engineered" the quartz) is told retrospectively rather than discovered through physical inspection, slightly diluting the setting's tactile presence at the revelation beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving objects absorb emotions—is signaled early and deepens when the prism reveals the grandmother's fabrication. The tightening occurs on-page: Vera's scientific pursuit collapses into acceptance that "lies had become true." Agency is renunciation (no publication) with visible cost (isolation, no vindication). One meaningful pressure point shifts knowledge and forecloses the academic path. The escalation is accumulative rather than causal, fitting the inferred lens, though the choice to "tend this garden" is not dramatized as a pivot under competing wants.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—belief shaping reality, "truthful lies"—emerges through concrete action: the prism revealing the grandmother's planted fabrication that accrued genuine power. The final image (prism scattering rainbows) offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in Vera's laughter-through-tears and the grandmother's "elaborate fabrication" that becomes real. Minor slip: "sometimes you must plant a lie deep enough for truth to grow from it" edges toward thesis statement, though it's framed as Vera's realization rather than authorial intrusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single POV, third-limited; distance is stable and voice carries a lyric, pattern-aware texture ("frozen prayers," "silence with weight and texture"). Perceptual signature is clear: Vera notices stillness, frost geometries, emotion as sediment. No head-hopping. Elision is purposeful: the grandmother's burial of "something small" is withheld until the prism reveals it, charging the discovery. Minor slip: "shifted hush" repeats as a phrase without evolving meaning, and "firmly grounded" at the close reads slightly over-articulated for the emotional state.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean with varied rhythm and strong verbs ("staggered," "hummed," "blazed"). Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. Minor loop at "truthful lies"/"lies that wore truth's patient face"—the same paradox restated without added pressure. "Shifted hush" appears twice identically without transformation. The line "The mist thinned as the sun rose higher" is functional but pedestrian amid otherwise elevated diction. No major artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The premise—objects absorbing emotions engineered through belief—offers a fresh angle on sympathetic magic. The grandmother's fabrication-turned-real is non-obvious and thematically integrated. Execution is competent but the emotional arc follows a familiar trajectory: scientist loses funding, discovers familial secret, accepts paradox. The frost-on-car-window communion method is specific and memorable. Risk-taking is moderate; the ending lands safely in acceptance without exploring the friction between renunciation and isolation. Transformation test: plot could function with different objects and setting without major rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Vera's attentiveness drives the frost-prism observation that reveals the grandmother's fabrication, creating the key turn. Her choice to "tend this garden" rather than publish is present but not dramatized as a decision under pressure. Early signal, middle beat involvement, closure participation present; causal pressure moderate (observation enables discovery but does not constrain tactics). Cost is conceptual (no vindication) but the decision itself is told.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prism appears in three beats: brought to the window, pressed against frost to reveal visions, and held up at closure to scatter rainbows. It enables the key revelation and charges the final image. Early signal, strong causal pressure (unlocks hidden geometries), closure linkage. Specific property (facets refracting frost patterns) is irreplaceable. Cost is conceptual (prism reveals lies, forcing renunciation of proof). Minor: the prism "slipping from numb fingers" is briefly ornamental rather than functional.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Shifted hush" is introduced early as sensory atmosphere that signals difference, shaping Vera's attention and priming the discovery. It recurs once identically without transformation, then lifts as closure nears. Functions as a pressure cue but does not constrain tactics or alter options directly. Lyric reprise present; cost connection weak (the hush lifting does not foreclose a path). Swappability moderate (another atmospheric marker could serve).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Firmly grounded" appears as label in paragraph 3 ("firmly grounded in her conviction") and returns in the penultimate paragraph ("firmly grounded at last in the paradox"). Does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost; functions as thematic bookend rather than trait affecting choice. Setup and closure present; middle development absent. Swappability high (other conviction-markers could replace it).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Communion occurs in the prism-frost ritual that reveals the grandmother's fabrication, driving the major turn. The action is signaled early ("learned to commune through the patterns"), executed mid-story (discovery beat), and referenced at closure ("whispered thank you"). Two beats plus closure mention. Causal pressure strong (enables revelation) but the closure communion ("whispered thank you") is summary rather than dramatized. Cost is conceptual (what she learns forecloses publication).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Frost-on-car-window is introduced early (paragraph 5), mechanics matter (prism reveals hidden geometries), and the method shapes the discovery attempt. Signaled, executed, and its result (visions) drives the turn. Early signal, middle involvement, closure reference (rainbows scattered). Specificity high (frost + prism facets + dawn light). Causal pressure strong. Minor: the method is described more than enacted tactilely; Vera "leaned closer" but the frost-reading itself is vision-passive.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The quartz arbor is present throughout: established early (grandmother's legacy), mid-story (visions show "something small" buried at its center), and closure (prism scatters rainbows "across her grandmother's quartz legacy"). Setting constrains Vera's practice (she returns here) and charges the final image. Early signal, closure linkage. Minor: the arbor does not alter tactics or supply resources that affect outcome beyond being the locus of belief. Micro-setting (body kneeling, pressing palms) adds tactile pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>"When assumptions shatter" is embodied in the prism-discovery beat: "first assumption to shatter," "second assumption crumbled." Time is implied (dawn to sunrise) but does not tighten decisions; the narrative is retrospective reflection more than live clock. Setup (assumptions stated), middle (shattering dramatized), closure (acceptance after shattering). The frame reweights the premise but does not pressure tactics. Lyric reprise without urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The desire to prove objects absorb emotions is stated early, drives Vera's prism ritual, and is renounced at closure ("never publish her findings"). Dramatized in the frost-discovery beat where proof collapses into paradox. Friction between want (vindication) and cost (isolation, no peers) is present but told at the end rather than enacted as a choice under competing pressures. Early signal, middle causal involvement, closure participation. Cost legible but not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Truthful lies" is introduced mid-story as Vera's realization, modulates through laughter-and-tears, and charges the final image ("Truth dressed in lies, lies that wore truth's patient face"). Tone is coherent: paradox sustained without deflation. Present in peak beat and closure. Minor: the phrase is restated twice without transformation, edging toward label. Nonetheless, the tone reweights the dominant stake (belief vs. fabrication) and the final image holds the paradox without resolving it.</comment>
