<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Maren's interior is concrete and character-particular through the inherited tapping rhythm and her work as sea-level witness. Her motivations evolve cleanly from inherited silence to active vigil with visible cost in the torn atlas page kept close. The father remains a memory-vector rather than a second on-page character, so relationship dynamics are absent but appropriately so. Minor deduction: the revelation about his monitoring network arrives through manifest cross-reference rather than embodied choice under pressure, slightly diluting agency at the turn.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece accretes meaning through recurring images (tapping rhythm, atlas routes, white silence) that reweight at closure when juvenile coral grows unseen beneath. The Orientation Test is satisfied early (monitoring station, Maren, present day). Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise: Maren's decision to keep vigil and the torn page crystallizes her stance with felt cost (waiting through a lifetime for uncertain recovery). The revelation about her father's informal network provides the deepening that narrows her understanding and charges the final image. One micro turn (discovery of manifest records) sets up the closure without fragmenting pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The monitoring station built on a former parking garage is specific and purposeful, anchoring the post-ban timeline. The atlas page as micro-setting object constrains Maren's attention and charges the final choice to keep it beside her. Sensory detail is selective: fog pressing "like something trying to remember its own name" and the monitors' "patient testimony" filter through her vigil-keeper's bias. The station's moorings and the unseen juvenile coral beneath create spatial pressure that charges closure. Meets the 9+ gate requirement: the atlas page (object-as-setting) constrains her choice to maintain witness and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: understanding why coral routes disappeared and whether paths can return. Escalation under Accumulative lens: the tapping rhythm accumulates weight, the discovery of her father's monitoring network deepens the vigil's meaning, and the final image of unseen juvenile coral reweights all prior material. Agency is crystallized through her decision to keep the page and continue watching despite the ocean's indifferent schedule—a stance that forecloses easier paths with visible cost (a lifetime of uncertain witness). One meaningful tightening occurs when she understands her father's crossed-out routes as documentation of absence, which charges her own data-assembly work.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: delayed consequences, the gap between human timelines and ecological recovery, inheritance of witness. The "periodically eternal" motif recurs with shifting valence—first as geological indifference, then as stubborn life returning. No moralizing; the ending's image of unseen coral growth offers a resonant non-literal answer to whether paths return, reweighting all prior material without stating a thesis. The father's quiet evidence-gathering and Maren's continuation of that work embody theme through specific action rather than abstract meditation. Strong subtext in the tapping rhythm as inherited language of warning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single stable POV with strong perceptual signature: Maren notices through a scientist-daughter lens (quarterly data reports, cross-referencing manifests, the atlas beside her keyboard). Diction is controlled and purposeful: "periodically eternal," "white silence of loss," "the ocean kept its revelations on its own schedule" feel voice-motivated without purple excess. Free indirect style is clean. The father's presence is memory-filtered, not head-hopped. Rhythmic control under pressure: sentence lengths modulate between Maren's habitual tapping and the ocean's slow disclosure. Minor deduction: "desperate human need to witness recovery in a single lifetime" edges toward overt theme statement in the penultimate paragraph, slightly breaking POV modesty.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Strong opening anchors voice and stakes; final line ("Some truths arrive late. Some paths return") resolves by image with charged reprise. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or thematic weight. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating through the manifest discovery and breathing in the closure. Minor loop detected: "periodically eternal" appears three times with slight variations ("periodically eternal dance," "periodically eternal in its cycles," "periodically eternal, indifferent")—the recurrence feels pattern-taught rather than accidental, but the third instance adds minimal new pressure. One filter-verb cluster in the father-memory paragraph ("had been," "had shown," "had stopped") slightly dulls immediacy but remains voice-coherent. No scaffolding or major artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—monitoring station witness after fossil fuel ban discovers her father's informal coral documentation—synthesizes familiar elements (climate elegy, inherited mission) into a specific, grounded synthesis. The delayed revelation structure transforms the tapping rhythm from character tic to inherited warning language. Fresh inflections: the atlas page as torn inheritance, the crossed-out routes as absence-map, the unseen juvenile coral as answer to her vigil. Avoids sentimentality through specific occupational detail (quarterly reports, twelve stations, manifest cross-reference). Risk-taking is moderate: the quiet closure and heavy reflection load succeed under Accumulative lens but don't radically subvert form. Transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on these exact particulars (coral bleaching, shipping captain father, monitoring station moored to drowned parking garage).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren witnesses bleaching at age eleven and again at fourteen (white coral); this memory primes her choice to work at the monitoring station and shapes her discovery about her father's network. The witnessing drives two beats (childhood memory, choice of vigil work) and participates in closure by charging her decision to keep watching. Early signal, causal pressure, closure linkage present. Deduction for late payoff: the witnessing itself is retrospective setup; her present choices trace more directly to the atlas and tapping rhythm than to the bleaching memory, making this character attribute essential but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Atlas page torn from father's book appears in opening paragraph, is traced and tapped throughout (multiple beats), and remains "beside her" in the final image, charging her decision to keep vigil. Early signal, beat involvement (opening, discovery scene, closure), causal pressure (its marked routes drive her investigation), closure linkage (kept close in final line), specificity (torn page with penciled and crossed-out routes is irreplaceable). Visible cost: she keeps it as anchor despite uncertain payoff. Strong integration across all three gates with cost tied to the object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Delayed revelation structures the entire narrative: Maren doesn't understand the atlas markings until she discovers the manifests on Tuesday. The concept shapes stakes (why did her father mark these routes?) and tactics (cross-referencing old records). The revelation changes her understanding and intensifies her vigil's meaning, directly enabling the closure stance. Early signal (opening paragraph notes she didn't understand "then"), beat involvement (discovery scene is the major turn), closure participation (the revelation charges her final choice to keep watching). High causal pressure and specificity: the story's architecture depends on this exact concept.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Periodically eternal" appears three times describing the ocean's cycles, framing human efforts against geological timescales. It constrains Maren's expectations (she "wouldn't know for years") and charges the theme of patience versus desperation. Present in opening third, returns at closure ("periodically eternal, indifferent"). Functional lyric reprise that reweights the stake. Deduction: the phrase operates more as thematic accent than action constraint; it shapes atmosphere and meaning but doesn't enable or foreclose a specific choice under pressure. Reaches mid-6s on resonance rather than causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Assemble" drives multiple beats: Maren is assembling the quarterly data report (opening task), her father was "assembling evidence" (revelation), she "began typing her report" and continues "assembling fragments of a story" (closure). The action shapes the central question (what are we assembling from fragments?) and charges the ending where she commits to ongoing assembly despite uncertainty. Early signal, beat involvement across three moments, closure participation. Causal pressure: her assembling work enables the manifest discovery. Minor swappability: could be replaced with "compile" or "gather" without breaking logic, preventing top-band score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tapping rhythm (three quick, pause, two slow) appears in opening paragraph, recurs when she traces routes, identified as inherited from father, and returns in closure ("kept tapping"). The practice is signaled early, developed as inherited warning language through the revelation about her father's monitoring work, and charges the final image as continuity of witness. Beat involvement (opening, mid-discovery, closure), causal link (connects her to father's mission), closure participation. Cost: keeping the rhythm is choosing to carry his burden. Deduction: the tapping doesn't mechanically constrain a choice; it's more symbolic anchor than tactical method, capping score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sea level monitoring station is anchored early, provides the occupational frame (quarterly reports, twelve eastern seaboard stations), and supplies the monitors that scroll "patient testimony" in closure. The moored station built on a drowned parking garage concretizes the post-ban timeline and rising waters. Setting pressures her choices by making the vigil literal and isolated. Early signal, closure participation, some causal pressure (the station enables her data work and manifest access). Deduction: the specific station features (aluminum desk, monitors, fog at windows) provide atmosphere more than tactical constraint; most beats could occur in any monitoring outpost, preventing indispensability score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After the fossil fuel ban" is established in opening and referenced throughout (electric cargo vessels, closed ports, "before the ban"). The timeframe shapes the world state (waters still rising slowly, juvenile coral beginning unseen) and charges the theme of delayed consequences despite human amendment. Present early, returns at closure in the patience required for recovery. Moderate causal pressure: the post-ban world enables Maren's monitoring work and her father's obsolescence as shipping captain. Deduction: the timeframe is consistent backdrop rather than live ticking clock; it sets stakes but doesn't tighten decisions beat-to-beat, scoring mid-6s for coherent integration without tactical urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren's desire to discover why some paths disappear is signaled through her tracing of the atlas routes and crystallizes when she finds the manifests showing her father tracked dying reefs. The motivation drives her investigation and charges her closure decision to keep vigil for paths that "might, impossibly, return." Early signal (opening third: tracing routes, wondering why they're crossed out), beat involvement (manifest discovery answers the question), closure participation (she commits to witnessing which paths reappear). Visible cost: a lifetime of uncertain watching. Friction between want (to know now) and reality (ocean's schedule) creates authentic tension. Strong integration with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Drifting moored" tone is established through the station's physical moorings, the fog that "pressed...like something trying to remember," and Maren's suspended state between past bleaching and future uncertain recovery. Tone modulates coherently: elegiac in memory passages, patient in monitoring descriptions, charged at the revelation, and poised at closure where "the station drifted on its moorings" as she commits to vigil. The oxymoron (drifting yet moored) charges the final image of waiting that is both anchored and suspended. Strong coherence through turns with purposeful modulation that supports rather than undercuts pressure. Tone is indispensable to the piece's effect.</comment>
