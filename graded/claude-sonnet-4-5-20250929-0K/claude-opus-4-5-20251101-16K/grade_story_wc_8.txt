<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Miriam's interiority relies heavily on summary and label-speak rather than embodied contradiction. Her "emotionally rational" trait is told via exposition ("she felt the weight...yet her mind processed each feeling through careful analysis") rather than shown through conflicted micro-choices. The final walk away reads as a smooth decision without visible internal friction or cost—no moment where competing impulses act simultaneously in scene. Gerald's haggard face and trembling reluctance provide some secondary pressure, but Miriam's arc lacks the lived-in messiness required for high bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored early). The closure—Miriam walking away with the letter, declaring truth necessary—lands as a Decisive Change (she acquires the document and commits to publication), but the cost is more asserted than felt on the page. Gerald's capitulation happens off-stage between "was silent" and "finally said," eliding the turn where he decides. The piece follows a causal lens (meeting → debate → acquisition), but the final beat summarizes consequence ("a world that would soon lose a beloved saint") rather than dramatizing immediate forfeit or friction. One meaningful tightening occurs when the petal falls, cueing Gerald's emergence, but the ending's cost remains abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ivy-covered station and dying rosebush are vivid, but they function primarily as atmosphere rather than constraining choice. The petal's fall triggers the scene's start mechanically (timeframe constraint) yet does not return with reweighted meaning at closure. Spatial choreography is minimal—two characters on a platform—and the illuminated letter is handled in archival sleeve without tactile detail that shapes the exchange. The setting does not apply pressure or alter tactics; it frames rather than participates.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>One dominant stake (publish the letter vs. protect charitable foundations) is signaled early and debated. Miriam's Prester John parallel tightens the argument, and Gerald's silence functions as a micro-reversal. However, the final cost—Gerald's acquiescence, Miriam's departure—is more declared than dramatized; we do not see Gerald wrestle on the page between "the foundations do real good" and his final surrender. The piece lacks a second escalation or a visible price that alters tactics after the midpoint. Pressure coheres but does not deeply narrow options or force a trade-off with felt stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme (truth vs. noble lies) emerges through the debate and the illuminated letter's imagery (the archbishop's "smirk across the centuries"). Miriam's argument that "noble lies never stay noble" and the Prester John parallel ground the concept in particulars. However, the final paragraph moralizes directly: "The truth was rarely noble. But it was always necessary" is a thematic echo that replaces scene pressure with assertion, triggering a −0.5 deduction. The piece invites reflection but does not offer a resonant, non-literal answer—it states its thesis outright.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is clean with stable third-person limited. Miriam's perceptual signature (historian's lens, patience) is consistent. Dialogue carries subtext—Gerald's "You'll publish this" as resigned statement, Miriam's refusal of "false comfort"—and advances the debate efficiently. However, Gerald's voice converges with Miriam's register in the exchange ("The lie served its purpose once. Seven hundred years is long enough" could belong to either). Under peak stress, both characters speak in equally articulate, thesis-ready sentences without dialect variation or emotional fracture. Psychic distance remains stable, but voice distinction weakens at the climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: "a small red wound against the grey platform," "the archbishop's face...seemed to smirk across the centuries," "nature slowly erasing humanity's abandoned infrastructure." Rhythm varies purposefully. Two minor issues: "emotionally rational—she felt the weight of what she sought, yet her mind processed each feeling through careful analysis" is scaffold exposition that tells the attribute rather than enacting it; and the final two paragraphs loop thematically ("The truth was rarely noble. But it was always necessary" echoes prior material without added pressure). Information density is high in the debate section but softens in the closing. No major artifacts touch closure, so caps remain clear of Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise—historian discovers proof a beloved saint never existed—is familiar (faith vs. evidence, institutional lies) and follows a recognizable debate structure. The Prester John parallel is apt but not transformative. The illuminated letter as smoking gun and the ivy-covered station as meeting place are functional but replaceable with minor edits (any archival document, any atmospheric ruin). Miriam's final walk and declaration feel inevitable from the opening rather than earned through surprising turns. No bold structural or perspectival risk heightens stakes. The piece executes competently within its template but does not transform it through lived detail or moral calculus that resists easy resolution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Miriam (fictional historian) frames the premise, debates Gerald, and makes the final choice to publish. She drives the argument and the decision to walk away with the letter. Present in setup (waiting at platform), development (Prester John parallel narrows Gerald's options), and closure (walks away declaring truth necessary). Two beats: debate and departure. Causal pressure: her role as historian justifies her presence and stance, but "historian of fictions" is more thematic ornament than a constraint that shapes her tactics under pressure. Cost is declared but not embodied—no visible forfeit tied to her profession. Eligible for mid-6s: setup/development/payoff present, two beats, but swappable for "truth-seeker" or "archivist" with minor edits. Specificity is moderate; cost connection weak.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The illuminated letter appears in setup (described in paragraph 3), is handled at midpoint (Gerald emerges with it in archival sleeve; Miriam studies the archbishop's smirk), and drives closure (she slides it into her satchel and walks away). Three beats: revelation of its content, exchange, and departure. Causal pressure: the letter is the inciting object and the story's MacGuffin; without it, no meeting occurs. Cost: implicit—acquiring it means publishing, which will "devastate charitable foundations." The smirking archbishop detail is specific and irreplaceable. However, the letter is more catalyst than constraint—it does not evolve in meaning or alter Miriam's tactics during the scene. Strong integration, but not indispensable in the highest sense (a similar document could serve). Setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.5, minus swappability −0.5, minus static handling −0.6 = ~7.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Noble lies" is the conceptual spine: Saint Edmund is the lie, the Church manufactured him to inspire charity, and Miriam's mission is to expose it. Present in setup (paragraph 3 spells out the invention), development (her Prester John argument that "noble lies never stay noble. They metastasize"), and closure (Gerald's concern for foundations vs. Miriam's assertion that truth matters). The concept shapes stakes directly: publish and destroy institutions vs. preserve the lie. It narrows options—Miriam cannot keep the letter secret and fulfill her mission. Visible cost: charitable foundations will suffer. The final image ("perhaps—perhaps—gain something more valuable") is a conceptual repricing tied to the lie's exposure. Setup +0.7, two beats (debate, closure) +0.9, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.7, cost connection +0.5 = strong 8+. Not swappable; the story is built on this exact tension.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Emotionally rational" is introduced in paragraph 5: "she felt the weight of what she sought, yet her mind processed each feeling through careful analysis." This is label-only exposition; no on-page action demonstrates the trait constraining or enabling a choice. Miriam's subsequent argument (Prester John parallel) reads as straightforward persuasion, not a unique synthesis of emotion and logic. No moment where her rationality costs her empathy or where her emotion tempers cold calculation. Present but ornamental. Late signal (40% mark), label-only −0.3, no beat involvement, no closure linkage, high swappability (could be "analytical," "methodical," "dispassionate"). Cap 4.6 for late intro; no development or payoff. Final: 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Recapture" appears in Miriam's interior monologue: "I'm trying to recapture truth itself—the principle that we deserve to know what's real." This is a thematic claim in dialogue/thought, not a dramatized action. The action of acquiring the letter (walking away with it in her satchel) is the physical turn, but "recapture" as method is asserted, not enacted through multiple moves. Present in development (the line above) and closure (she leaves with the letter to publish it, thus recapturing truth from concealment). One beat where the verb is explicit; the walk-away implies it. Swappable with "restore," "recover," "reveal" without structural change. Functional but not irreplaceable. Setup weak (not signaled early), development +0.4, closure linkage +0.9, swappability −0.6 = ~5.9. Lyric reprise absent.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"By drawing parallels" is the method Miriam uses to persuade Gerald. Setup: implicit in her historian role. Development: the Prester John analogy (paragraph following Gerald's objection) is the explicit parallel—she compares Saint Edmund to another historical lie that "consumed resources, drove colonial ambitions, justified conquests" and "caused people to abandon real medicine. Children died." This parallel narrows Gerald's position and shifts his silence from resistance to acquiescence. Closure: the method succeeds; Gerald concedes. One major beat (the analogy itself), causal pressure (it changes Gerald's stance), and closure linkage (the success of the parallel allows her departure). Not swappable—the story hinges on persuasion through historical example. Setup weak (taught only at use), one beat +0.4, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +1.3, specificity +0.6, cost connection +0.4 = ~7.2. Late signal −0.3 applied.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The disused railway station with ivy is vivid (ivy swallowed the ticket booth, rusted bench, overgrown platform) and anchors locale early (paragraph 1). The ivy rustles during Gerald's silence, providing atmospheric texture. However, the setting does not constrain choice or supply resources—Miriam and Gerald could hold this conversation in any atmospheric ruin. No micro-setting detail (e.g., a bench that forces proximity, a train schedule that imposes urgency) alters tactics. The setting frames but does not pressure. Setup +0.6, one atmospheric beat (rustling ivy) +0.4, no causal pressure, no closure linkage (the walk along the platform is generic departure), moderate swappability −0.5 = ~5.4. Postcard description, not tactical.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the final petal drops from the old rosebush" is specific and met on the page: "The petal fell" (paragraph 6) triggers Gerald's emergence in the next line. This mechanically gates the meeting. However, once the petal falls, time becomes slack—the debate could stretch indefinitely without cost. No urgency arises from the timeframe after its initial trigger. The rosebush returns only as "past the fallen petal" in the final paragraph, a reprise without reweighted meaning. Setup +0.7 (petal introduced paragraph 2, gate described paragraph 4), one beat (the fall itself) +0.4, causal pressure +0.6 (it initiates action), closure reprise +0.3 (mentioned but not charged), swappability −0.4 (could be "at sunset" or "after the bell tolls"). No live clock that tightens decisions mid-scene. ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To rescue truth from a pit of lies" is Miriam's stated mission (paragraph 5: "rescuing truth from the pit of lies that history so often became"). The motivation is dramatized through her refusal to offer Gerald "false comfort," her Prester John argument, and her final declaration ("The truth was rarely noble. But it was always necessary"). Internal conflict appears briefly—she acknowledges the devastation to charities—but her commitment never wavers; there is no moment of genuine doubt or trade-off where wants clash with costs on the page. Setup +0.7, two beats (debate, departure) +0.9, causal pressure +1.0 (drives her choices), closure linkage +1.4 (final assertion), cost friction moderate (acknowledged but not felt) +0.3, specificity +0.5. No genuine temptation to keep the letter secret lowers friction. ~7.6.</comment>
