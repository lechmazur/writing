<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marta's interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied emotion through her handling of the gauge tooth and her garden work. The "wistfully pragmatic" lens successfully shapes her choices and perception without therapy-speak. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between her practicality and vulnerability, though the final choice—repositioning mirrors—feels more like routine maintenance than a high-stakes decision that forecloses a path with visible cost. The micro-choices around mirror placement and allowing herself to "simply feel" the ache are present but lack the sharper edge of genuine struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes clear orientation (who/where/when) within the opening beats. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the story deepens through layered images (rosebush, harbor, mirrors, gauge tooth) and cadence shifts rather than causal because/therefore linkage. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Marta accepts the cyclical nature of beauty and loss, repositions her mirrors, and commits to planting again come spring. The cost is felt (vulnerability, ache of loving fragile things) but largely internal and already-known rather than a decisive new forfeiture. One meaningful tightening occurs (bare rosebush → mirror repositioning → spring planning), sufficient for this length under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The fire escape garden, harbor moonlight, and mirror array function as micro-setting that charges the final image and constrains Marta's choices (repositioning depends on moon/sun angles, seasonal change). Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "waters holding light like a secret worth keeping," the "quivering hush," boat creaks. Spatial choreography remains clear across the single platform. The mirrors-among-plants setup is specific enough to feel indispensable to the closure, where Marta finishes positioning the last mirror with the knowledge that neighbors will wake to unexplained brightness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Marta's commitment to tending beauty and reflecting light despite fragility and loss. The piece establishes this early and deepens it through the rosebush's death, winter's approach, and the mirror repositioning. Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure coheres through seasonal tightening and the ache of vulnerability, with one meaningful shift (allowing herself to feel the ache fully, then acting on her yearly ritual). Agency is present in the repositioning choice, though it's more affirmation than renunciation. The cost is felt but quiet—emotional exposure rather than a trade-off that forecloses a live option. No antagonist or reversal is required, and the piece meets the lens's escalation standard, though entering the 8+ band typically demands a more visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: choosing to witness and tend fragile beauty, reflecting light into dark corners as an act of quiet determination. The lockmaster father's lesson ("locks weren't about keeping people out—they were about choosing who to let in") integrates through Marta's mirror work without on-the-nose moralizing. The final image—neighbors waking to unexplained brightness, Marta planning for spring—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the thematic question. The rosebush, gauge tooth, and mirrors recur with shifting weight. Subtext operates in gesture (the oar-like rhythm, the tooth placed on the railing) and in the implication that small gestures matter without asserting hope as a certainty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with controlled psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Marta notices moonlight paths, mirror angles, boat wakes shaped like thorns. Diction is purposeful and character-specific ("wistfully pragmatic," "quivering hush," "luminous harbor"). Narrative certainty matches what the focalizer knows. No dialogue appears, so those bullets don't apply. The prose rhythm modulates with emotional beats—shorter clauses during the mirror work, longer during reflection. One minor slip: "instill something—not hope exactly, but possibility" edges toward tell-mode abstraction when the image could have carried it alone, and "that familiar tenderness" is slightly generic for peak interiority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; openings are diverse. Information density is high with most lines doing double duty (e.g., the gauge tooth establishes backstory, symbolism, and present tactile action simultaneously). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Clarity and propulsion are strong through the mirror-repositioning sequence. Minor overwriting appears in stacked figurative language: "waters holding light like a secret worth keeping" followed closely by "quivering hush" and the wake "like the rosebush's thorns, protective and purposeful"—three metaphors in quick succession risk slight density creep, though each remains coherent. The phrase "instill something—not hope exactly, but possibility" tells where showing would sharpen. Grammar and punctuation are clean; no scaffolding or generation artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—fire escape gardener as light-reflector, lockmaster's daughter reframing her inheritance—offers a fresh synthesis that avoids template structures. The transformation test passes: swapping names/places would lose the harbor moonlight mechanics and the lockmaster metaphor's specificity. Emotional truth in Marta's "ache of loving fragile things" and her practical routines feels earned rather than sentimental. The rosebush/mirrors/gauge tooth combination is particular to this voice and world. Risk is modest: the piece commits to a quiet, accumulative design without gimmickry, though the safety of affirming an established routine rather than forcing a harder choice keeps it from the highest band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marta is present throughout and her choices—allowing herself to feel vulnerability, repositioning mirrors, planning for spring—create the story's turns. Setup is immediate, development occurs in the middle reflection and repositioning beats, and payoff appears in the final planning sentence. Her decision to continue the ritual despite loss drives the closure. The choices are credible but not high-stakes in the sense of forfeiting a competing path; they affirm an established pattern rather than forcing a new direction. Causal pressure is moderate; the element shapes two distinct beats (reflection, repositioning) and the ending. Swappability is low—remove Marta's gardener identity and the story collapses.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The gauge tooth appears in three beats: withdrawn from pocket with backstory, placed on railing as beacon, returned to pocket. Early signal is strong. Its function as a thinking tool ("rhythm of oars in water") and its symbolic link to the lockmaster father frame Marta's mirror work as a parallel practice. Development is present (the oar-like rhythm guides her repositioning), and it returns at closure when she pockets it after finishing. However, the tooth does not constrain a choice or create friction; it's more talisman than tool. Swappability is moderate—a similar heirloom object could serve the same thematic role with minor edits. The element enriches but doesn't alter tactics or outcome.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Quivering hush" is labeled once in the text and functions as atmospheric descriptor rather than stake-shaping concept. It does not constrain choices or change options on the page; Marta's actions would proceed identically without it. The concept echoes the tone (quiet, liminal moment) but lacks causal integration. No development beat ties the hush to a tactical decision. Ornamental use without pressure involvement.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Wistfully pragmatic" is labeled explicitly ("the wistfully pragmatic attention of someone who understood that beauty required witnessing") and demonstrated through Marta's actions: she counts blooms, repositions mirrors with methodical care, yet allows herself emotional vulnerability. Setup is clear in the opening paragraph. Development appears in her acknowledgment that "it wasn't much" and her acceptance of "the limits of small gestures." The trait enables her endurance (she doesn't retreat into pure sentiment or pure cynicism) and shapes her stance at closure. One on-page cost: the exposure of letting herself "simply feel" the ache. Swappability is moderate—"pragmatic yet tender" could substitute with minor edits. The trait guides but doesn't force a high-stakes tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Instill" appears once as a verb describing the effect Marta hopes her mirrors have on neighbors. It does not drive a major turn; the action that matters is the mirror repositioning itself, and "instill" is the desired outcome rather than the enabling deed. The word could be swapped for "offer," "suggest," or "bring" without structural change. Middle development is absent—the instilling is described as an ongoing effect, not a choice-point. No closure participation beyond thematic echo. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "rhythm of oars in water" is signaled in the gauge-tooth paragraph and reappears when Marta repositions mirrors ("that same oar-like rhythm guiding her hands"). Setup and development are present; the rhythm frames her meditative, methodical approach. It shapes the manner of her work and links her to her father's practice, but the mechanics don't alter outcome—she could reposition mirrors without this specific cadence. Payoff is implicit (the rhythm completes at the last mirror). The method enriches character texture but remains swappable with another meditative descriptor. Lyric reprise adds modest weight.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The harbor and moonlight are introduced in the opening paragraph and drive the core conflict: Marta's platform is "a collector of something precious" because of the moon's path, and the mirror repositioning depends on seasonal angle changes. Setup is immediate. Development occurs when the harbor's luminosity and boat wake trigger reflection, and the moon dictates mirror tactics. Payoff is direct—neighbors wake to "unexplained brightness." The harbor's specific geography (harbor-facing corner, moon path) constrains Marta's choices and enables her light-reflecting practice. Removing the luminous harbor would collapse the premise. Swappability is low.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the final petal drops" anchors the opening beat and establishes seasonal transition (end of bloom, winter approaching). Setup is strong. The time element motivates the mirror repositioning (sun and moon angles will change) and charges the closure planning ("when spring returned"). However, the petal drop itself doesn't tighten a decision in progress—it's a marker rather than a pressure mechanism. No live clock narrows options during the repositioning. Development is thematic (cycle of endings and beginnings) rather than tactical. Payoff is conceptual (planning for spring). Functional causal role with modest pressure contribution.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Marta's desire "to reflect light into dark corners" is established early (paragraph five) and dramatized through her mirror array and its effects on neighbors. Setup is clear. Development appears in her acknowledgment of limits ("It wasn't much") and her decision to continue anyway, accepting the ache of loving fragile things. The motivation drives the repositioning action and shapes the closure commitment to plant again in spring. One friction: the desire costs her emotional exposure and ongoing effort with uncertain impact. The motivation could be more conflicted—no competing want pulls against it—but it's felt rather than merely told. Swappability is moderate; "bring beauty" or "offer comfort" could substitute with edits.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tone of "protected vulnerability" is coherent throughout: Marta's practical routines shield her tenderness, which she allows herself to feel fully in the "quivering hush" beat. The tone modulates under pressure—tighter during the rosebush observation, softer during the harbor reflection, purposeful during repositioning. Setup is immediate (counting blooms with "wistfully pragmatic attention"). Development occurs when she lets down the shield ("she allowed herself to simply feel it"). Payoff charges the final image: she remains "keeper of a fire escape garden...holding space for beauty even as it fell away." The tone is not static; it breathes with the narrative arc. Removing this tonal thread would flatten Marta's characterization and the thematic resonance.</comment>
