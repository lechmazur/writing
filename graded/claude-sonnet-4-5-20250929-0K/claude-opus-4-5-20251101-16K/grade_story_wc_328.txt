<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elena's interiority is concrete and moves through embodied decision—she feels her "scientific mind ache," her breath crystallizes, and her bitterness thaws into metamorphosis. The final renunciation (leaving without recordings) is earned by prior causality: the arrowhead pointing at her chest, the garden's lessons. However, her initial motivation to "prove them wrong" reads generic, and the transition from career-driven researcher to wonder-accepting wanderer compresses key internal contradiction into a single passage rather than letting contradictory impulses act simultaneously across beats. The choice forecloses her career with visible cost, satisfying the requirement.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through sensory density, pattern recurrence (gravity defiance, bitterness→metamorphosis), and cadence shifts until the final renunciation reweights the Institute's demand. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the opening paragraph. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration: Elena's renunciation of evidence-gathering forecloses her career path with visible cost ("disgrace," career end), and the final image ("the beginning") recharges the opening stake with a felt trade-off. One meaningful deepening occurs when the arrowhead points at her own heart, narrowing her options. Minor causality slip: how the phone captures Margit's voice "two chambers away" while she sleeps is under-motivated, but the effect serves the accumulative pattern and does not break closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The underground garden is vividly particular—seeds root in ceiling-soil, water pools in midair, lavender blooms upside-down—and these details constrain Elena's understanding and final choice. The arrowhead (micro-setting object) recurs with reweighted function: a seal, then a diagnostic tool pointing at her heart, then a returned anchor that releases her. Spatial choreography is clean (ceiling-soil, two chambers, recording equipment placement). The cold, the mint-and-wild scent, and the roots reaching "like curious fingers" are filtered through Elena's scientific-then-wonder POV. The garden's defiance of physics directly charges the closure image: her acceptance of "gravitationally playful" strangeness justifies walking away from the Institute.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: document/retrieve the garden's secret for the Institute versus honoring the garden's untamed harmony. Escalation tightens when Elena realizes the Institute wants to "weaponize grief," then when the arrowhead points at her own bitterness, forcing a choice. The final renunciation (leaving without recordings) is driven by her agency and forecloses her career with on-page cost. However, the garden's "release" feels slightly convenient—roots let go "gently" once she returns the arrowhead—reducing the visceral price of the choice. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, and the cost is legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—bitterness transformed into wonder, grief inverted into playful defiance of natural law—emerges through concrete images (upside-down lavender, the arrowhead diagnostic, the phone's static confessions) rather than assertion. The final image offers a non-literal answer: "the beginning" recasts career failure as liberation, and "the cosmic joke" reweights the Institute's calculus without moralizing. Subtext operates in Margit's recorded voice, the son's ambiguous return, and Elena's silent choice to replace the arrowhead. Minor slip: "some harmonies couldn't be tamed, only joined" edges toward a thematic echo, though it remains embedded in Elena's embodied realization rather than narrated thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Elena's scientific-then-wonder lens; perceptual signature (crystallizing breath, "scientific mind ache") is distinct. The phone dialogue is purposeful and goal-driven, carrying subtext about grief and transformation. Psychic distance tightens appropriately under pressure. However, two register slips: "gravitationally playful" and "frostbitten hope" read as prompt-adjacent labels rather than Elena's organic idiom, especially under stress. "Calcified bitterness" and "metamorphose" recur in ways that feel concept-first. Free indirect style is otherwise clean, and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is largely clear and propulsive, with strong images ("water pooled in midair," "roots unwound... like curious fingers"). Rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is mostly controlled. However, several artifacts accumulate: "gravitationally playful" appears three times in identical phrasing (decorative repetition); "metamorphose" is both verb and noun across adjacent paragraphs (synonym churn); "static-laden confession" recurs without variation. The phrase "frostbitten hope" in the opening and "Frostbitten hope—that's what this place offered" is a paraphrase loop. Template cadence in the ending: "She carried... She carried... She called..." These issues do not obscure closure but dull line-level sharpness. Deductions: −0.6 for patterned artifacts, −0.2 for paraphrase loop.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—underground garden defying physics as externalized grief—offers a fresh synthesis of magical realism and cryptid research. The arrowhead as diagnostic tool and the phone capturing "something deeper than sound" are inventive. However, the emotional arc (proving-them-wrong researcher learns wonder) is a familiar template, and the Institute-as-weaponizer is a stock antagonist. The "cosmic joke" frame and the son's ambiguous return add specificity, and the choice to leave without evidence transforms the expected retrieval plot. Risk-taking is moderate; the piece executes its concept cleanly but does not fully subvert the undercover-researcher-finds-redemption arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena (cryptid researcher undercover) is present from the opening, frames the setup, drives the middle choice (taking the arrowhead), and makes the final renunciation (leaving without recordings). Her professional identity constrains her initial goal and her final choice forecloses her career. She is causally active in three beats and shapes closure. Swappability is low; her scientific lens and Institute employment are necessary to the stakes. However, "undercover" itself does little work—Margit never discovers her, so the undercover element adds no tension or tactical pressure beyond framing her dual identity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The flint arrowhead appears in beat one (ceiling-soil), is taken by Elena (beat two), vibrates and points at her heart (beat three, escalation), and is returned to the ceiling-soil (beat four, closure trigger). It evolves from seal to diagnostic to anchor, with visible cost: taking it breaks the seal, returning it releases her but forecloses retrieval. Early signal, multi-beat causal work, closure linkage, and irreplaceability (its pointing function is specific). Minor friction: its mechanics (why it points at "the heaviest heart") are asserted rather than discovered through Elena's action.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"A harmony untamed" is signaled early (the garden defies physics) and shapes Elena's final stance: she chooses to "join" rather than "tame." The concept appears in the climax passage ("witnessed a harmony untamed") and charges the ending ("some harmonies couldn't be tamed, only joined"). However, it functions primarily as theme rather than constraining on-page tactics; Elena's choice to return the arrowhead is driven by her bitterness-diagnosis, not by learning how to join the harmony. Lyric resonance is present but causal pressure is light.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Gravitationally playful" is used three times: opening description (seeds float, water pools midair), final realization ("gravitationally playful"), and closing reflection ("the universe was this strange"). It signals the garden's physics-defiance early and charges Elena's acceptance of wonder at closure. However, it remains descriptive rather than enabling or constraining on-page action—Elena does not navigate gravity-defiance tactically; she observes it. The attribute reweights meaning at the end but does not alter her tactics. Swappability is moderate; "physics-defying" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Metamorphose" is signaled early (three-month timeline, Margit's transformation of bitterness), drives the middle turn (the garden metamorphoses around Elena, roots reach), and Elena's interior arc (bitterness metamorphoses into wonder). The verb recurs at closure: her choice is to allow transformation rather than weaponize it. Causal linkage is strong; the action redefines her options. Minor friction: the word itself appears in narration as both verb and abstract noun ("metamorphose" / "metamorphosis"), reading slightly templated. Irreplaceability is high; the specific transformation logic shapes the ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The old cordless phone is present early (rigged recording equipment), delivers Margit's and the son's static-laden confessions across three beats, and dissolves into "laughter, or wind, or both" at closure. Its mechanics (capturing "frequencies," "something deeper than sound") are asserted and matter to the method. However, Elena does not use it tactically—she listens passively. The phone does not enable her final choice; she returns the arrowhead independent of phone input. It shapes atmosphere and delivers exposition but does not constrain her attempts. Two-gate presence (setup, closure cameo) but weak development.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The herbalist's underground garden is present from the opening, supplies the setting for all action, and its physics-defying properties constrain Elena's understanding and final choice. The ceiling-soil holds the arrowhead; the cold and the roots' reach create embodied pressure. The garden's "rules from somewhere beyond" directly charge her renunciation: she cannot capture/weaponize what she cannot control. Spatial choreography (ceiling, chambers, equipment placement) is clean. The setting is irreplaceable; moving the story above-ground or to a conventional garden would collapse the stakes. Early signal, multi-beat involvement, closure linkage, high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"After the missing return changed everything" anchors the timeframe early (Margit's son reappeared after seven years, prompting Institute notice and Elena's three-month undercover stint). The backstory frames causality but does not create a live ticking clock. Elena's present-scene choices are not time-pressured; she could document indefinitely. The "after" signals a shift but does not tighten tactics. Present at setup and referenced at closure (the son's voice on the phone), but the timeframe is structural rather than urgent. Two-gate lyric presence; minimal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Margit's motivation ("to turn bitterness into a cosmic joke") is voiced through the phone in beat two, shaping the garden's origin and thematic spine. Elena's parallel motivation (her own "calcified bitterness" wanting to prove colleagues wrong) is dramatized when the arrowhead points at her heart, forcing her to choose transformation over weaponization. The motivation drives the final renunciation with visible cost. However, Elena's bitterness is told more than shown in contradictory on-page choices; her initial scenes are observational rather than defensive or aggressive. Two-beat causal work, closure linkage, but friction between want and cost could be sharper.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Frostbitten hope" is named early, embodied in the garden's "perpetual cold" and "frostbitten stalks of lavender," and charges the final image: Elena walks into "cold morning light" smiling at the absurd hope of the "cosmic joke." Tone is coherent through turns—wonder tinged with cold, loss transformed into playful defiance—and modulates with pressure (scientific ache → thawing bitterness → smiling liberation). The oxymoron is purposeful and specific to the garden's wounded-possibility aesthetic. Early signal, sensory embodiment across beats, closure charge. Minor friction: "frostbitten hope" is named twice in identical phrasing, reading slightly label-like.</comment>
