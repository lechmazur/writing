<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is specific and embodied—her blithe affect amid death, her "cemetery-roughened fingers," her patient decoding work. However, the character reads more as a vehicle for discovery than someone whose internal contradictions drive choices under pressure. The final "weight" she carries is asserted rather than felt as a lived cost that forecloses a path. No diagnostic label-speak, but the epiphany ("whole architectures of intention") arrives too cleanly without prior friction or trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational elements. Orientation anchors quickly (cemetery groundskeeper, October evening, Aldrich plot). The closure is a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing hybrid: Maren begins mapping secrets "by starlight, thread by tender thread," crystallizing her new role with felt weight ("three gold coins like a promise"). The cost is implied rather than on-page decisive—she will carry hidden truths forward—but the final image reweights the premise (tending graves now means tending buried architectures of intention) with undeniable pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs when she decodes the tapestry and understands Aldrich's map. The lens holds; the closure lands with conceptual cost legible in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cobalt silo is vividly particular ("paint flaking but still holding that deep blue color, luminous under moonlight") and functions as micro-setting: its curved wall displays the tapestry, the circular window tracks stars' passage, the dome shelters her "quiet archaeology." The velveteen gloom modulates from oppressive to "almost warm," mirroring Maren's shift. The cemetery and silo anchor all action; "cemetery-roughened fingers" and the stars as "indifferent witnesses" are filtered through Maren's sensibility. The final image charges the silo setting ("vast blue quiet") with thematic resonance. Minor: occupational detail (groundskeeping) is present but not deeply leveraged in choice-making.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to discover what Aldrich hid and why. Maren's agency is attention and endurance (hours of decoding) rather than decision against opposition; no reversals or trade-offs narrow her path—she simply succeeds. The tightening occurs when she realizes the tapestry's figures point to other caches, expanding scope rather than foreclosing options. The cost is conceptual (she will carry "new weight") but not dramatized as a visible loss or renunciation on the page. Pressure accumulates through texture (velveteen gloom, wheeling stars, thread by thread) rather than escalating conflict, fitting the Accumulative lens, but the lack of a live obstacle or price paid keeps this from higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—tending the dead's hidden truths with patience and lightness—emerges organically from Maren's work, the Aldrich backstory, and the tapestry's cipher. "Discover the shape of hidden intentions" is both instruction and confession, avoiding thesis-speak. The final image ("listening for uncharted echoes") offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Minor slip: "whole architectures of intention lay buried" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward abstract summary rather than letting the image speak, and "uncharted echoes" recurs as prompt-label without full dramatization of what "echoes" cost or enable. Still, the marigolds/sorrow frame and chess-clock motif reweight prior material effectively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and close to Maren; perceptual signature is consistent ("cemetery-roughened fingers," "quiet archaeology," blithe framing). Diction is elevated and lyric ("velveteen gloom," "stars wheeled through the circular window") but remains voice-motivated and legible. Psychic distance is controlled. Minor issues: some figurative density in non-peak beats ("reverberations of lives that had never been fully heard") and a slight tendency toward explanatory interiority ("She understood then," "She understood why") that tells what has been shown. No head-hopping; narrative stance modulates appropriately with Maren's discovery.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; opening and closing lines anchor stakes and image effectively. Information density is high in the tapestry-decoding passage. However, several scaffold/loop artifacts: "The velveteen gloom" appears twice verbatim; "patient/patience" recurs mechanically (three times); "tender/tenderly" (sovereign case "tenderly organized," "thread by tender thread") reads as template echo. Sentence stems converge: "Maren [verb]" opens multiple paragraphs. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "velveteen gloom" is evocative but borders on ornamental when repeated without evolving function. No major clarity issues, but cumulative texture drag and paraphrase loops (e.g., "waiting for someone curious enough to listen, patient enough to decode" restates "patient enough to hear" from the final line) lower momentum. Apply −0.8 for loops and template cadence across non-closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cemetery-groundskeeper-as-archaeologist premise is fresh, and the chess-clock/tapestry-cipher combination feels specific. However, the emotional arc (discovery → acceptance of weight) follows a familiar template without a non-obvious turn or moral calculus. The "blithe among headstones" frame is memorable, but Maren's ease of success (no failed attempts, no ambiguity in the decode) avoids risk. The story commits fully to its premise but does not transform the "hidden family secrets" trope beyond adding ornate detail. Within-band: no bold structural risk; the specificity (cobalt silo, frayed threads) is vivid but does not fundamentally alter the arc's predictability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maren (blithe cemetery gardener) is present throughout and her curiosity drives the search. She makes the choice to follow coordinates, enter the silo, and decode the tapestry. However, her "blithe" trait is established early ("humming among the headstones") but does not constrain or complicate her actions—she remains blithe without friction. The attribute shapes tone but not tactics. Appears in setup, middle (decoding), and ending (mapping by starlight), satisfying all three gates, but causal pressure is modest: her choice is to continue rather than to navigate a trade-off. Cap at ~6.0 for light causal weight; minor lift for closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The antique sovereign case is introduced early, contains the note and coordinates (setup), prompts her journey (middle), and returns at the ending ("tucked...into her coat pocket, feeling the weight...like a promise"), reweighted as a promise rather than mere clue. Three touches across beats; evolving meaning. However, the case itself does not constrain a choice—it simply unlocks the next step. The final reprise is lyric resonance rather than causal pressure. Eligible above 6.0 for all-gates + reprise; cap near ~6.7 for swappability (any container with a note would serve the same function) and lack of unique properties affecting tactics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Uncharted echoes" appears as phrase in the penultimate and final paragraphs but functions as thematic label rather than on-page mechanic. Maren discovers hidden caches (the echoes), but the concept does not change her options or tactics—she simply finds what was always there. No cost or constraint tied to "uncharted" versus charted. Present in closure paragraph but ornamental; does not shape a decision. Late explicit mention (~final third); no middle beat involvement. Cap at 4.6 for missing setup and middle gates; further penalty for label-only use: 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Tenderly organized" describes the sovereign case's interior (setup) and subtly recurs in "thread by tender thread" at the ending, creating a pattern of care. However, the trait does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost—it characterizes Aldrich's method and Maren's echo of it, but no action hinges on tenderness versus another approach. Lyric resonance across first and final beats; no middle development. Two-gate presence allows up to ~6.0, but swappability (any meticulous or deliberate phrasing would serve) and lack of causal pressure lower the score. 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Untangle" is signaled early (sovereign case note, frayed threads), drives the middle beat (decoding the tapestry cipher letter by letter), and frames the ending ("untangle what they'd left behind"). The action is specific and irreplaceable: the story hinges on patient decoding. However, Maren succeeds without false starts or trade-offs, so the action does not redefine options—it simply proceeds. All three gates; strong beat involvement; closure linkage. Cost is implied (hours, patience) but not a forfeiture. Eligible for ≥7.0; specific mechanics and closure presence lift to 7.3, but lack of visible cost or tactical shift caps below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The method (decoding frayed threads in the tapestry's border) is signaled at the midpoint, detailed in a substantial beat ("each colored strand a letter in some cipher only patience could reveal"), and produces the key revelation ("Discover the shape of hidden intentions"). The mechanics matter: Maren must decode thread by thread, a time-consuming constraint. Present in middle and shaping closure understanding. However, the method is introduced late (~midpoint, missing early setup) and no failed attempt or alternate approach appears, so its necessity is asserted rather than tested. Cap at ~4.6 for missing setup gate lifted by strong middle + closure linkage and specificity to 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt silo is introduced early (coordinates lead there), houses the workshop/tapestry (middle), and its "vast blue quiet" and stars charge the final image. The setting provides resources (tapestry, chess clock, circular window tracking time) and constrains Maren's investigation to this enclosed, liminal space. The silo's "luminous" blue under moonlight and "velveteen gloom" modulate tone and reflect Maren's shift. All three gates; causal and atmospheric pressure; closure linkage. The silo is irreplaceable (cobalt color, dome, isolation all serve the mystery's tone). Minor: the setting pressures mood more than tactics. 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"After the chess clock runs down" appears in the note (setup) and is realized at the silo (both flags fallen, time "long spent"). The timeframe enables Maren's discovery (she arrives only after those who might stop her have died), but it does not tighten her decisions on the page—there is no live countdown or urgency. The clock is symbolic rather than tactical. Setup and middle presence; contributes to causal logic (why now?) but does not shape Maren's tactics or the final image directly. Two gates allow up to ~6.0; subtract for passive rather than active pressure: 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"To discover the shape of intentions" is decoded mid-story and becomes Maren's explicit motivation, framing her final mapping work. However, the desire is not dramatized through conflicting wants or costs—Maren is curious, decodes successfully, and accepts the weight without friction. The motivation appears in setup (her curiosity drives the search) and closure (she begins mapping), but no middle beat shows her weighing the cost of continuing versus stopping. Two gates (setup via general curiosity, closure); no on-page conflict between wants and costs. Cap at ~6.0 for missing middle friction; small lift for closure framing: 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Velveteen gloom" appears twice verbatim (approaching the silo, then "almost warm" inside), modulates with Maren's emotional shift, and frames the ending's "vast blue quiet." The tone is coherent through discovery and charges the final image (soft, enveloping darkness becomes companionable rather than oppressive). However, the exact phrase "velveteen gloom" is repeated without evolution in the first mention, and the modulation is told ("felt almost warm now") rather than shown through perception shift. All three gates; tone shapes atmosphere and the closure image. Strong closure linkage and specificity; minor penalty for static repetition and telling: 7.2.</comment>
