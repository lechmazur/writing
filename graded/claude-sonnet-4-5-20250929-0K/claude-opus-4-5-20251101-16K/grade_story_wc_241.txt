<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior voice is consistent and specific—"theoretically rebellious" shows character-particular diction. Her motivation to "widen perspectives responsibly" shapes her choice to continue the journal project, and the contradiction between love and distance from her father's gambling is embodied through her actions. However, the emotional progression feels somewhat abstract; the shift from grief to peace arrives without sufficient embodied struggle or micro-choices under pressure in the library scene itself.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: the library discovery deepens understanding of the father's contradiction, and the final decision to ride the subway tomorrow reweights Mira's stance with visible cost (she accepts his contradictions as her own). Orientation is clean (who/where/when by the second paragraph). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis/Charged Poise hybrid): Mira commits to继续 the journal practice, foreclosing her prior distance, and the cost—letting grief become understanding—is legible in the final image of her sitting with his contradictions.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The rainwashed library is rendered through purposeful sensory detail: "that particular quality of light...like being inside a shell," ivy pressing "like curious fingers." The candle lantern with cloudy mica constrains the atmosphere and charges the final image ("soft shadows that seemed to move like water"). The setting's post-storm quiet mirrors Mira's reflective state without overt symbolism, and midsummer rain bookends the scene, modulating tone as pressure shifts from discovery to acceptance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding her father's contradiction—is clear and signaled early. One meaningful deepening occurs: the journal reveals he was mapping human contradiction, not just gambling irrationally, which narrows Mira's prior judgment and opens a new path (continuing his work). However, the escalation is primarily cognitive; no on-page obstacle or secondary pressure tests her resolve. The decision to ride the subway and add her own messages carries implied cost (accepting his pattern) but lacks a visible tradeoff or complication in the scene itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the journal's scrawls and Mira's realization: contradiction between reason and hope is human terrain, not failure. The candle's cloudy mica and the post-rain atmosphere work as non-literal vehicles. "Letting grief become understanding, letting understanding become something like peace" risks tidy resolution, but the commitment to continue his practice (not to gamble, but to witness) offers a resonant answer without moralizing. The final image reweights "lucid contradiction" through acceptance rather than reconciliation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mira; psychic distance narrows appropriately during the journal discovery. Diction is controlled and voice-particular: "traverse the distance between what he knew and what he felt," "small those lines had been." No head-hopping. The prose reflects Mira's analytical yet emotional lens ("mathematics became magic, where the house edge dissolved into hope"). Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices contradictions, maps terrain, interprets. Minor slip: "green growing things" in the opening leans slightly generic for this voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high. Figurative language is controlled: "ivy pressed against the glass like curious fingers," "soft shadows that seemed to move like water." Some scaffold remains: "She understood then" is a visible hinge rather than dramatized realization, and "Now she saw how small those lines had been" summarizes insight that could be shown through micro-choice. The opening line's inversion ("lucid contradiction") is striking, but "green growing things" and "soft as clover" trend toward stock pastoral. No loops or template cadence in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—probability professor's gambling mapped through subway graffiti—is specific and non-obvious. The frame avoids grief-story templates by focusing on intellectual inheritance rather than loss processing. However, the emotional arc (distance → understanding → peace) follows a familiar shape, and the library-as-sanctuary setting is conventional. The journal's content (cryptic scrawls as philosophical cartography) offers a fresh inflection, and the decision to continue the project rather than resolve it transforms the trope. Risk-taking is moderate; the piece commits fully but does not destabilize expectations.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira (the daughter) is present throughout and makes the key choice to continue the journal practice, which alters her stance from observer to participant. However, her father (the compulsive gambler probability professor) appears only in backstory and the journal; no on-page choice by him drives a turn. Setup is early (first paragraph); development occurs via the journal discovery; payoff is her decision to ride the subway. The character shapes two beats (discovery, decision) and contributes to closure, but the gambler himself is absent from scene action.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The candle lantern with mica pane appears twice: introduced mid-scene ("sat his other bequest") and reprised in the final paragraph ("The candle flickered behind its cloudy mica pane"). The cloudy mica is described as "like a cataract" and throws "soft shadows that seemed to move like water," but it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. Setup is late (past the first third); no middle development; closure participation is atmospheric only. The object is specific but remains ornamental; removing it would not break story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Lucid contradictions" is introduced in the opening line and shapes the entire arc: Mira's father embodies it (knowing probability yet gambling), and her realization that she lives a smaller version (loving him while drawing lines) drives the closure choice. The concept reappears explicitly in the final paragraph ("sat with her father's contradictions, letting them become her own"). It structures stakes (understanding vs. judgment) and the resolution (acceptance of contradiction). Setup is immediate; development threads through the journal discovery; payoff reweights her stance. The concept is indispensable to closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Theoretically rebellious" is applied to both father and Mira in the journal section: "Her father, like Mira herself, had been theoretically rebellious all his life—questioning axioms, publishing papers that challenged colleagues' fundamental assumptions." It is labeled but does not constrain an on-page choice with visible cost. The trait aligns with her decision to continue an unconventional practice, but the connection is thematic rather than causal. Setup is mid-scene; no middle beat applies the trait under pressure; closure echoes it obliquely. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Traverse" appears three times: the father "tried to traverse the distance between what he knew and what he felt," Mira's motivation is "to widen perspectives responsibly...to traverse," and she will "traverse the strange territory between reason and hope." The action is metaphorical and shapes the thematic frame, but it does not drive a concrete on-page turn. Setup is early (implicit in the father's journal work); development is thematic (Mira's realization); payoff is her commitment to continue. The verb is specific to the concept but could be replaced with "bridge" or "navigate" without breaking logic. It anchors theme more than plot.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The method—interpreting cryptic scrawls on subway seats—is introduced early (journal entries list scrawls and his analysis) and drives the key discovery: the father was mapping human contradiction through strangers' messages. It shapes Mira's realization ("This was how he had tried to traverse the distance") and her closure decision to ride the subway and continue the practice. Setup is early (journal section); development is the interpretive work he did; payoff is her commitment tomorrow. The method is indispensable; removing it collapses the story's logic and Mira's inheritance path.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The rainwashed library at midsummer is established in the second paragraph and sustained throughout the single scene. The setting supplies the reflective atmosphere and the physical anchor (table by tall windows, ivy pressing the glass), and the rain's return in the final paragraph modulates tone ("gentler now, a whisper"). However, the library does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it is a container for discovery rather than an active pressure. Setup is immediate; it threads through all beats; closure uses the rain to charge the final image. Essential to tone but not to plot logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"After the heart attack" is stated in the second paragraph and frames the entire present action: Mira is in the library because her father has died. The timeframe is not live or ticking; it sets the condition for discovery but does not tighten decisions. Setup is early; it motivates the scene but does not develop mid-scene; payoff is implied (she will honor him by continuing the journal). The temporal anchor is functional—it explains why she has the journal—but it could be replaced with "after he died" or "after the funeral" without altering story mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mira's motivation "to widen perspectives responsibly" is stated explicitly mid-scene and drives her past behavior (keeping distance from his gambling while loving him) and her closure choice (continuing his journal practice without adopting the addiction). The motivation is told rather than dramatized in conflict, but it shapes the decision with visible cost: she will "traverse the strange territory" he mapped, accepting his contradictions. Setup is mid-scene; development is her realization that he shared this goal; payoff is the commitment to ride the subway. Functional and contributes to closure, but the lack of on-page friction or competing want keeps it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Clover melancholy" is sustained through diction ("soft as clover" in the final line, "pearlescent" light, "whisper" rain) and modulates with pressure: the opening is measured and analytical, the journal discovery deepens sorrow, and the ending shifts to "something like peace." The tone is coherent and specific, neither maudlin nor detached. It charges the final image (midsummer rain, candlelight, grief becoming understanding). Setup is immediate (the opening's measured sorrow); development is the tonal deepening at the journal revelation; payoff is the quiet acceptance in the last paragraph. The tone is indispensable to the story's emotional register and closure effect.</comment>
