<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Della's interiority is concrete and character-specific throughout, particularly her quest to "capture the sound of trust breaking" which drives embodied choices across the false starts. The confrontation with Carver pays off with genuine contradiction—her capacity to expose him versus her choice not to—rooted in accumulated understanding rather than expedient mercy. Carver's confession ("they had my boy") lands with earned weight, showing the "terrible arithmetic of loving one person more than your word." Minor: the father's silence is told rather than shown breaking on the page, reducing the emotional cost of that pivot.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal-Hybrid: reconnaissance through false starts narrows Carver's patterns, then Della's final positioning forces the confession that reweights her understanding. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Della chooses not to expose Carver, pocketing the watch fob and walking home with new knowledge that might restore her father's voice—cost is visible in her renunciation of vengeance and acceptance of ambiguity. Orientation anchors cleanly (pier market, sunrise deadline, watch fob) within the first two paragraphs. One meaningful tightening occurs when the false starts cohere into tactical advantage, then the watch-fob reveal crystallizes Carver's vulnerability.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The pirate market setting constrains choice throughout: the "truce of hush" prevents violence before transaction, forcing Della's tactical repositioning rather than direct confrontation. Spatial choreography is clean (stairs, stalls between beams, eastern exit, medicine stall) and micro-setting details like the watch fob catching lantern light charge the climactic beat. The rotting pier's sensory texture—brine, copper light, barnacles—filters through Della's familiarity ("homelike, this wrongness") rather than tourist catalog. The sunrise timeframe tightens her moves and the market's dissolution at dawn underscores the ephemeral truce.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding Carver to understand her father's breaking) is signaled early and drives all three false starts, each narrowing options under the truce constraint. The escalation is causal: each failed approach teaches Carver's tells, culminating in Della's passive positioning with the watch fob—a reversal of her initial aggressive impulse. The confession arrives with visible cost: Carver's moral arithmetic and Della's choice to withhold punishment foreclose vengeance while accepting ambiguity. The truce rule creates persistent pressure; coincidence does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the watch fob (won in the card game that started the partnership), the "truce of hush" (loyalty code among thieves), and the sound of trust breaking ("sharp as ice giving way underfoot"). The final image answers the thematic question without moralizing: "some broken things, known fully, hurt less than mysteries." Della's renunciation of exposure in favor of understanding reweights the opening quest; the piece resists simplistic forgiveness while honoring the "impossible choice" Carver faced. No prompt echo or late thesis statement mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Della; perceptual signature is consistent (moonshine runner's daughter who "understood silence the way other girls understood needlework"). Distance modulates purposefully: tighter during the false starts, slightly elevated for reflection on the father's silence, then intimate again at closure. Carver's fragmented confession ("I didn't—" "Your daddy, he—") contrasts with Della's controlled interiority. Minor: a few filter verbs ("she spotted," "she tried") in early beats are acceptable but stack slightly; the phrase "curiously steadfast" recurs without full dramatization of the contradiction it implies.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high: most sentences advance character or pressure without padding. Minor loop: "The market dissolved behind her, vendors packing wares into shadows, the truce of hush extending into daylight where none of this had happened, where trust remained theoretical and unbroken" restates the truce concept without adding pressure. The phrase "curiously steadfast" appears twice as a modifier without new work. No major muddle or template cadence, but a light scaffold residue in mid-story transitions lowers momentum slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The combination of pirate market, moonshine runner heritage, and the quest to "capture the sound of trust breaking" offers a fresh synthesis; the truce-of-hush rule transforms standard market-confrontation into tactical positioning. The false-starts method is well-executed and the watch fob's dual history (Carver's grandfather, won by Della's father) adds specific irony. The ending resists both vengeance satisfaction and easy forgiveness, landing on knowledge as partial consolation. Slight proximity to "thieves' code" tropes and the "rotting pier at night" setting, though the execution elevates them above template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Della drives all key turns: her three false starts teach Carver's patterns, her final positioning with the watch fob forces confession, and her choice to withhold exposure and walk home with knowledge constitutes the closure. She is present and causal in setup (descent to market), development (reconnaissance through failure), and payoff (silent confrontation, renunciation of vengeance). Removing her agency would collapse the plot.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The watch fob appears in setup (pressed in Della's palm, brass worn smooth), development (she considers bribing with it, keeps it as anchor), and payoff (catches lantern light to trigger Carver's recognition and confession). Its dual history—Carver's grandfather's, won by Della's father—charges the final beat and her act of pocketing it rather than using it as weapon or bribe. Specific, irreplaceable object that alters the confrontation's tactics and meaning.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The truce of hush shapes stakes and tactics throughout: "no violence until merchandise changed hands" prevents Della's initial knife move, forcing the false-start reconnaissance. It constrains all her approaches and makes the final passive positioning necessary. The concept is signaled early, governs middle beats, and the ending notes its extension "into daylight where none of this had happened." Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; cost is implicit in the forced renunciation of direct confrontation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Curiously steadfast" appears twice as a descriptor but does not constrain a specific choice with visible cost. Della's persistence through the false starts demonstrates steadfastness, yet the "curious" contradiction (steadfast despite fear? despite knowing the market's dangers?) is asserted rather than dramatized in a trade-off moment. Present in setup and reprise but ornamental rather than causally active. Mid-band for thematic resonance without mechanical necessity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Thwart" is implicit rather than explicit: Della could thwart Carver's reputation by exposing him but chooses not to. The action is more renunciation than active thwarting. The story notes she "could have thwarted his reputation with a single shouted accusation" but this is told potential rather than dramatized event. Present in closure consideration but swappable with "expose" or "ruin" without structural change. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The false-starts method is taught early (first approach with knife, second with bribe, third at exit), structures the entire middle, and pays off when "the false starts weren't failures—they were reconnaissance." Each attempt reveals Carver's patterns and nervous tells, enabling the final passive gambit. The method shapes all three development beats and is essential to the causal chain leading to confession. Mechanics matter: observation rather than confrontation becomes the tactic. Indispensable to the plot's architecture.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The pirate market setting is signaled in the opening line, constrains all action via the truce rule, and provides the tactical terrain (stalls, exits, medicine stall, lantern light for the watch fob reveal). The rotting pier's "comfortable unease" and "homelike wrongness" filter through Della's expertise. The market's dissolution at sunrise mirrors the closure. Setting supplies both the rule-set and the physical resources that alter outcome. Strong integration across all three gates with causal and atmospheric pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The sunrise deadline is signaled early ("She had until sunrise to find Carver Nell"), tightens pressure as "hours bled toward dawn" and "sky was lightening to gray," and the final image occurs "as sunrise painted the pier's rot in gold." Time drives the three false starts and the urgency to position before the market dissolves. The clock is tracked and alters tactics. Not as mechanically tight as a chase countdown, but present in setup, middle urgency, and closure image with cost (running out of time forces the passive gambit).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation to "capture the sound of trust breaking" is signaled early and frames Della's quest, but the dramatization leans toward metaphor: "she heard it anyway: the crack of trust breaking, sharp as ice giving way underfoot." This is internal perception rather than a choice with friction. The motivation drives her to find Carver and fuels her persistence, yet the "sound" remains abstract—she gains understanding but does not literally capture or record anything. Present in setup and closure reflection, functional in driving reconnaissance, but thetel-tale particularity of "capture the sound" is more lyric conceit than mechanical stake.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Tone of "comforting unease" is established early ("safe among thieves because at least their dangers were familiar... homelike, this wrongness") and modulates with pressure: tense during false starts, contemplative at the reconnaissance insight, charged at the confession, then quiet-resolute at closure. The paradox coheres across turns and the final image—walking home with "betrayal's frequency still ringing in her ears, curiously steadfast in her belief"—sustains the tone without flattening into single mood. Strong execution with clear modulation tied to escalation and the ending's emotional register.</comment>
