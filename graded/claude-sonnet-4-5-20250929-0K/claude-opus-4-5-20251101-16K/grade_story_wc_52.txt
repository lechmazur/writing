<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marta's interior life is concrete and embodied—"feeling for the grain," the specific memory of Henrich collapsing "between breakfast and the morning news." The contradiction between grief and practicality operates simultaneously through carved objects that "contain what might otherwise spill." Her philosophy ("Grief that clings becomes a cage") is earned through Henrich's example with Empress rather than asserted, and the final choice to continue carving forecloses sentimentality with visible cost: she accepts impermanence through action. Minor deduction: the phrase "hauntingly practical" as both badge and sister's criticism edges toward self-aware labeling, though it's anchored in relational friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening: loft, rain, October, Marta at her workbench. The dominant stake—how to process Henrich's death—tightens through the kettle countdown and deepens when she moves from blank to emerging muzzle, crystallizing her philosophy in the act of carving. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): "Here and gone. But not nothing" is paid off in the final image of the lioness beginning to breathe in the wood, reweighting loss as presence through craft with the cost of ongoing, solitary labor made visible. The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: density increases through layered reflection, rain imagery, and the physical work, then the final cadence shift ("a lioness began to breathe") recharges prior material. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The loft is vivid and purposeful: "rain-beaded skylight," "rust-hued peace," the kettle and workbench create a coherent micro-setting. The ash wood blank itself functions as object-as-setting, constraining Marta's physical engagement and anchoring her philosophical stance through tactile resistance ("soft resistance"). Rain modulates from drumming to whispers, tracking emotional arc. The skylight's shifting light charges the final contemplative beat. No major lapses; the setting genuinely pressures her choice to continue carving rather than merely framing it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning to release rather than cling—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure accumulates through the kettle countdown (a live ticking clock), the act of carving (physical and philosophical labor), and the layered reflections on Henrich and Empress that deepen her understanding. The story delivers one meaningful tightening: the shift from abstract philosophy ("here and gone") to enacted practice as she lifts the gouge again, forecloses retreat, and accepts the ongoing discipline of remembering well. The cost is visible: solitary, repeated labor with no closure beyond the work itself. Agency is clear—she chooses to carve rather than weep or refuse—and the choice narrows options (no easier grief) with felt weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from carved objects, the kettle's steam, rain's impermanence, and the lions' cycle. "Here and gone. But not nothing" avoids thesis statement by anchoring in the muzzle emerging from wood and Marta's hands continuing the work. The final image—"a lioness began to breathe"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: presence persists through craft and attention, not permanence. Subtext operates in silence (just watching the light) and the chamomile's "domestic and ancient" scent. Minor issue: "The lessons she harvested" in the penultimate section edges toward thematic echo, though it's embedded in reflection rather than closing sermon. The piece resists moralizing and embraces complexity without false balance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds steady with Marta's perceptual signature: she notices grain, tool resistance, light shifts—craft-focused and tactile. Diction is controlled and voice-particular: "rust-hued peace," "pale bone," "brief cool weight against her palms." Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during carving and opening for reflection. The prose reflects her mind under moderate pressure without slipping into generic register. One minor slip: "hauntingly practical—a phrase meant as criticism but worn like a badge" momentarily rises to a slightly meta-aware articulation, though it's anchored in her sister's voice and remains within plausible self-knowledge. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentences range from terse action ("She lifted her gouge again") to layered reflection. Information density is high—most lines do double duty (rain tracks time and emotion; carved pieces catalog loss). Two patterns create mild friction: (1) "Here and gone" recurs four times, threading motif but risking echo in close quarters; (2) a few abstract phrases ("hauntingly practical," "strange rust-hued peace") slightly elevate diction. No paraphrase loops or template cadence in peak beats. The kettle whistle, rain slowing, and "a lioness began to breathe" are clean, propulsive anchors. Clarity and concision are strong; the final image recharges prior material without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of widowhood, woodcarving, and big-cat legacy is specific and non-obvious; the piece avoids grief-template predictability by grounding philosophy in craft rather than therapy or memorial ritual. The kettle countdown and ash-wood resistance add fresh texture. Risk: the reflective mode is bold for flash length and succeeds in building pressure through accumulation. Minor deduction: the "here and gone" formulation, while earned, brushes against familiar impermanence rhetoric; the story's particularity (Empress, the loft, Henrich's collapse timing) saves it from abstraction. The transformation test passes—swap Marta for another widow and the emotional arc loses its craft-specific anchor.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marta (lion tamer's widow) is present throughout, anchored in paragraph one. Her choices drive all beats: she sets the kettle, picks up the gouge, pauses to make tea, lifts the gouge again. The middle beat—pouring tea and sitting without working—demonstrates her deliberate pacing. The final choice to resume carving redefines her relationship to loss and forecloses easier paths. Her specific history (thirty years beside Henrich, the lions, his collapse) constrains her present stance. The identity is essential: remove "widow" or the lion legacy and the stake collapses.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The ash wood blank appears in beats one, three, and five. Beat one: she turns it, feeling for grain. Beat three: she defines the head and jawline. Beat five: Empress's muzzle emerges; she watches light shift across it and then resumes work. Its physical properties matter—"soft resistance," "pale bone"—and the act of carving is the vehicle for containing grief. The final image ("somewhere in the ash wood, a lioness began to breathe") recharges it with life and stakes. Swapping for clay or stone would alter the tactile and symbolic charge. High integration: setup, development, and closure payoff all present with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Here and gone" is seeded in paragraph four, shapes the middle reflection on Henrich's lesson ("open his hands when the time came"), and is reprised twice in the penultimate section, reweighting from fear to acceptance. It directly alters Marta's stance: instead of clinging, she carves knowing the work is temporary. The concept constrains her choices—she cannot freeze time, only "contain moments like water in cupped hands." The final image (the lioness breathing in wood) embodies the concept: presence despite transience. Not merely thematic; it reconfigures her relationship to loss with visible cost (ongoing solitary labor).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Hauntingly practical" is introduced early as her sister's criticism and worn as a badge. It enables Marta's choice to carve rather than weep, constraining her to a specific grief style. The trait appears in beat one (she doesn't refuse meals, she carves) and is echoed when she adopts Henrich's open-handed philosophy. The tradeoff: emotional directness is sacrificed for craft discipline. Minor deduction: the phrase itself is slightly elevated and self-aware, though anchored in relational friction. The trait shapes tactics and the final stance, making it more than ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Contain" is signaled in paragraph five: "Each piece was a way to contain what might otherwise spill and flood." It drives the middle beat—she works to "contain moments like water in cupped hands"—and the final turn: by lifting the gouge again she enacts containment through craft rather than suppression. The verb is irreplaceable; "preserve" or "hold" lack the dual sense of restraint and vessel. The action redefines her relationship to grief with cost: she accepts that containment is temporary (water slips through) but necessary. Present in setup, middle choice, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Crystallized time" appears twice: paragraph five ("crystallize time into something she could hold") and the penultimate section ("The afternoon stretched before her, crystallized into this single purpose"). It describes her method—turning temporal flow into carved objects—and shapes the middle beat where she realizes "here and gone" can be honored through attention rather than permanence. The mechanics matter: carving is the means of crystallization, not mere description. Minor deduction: the method is more explained than enacted in a pivotal choice; it underwrites rather than drives a turn. Still, it's essential to her philosophy and closure stance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft is anchored in the opening line and returns in beats throughout: rain drums, light shifts, droplets slide. The skylight provides the changing light Marta watches in beat five. The enclosed, elevated space mirrors her withdrawal into craft and shapes her solitude. Rain's modulation from drumming to whispers tracks emotional arc. The workbench, kettle, and stove create a coherent micro-environment. The setting constrains her to this single, self-sufficient space and charges the final contemplative moment. Swapping for a generic studio would lose the rain/impermanence motif and the skylight's role in lighting the blank.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The kettle timeframe is introduced in beat one ("kettle began its low murmur"), tightened in beat two ("perhaps three minutes left"), and resolved in beat three ("The kettle screamed"). It creates urgency, constraining Marta to complete the jawline before the whistle. The countdown structures the first half and provides a discrete unit of pressure. After the tea is poured, the frame shifts to "the afternoon stretched before her," which is less immediate but thematically apt (crystallized time). The timeframe shapes tactics in the opening beats and provides rhythm. Minor deduction: after the kettle resolves, time becomes more atmospheric than constraining.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"To harvest lessons from loss" is present from paragraph five onward. The desire is dramatized: she carves to learn Henrich's open-handed philosophy rather than merely mourn. The friction is visible—"hauntingly practical" vs. her sister's expectation of weeping—and the cost is solitary, repetitive craft labor. The motivation shapes every choice: picking up the gouge, defining the muzzle, lifting it again at the end. The final beat enacts the lesson ("deserving the love while it lasted...remembering well") through resumed work. The motivation is indispensable; without it the carving is merely therapeutic rather than philosophical.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Rust-hued peace" appears in paragraph six ("In the rust-hued peace of the loft") and is echoed in the penultimate section ("the strange rust-hued peace that comes...from remembering well"). The tone is coherent: elegiac but not mournful, contemplative with forward motion. Rain, chamomile, and the lioness emerging create a consistent register. The tone modulates subtly—urgency during the kettle countdown, stillness when she sits with tea—and charges the final image where the lioness breathes (life persisting in stillness). Minor deduction: "rust-hued" is slightly ornamental on first use, though the reprise earns it thematically. The tone is essential to the piece's accumulative pressure.</comment>
