<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vael's motivation is clear and rooted in twelve-thousand-year boredom that has become "erosion of purpose." The immortal's obsession with "what happens after goodbye" drives the decisive act of stepping through the rift. However, the protagonist's interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical language ("hollow and aching," "profound, terrifying peace of completion") rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice feels dramatized but the emotional texture leading to it remains more told than shown through micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors appear by the second paragraph (Vael, prismatic escondite, twelve thousand years). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: magnetic storm → curse awakens → rift opens → Vael steps through, with each beat reweighting the dominant stake (crossing the threshold to discover what lies beyond goodbye). Closure lands on the page as a Decisive Change with visible cost—Vael releases the amulet fragment and steps through, ending immortality. The cost is legible ("the profound, terrifying peace of completion"), though the final-paragraph moralizing ("that goodbye is never truly the end") slightly undercuts the image with thematic summary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite is vividly rendered: "light fractured into infinite spectrums," walls that "groan and shimmer," crystalline shards "sang with frequencies from adjacent realities." The setting directly enables the climax—the overlapping dimensions at the wall allow the rift to tear. Spatial choreography is clear (Vael presses fragment against wall, steps forward, rift seals behind). Micro-setting (the specific wall where dimensions overlap thinnest) constrains the key choice and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate test for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Vael's hunger to discover what happens after goodbye. The solar storm meaningfully tightens pressure—"spatial mutiny" creates the rare conditions Vael has waited three centuries for. One clear escalation: the curse tries to anchor Vael to immortality, but the spatial rebellion proves stronger, forcing the choice to release the fragment. The cost is visible on the page (immortality ends, amulet falls through rift, "one crystalline moment" of dual existence). Agency is protagonist-driven: Vael presses the fragment, releases it, and steps through.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The central question—"what happens after goodbye?"—is rendered through concrete images (the rift, the "vast, patient awareness," the released amulet) rather than abstraction. However, the final paragraph delivers overt thematic summary: "goodbye is never truly the end, only a door to something the living cannot name." This moralizing replaces scene pressure at closure, typical of a −0.5 to −0.8 penalty in Q5. The "profound, terrifying peace of completion" phrase also edges toward label-speak rather than earned resonance from particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Vael; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: Vael perceives "reality's layered membranes" and "dimensions stacked like pages." Diction is elevated and ornate throughout, matching the cosmic scale, though some phrases trend toward purple ("hushed thunder," "dormant malevolence"). The phrase "what every mortal discovers in time" in the final paragraph reads as narratorial intrusion rather than Vael's voice. No dialogue present to evaluate. Psychic distance remains consistent, though the final moralizing shifts slightly out of character focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Overwriting is pervasive: "prismatic," "infinite," "cosmic," "ancient," "corrosive," "dormant malevolence," "hushed thunder" cluster densely in descriptive mode without pattern-teaching or payoff beyond atmosphere. Mixed metaphors appear: "boredom had become something far more corrosive—an erosion of purpose" (corrosion vs. erosion blur). Register drifts into elevated abstractions ("profound, terrifying peace of completion") that don't match the tactile urgency of the rift scene. Paraphrase loop: "Pain lanced through Vael's hand—pain they hadn't felt in millennia—and they almost wept at its sharp, mortal beauty" restates "pain" three times without added information. Template cadence in the opening: "Once, it had been... Now only this shard remained..." Apply −0.8 for density + coherence issues, and −0.3 for paraphrase loop, totaling roughly −1.1 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The premise—immortal bored after twelve thousand years seeks to breach death's threshold—is familiar from countless genre treatments. The "prismatic escondite" and "spatial mutiny during solar storm" offer fresh specificity, but the emotional arc (immortal discovers peace in mortality) follows a well-worn template. The "cursed amulet fragment" and "dimensionally aware" traits function as standard fantasy furniture. Transformation test: swapping names and settings would leave the core beats and emotional resolution largely intact. Some ingenuity in the magnetic-field mechanism and the "presence" beyond the rift, but not enough to escape derivative-premise territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vael (bored immortal) is established in paragraph one, drives the middle choice (pressing the fragment against the wall during the storm), and steps through the rift at closure. The boredom is not passive observation—it has "become something far more corrosive" and compels the entire arc. Two distinct beats: waiting for the storm, then acting during it. Causal pressure: boredom → obsession → preparation → breach. Closure linkage: Vael's final step is the answer to the boredom. Cost: immortality ends. Specificity: twelve thousand years and the erosion metaphor make this irreplaceable. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.2, closure +1.5, cost +0.5, specificity +0.6 = ~8.3 baseline; round down to 7.8 for slight ornamental phrasing in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cursed amulet fragment is introduced in paragraph two, used in the climax (Vael presses it against the wall, it awakens and feeds on magnetic chaos, Vael releases it), and falls through the rift at closure. Three beats: introduction, activation, release. Causal: the fragment's curse is the "chain that bound Vael to endless existence," and its breaking enables the crossing. Closure: "its curse finally broken, its purpose finally complete." Cost: releasing it is the price of passage. Specificity: its curse and "dormant malevolence" are unique. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal +1.3, closure +1.4, cost +0.5, specificity +0.6 = ~8.8 baseline; slight summary phrasing ("its purpose finally complete") nudges down to 8.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny is named and explained in paragraph five ("rare cataclysms when reality's architecture rebelled against itself"), enables the rift to open, and is the condition Vael has "waited three centuries for." Two beats: introduction as concept, then active enabling of the rift. Causal: without spatial mutiny, the boundaries cannot tear. Closure: "the spatial mutiny had grown stronger than any binding." Cost: the mutiny's rarity imposes a three-century wait. Specificity: the term and mechanics are unique to this story. Early signal +0.5 (appears ~40% in), two beats +0.9, causal +1.4, closure +1.3, cost +0.4, specificity +0.7 = ~7.7; round to 7.9 for strong causal integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dimensionally aware is introduced in paragraph three ("not a gift but a sentence") and allows Vael to perceive "reality's layered membranes" and see "variations of endings." It enables the setup (Vael knows where to press the fragment) but does not visibly constrain a middle choice or appear at closure. One beat: the explanation paragraph. Causal: it informs Vael's preparation but doesn't narrow options on the page. No closure linkage. Cost: the trait is described as torment ("always watching them pass through that final threshold while remaining forever on this side") but this is told, not dramatized. Early signal +0.5, one beat +0.4, causal +0.6, no closure, cost (told) +0.2, specificity +0.4 = ~6.1; round to 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Intrigue is mentioned in paragraph six: "Other dimensionally aware entities had noticed Vael's preparations, had sent emissaries to dissuade and threaten." This is pure summary with no on-page scene, no named entities, no dramatized pressure. It does not drive a middle turn or appear at closure. One beat: the summary mention. No causal pressure—Vael has "outmaneuvered them all" off-page. No closure linkage. No visible cost. Swappable: the sentence could be cut without affecting the rift scene. Late first appearance (second half) −0.4, summary-only −0.7, ornamental −0.8, swappable −0.6 = start at 3.0, net ~1.5; round to 5.8 for minimal setup function.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Magnetic fields are introduced with the solar storm in paragraph four ("electromagnetic fury," "magnetic fields saturating Earth"), enable the rift by warping boundaries, and are referenced at closure ("magnetic fields pulled at the rift's edges"). Two beats: storm arrival, rift widening. Causal: "through those magnetic fields, Vael sensed the boundaries of space beginning to strain." Closure: the storm "peaked and faded" as the rift sealed. Cost: the method's rarity (three-century wait) and the pain it causes. Specificity: the magnetic mechanism is distinct. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal +1.3, closure +1.0, cost +0.4, specificity +0.6 = ~7.7; slight summary tone lowers to 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prismatic escondite is named in the opening line, its walls "groan and shimmer" under magnetic pressure, and it provides the specific wall "where dimensions overlapped thinnest" for Vael's breach. Three beats: introduction, storm reaction, rift location. Causal: the escondite's prismatic nature "scattered surveillance" (enables preparation) and its specific wall enables the rift. Closure: "stood empty" after Vael departs, and "light still fracturing through its wounded walls" charges the final image. Cost: the escondite is left behind. Specificity: "prismatic" and dimension-overlap are unique. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal +1.4, closure +1.2, cost +0.3, specificity +0.7 = ~8.8; slight ornamental final description lowers to 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The solar storm begins in paragraph four ("at dawn"), intensifies through paragraphs 7–9, and "peaked and faded" at closure. Two beats: onset, peak/fade. Causal: the storm creates the magnetic conditions for spatial mutiny. Closure: the rift seals "as the solar storm peaked and faded." Cost: the storm's rarity (three-century wait) and brief window create urgency. Specificity: the electromagnetic mechanism is tied to this event. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal +1.3, closure +1.0, cost +0.4, specificity +0.5 = ~7.6; slight vagueness in tracking the storm's duration lowers to 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation ("to discover what happens after goodbye") is introduced as "the question" in paragraph three, described as "an obsession, a hunger that no century could sate," and shapes every choice: Vael's preparation, pressing the fragment, stepping through. Three beats: question posed, preparation explained, question answered. Causal: the obsession drives the entire arc. Closure: Vael "found what boredom and eternity had kept hidden." Cost: immortality and the familiar world are forfeit. Specificity: the phrasing and stakes are unique. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal +1.5, closure +1.5, cost +0.5, specificity +0.6 = ~8.7; slight abstraction and summary tone in the final answer lower to 7.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Hushed thunder appears once in the opening ("shadows that whispered") and twice at closure ("hushed thunder" describing the presence beyond). Tone is consistently elevated, cosmic, and patient throughout. The phrase charges the final image: "in that hushed thunder beyond all dimensions, Vael found... peace." Two beats: opening hint, closure payoff. Coherent through turns. Closure linkage strong. Specificity: the phrase is distinct. No middle modulation visible, but the lyric reprise reweights the stake. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure +1.4, coherence +0.8, specificity +0.6 = ~7.3; slight static quality (one mood) and reliance on the single phrase lower to 6.8.</comment>
