<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera's motivation is clear and her emotional journey—working through grief by completing her father's unfinished mechanism—is embodied through concrete action. The mirrors showing her hands at work provide a strong externalization of internal process. However, the core insight ("some broken things must remain broken until we grow") arrives as stated wisdom rather than through a contradictory choice that costs her something on the page. The final assembly feels inevitable rather than earned through a visible internal conflict that she must resolve in the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece moves through purposeful deepening—climbing, discovering, assembling—culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: she accepts incompleteness as generative). Orientation anchors quickly (frozen library, Vera, her trade). The cost is felt but oblique: she carries the mechanism "home in the only way left to her," which implies acceptance of his death but doesn't show a tangible path foreclosed. The closure lands but the price could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The frozen library's ice-glazed architecture, crystalline dome, and hauntingly bright light create a vivid, purposeful space. Micro-setting shines: the gear assortment (brass, springs, escapement wheels) and the vial of oil (pine resin, rendered fat, metallic scent) anchor sensory detail in action. The hall of mirrors constrains her method—she sees what "ordinary eyes" cannot—elevating it beyond backdrop. Spatial choreography (corridors branching, reaching the center) remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>One dominant stake—learning repair to complete her father's legacy—is signaled early and tightens through the mirror revelation. The assembly sequence narrows options under pressure (each gear must relate correctly) and the final tick represents a meaningful deepening. However, the turn lacks a visible tradeoff: no competing desire, no resource spent, no tactical shift forced by failure. The cost is emotional resonance rather than a dramatized forfeiture, which keeps this from higher bands under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: gears-as-grief, mirrors-as-memory, the rhythm of repair as both mechanical and emotional. "Some locks are opened not with tools but with time" reweights prior material without moralizing. The oil's scent (pine resin, lightning) evokes embodied memory. One small slip: "He had left her the capacity to complete them herself" edges toward thesis statement, though it's cushioned by prior image work. The final image—carrying the ticking mechanism through clouds—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and close, filtering everything through Vera's perception. Voice is distinct: "lunar-eclipse locksmith," "springs coiled tight as secrets," "clouds rolling below like a frozen sea." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (zooming into the oil's scent, pulling back for the mirror reflections). One minor slip: "She found something more" is slightly expository where the image could speak alone. Perceptual signature is consistent—mechanistic, grief-laden—and diction remains within character throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and lengths create visual flow. Clarity is high, momentum steady. Minor density issues: "The frozen library stretched before her, corridors branching like the chambers of a crystallized heart" is vivid but doesn't advance goal or knowledge—purely atmospheric. "Impossibly cold, impossibly dear" is effective parallelism but borders on overwriting. The oil description ("sharp and mechanical and heartbreaking") stacks three adjectives where two would suffice. No loops or major artifacts, but figurative density in the mirrors passage ("doubled infinitely," "ghosting through," "worn like a veil") slightly dulls propulsion in a high-pressure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of grief work and clockmaking through a literal frozen archive is specific and coherent. "Lunar-eclipse locksmith" offers fresh occupational texture, and the mirrors-as-teaching-tool transforms a familiar trope. However, the emotional arc—assembling father's gears to process loss—follows a recognizable template (physical task as metaphor for healing). The prophecy scraps and frozen library lean toward convenience plotting (why this library, why these mirrors, why now?). Risk is present in the lyric frame but the core journey feels safely archetypal.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Vera is present throughout and makes one key choice: to work on the gears in the hall of mirrors. Her decision to climb, enter, and begin assembly drives the narrative forward. However, her agency is more about following a path (trusting frost patterns, reaching the center) than creating turns through conflicting options. The mirrors guide rather than oppose, so her choices feel enabled rather than pressured. Present in closure but her final action (wrapping, descending) is resolution rather than a choice that reweights stakes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The gear assortment appears early (in her satchel), is unpacked and handled in the mirror hall, and is assembled piece by piece in the climax. Each mention advances pressure: first as inheritance and grief object, then as puzzle requiring insight, finally as completed mechanism that ticks. The gears' "relation to the next" and "rhythm they once shared" reweight the object from mere tools to metaphor with mechanical specificity. Present in closure (wrapped, carried down). Strong causal role across three beats.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The hall of mirrors is the story's spatial and thematic fulcrum. It enables the key revelation—showing her "what she could not see with ordinary eyes"—and thus permits the assembly that would otherwise be impossible. It appears at the midpoint and dominates the climax. However, it functions more as a magic teaching aid than a constraint that forces choice under pressure. The mirrors show rather than test, so their integration leans toward facilitation rather than true complication. Essential to method but not to internal conflict.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Hauntingly bright" modifies the morning light in the opening and the light filtering through the dome during assembly. It establishes tone and atmosphere but does not constrain or enable a specific action with cost. The brightness allows her to see, but any sufficient light would serve the same function. Label-level use: the descriptor is evocative but swappable (e.g., "pale," "cold," "ethereal") without altering plot or stakes. Present in two touches but ornamental in both.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Uncap" appears once: Vera uncaps the vial of oil during assembly. The action is concrete and advances the beat by releasing the scent that triggers memory. However, it does not create a turn; the assembly continues seamlessly after. The oil itself matters more than the uncapping gesture, which could be replaced (e.g., "lifted," "opened") without loss. Functional within one beat but not a pivot that redefines options or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The prophecy scraps are mentioned in setup: Vera heard of the library "through scraps of prophecy hidden in a library's corner back home—torn pages stuffed behind a radiator." This exposition explains how she knows to come but does not shape her tactics on the page. The method is summary-only, a past-tense info drop rather than a present constraint. It sets the frame but does not return or complicate the action. Functional setup, absent from development and closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The frozen library is present from the title onward and dominates every beat: spires and ladder (obstacle), frost-coated shelves (stasis as theme), corridors and center (spatial progression), crystalline dome (light source for assembly). The setting's "perpetual stillness" and "time paused" mirror Vera's grief-stasis and make the final ticking mechanism a pointed reversal. The library supplies the hall of mirrors, the light, and the symbolic architecture. Essential across setup, development, and closure; removing it breaks the story's logic and imagery.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Under the soft hush of a distant morning" bookends the piece (opening rays, final paragraph reprise). The timeframe establishes mood—liminal, quiet, threshold—but does not impose a ticking clock or deadline that alters Vera's tactics. Morning could stretch indefinitely; no urgency or time-pressure shapes her choices. The distant morning charges tone and closure image but does not constrain action. Lyric reprise without mechanical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To learn the rhythm of repair" is stated early and drives every beat: climbing to the library, seeking the hall, working the gears until they tick. The motivation is dramatized through action (assembling, oiling, fitting) and internalized through reflection (each gear's relation, damage propagating like grief). However, the desire faces no friction—no competing want, no moment where repair seems impossible or undesirable. The motivation is univocal rather than conflicted, which limits its integration score despite strong presence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Driftwood nostalgia" coheres well: the frozen library's stillness, the father's unfinished work, the oil's scent, the reflections of younger/older selves all evoke loss weathered into acceptance. Tone remains elegiac and restrained throughout, modulating only slightly (trembling fingers, heartbreak) under pressure. The final image—carrying him home "through the work of her own two hands"—charges the tone with forward motion rather than stasis. Coherent and purposeful, though static in register; a single modal layer without sharp tonal shift at the turn.</comment>
