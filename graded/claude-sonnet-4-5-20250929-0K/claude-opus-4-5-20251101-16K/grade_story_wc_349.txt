<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's arc from archivist/thief/prisoner to vendor is clear, and her interior motivation (penance through quantifying absence) drives choices. The embodied work with tools—measuring glass, stylus, ledger—grounds her labor in concrete action. However, the customer interaction near the end is purely transactional; no contradictory impulses emerge when she hands over the vial, leaving the peak beat emotionally flat. The final choice to "continue her rounds" reads as endurance without visible cost that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story anchors who/where/when early (glass orchard library, Mira, opening day lull) and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through the measurement ritual, backstory of her crime, and the customer transaction. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—the final image of "counting what was missing, waiting for what might someday arrive" reweights her parole as perpetual threshold-standing with conceptual cost (she may never step through). The cost is legible in "perhaps that was enough" and the contrast between tending beginnings and her own foreclosed bloom. One meaningful deepening (the customer scene) tightens her understanding of absence as mercy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The glass orchard setting is vivid and constrains Mira's work: she incises trees, presses the measuring glass to wounds, reads gradients of unspoken fear and hope. The "sea-clouds" and shifting light anchor the floating library spatially. Tools (silver stylus, cloud-leather ledger, bottled moonlight) recur across beats and charge the ending when she lifts the moonlight to continue rounds. The micro-setting (crystal trees, vials on translucent shelves) directly enables her task and charges the final image of her touching "cold bark" while tending unborn stories.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—serve penance by standing at the threshold without crossing—is signaled early ("conditional freedom," "one transgression…the sentence would crystallize again"). Pressure tightens when the customer arrives wanting a clean slate, mirroring Mira's own past wish, forcing her to quantify absence for another. The transaction narrows her options: she chooses mercy over rebellion, foreclosing the path of forcing stories open again. The cost is felt in "perhaps that was enough" and the perpetual waiting. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is sufficient; the customer beat delivers it with visible emotional price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the premise: beginnings exist as structured absence, penance as perpetual threshold-standing. The bottled moonlight and incised trees serve as recurring images that shift meaning—first diagnostic tools, then metaphors for her own arrested narrative. The customer transaction dramatizes the theme (emptiness as mercy) without stating it. The final image answers the central question (where do stories begin?) non-literally: in accumulated gaps tended by one who may never cross. "Counting what was missing" resonates as both method and metaphor, the conceptual cost undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single-POV third limited is stable; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric ("genuine lunar radiance, harvested during the third quarter when shadows taught the light how to whisper") but remains internally consistent. Perceptual signature is clear: Mira notices narrative striations in trees, measures absences with impossible gradients. The customer's wavering "heat-shimmer" form fits the atmospheric register. Under peak pressure (customer transaction), syntax compresses slightly ("This was the trade she offered now: emptiness in exchange for emptiness") without losing clarity. Filter verbs ("watched," "felt," "understood") appear but are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high: most sentences layer world-building, character history, and present action. However, three paraphrase loops appear: "clean slates were…the careful cultivation of absence" / "emptiness in exchange for emptiness" / "counting what was missing"; the conceptual redundancy across these lines triggers a −0.3 deduction. Figurative density is high ("sea-clouds," "stories grew before anyone thought to speak them," "weight of a door not yet opened") but remains coherent and serves the lyric mode. No scaffolding or template cadence. One minor clarity slip: "they wanted a clean slate, they explained" tells rather than shows the customer's request.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of parole-as-penance + stories-as-absence + glass orchard is non-obvious and specific. "Quantifying absence" as both literal labor and metaphor for narrative gestation feels fresh. The inversion (stories begin not in fullness but in accumulated gaps) transforms the familiar archetype of the librarian-keeper. Emotional truth grounds the fantastical premise: Mira's crime (forcing a story open, scattering its fragments, causing three people to forget how to love) is both mythic and psychologically specific. The "glimmering parole" concept adds moral complexity without safety-hedging. Risk-taking in the lyric register and high metaphorical density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; +0.3 within band for bold execution of the premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira (clean slate vendor) is present throughout, frames the opening ("arranged her wares"), and makes the pivotal choice in the customer transaction (selecting the vial, watching edges soften). Her past crimes and current labor shape every beat. The ending beat ("continued her rounds, counting what was missing") is her decision to endure. Setup, development (measuring trees, serving customer), and payoff (final rounds) all present. Two distinct beats: measurement ritual and customer transaction. Causal pressure: her past crime constrains present choices. Closure linkage: her final action (tending the orchard) directly embodies her penance. Specificity: "clean slate vendor" is irreplaceable given the premise. Minor friction: the customer beat lacks dramatized internal conflict; she selects the vial without visible hesitation or cost in that moment. Adjustments: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.5, transaction lacks visible cost in the moment −0.5. Base 3.0 + 3.2 = 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Bottled moonlight appears in three beats: lifted early to reveal narrative striations in the glass tree, implicit in the "vials and vessels" collection, and lifted again in the final line to "continue her rounds." Setup (early), development (implicit in customer transaction as part of her wares), and payoff (final image) all present. Causal pressure: weak; the moonlight reveals story-potential but does not constrain Mira's choices. Closure linkage: present in the final image, charging her perpetual labor. Specificity: "genuine lunar radiance, harvested during the third quarter when shadows taught the light how to whisper" is vivid and irreplaceable in texture. Friction: the moonlight is descriptive in the opening beat and does not reappear with reweighted meaning until the end; the middle beat (customer transaction) does not involve it. Adjustments: early signal +0.5, two distinct beats (opening, ending) +0.4, closure linkage +0.9, specificity +0.6, ornamental in opening beat −0.3, middle beat absent −0.3. Base 3.0 + 1.8 = 4.8, round to 4.8. Reconsidering: the final reprise does reweight it (from diagnostic tool to emblem of perpetual waiting), and it brackets the story. Lyric-resonance allowance applies: +0.8. Adjusted: 4.8 + 0.8 = 5.6, round to 5.6. Rechecking closure: the moonlight in the final line is causally inert (she lifts it to continue rounds, not to resolve a choice). Closure participation is weak; she could continue rounds without it. Cap at lyric-resonance ceiling 6.3, but actual pressure is lower. Final: 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Glimmering parole is introduced early ("conditional freedom that wavered like light through water"), constrains every beat (one transgression and the sentence crystallizes again), and is reweighted at closure ("Her parole required her to stand at the threshold of beginning and never step through"). Setup, development (constrains her measurement work and response to the customer), and payoff (final image of perpetual waiting) all present. Three beats: opening exposition, customer transaction (she offers mercy within the bounds of parole), ending crystallization. Causal pressure: strong; the parole forecloses the path of forcing stories open and shapes her labor. Closure linkage: the final image explicitly names the parole's cost (threshold-standing). Specificity: "glimmering" (wavering, conditional) is essential to the metaphor. Visible cost: "perhaps that was enough" and the perpetual waiting. Adjustments: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.7, cost connection +0.5. Base 3.0 + 5.8 = 8.8, round to 8.8. Minor friction: the concept is more thematic than tactical in the customer beat; she does not weigh the parole's terms explicitly when selecting the vial. Deduct −0.3 for summary-only in mid-beat. Final: 8.5, round to 8.5. Rechecking: the parole is named and its constraint is active in the customer beat ("This was the trade she offered now"), though the internal weighing is implicit. The friction is minor. Restore to 8.6, but the absence of explicit tactical weighing in the transaction caps practical ceiling. Final: 7.6 reflects strong setup and payoff with weaker middle dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Mindfully scattered appears once in the opening: "She had arranged her wares mindfully scattered across the translucent shelves." The attribute describes the spatial arrangement but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. The customer selects a vial, but the "mindfully scattered" arrangement plays no role in that choice. Setup present (opening), development absent (no middle beat uses it), payoff absent (does not shape ending). One beat: opening description only. No causal pressure, no closure linkage. Swappability: "carefully arranged," "artfully placed," or "intentionally dispersed" would serve identically. Adjustments: early signal +0.3, one beat +0.4, ornamental −0.7, swappable −0.6. Base 3.0 + (−0.6) = 2.4, but the attribute is present and logically consistent, so floor at 3.0. Reconsidering: "mindfully scattered" reflects Mira's philosophy (absence as cultivation), a thematic echo. Add +0.3 for thematic coherence. Final: 3.3, but label-only use and no action pressure caps at 3.8 per rubric. Splitting the difference: 4.1 reflects presence, thematic fit, but functional irrelevance.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Incise appears in three beats: Mira incises lines into glass trees in the measurement ritual (midpoint), the method is explained ("not to damage them, but to read them"), and the action is repeated in the ending sequence ("Mira incised a careful line into the nearest tree and pressed her measuring glass against the wound"). Setup (explained early), development (measurement beat), and payoff (ending beat) all present. Three distinct beats. Causal pressure: strong; incising releases "exhalations of potential" that Mira measures to calculate story-readiness, directly enabling her labor. Closure linkage: the action recurs in the ending, charging the final image of perpetual tending. Specificity: "incise" (cut to read, not damage) is precise and irreplaceable. Visible cost: the trees are wounded, even if for diagnostic purposes. Adjustments: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.7, cost connection +0.4. Base 3.0 + 5.6 = 8.6, round to 8.6. Minor friction: the ending beat repeats the action without deepening or reweighting it; the incision in the final paragraph yields numbers recorded in the ledger, a loop of the earlier beat. Deduct −0.2 for repetition without escalation. Final: 8.4, but the action is indispensable to her labor and the closure image. Restore to 7.9 to reflect strong integration with minor repetition.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Quantifying absence is introduced early ("served her penance by quantifying absence"), explained in the measurement beat ("by measuring what was not yet there, she could calculate how close each story stood to birth"), and enacted in the ending ("counting what was missing, waiting for what might someday arrive"). Setup, development (measurement beat with gradients of unspoken fear, hope, child's question), and payoff (final line) all present. Three beats. Causal pressure: moderate; the method enables her labor but does not constrain choices. Closure linkage: strong; the final line explicitly names the method. Specificity: "quantifying absence" is conceptually rich and irreplaceable. Visible cost: the method requires perpetual threshold-standing. Adjustments: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.7 (moderate), closure linkage +1.3, specificity +0.7, cost connection +0.4. Base 3.0 + 5.1 = 8.1. Friction: the mechanics are explained more than dramatized; the gradients (seventy-three units of unspoken fear) feel ornamental rather than consequential. Deduct −0.5 for summary-heavy dramatization. Final: 7.6, but the concept's thematic weight and closure presence are strong. Splitting: 6.7 reflects solid integration with weaker mechanical stakes.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Glass orchard library floating on cloud-sea is anchored early (opening line) and recurs in the measurement beats (glass trees, translucent shelves, incised bark) and ending (touching cold bark, clouds swirling below). Setup, development (trees constrain and enable her measurement work), and payoff (final image of touching bark) all present. Three beats. Causal pressure: moderate; the trees are the substrate of her labor, but the floating library itself does not constrain choices. Closure linkage: the bark and clouds appear in the final image. Specificity: "glass orchard" and "sea-clouds" are vivid and irreplaceable. Spatial choreography is clear. Adjustments: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.8 (trees enable, library doesn't constrain), closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.7. Base 3.0 + 4.6 = 7.6. Friction: the floating/drifting quality and cloud-sea are scenic but do not pressure choices; the customer "appeared at the library's threshold" without spatial consequence. Deduct −0.4 for postcard description in non-choice beats. Final: 7.2, but the trees do constrain (she must incise them to measure). Splitting: 6.4 reflects strong sensory presence with moderate tactical impact.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The lull on opening day is named early ("that strange, suspended hour on a shop's very first opening day") and frames the story's temporal scope. Setup present. Development: weak; the lull does not tighten decisions or create urgency. Payoff: the customer arrives "that afternoon," but no clock pressures the transaction. Time is tracked loosely ("the afternoon light shifted") but does not alter tactics. One beat (opening framing). No causal pressure, weak closure linkage. Adjustments: early signal +0.5, one beat +0.4, no causal pressure 0, weak closure linkage +0.2, thematic coherence (lull = suspended state of her parole) +0.4. Base 3.0 + 1.5 = 4.5. Friction: the timeframe is ornamental; the story could occur on any opening day or any afternoon with identical structure. Swappable. Deduct −0.5. Final: 4.0, but the lull does establish mood and fits the Accumulative lens. Lyric-resonance: the suspended hour mirrors her suspended sentence. Add +0.3. Final: 4.3, round to 4.3. Reconsidering: the opening day signals a beginning that Mira cannot herself claim, a thematic reprise. Add +0.5 for thematic charge. Adjusted: 4.8, but no tactical impact. Splitting: 5.3 reflects thematic fit with weak causal role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>To find the place where stories begin is introduced early ("the magistrates had needed someone who understood the work. Someone who knew how to find the place where stories begin"), enacted in the measurement beats (she reads striations, calculates story-readiness), and reweighted at closure ("To tend the orchard where all stories started their slow bloom toward being spoken"). Setup, development (measurement work), and payoff (final paragraph naming the place) all present. Three beats. Causal pressure: moderate; the motivation shapes her labor but does not force a conflicted choice. Closure linkage: strong; the final image names the place and her role. Specificity: "place where stories begin" is thematically central. Visible cost: she may tend but never step through. Adjustments: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6, cost connection +0.5. Base 3.0 + 5.1 = 8.1. Friction: the motivation is told in exposition and enacted in ritual, but no on-page beat dramatizes her desire as conflicted (e.g., temptation to force a story open again). The customer transaction does not test the motivation. Deduct −0.6 for told-only conflict. Final: 7.5, but the closure does crystallize her stance. Splitting: 6.9 reflects strong thematic presence with weak dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Integrated fragmentation as tone: the prose is lyric and elliptical, weaving backstory shards (her crime, the shattered narrative) with present ritual and metaphysical exposition. The register is consistently elevated and imagistic ("longing, the loss, the questions that would someday become once upon a time"). Tone modulates slightly: the opening is suspended and meditative, the measurement beat technical, the customer transaction warm ("Mira understood. She had wanted the same thing once"), the ending resigned and tender. Setup (opening lyricism), development (tonal shifts across beats), and payoff (final image's quiet resonance) all present. Three beats. Coherence: strong; the fragmented structure (shards of backstory, present action, exposition) coheres under the Accumulative lens. Closure charge: the final tone (patient waiting) reweights the earlier suspension. Adjustments: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, coherence through turns +1.0, closure charge +1.1, specificity +0.5. Base 3.0 + 4.6 = 7.6. Friction: "integrated fragmentation" is more a descriptor of structure than tone; the emotional register is more lyric melancholy than fragmented. The rubric defines tone as mood/affect, not structure. Deduct −0.5 for label mismatch. Final: 7.1 reflects strong lyric coherence with structural-not-tonal reading.</comment>
