<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's progression from resentment to release is dramatized through embodied reactions (collapsing, sobbing without sound) and her cellular memory serves as a constraint device. However, interiority leans diagnostic ("resentment that had calcified into something that felt like bone") and the moment of surrender—leaving the music box—lacks visible internal contradiction or cost-weighted struggle in the beat itself. The shift feels orchestrated by Vera's persuasion rather than earned through Mira's own agency under competing impulses acting simultaneously on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure arrives on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira surrenders the music box and carries her mother's melody forward, forecloses anger with visible cost (the offering left behind). The Drive Lens reads Accumulative/Textural—sensory memory layered through cellular detail reweights her stance. Orientation anchors quickly (sanctuary threshold, Vera's appearance). One friction: the music box turning "impossibly" introduces a grace-device that borders on authorial assertion rather than earned causal pressure from Mira's own choices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The soundless sanctuary constrains perception throughout ("not the crunch of footsteps, not the rasp of breath") and the silence frames Mira's embodied collapse. Micro-setting is purposeful: walls becoming water/light mirrors the shifting-grace premise, and the music box as recurring object anchors multiple beats. Spatial choreography remains clear (threshold crossing, kneeling beside, music box on floor). The sanctuary's physics charge the final image when the cylinder impossibly turns.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early (forgetting versus release) and pressure tightens when Vera denies Mira's want and offers cellular memory instead. The deepening moment—Mira's body remembering tenderness—narrows her emotional options. Cost at closure is visible (surrendering the music box, burying anger). However, escalation is driven more by Vera's scheming pacifist manipulation than by Mira's own agency resisting or choosing under competing goods; the protagonist receives transformation rather than earning it through a high-stakes on-page decision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the music box's broken mechanism and Mira's cellular memory: resentment as prison, grace filling gaps mechanism cannot mend. The final image (melody humming through blood, broken cylinder of heart) reweights prior material without stating a moral. Minor slip: "scheming pacifist" and "strategic compassion, patience weaponized toward healing" edge into authorial explication of Vera's role rather than letting her actions alone teach the theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-close on Mira; Vera's dialogue arrives as telepathic intrusion, voice-motivated by the soundless setting. Diction is controlled and rhythmic ("reality shifts like water finding new paths through stone"). One register slip: "calcified into something that felt like bone" and "scheming pacifist who had spent centuries manipulating souls toward peace through methods that walked the knife-edge of ethical" both elevate into essayistic summary rather than staying grounded in Mira's immediate perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and sensory detail is vivid (cheap soap, thumb stroking forehead). Two distinct loop patterns: "Mira felt rather than heard" / "sensations" / "felt" cluster near the cellular-memory beat recycles the filter construction; and "reality shifts" recurs as a phrase anchor three times without reweighting. The music box turning "impossibly, since the pin remained broken" is scaffold clarification rather than trusting the image. No closure-touching artifacts, but density could tighten in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The sanctuary-as-healing-space and scheming-pacifist mentor both echo familiar templates (wise guide, liminal threshold). Cellular memory as vehicle offers a fresh physiological angle, and the music box's impossible turning inverts the broken-object trope purposefully. However, Mira's arc follows a predictable refuse-truth → receive-truth → accept-truth trajectory without a non-obvious moral calculus or risky structural choice that would elevate the synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Vera's scheming creates two key turns: denying Mira's request for forgetting and offering cellular memory instead, then explaining the sanctuary's mechanics to shift Mira's stance. Present early, drives middle choice, shapes ending explanation. Deductions for late causal agency (Vera acts upon rather than alongside Mira at closure) and swappability (a wise guide could perform similar function with minor rewrites).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The broken cylinder pin is handled in three beats: arrival with the pin "snapped clean through," Vera examining "the broken pin, the frozen cylinder," and the impossibly turning cylinder at closure that charges the final image. Early setup, middle development (Vera's examination), payoff in the ending where it vibrates melody. Strong causal pressure (broken state = silenced song) and irreplaceability (pin's mechanics matter). Minor friction: the "impossibly" turn introduces grace-device rather than earned repair, slightly reducing felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Shifting grace appears as setting description ("reality shifts like water," walls becoming geometry) and Vera's closing line "Grace shifts to fill the gaps we cannot mend ourselves," plus final paragraph "shifting grace." Shapes middle beat when sanctuary ripples in response to Vera's intention, and charges final image when reality shifts one last time. Present early and at closure, but functions more as thematic echo than on-page constraint that alters Mira's tactical options or forces a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Vera "appeared as she always did—when needed" signals the attribute early, and the closing "already sensing the next soul approaching" confirms recurrence. However, this trait does not constrain or enable a visible on-page cost or tactical choice within Mira's story; it frames Vera's role but remains ornamental to the central pressure. Two-gate presence (setup, ending mention) but no middle development where reappearance mechanics create friction or opportunity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira arrives wanting to convince herself "that hating her was righteous," Vera denies that and instead convinces Mira through cellular memory, and Mira is persuaded to release resentment. The action drives the central turn and closure. Present early as framing want, middle as Vera's counter-offer, payoff when Mira surrenders the music box. Deduction for passivity: Mira is convinced by Vera's scheming rather than wrestling the choice herself under competing costs, making the action partially swappable with "heal" or "accept."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Cellular memory is signaled midpoint ("Through cellular memory, your body holds every moment") and demonstrated when "Memory erupted through Mira's body—not images but sensations." Shapes one key beat (the sensory flood that breaks Mira's resistance) and primes closure when melody hums "through her blood." Two-gate presence (middle introduction, ending echo) but late first mention and mechanics arrive as Vera's explanation rather than Mira discovering or struggling with the method herself, reducing causal irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The soundless sanctuary is anchored early ("No sound penetrated here"), pressures perception throughout (sobbing without sound, words arriving in mind), and the sanctuary's shifting walls mirror the grace premise. Setting enables Vera's telepathic dialogue, constrains Mira's embodied experience (collapsing into soundlessness), and the sanctuary "waited in its eternal silence" at closure reinforces thematic charge. Three-gate presence with causal pressure on multiple beats; slight reduction for the setting acting more as stage than active obstacle Mira must work around.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"While reality shifts" appears in opening description, midpoint when the sanctuary ripples, and final paragraph when "Reality shifted one final time." The shifts mark transitions but do not impose a ticking clock or narrow Mira's tactical window; time remains elastic and untracked. Two-gate presence (early mention, ending reprise) but the timeframe functions as atmospheric descriptor rather than constraint that forces faster decisions or alters moves under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Vera's motivation "to teach resentment to release" is stated explicitly ("I exist to teach resentment to release its grip") and dramatized through her choice to offer cellular memory instead of forgetting. The desire drives her middle intervention and shapes the ending when she senses the next soul. Present across three beats with causal involvement. Deduction for told-label framing ("strategic compassion, patience weaponized toward healing") that asserts rather than showing friction between Vera's pacifist constraint and her manipulative method.</comment>
