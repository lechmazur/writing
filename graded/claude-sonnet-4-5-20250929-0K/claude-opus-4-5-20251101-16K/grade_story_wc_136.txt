<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear—seeking unspoken truths her family never shared—and the opening seventeen-year detail anchors her patience. Her final choice to speak her father's name feels earned by the prior setup. However, the journey itself lacks micro-choices under pressure; she follows arrows without resistance or internal friction, and the fortress delivers answers without requiring her to sacrifice or risk anything concrete on the page. The bodily embodiment is thin: "trembling certainty" is asserted more than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (charged imagery, pattern-taught motifs). Closure form: Resonant Reconfiguration (Elara speaks aloud, the fortress answers). The orientation is clear by ~120 words. The escalation is mild—she follows cracks, finds the fortress, inserts the punch—without a meaningful tightening that narrows options or raises cost. The final image reconfigures her silence into speech, but the cost feels implied rather than legible: we're told the fortress answers, yet no on-page consequence or forfeiture is dramatized. The punch's use and the gate's opening function as moments of potential closure, but the lack of visible sacrifice or friction weakens the felt cost required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The starlit vault, frozen-breath bridge, and crystallized-whisper fortress are vivid and purposeful, charging the final image with textural weight. The cracks forming arrows constrain her route, satisfying the micro-setting test. Spatial choreography is coherent: plazas → stairs → bridge → gate. The fortress's sensory detail (humming voices, echoing hall) anchors the climax and integrates with theme. Minor deduction: the opening city detail is generic ("empty plazas," "winter mist") and could be sharpened with POV-filtered particulars.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: find the fortress and unspoken truths. The tightening is gentle—arrows lead her forward—but no live option is foreclosed with on-page cost until the very end. The punch insertion opens the gate, but the action feels automatic rather than a forced trade-off. The fortress delivers answers without requiring Elara to renounce, endure, or pay a visible price on the page; her father's voice completes the conversation, yet we don't see what she loses or risks by entering. Accumulative lens allows pattern-driven pressure, but the escalation remains flat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—unspoken truths and the courage to voice them—emerges from the fortress architecture and Elara's final spoken line. The punch as inherited key and the cracks as breadcrumbs carry thematic weight. However, the ending tilts toward thematic echo: "some routes cannot be mapped until you dare to walk them" reads as a thesis statement rather than an earned resonance from particulars. The fortress answers too readily, softening the complexity; no counter-reading or ambiguity lingers. The specificity of "seventeen years" and her father's name anchor universals, preventing full abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent—"analytically artistic," "trembling certainty," "graveyard of her throat"—fitting a reflective, pattern-seeking mapper. The perceptual signature (routes, divergences, patterns) colors her observations. However, peak-stress compression is absent: the final beats maintain the same lush, measured cadence as the opening, missing the rhythmic modulation that would heighten pressure. Minor filter-verb stack in the opening ("understood," "called") is voice-motivated and acceptable. Dialogue is absent, so those bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence. Line-level clarity is high, and figurative language is mostly coherent ("fortress of unspoken truths," "crystallized whispers"). Deductions: paraphrase loop in the fortress description ("hummed with voices just below hearing" / "chorus of everything never spoken") restates without adding pressure (−0.2). Elevated diction ("vault overhead," "cathedral whose ceiling was infinity") is consistent but dense across most sentences, bordering on overwriting without pattern-teaching or payoff in a high-pressure beat (−0.3). The final paragraph's "some routes cannot be mapped" is a thematic scaffold that tells rather than charges through image (−0.2). No loops touch closure, so caps are not triggered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The phantom punch as inherited key and the fortress built of unspoken words offer a fresh synthesis. The route-mapper profession integrates thematically. However, the core emotional journey—finding a parent's missing words—is familiar, and the fortress delivers answers without requiring Elara to transform or renounce in a non-obvious way. The ending's moral ("dare to walk them") is stated rather than earned through hindsight inevitability. The piece leans on lyric atmosphere more than bold structural or perspectival risk. Specific details (seventeen years, brass teeth worn smooth) prevent full genericity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Present early and at closure; her map-reading skill colors perception. However, her route-mapping does not constrain or enable a key choice under pressure—she follows the cracks passively. The trait is more thematic accent than causal lever. Two touches (opening profession, final "map-maker's instinct"), but no decision that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup (velvet box arrival), development (she raises it with trembling certainty), payoff (inserts it to open the gate). Three beats. Causal role: the punch unlocks the gate, enabling entry. However, it does not narrow options or impose cost; it functions as a key without requiring sacrifice or choice. The "inherited key" idea adds specificity. Strong closure linkage, but swappable with any mystical key without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Present thematically (unspoken truths) and in the fortress's architecture. However, "unraveling mysteries" as an active stake is told more than dramatized—Elara follows arrows without investigative friction or false leads that she must deduce through. The concept shapes the premise but does not constrain tactics on the page. Setup and closure present; middle development weak.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Mentioned early ("analytically artistic mind accepted as truth beyond logic") and in the final paragraph ("map-maker's instinct charting new territories"). Label-only; no on-page action demonstrates the trade-off between precision and intuition. Does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost. Swappable with "methodical yet creative" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setup (title: "dare to follow"), development (multiple dares: follow cracks, cross bridge), payoff (punch insertion as the climactic dare). The dare redefines options at closure: she speaks her father's name, breaking seventeen years of silence. Causal pressure and closure linkage strong. The element is signaled repeatedly and shapes the emotional arc. Deduction: the punch insertion itself lacks friction—no cost or hesitation dramatized in the moment (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setup (first crack at her feet), development (cracks lead through plazas and stairs), payoff (arrows fade after their purpose is complete). The method shapes her route and enables discovery. Three beats, early signal, closure mention. However, the cracks function as passive guidance without requiring interpretation or choice; she follows without cost or alternative. Swappable with glowing footprints or any breadcrumb trail. Causal role present but minimal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Present at opening and sustained through the journey; the starlit vault charges the final image. The fog and mist create atmosphere. However, the setting does not constrain choice or supply resources that alter tactics—Elara moves through it without obstacle or cost. Lyric reprise (opening sky → vault above at closure) reweights meaning slightly. Setup and closure strong; middle development absent.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Signaled in the title phrase ("hour that divides bad habits and new starts") and opening beat. Thematically apt (midnight, new year). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page—no clock pressure, no urgency that forces faster choices. The liminal hour is atmospheric rather than causal. Setup present; no middle or closure participation beyond initial mention.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup (three months of research, nightly whispers), development (she follows cracks toward the fortress), payoff (she seeks her father's words and speaks his name). The motivation drives the journey and is dramatized in the final beat. However, the desire is told more than conflicted: no on-page friction between wanting the truth and fearing it, no cost or hesitation when she inserts the punch. Causal role and closure linkage present; internal conflict weak.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Established early ("trembling certainty," "analytically artistic mind accepted as truth beyond logic") and sustained through the journey ("her certainty did not" waver, "smiled, tears freezing"). Tone modulates slightly at closure (tears, spoken truth) but remains coherent. The paradox of trembling + certainty is asserted more than embodied in contradictory actions. Setup and closure strong; the tone charges the final image but does not shift under peak pressure to heighten escalation.</comment>
