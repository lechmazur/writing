<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's "perceptively calm" trait is label-heavy rather than embodied through contradictory impulses under pressure. Her motivation to "transmute pain into a masterpiece" drives the archive work, but no on-page choice forces her to forfeit a competing want or face a visible cost. The townspeople show recognition moments, but their emotional progression remains summary-level rather than dramatized with misbeliefs or struggle. Interior life stays generic ("patient devotion," "stillness of someone listening") without character-particular contradiction or micro-choices that narrow options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the story layers archive images and townspeople visits toward a final symmetry (1952 opening hands matched with present raised arms). Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly by the third paragraph. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the symmetry reweights collective grief as survival), but the cost is conceptual and asserted rather than felt on the page—no foreclosed path, no visible sacrifice, just a smile at symmetry. The final image ("proof that they had survived together") tells theme rather than showing a choice or renunciation with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lavender field and rusted factory create vivid contrasts (orange skeleton, purple blooms, climbing vines) filtered through the archive's purpose. The shed and field recur across beats and anchor the Sunday gatherings. Spatial choreography is clear (field edge, shed, ruins). The vines' patient climb and the dove gray map case supply tactile, purposeful detail. The setting charges the final image (townspeople in the field, factory crowned with vines) and subtly mirrors the transformation theme, meeting the 9+ gate criterion of constraining or charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—collective healing via the archive—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the archive work and Sunday visits, but no on-page reversal or tightening forces Mira to choose between competing goods or pay a visible price. The townspeople's recognition ("That's my mother's gesture") deepens understanding but doesn't narrow options or create friction. The final photograph pairing is a thematic capstone without escalation or cost legibility. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful cadence shift or pattern break that reweights the stake with felt cost is required; the story offers symmetry but not sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of collective healing through shared gestures emerges organically from the archive work and arc-tracing method. The recurring arcs ("grammar of joy and sorrow") and the lavender-from-ruins metaphor are purposeful and integrated. The final symmetry (workers' 1952 hands mirrored in present) offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. However, the last two paragraphs edge into thematic summary ("proof that they had survived together, and that surviving together was its own kind of art") rather than letting the image speak. The piece resists false equivalence and embraces ambiguity in how pain becomes beauty, but the closure leans toward assertion over earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single third-person POV with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature (Mira's attention to arcs, patient observation). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("earnest whimsy," "orange skeleton," "frequencies others couldn't hear"). The two dialogue fragments feel natural and goal-driven, advancing recognition without exposition. Filter verbs ("she believed," "she would wait") appear but fit the reflective voice. Under peak moments (the final photograph placement), the prose maintains rhythm and specificity without template cadence or head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully between close observation and wider framing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with varied sentence openings and paragraph rhythm. Information density is solid (the arcs method, the factory closure, the Sunday gatherings). However, paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear: "patient devotion" / "perceptively calm" / "stillness of someone listening" restate Mira's trait without new detail; "the town's deepest wound was becoming...a masterpiece of survival written in the language of arcs" echoes the earlier "transmute pain into a masterpiece" without added pressure. The final two paragraphs stack thematic summaries ("proof that...," "that surviving together was its own kind of art") where a single charged image would suffice. Filter-verb density ("she believed," "she never explained") and stock metaphors ("candle flame," "song") accumulate in non-closure beats, applying −0.8 for loops and template phrasing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The core synthesis—archive of collective grief via gesture arcs behind a lavender-reclaimed factory—feels specific and non-obvious. The trope of community healing is transformed through the unusual arcs method and the ruins-to-garden setting. The final symmetry (1952 / present hands) is earned by the archive logic established early. Risk-taking is moderate: the reflective, summary-heavy final paragraphs retreat from bolder closure images. The piece avoids template plots and hedged morals, committing fully to its premise. Emotional honesty and specificity elevate familiar material, though the "transmute pain into masterpiece" phrasing nears self-conscious artistry.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and her archive work frames all beats, but her choices are observational rather than decisive. She spreads photographs, adds the final image, and smiles at symmetry—actions that advance understanding but do not alter tactics or foreclose options with cost. The trait "subtle puzzle archivist" describes role more than it constrains on-page decisions.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dove gray map case appears in the opening (worn soft, containing photographs) and returns at closure when Mira places the two symmetrical photographs inside and closes it gently. Two beats, but the case functions as storage rather than tool that shapes tactics. The "worn soft" detail and the closing gesture charge the final image with gentle resonance, lifting score into mid-band via early seed and closure reprise.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Collective healing is the stated motivation and dominant stake. It shapes the archive's purpose, the Sunday gatherings, and the townspeople's recognition moments. The final symmetry (workers' hope mirrored across decades) dramatizes the concept without moralizing. However, no on-page choice tests competing goods or imposes cost; the concept remains thematic rather than tactical. It articulates stakes but doesn't narrow options under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Perceptively calm" is mentioned twice as a label ("perceptively calm about her work," "perceptively calm as always") without embodied tradeoff or cost. The trait describes Mira's demeanor but does not constrain an action or enable a choice that alters outcome. It reads as character color rather than functional attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Linger" is thematic (Mira "had always been the type to linger where others rushed past") and establishes character, but the action itself—lingering over photographs, letting visitors linger—does not create a major turn or redefine options. The method is patient observation rather than a decisive gesture. The trait supports the archive work but is swappable with "observe closely" or "study" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Arcs in black-and-white photographs are signaled early (paragraph 5), demonstrated in action (tracing arcs, connecting images with red thread), and return at closure (matching the raised-hand arcs from 1952 and present). The method shapes multiple beats: Mira's work process, the townspeople's recognition, and the final symmetry. Mechanics matter (curve of arm, arc of smoke, parabolic jump ropes) and the method charges the ending. Missing: a moment where the method constrains or enables a tactic under pressure; it functions more as frame than friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Lavender field behind rusted factory appears in setup (paragraph 4), anchors the archive shed and Sunday gatherings (middle beats), and charges the final image (townspeople in the field, factory crowned with vines, purple blooms as witnesses). The setting supplies the transformation metaphor (industry reclaimed by nature) and provides spatial grounding. It participates in closure by framing the symmetry photograph. The ruins and vines constrain the archive's physical location and mood, meeting threshold for essential across beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"As vines climb" appears as a timeframe marker (paragraph 4: "As vines climbed the factory walls"; final: "vines continued their patient climb, marking time in green growth"). The phrase brackets the story and signals slow passage, but time does not tighten decisions or create urgency. The twelve-year gap since the factory closed is static background. The vines' growth is poetic rather than tactical, failing to alter Mira's moves or force a deadline.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Motivation "to transmute pain into a masterpiece" is stated early (paragraph 8) and drives the archive work and Sunday gatherings. It shapes stakes and explains Mira's goal. However, the motivation is told rather than tested by conflicting wants; no beat forces Mira to choose between the masterpiece and another urgent need. The final symmetry fulfills the goal without friction or visible cost, keeping the motivation functional but not deeply conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Earnest whimsy" is legible in diction ("nature's earnest whimsy," the lavender as "witnesses," the arcs as "grammar of joy and sorrow") and modulates coherently through reflective beats. Tone is consistent but single-register; no modulation under pressure since pressure itself is low. The final image sustains the tone (gentle closing of the case, child's laugh "like a question and an answer") but does not charge it with new tension. Mid-band for coherence without dynamic range.</comment>
