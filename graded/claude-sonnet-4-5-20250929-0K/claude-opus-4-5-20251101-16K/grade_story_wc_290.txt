**Drive Lens:** Causal — because/therefore linkages drive the sequence (father's knowledge → organ → stabilization → compass point → key → escape).

**Closure Unit:** Decisive Change — Maren obtains the Fallow Key and escapes, completing her father's mission. Some Charged Poise in the final image.

**Dominant Stake:** Recovery of the Fallow Key / completing the father's unfinished work.

<question>1</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and rooted in filial inheritance, but the claustrophobia—her defining contradiction—operates as label-speak ("her claustrophobia screaming") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene. She executes a pre-planned sequence with near-perfect competence; no blind spots compound, no genuine struggle forces improvisation. "Prudently adventurous calm" and "wistful rebellion filled her chest" are diagnostic labels, not embodied emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Clean causal chain from organ to compass point to key retrieval, with orientation anchored well within the first 50 words. However, on-page closure cost is thin—the danger of spatial reassertion is dispatched in a sentence, and the real cost (father's death) is backstory. The final paragraphs drift from dramatized scene into thematic summary, softening the closure beat. Cost proof test: no single sentence carries undeniable on-page price at the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Silver equations on stone" and the ceiling "simultaneously crushing downward and stretching impossibly upward" are strong, setting-specific images. The spatial mutiny concept generates a genuinely atmospheric environment that constrains action (the organ as counter-mechanism). Weakness: the escape is vaguely rendered ("navigating by starlight and instinct"), and the final nexus image is more decorative frame than tactile constraint. Phosphorescent moss is a nice sensory beat for the chamber.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The one-hour time limit from the organ's stabilization provides structural tightening, but Maren faces no real complication—every step works as pre-planned. The claustrophobia doesn't impede her, no tool fails, no improvisation is forced. The spatial reassertion creates urgency but she escapes cleanly. Declared stakes ("madness or starvation") never materialize as on-page threats tested against her agency. The resolution feels like a successfully executed checklist rather than a hard-won victory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The inheritance theme (knowledge passed through compass points and cryptic letters) is coherent but the final paragraphs collapse into explicit moralizing: "some rebellions were quiet things, passed from parent to child… through love that outlasted death." This is thematic echo at its most direct, essentially stating the thesis in prompt-adjacent language in the closing paragraphs (−0.7). The Fallow Key as metaphor for dormant knowledge is conceptually tidy but never complicated or challenged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited throughout; no head-hopping. Some distinctive images ("dust rising like disturbed memories"). However, the voice doesn't degrade under pressure—when Maren is supposedly panicking, prose remains equally composed and literary. "The space began to transfix itself—the word her father had used" is a meta-commentary that breaks immersion. Perceptual signature is present but thin; the narration explains rather than trusts dramatization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Spatial mutiny" appears four times; "claustrophobic explorer" is reinforced repeatedly—concept churn that functions as scaffold. The final third stacks telling: "wistful rebellion filled her chest—grief for her father, defiance against the forces that had consumed him, desperate hope" is an emotion list, not dramatized feeling. "Through love that outlasted death" is stock phrasing in a peak position. Some strong lines earlier ("silver equations on stone") can't offset the closure-adjacent artifacts.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny as a concept—architecture that rebels against fixed geometry, countered by organ harmonics—is genuinely fresh and well-integrated. The compass point as both emotional artifact and literal key is a satisfying dual function. However, the narrative structure (enter dangerous place, solve puzzle, retrieve artifact, escape) follows a standard quest template without surprise. The "ancient knowledge hidden because humanity wasn't ready" is a well-worn trope that isn't transformed here.</comment>
