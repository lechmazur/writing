<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sable's monthly personality shifts are established with concrete examples ("laughed too loudly," "someone quieter"), and her core constancy—forging beauty from chaos—anchors her choices. Marcus is rendered through action (hauling cinder blocks, securing tarps) with sufficient interiority via his question "Who are you this month?" The relationship history (prison library, three years of sorting books) provides weight, though the backstory occupies significant space without altering present tactics on the page. Emotional embodiment is present but leans toward poetic summary rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in high-pressure beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early (rusted library, moon, Sable and Marcus). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure accrues through layered images (coffee tin poems, resistance metaphor, reconstruction theme) rather than because/therefore causality. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—the final lines reweigh the ongoing work ("the act of rebuilding is itself the resistance") with conceptual cost implicit in permanence deferred. However, no single on-page choice alters tactics or forecloses a path with visible felt cost; the ending restates the premise rather than reweighting it through a decisive image or action that makes a before/after legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The rusted library is vividly rendered: oxidizing shelves, crumbling walls, open roof, moon/starlight spilling across beams. Spatial choreography is clean (Marcus between shelving units, Sable at the wooden poetry box). The coffee tin's false bottom and the POETRY, TAKE ONE LEAVE ONE box ground action in tactile detail. The setting constrains choices (vulnerable shelves require tarp protection) and charges the final image (star-touched, open-roofed patience). Sensory hierarchy and micro-setting both function well within the single nocturnal scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Sable's need to forge beauty and bear witness through the library rebuild and her poems. The accumulative design layers acts of resistance (organizing books, hiding poems, tarp work), but no on-page choice narrows options or forces a trade-off with visible cost. The ending crystallizes the ongoing stance ("choosing creation over collapse") without a tightening that forecloses a path or escalates pressure. Marcus's question and Sable's self-assessment ("someone who believes in reconstruction") offer a micro-turn, but agency remains declarative rather than tested by a decision that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—resistance through creation, beauty from wreckage, constancy amid fragmentation—emerges organically from action and image (rusted library, coffee tin poems, monthly personality molts). The final paragraph offers a resonant answer ("the act of rebuilding is itself the resistance") without overt moralizing, and the image of fractures letting in light reweights prior material. However, the closing lines edge toward thematic summary ("choosing creation over collapse, beauty over despair") that explains rather than trusts the image. The piece avoids diagnostic label-speak and sustains complexity, but the ending's direct articulation of theme slightly undercuts the non-literal resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and close to Sable; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close interiority for her self-assessment, zoom-out for the library description). Diction is elevated and lyric ("wounded cathedral of books," "luminous fracture") but consistent with a poet's sensibility. Dialogue is sparse, natural, and subtext-laden ("Who are you this month?" carries weight without exposition). The perceptual signature is strong—Sable notices books, poems, metaphor—but the prose occasionally drifts toward narrator omniscience ("two people made of fractures") that reads slightly outside her immediate thought. No head-hopping; filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; paragraph structure supports visual cadence. Information density is high, with most lines advancing character, setting, or theme. However, several beats exhibit figurative stacking without earned pressure: "molts personalities monthly, shedding selves the way trees shed leaves" followed immediately by another metaphor, and the final paragraph's triple parallelism ("choosing creation over collapse, beauty over despair, connection over isolation") reads as thematic scaffolding rather than propulsion. Minor paraphrase loop between "blooming resistance" mentions. No major loops or template cadence, but the closure paragraph's elevated diction and summary tone slightly dull momentum. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—vagrant poet rebuilding a rusted open-air library as resistance—synthesizes familiar material (found-family resilience, art as witness) with specific, grounded detail (coffee tin false bottom, prison library origin, monthly personality shifts). The rusted library setting and Sable's shifting selves offer fresh texture. However, the emotional arc and thematic resolution follow a template path: ongoing resistance validated rather than transformed by a specific choice or cost. The "act of rebuilding is itself the resistance" insight, while coherent, lacks a turn that grows inevitably from prior particulars. Proximity to "beauty from ashes" tropes is managed but not fully transcended.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Sable, the vagrant penny poet, is present throughout and her choices (organizing books, placing poems, self-assessment) drive beats. Setup is immediate; middle development shows her selecting and hiding poems; closure returns to her walking into the city with the coffee tin. However, her decisions do not create a key turn—she continues an established pattern rather than making a choice that alters tactics or stakes. The character is essential to texture but not indispensable to a plot turn with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The coffee tin with false bottom appears in two distinct beats: Sable retrieves poems from it mid-scene and tucks it back at dawn. Setup is mid-story (~30%); it enables her witness work (hiding poems) and recurs with consistent function. However, it does not return with reweighted meaning or constrain a choice—it remains a storage device. The specificity (dented, stained, twist-bottom mechanism) is vivid, but the object could be replaced with another hiding method without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Blooming resistance" is named explicitly and frames the library project: "anyone can come, anyone can take, anyone can give." It shapes the dominant stake (forge beauty, bear witness) and recurs in the final image ("seeds planted in darkness"). However, it functions more as theme label than tactic-altering concept—the resistance is described rather than tested by a choice that narrows options. The concept is present across beats but does not change options on the page with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Molts personalities monthly" is established early with concrete examples (weeping, raging, whispering past selves vs. current brave/reconstructive self). Marcus's question "Who are you this month?" and Sable's self-assessment give it middle development. However, the trait does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost—it colors her interiority but does not alter a tactic or force a trade-off. The attribute is present and consistent but remains more character texture than causal lever.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Rebuild" is the central action: Marcus hauls cinder blocks, secures tarps; Sable organizes books. Setup is immediate; middle beats detail the physical work; closure explicitly reweights it ("the act of rebuilding is itself the resistance… they will rebuild it again tomorrow"). The action defines the dominant stake and frames the final image. It is not easily swappable—remove rebuilding and the story's logic collapses. However, no single rebuild choice on the page forces a turn; the action is ongoing pattern rather than decisive tactic shift.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The friendship sparked at the prison library is introduced early via backstory ("three years ago, sorting books… between Dickens and Dostoevsky"). It establishes their bond and explains the current collaboration. However, the origin story does not shape on-page attempts or tactics—it provides history but does not constrain present choices or return with reweighted meaning at closure. The method is functional context but replaceable; they could have met elsewhere without altering the rebuild action or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rusted library is anchored immediately in the opening line and detailed throughout (oxidizing shelves, crumbling walls, open roof, moon/starlight). It pressures choices: vulnerable shelves require tarp protection; the open sky and ruin enable the "anyone can come" ethos. The setting supplies micro-resources (wooden poetry box, cinder blocks) and charges the final image ("open-roofed and star-touched, patient as any growing thing"). It is indispensable—remove the rusted library and the premise dissolves. Strong causal and closure integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"As the moon clears the skyline" opens the piece and bookends with "dawn approaches," establishing a single night's window. Time is tracked loosely (moon rises higher, stars fade) but does not tighten decisions—the work proceeds at the same pace regardless of elapsed minutes. No live clock or deadline alters tactics. The timeframe provides atmospheric coherence but is not load-bearing for escalation or closure; a longer or shorter night would not change the outcome.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To forge beauty from anarchy" is Sable's stated need, present in the opening ("her need to forge beauty from anarchy") and enacted through organizing books and hiding witness poems. Middle beats dramatize the motivation (placing seven new poems, reflecting on their potential impact). Closure echoes it ("choosing creation over collapse, beauty over despair"). However, the motivation is more declared than tested—no on-page friction between want and cost forces a trade-off. It shapes texture and frames action but does not drive a conflicted choice with visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Luminous fracture" as tone is present throughout: "wounded cathedral," "fractured light," "luminous fracture of what was and what might be," and the closing "fractures will let in the light." The tone is coherent, modulates with the nocturnal progression (moonrise to dawn), and charges the final image with poetic resonance. Diction sustains the fracture/light duality without static repetition. However, the tone does not shift under pressure—it remains lyrically elevated without tightening or breaking, offering atmospheric consistency rather than escalation.</comment>
