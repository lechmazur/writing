<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Morrow's motivation is clearly rooted in her unique perception ability, and her final action (hanging the tapestry) feels earned. Her grief and wonder are embodied through the wall-touching rather than labeled. The transition from historian work to emotional recognition tracks cleanly, though the secondary character Elise exists only in diary form, which limits relational pressure. Her renunciation of full closure (sitting in the dark, finding "everything in nothing") reads as Earned Stasis with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens: the piece layers discovery (diaries → wall memories → tapestry) and deepens through resonance rather than causal turns. Orientation anchors within the first two paragraphs (who, where, when-frame). The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Morrow sits beneath the tapestry in darkness, the cost legible in her stillness and the "bronze quiet" continuing outside. One meaningful deepening—walls holding dreams—reweights the stake from mere archival work to recovery of lost human capacity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The silo's curved walls are tactile and recurrent, directly enabling Morrow's discovery method and charging the final image when the tapestry is hung where "bronze light fell warmest." The fireplace (cold for forty years) and the spiral stairs provide spatial choreography. The half-burned diaries function as micro-setting objects that constrain her probing method. The dragon tapestry, described through thread and eye tilt, anchors the ending and constrains the final choice of placement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: Morrow seeks what walls have heard. The discovery that walls remember *dreams* narrows her understanding and drives the climb to find the tapestry. The final act—hanging the fragment and sitting beneath it—forecloses active cataloging in favor of witness, an Earned Stasis with visible opportunity cost. One tightening (walls heard dreams) and one deepening (dragons = last symbols) suffice under the Accumulative lens. Persistent constraint: the dreamless condition shapes all tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: grain-to-bread, book-to-tears, dream-to-memory. The dragons function not as overt symbols but as the "last symbols of the dreaming mind," and their sadness is specific (eyes tilted, wings half-folded). The ending offers a non-literal answer: memory of dreaming persists even without access, charged by Morrow's sitting vigil. No moralizing; the final line ("finding everything in nothing") reprices the premise without stating a thesis. The piece resists tidy resolution—the world remains dreamless, yet something "like sleep descended."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited. Perceptual signature is distinct: Morrow reads stone, feels "sediment of secrets," perceives "vibration of pages turning." Diction ("bronze quiet," "chambered nautilus," "geology") is character-particular and consistent. The piece sustains lyric compression without obscuring who is perceiving. Elise exists only through diary voice, preventing dialogue or head-hopping. Psychic distance tightens at the tapestry discovery ("eyes…suddenly wet") without breaking frame.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies (short declaratives at closure, longer syntactic weaves in reflection). Information density is high: most sentences do multiple jobs (e.g., "grain once waited to become bread" establishes setting, timeframe, and theme). Minor loop: "stories walls have heard" appears three times without reweighting. Figurative language is controlled and voice-motivated ("chambered nautilus," "geological strata"). No filter-verb stacks or template cadence in peak beats. The final paragraph's repetition of "memory" and "ghost" feels purposeful rather than artifactual.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dreamless-humanity premise is fresh, and the silo setting integrates organically rather than as convenience. The concept of walls remembering dreams offers a non-obvious angle on loss. The tapestry functions as specific discovery rather than deus ex machina. Risk-taking: the piece commits to quietness and lyric accumulation without forced drama, and the closure resists explaining or resolving the displaced axis. Proximity check clear; no famous-line echoes. Slight deduction: the "historian who collects stories walls have heard" could trend toward archetype without the wall-touching specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Morrow makes three distinct choices: probing diaries, touching the wall, climbing to retrieve the tapestry, and hanging it. Her oddness is dramatized (colleagues called her odd, she does unconventional work) and her final vigil under the tapestry forecloses active cataloging. Present in setup, middle discovery, and closure. The trait "odd" constrains her professional path and enables her unique method.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tapestry appears in Elise's diary (first third), is retrieved by Morrow mid-story, and hangs in the final image where she sits beneath it. Its specific details (amber and bronze scales, sad eyes, half-folded wings) charge the ending. The dragons reweight the theme: last symbols of dreaming. Used in three beats (diary mention, discovery, hanging) with evolving meaning. Strong closure linkage; visible cost (Morrow's stillness and grief). Could not be swapped for a generic object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The displaced axis frames the entire world (humanity lost dreams) and shapes the stake: Morrow seeks what remains of that lost realm. It alters tactics (she probes residue rather than active minds) and the ending's cost (she can only witness, not restore). Present in setup and echoed at closure ("the dreamless world continued"). Mid-band: it is essential context but does not turn on-page pressure in a discrete beat; instead it steadily constrains all action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Sensitively perceptive" is dramatized: Morrow presses palms to stone and feels conversations, vibrations, dreams. This ability enables the wall-touch discovery (middle beat) and the final recognition. It carries implicit cost (colleagues found her odd; she works alone). Present in setup, middle, and implied at closure. The trait is irreplaceable to the method. Slight deduction: the label appears once; the ability is shown more than the sensitivity's personal cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Probe" is her stated method and drives two beats: examining the half-burned diaries and pressing her palm to the wall to detect dreams. The climb and hanging follow from that discovery. Present in setup and middle; implied at closure (she listens to what walls remembered). Could arguably be replaced with "search" or "examine" with minor edits, limiting irreplaceability. The probing does enable the key turn (walls heard dreams).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The half-burned diaries are Morrow's "preferred method" (stated early), and the burn marks tell her "more than preservation ever could." They introduce Elise and the tapestry. Present in setup and referenced at the discovery. The fireplace detail (cold for forty years) adds specificity. Mid-band: the method enables the hunt but does not constrain a later tactical choice or reappear at closure. Swappability: another artifact type could serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The silo's curved walls are essential: they hold the memories Morrow reads, enable her tactile method, and provide the spatial anchor (spiral stairs, highest shelf). The setting pressures her choice (she climbs to find the tapestry) and supplies the "warmest bronze light" placement for the final image. Present in setup, middle (climb), and closure (sitting beneath the tapestry). Specific and irreplaceable; the curvature and history are integral. Strong causal role across three beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The timeframe ("after the last human dream is dreamt") establishes the world rule, the stake (recovering dream-memory), and the ending's cost (eternal wakefulness, "bronze quiet turning"). It appears in setup and closure. Does not tighten tactical choices beat-to-beat but reconfigures all meaning: Morrow's work becomes preservation of what cannot return. The "forty years" cold fireplace detail adds specificity. Lyric reprise (setup → ending) with clear thematic weight.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Morrow's motivation (collect stories walls have heard) is stated early, dramatized in her diary work and wall-touching, and deepened when she discovers walls heard *dreams*. This recognition drives the climb and tapestry retrieval. The final vigil (listening to what walls remembered) completes the desire with visible cost: she finds meaning but cannot restore dreams. Present in setup, middle turn, and closure. Friction: the desire meets resistance (burned pages, lost access to dreaming).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Bronze quiet" appears early (post-axis world), modulates through "bronze light" (tapestry placement), and returns at closure ("bronze quiet turning"). The tone coheres: hushed, elegiac, layered. It charges the final image (Morrow in darkness, listening) and reflects the emotional stakes (grief, wonder, stubborn hope). Consistent through turns without becoming static. The descriptor is specific and irreplaceable, tied to the world's altered state. Strong lyric integration across setup and ending.</comment>
