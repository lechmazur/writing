<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's internal contradiction is embodied through concrete choices—tracing coffee cup, lifting the violin, beginning the true report—but the peak decision feels more explained than dramatized. The mulberry ache and roses' urgings provide texture, yet the moment she begins writing lacks visceral cost or visible struggle; the turn reads as inevitable rather than hard-won. Backstory (telepathy origin, Empire's promise) is economical and anchors present stakes without flattening momentum. Minor: "dismissed by colleagues as superstition" tells rather than shows the professional cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean by the second paragraph (who, where, when). The drive lens reads Causal with Accumulative coloring: discoveries (transparent violin, roses' story, coffee-stain futures) narrow Elara's options until she writes the true report. Closure is a Decisive Change with conceptual cost—her professional dream dims, truth propagates—legible in the final paragraphs. One substantive tightening (learning the child's story → choosing truth) is sufficient for this length. Minor: the cost is more asserted ("some dreams worth more than empires") than shown in a concrete forfeiture on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The velvet observatory is vivid and specific (burgundy folds, absorbed echoes, great window, renamed constellations) and constrains Elara's solitary work. The transparent violin and black velvet cushion anchor tactile choices. Spatial choreography is clean. The setting charges the final image (roses singing, gardens spreading news) and the detail that "even the sky had been colonized" sharpens thematic pressure. Minor: midsummer and the observatory's function as telescope-space remain underutilized in the central conflict.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—authenticate for recognition versus tell the truth—is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful reversal (roses' revelation). Elara's agency drives the turn: she lifts the violin, reads the distortion, begins the true report. The cost is conceptual and relational (dimmed promise, propagated truth) rather than immediate physical forfeiture, which fits the Causal-Accumulative lens but lands more obliquely than viscerally. The "perforated destiny" metaphor and coffee-stain futures add texture but don't force a second on-page narrowing of tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—truth versus sanitized history, the cost of belonging—emerges from concrete particulars (frozen child, razed village, renamed stars, propagating roses) without overt moralizing. The final image (ice violin singing, roots spreading) offers a resonant answer to the central question. "Some dreams worth more than empires" is close to thematic summary but is earned by prior imagery. The perforated-destiny and propagate motifs recur with shifting weight. Minor: "mulberry ache" as a color-emotion hybrid is poetic but risks abstraction; it does not fully embody the cost on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; Elara's perceptual signature (coffee sediment, roses' whispers, transparent distortion) is distinct. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close ("traced her finger") to reflective ("she realized"). The prose carries a consistent lyric register ("velvet darkness," "mulberry ache," "perforated destiny") that fits the character's researcher idiom without head-hopping. Minor: no dialogue on the page to test voice distinction. The final paragraph's "some dreams…some promises" leans slightly toward narrated wisdom rather than Elara's exact thought, though it remains within plausible internal voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well (short beats, longer reflections) and information density is high. Clarity is mostly strong. Minor loop: "the promise" is named three times in close succession (paragraphs 7–8) without advancing new detail. Stock phrases cluster: "the color of mulberry ache," "like lace, like something riddled with holes" stacks similes without sharpening the image. Filter-verb stack in paragraph 2: "she had discovered," "she couldn't name," "wanted her to confirm"—three in quick sequence. Template cadence in paragraph 4: "It had belonged… It had belonged… had razed." These artifacts appear outside the closure beat, so no 9+ disqualification, but they dull momentum mid-story. Overall propulsion is good; the ending is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of telepathic plants, ice-crystal artifact, and imperial history is specific and non-generic. The transparent violin through which "she could see the observatory behind it, distorted" is a fresh visual that serves theme. The plot arc (provenance researcher choosing truth over empire) is familiar but personalized through the roses-as-witnesses and coffee-divination details. The "perforated destiny" conceit is poetic yet somewhat abstract; it does not constrain tactics on the page as sharply as the other elements. Minor: the Empire's two-century-old atrocity and renamed stars are effective but not deeply transformed beyond competent execution of a familiar anti-colonial frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's role as provenance researcher frames the inciting problem (authenticate the violin) and the stakes (professional recognition versus historical truth). Her choices—examining the violin, reading coffee stains, beginning the true report—drive the two key beats. The occupation is not merely a label; it motivates her access, her knowledge of lineage, and the weight of her decision. Present in setup, middle choice (lifting the violin to see distortion), and closure (writing the report). Cost is conceptual but legible.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The transparent violin appears in setup (paragraph 2), is handled twice (Elara lifts it, sees the observatory distorted through it), and returns in the ending image (singing in the velvet darkness). Its material properties (ice crystal that should melt but doesn't) and its transparency (distorting the room) directly enable the thematic turn. The child's spirit crystallized within charges the closure. Removing the violin would collapse the plot; no generic artifact could replace it. High irreplaceability and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Perforated destiny" is introduced in paragraph 5 and recurs in paragraph 10 ("her destiny was perforated too"). It enriches theme (gaps where meaning can enter, holes that let in light) but does not constrain an on-page choice or tactic. The concept is more lyric echo than causal lever; Elara's decision to tell the truth is driven by the roses' story and the coffee-stain reading, not by the perforated-ness of fate. Purposeful early–final reprise reweights the stake slightly, placing it in mid-band, but swappable language could convey similar ambiguity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Plant telepathy is signaled in paragraph 3 (origin story: northern glaciers expedition) and enables two key beats: the roses tell Elara the violin's true story (paragraph 3) and sing in harmony at the ending, spreading news through roots (paragraph 14). The trait constrains her access to hidden history and provides the emotional chorus that supports her choice. Without it, the inciting knowledge and the propagation closure would require different mechanics. Cost is implicit (the accident changed her) but not foregrounded. Strong causal role; present in setup, middle, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Propagate" appears three times with escalating weight: the Empire's sanitized history would spread (paragraph 4), truth would propagate like wildfire through scholar networks (paragraph 11), and roses propagate the news through roots by morning (paragraph 14). The verb frames both the problem and the solution, making it indispensable to closure. The final image depends on this exact action. Removing "propagate" would require a different thematic verb and weaken the echo structure. High causal integration and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Reading the future in coffee stains is introduced in paragraph 1 and used once in paragraph 4 to show Elara two paths (authenticate or tell truth) and again in paragraph 11 to foresee truth's wildfire spread. The method enables her decision by making consequences legible. It is specific to her grandmother's gift and fits the story's magical-realist texture. However, the mechanics are not tested under pressure; a different divination method (cards, stars) could serve similar function with minor edits. Present in setup and shaping the middle turn, but not returned at closure. Mid-band for purposeful use without full irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The velvet observatory is named in the opening line and anchors all action: its velvet folds gather twilight, its soft walls absorb echoes (solitude enabling the choice), the great window frames renamed stars (imperial colonization theme), the telescope looms (pointing at generals' constellations). The setting's velvet texture recurs in the ending ("velvet darkness"). It pressures Elara's solitary decision and charges the final image. Midsummer is noted but not used tactically. Strong thematic and atmospheric integration; the setting could not be swapped for a generic room without losing symbolic weight.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Before the promise loses its glow" is voiced by the roses in paragraph 7 and reflected in paragraph 8 ("the glow of that promise had sustained her… now it was dimming"). The timeframe creates urgency (act now while the promise still has power) and is referenced at closure ("some promises were meant to dim"). It tightens the decision window but is not tracked as a live clock with concrete beats. The glow is more metaphor than measured countdown. Purposeful reprise with thematic weight, but replaceable phrasing could convey similar urgency. Mid-band for shaping one turn without on-page temporal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To weigh a dream against an empire" is stated explicitly in paragraph 9 and dramatized through Elara's internal conflict (recognition and belonging versus the child's story, truth versus sanitized history). The desire drives her coffee-stain reading, her lifting of the violin, and her final choice to write the true report. Cost is visible in the dimming promise and the forfeited professional future. The motivation is present in setup (emissary's promise), tested in the middle (lifting violin, seeing distortion), and resolved at closure (writing the report). High coherence and causal pressure; removing this exact want-versus-cost frame would weaken the stakes.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Mulberry ache" appears once in paragraph 8 as "the color of mulberry ache pressed deep into her chest," a poetic register that colors Elara's emotional state. The tone—elegiac, contemplative, tinged with loss—coheres across the piece (velvet darkness, crystalline singing, midsummer twilight) and modulates under pressure (from tracing coffee to lifting violin to writing). The final image sustains the tone (dead child's voice echoing across centuries). However, "mulberry ache" is not returned or reweighted at closure; the exact phrase is ornamental rather than structural. Coherent atmospheric contribution without full causal integration.</comment>
