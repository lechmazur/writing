<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira's characterization is strong: her "wisdom wore foolishness like armor" manifests through concrete choices (the deliberate chart errors, the strategic timing). Internal life is embodied through her needlework and observations rather than diagnostic labels. However, the protagonist remains largely passive—she gathers intelligence and plans but takes no on-page action that costs her anything immediate; the actual confrontation with Adara happens off-page in three nights, so the renunciation or risk never crystallizes here.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (who, where, when within opening lines). The conspiracy exposition unfolds through concrete observations (Vessik's meetings, the reassigned guard, the star chart commission). However, closure is deferred: Mira completes her subversive embroidery and imagines the future warning, but no decisive change occurs on the page—the princess hasn't arrived, the coup hasn't been thwarted, and Mira's stance at story end is identical to her stance at story start. The final image ("let them think her a fool") restates the opening premise without visible cost or reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory, eternal flame, autumn winds, and embroidery frame are vividly rendered and consistently present. The flame's restlessness toward the east window and the autumn leaves scraping the dome create atmospheric pressure. The eternal flame functions as more than décor: Mira pulls her frame closer to study how its light "transformed her silver threads into rivers of possibility," guiding her tactical choice to weave aberrations. Spatial choreography (dome slats, east window, capital below) remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake (warn the kingdom of the coup) is clear and tightens once when Mira devises her embroidery plan. However, escalation is minimal: she gathers evidence, forms a plan, and executes it without complication, setback, or on-page cost. The story operates in a single pressure register from inciting observation to plan completion. No reversal tests her commitment; coincidence (the princess's scheduled visit) enables rather than complicates. The cost—risk of discovery, personal jeopardy—remains abstract and unfelt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: power overlooking the powerless, truth conveyed through indirection, "stories lived in the spaces between stars." The eternal flame, silver threads, and cobalt setting accumulate meaning without overt symbolism. The final image—"Fools, after all, were never suspected of saving kingdoms"—resonates without moralizing, reweighting Mira's "foolishness" as strategic armor. The piece invites reflection on unheard stories and adjacent truths without thesis-statement intrusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Voice is controlled and distinctive: elevated diction ("doddering," "adjacent possibilities," "usurper in ascendancy") suits an observatory embroiderer's interior world without register mismatch. POV remains stable third-limited; psychic distance modulates purposefully (intimate during embroidery, wider for conspiracy summary). Perceptual signature is consistent: Mira notices constellations, threading metaphors, pauses between words. No head-hopping. The line "stories lived in the spaces between stars" exemplifies the voice's lyric precision under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean and propulsive with varied syntax and strong imagery ("silver thread catching blue flame light," "seats empty as tombs"). Information density is high; sentences consistently do double duty (atmosphere + plot). Minor friction: "echoed silence" repeats twice and "adjacent possibilities" appears in both narrative summary and Mira's thought without dramatization of the method. The "needlework = storytelling" metaphor threads (pun intended) throughout but risks decorative threading in places. No template cadence or loops detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The embroiderer-as-spy premise offers a fresh angle, and the choice to encode warnings in star-chart errors is specific and clever. However, the "wise fool overlooked by power" trope is familiar and not substantially transformed—Mira's disguise works because the story asserts it does, not because we see her tactical deployment tested. The mechanics of "adjacent possibilities" remain abstract label rather than dramatized method. The ending's inevitability ("she would tell one of her own") feels assured rather than earned through on-page friction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira the embroiderer is present throughout and makes key choices: to listen for conspiracy fragments, to devise the aberration plan, to time the warning for Adara's visit. Her craft enables the plot's central tactic (encoding warnings in embroidery). She appears in the final image. However, her choices unfold without complication or visible cost on the page; she decides, executes, and awaits validation off-page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The eternal flame appears in multiple beats: initial description with "blue shadows," restless motion toward the east window signaling unease, and Mira pulling her frame closer to study how its light transforms her threads into "rivers of possibility." It participates in her tactical choice (the light guides her embroidery plan) and returns in the final paragraph. However, its use tilts decorative—atmospheric rather than constraining choice with cost. The flame's "approval" is asserted metaphorically rather than felt as pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Unraveling conspiracies shapes the entire plot: Mira pieces together Vessik's meetings, guard reassignments, council absences, and the Usurper chart commission. The conspiracy creates the dominant stake and drives her embroidery tactic. The concept is not merely thematic but operational—her method (indirect warning) mirrors the conspiracy's own coded communication. It appears in setup, middle evidence-gathering, and the closure plan. Cost remains abstract (risk of discovery is declared but not tested), capping the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mira's disguise—"wisdom wore foolishness like armor," singing nonsense rhymes, asking absurd questions—is established early and enables the entire plot (conspirators never watch her). It recurs in the final image: "Let them think her a fool. Fools, after all, were never suspected of saving kingdoms." However, the attribute is told more than shown in action: we see her embroidering and planning but never witness a moment where she actively performs foolishness to deflect suspicion or where the disguise costs her something immediate.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Synchronize" appears once as Mira's verb for her plan: "What if she could synchronize her knowledge with someone who could?" The term fits her strategy (aligning her embroidered warnings with Adara's observational skill), but the action itself is preparation, not dramatized synchronization. The embroidery errors are her tactic, not the synchronization—that event waits off-page when Adara arrives. Present in middle planning but absent from closure enactment; swappable with "coordinate" or "align."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Through adjacent possibilities" is invoked once: "Through adjacent possibilities, she had always found her answers—not by confronting truth directly, but by approaching it sideways, through the doors that stood next to the obvious ones." It names her general method and motivates the indirect embroidery plan. However, the mechanics remain abstract metaphor rather than demonstrated process. The phrase does not constrain tactics (she could have chosen direct warning and rejected it for practical reasons) and does not reappear or charge the closure. Present in middle reflection; swappable with "indirection" or "oblique approach."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory is vividly established (cracked dome slats, autumn winds, vast chamber, cobalt tiles) and anchors every beat. It supplies key resources: the eternal flame's light, isolation for planning, the scheduled eclipse viewing that brings Adara. The setting creates pressure (the conspirators' capital lights glitter below; the observatory's isolation enables secrecy). Autumn's presence (winds, leaves scraping tiles) recurs and charges the final image. The observatory is indispensable to plot logic and atmosphere; removing it breaks the story.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Before the coup" and "within the fortnight" establish temporal urgency and motivate Mira's accelerated plan. "In three nights, the young Princess Adara would visit" creates a countdown that tightens her window. Time pressure is signaled and shapes her choice to act now rather than wait. However, the clock remains background declaration rather than on-page friction—no moment where time runs out or forces a costly trade-off during execution. Present in setup and middle; absent from closure beats.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mira's desire "to listen for unheard stories—the ones that lived in pauses between words" is established early and drives her intelligence-gathering (noticing Vessik's hushed meetings, empty council seats, the chart's message). The motivation recurs in the final act: "Now...she would tell one of her own." However, the desire operates retrospectively—she has already been listening for forty years—rather than creating present friction. Her choice to act on this story feels inevitable from her established character rather than a conflicted want tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Echoed silence" appears in the title phrase ("Mira worked in echoed silence, the vast chamber swallowing all sound") and recurs implicitly (footsteps fade, autumn wind "whispered," leaves "scraped"). The tone is consistent: contemplative quiet charged with hidden urgency, isolation that enables focus. Tone modulates subtly from opening stillness through conspiracy revelation to charged anticipation at closure ("the eternal flame danced once more, illuminating possibilities"). The sonic restraint heightens the conspiracy's secrecy and Mira's solitary agency, charging the final image without breaking key.</comment>
