<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The skimmer's interiority is poetic but abstract; its "wanting" to navigate and "learning" through observation are told rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure. The piece offers no embodied emotion or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously—only serene contemplation across centuries. The arrowhead revelation ("This arrowhead had killed something sacred") feels declared rather than earned by prior causality, and the final "peace in stillness" reads as an epiphany without visible cost or foreclosed path. The motivation remains label-only; no genuine struggle or mistake compounds before resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph, satisfying the test. The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode: centuries of observation → birds → arrowhead → understanding. However, the closure unit—"The skimmer understood now why it was here"—lands as conceptual repricing without a legible on-page cost; the piece tells us there is peace and purpose but does not dramatize what option was foreclosed or what price was paid. The arrowhead discovery at the 60% mark functions as a turning point, but the final realization feels asserted rather than charged by prior pressure. One meaningful deepening is present, but cost remains oblique.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The canyon of bone towers is vividly rendered with specificity: "towers of bone rose like forgotten prayers," "centuries-thick layers" of dust, obsidian arrowhead "from mountains that no longer existed." The setting charges the final image (towers as witness, echoes carrying forward) and constrains the skimmer's choices by anchoring it in place. Sensory hierarchy remains consistent with the skimmer's resonance-based perception. The arrowhead functions as micro-setting, returning with reweighted meaning at closure. No spatial or factual inconsistencies noted.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving—is signaled early. The piece offers one tightening: the arrowhead's discovery narrows the skimmer's understanding from "prisoner" to "keeper." However, agency is limited to observation and realization; no decision forecloses a path with visible cost. The resolution ("There was peace in stillness") is told rather than earned through a choice that alters tactics or options. Under Accumulative/Textural lens, pressure deepens once but the cost at closure is conceptual and oblique rather than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: the bone towers, the arrowhead, the birds' formations spelling questions. The piece resists overt moralizing and sustains ambiguity around whether the skimmer is prisoner or keeper until the arrowhead revelation. The final answer—"Is there peace in stillness? Yes"—offers a resonant but somewhat stated response; the conceptual repricing reweights prior material without a moral, though the insight veers close to platitude ("some journeys were meant to be made through understanding"). The recurring motif (birds, echoes, arrowhead) accumulates meaning without forced checklist recurrence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable throughout: third-person limited to the skimmer's consciousness, with appropriate distance and perceptual signature ("humming in frequencies," "reading their patterns"). Diction is elevated and consistent: "pulse left wandering," "weathered resolve," "living calligraphy." No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks in peak beats. The voice sustains a lyric, meditative texture without mechanical template cadence. Brief compression at closure ("The answer resonated through bone and stone alike") supports the Accumulative mode and does not obscure interiority. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and rhythmically controlled: "towers of bone rose like forgotten prayers against a sky grown tired of color." However, paraphrase loops appear in adjacent paragraphs: "Through the birds, it would continue to learn... Through stillness, it would preserve" recycles structure without added pressure. The final paragraph summarizes rather than propelling: "It was weathered but resolute, ancient but unbroken, still as stone and vast as the sky"—a stack of adjectives that dulls the closure image. Minor scaffold in "The revelation came after three hundred years" (telling rather than showing the discovery). No mixed metaphors or register drift, but density could tighten in the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—an immobile consciousness learning to navigate through observation—offers a fresh angle on confinement and agency. The arrowhead as memorial and the birds as navigation method are specific and purposeful. However, the emotional arc (observation → understanding → peace) follows a familiar trajectory of acceptance without substantial transformation. The final image reweights prior material but does not surprise; the epiphany feels logical rather than inevitable in hindsight. The story commits fully to its lyric mode, though the closure veers toward abstraction ("echoes carried forward what silence alone could never hold") instead of a final concrete particular.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The harmonic stone skimmer is present throughout and frames the entire narrative. However, it makes no key decisions; its "choices" are to observe, extend harmonic reach, and understand—passive realizations rather than actions that alter tactics. The skimmer's final stance ("keeper" vs. "prisoner") is a conceptual shift told to the reader, not dramatized through a choice with visible cost. Present in setup, development, and closure, but swappable with any other bound observer. Mid-band for presence across beats without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The stone arrowhead appears at the 60% mark, is appraised in one extended beat, and returns in the penultimate paragraph ("The arrowhead remained where it lay, a memorial and a reminder"). It reweights the skimmer's understanding from prisoner to keeper, shaping the central realization. However, it is not handled or used in multiple distinct beats—only observed and contemplated. Late first appearance (−0.5), but closure linkage (+1.0) and causal pressure on the realization (+0.8) elevate the score. Swappable with another artifact (obsidian blade, bone shard) with minor edits (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"A pulse left wandering" is introduced in the opening and reprised twice: "The pulse left wandering was not a curse but a calling" and the penultimate paragraph. It frames the skimmer's nature but does not constrain tactics or alter options on the page; the phrase functions thematically rather than causally. Present in setup and closure with charged reprise, but does not shape middle choices or enable/narrow actions. Lyric resonance qualifies for mid-band, but lack of beat involvement and causal pressure limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Historically reverent" is introduced early ("It was historically reverent by nature and necessity") and mentioned again: "touching each tower of bone with reverent recognition." However, the trait is label-only; it does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost. The skimmer's stillness is attributed to reverence, but the choice to remain bound is backstory rather than a dramatized decision. Present in setup and thematically consistent, but ornamental (−0.8). No middle beat where reverence forces a tradeoff or enables a tactic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Appraise" occurs once in a key beat: "The skimmer began to appraise the arrowhead, reading its composition, its age, its buried story." This action triggers the central realization (prisoner → keeper), shaping the closure. However, it appears only in one beat and could be swapped with "examine," "sense," or "read" with minor edits (−0.6). Present in development and causal to closure (+1.2), but not signaled early (−0.4) and not repeated or varied across beats. Mid-band for single-beat causal work.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Through the patterns in a flock of birds in flight" is introduced at ~30% and developed across multiple beats: learning to read formations, casting awareness outward, the birds spelling questions, and "Through the birds, it would continue to learn." The method enables the skimmer's navigation and shapes its understanding of how to move without moving. Signaled early (+0.5), present in two distinct beats (+0.9), causal pressure on tactics (+0.8), and closure linkage (+0.9). However, the mechanics remain abstract—how patterns translate to navigation is told, not shown (−0.5). Solid integration with minor opacity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "towers of bone in a canyon of endless echoes" anchor the opening, constrain the skimmer's stillness ("To move would be to disturb"), supply the arrowhead discovery site, and charge the final image ("The towers of bone stood witness, and the echoes carried forward"). Present in setup (+0.6), development (the canyon as sacred constraint, +0.6), and closure (+1.2). The setting's specificity (bone towers, dust layers, echoes) is irreplaceable (+0.6) and directly shapes the skimmer's choice to remain still with visible cost (loss of physical freedom, +0.5). Strong causal and thematic integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Through centuries of layered dust" appears in the opening and is referenced throughout ("three hundred years of patient observation," "centuries-thick layers"). However, the timeframe functions as background texture rather than a live constraint; no on-page decision is tightened by a ticking clock or passage of time. The centuries deepen the atmosphere but do not alter tactics or narrow options. Present in setup and thematically consistent, but ornamental (−0.8). The lack of urgency or temporal pressure keeps the score in the lower-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To learn to navigate without moving" is introduced early ("the skimmer learned... to navigate without moving") and drives the dominant stake through the birds sequence and arrowhead discovery. The motivation shapes the middle beats (observation → method → realization) and is present at closure ("Even the motionless could journey far"). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices; no friction between wanting to move and the cost of stillness appears on the page. Setup (+0.6), development (+0.6), closure (+1.0), but lacks embodied conflict (−0.6). Solid thematic integration with limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Weathered resolve" is signaled in the opening ("weathered resolve"), sustained through the skimmer's patient observation across centuries, and reprised in the final paragraph ("weathered but resolute"). Tone modulates appropriately: serene contemplation during observation, deeper weight at the arrowhead discovery, and quiet certainty at closure. The tone charges the final image and remains coherent through turns without static uniformity. Setup (+0.6), consistent across beats (+0.6), closure linkage (+1.0), and rhythmic control under pressure (+0.5). Strong tonal integration with no contradictions or forced pivots.</comment>
