<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent, but her interior life remains abstract—"something her heart had always known but her mind had never grasped" bypasses the concrete contradiction that would ground her agency. The grandmother's backstory occupies meaningful space yet feels inserted rather than anchoring a present micro-choice. The statues' confusion and the trees' uprooting lack embodied resistance or cost that would test Mira's commitment; she succeeds without meaningful struggle or trade-off visible on the page. Her transformation from street musician to catalyst reads declared rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens inferred as Accumulative/Textural: the orchard procession and city replanting gather symbolic weight through patterned repetition. Orientation anchors adequately (sky-bridge violinist, city with mechanical citizens, dusk orchard) by the first third. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the orchard relocated, statues shifted from imprisonment to guardianship—but the cost remains conceptual and oblique; no visible price (fatigue, social consequence, loss of anonymity) appears on the page to charge the final image. The "gap between knowing and understanding" timeframe is poetic but does not tighten decisions or impose urgency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The enchanted orchard with silver trunks and glowing fruit, plus the city's chrome borders and factory towers, establish a coherent steampunk-fantasy hybrid. The locust shell handled twice (case tumble, branch ornament) and the statues' cracking footsteps provide tactile micro-setting. However, spatial choreography during the procession is vague—thirty-seven trees following Mira "back to the city's edge" lacks the friction of terrain, distance, or physical toll that would constrain her choice. The plaza planting occurs off-page between "dawn" and "noon," losing the chance for setting to pressure the act.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: reawaken beauty in the mechanical city. The orchard's uprooting is a meaningful turn, but it unfolds without resistance—the statues hesitate and follow, the trees choose to leave, and the city accepts the replanting with no dramatized opposition. Mira's heart-rhythm melody succeeds on first attempt; no failed tactic, no visible cost (arrest, exile, exhaustion, broken strings), and no trade-off between competing goods appears on the page. The accumulative lens supports thematic deepening, yet pressure does not escalate; the story delivers a procession rather than a tightening choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme—beauty versus efficiency, transformation as shedding rather than escape—emerges cleanly from the locust-shell image and the trees' migration. The final image (Mira beneath the tree, shell as ornament, children touching fruit, clockwork hearts stuttering into life) offers a non-literal answer with conceptual cost: the city's precision yielding to messy wonder. Minor slip: "She had uprooted more than trees" edges toward summary moralizing, though it stays grounded in prior action. The piece resists false balance and invites reflection without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited. Perceptual signature is present—"resonantly soft" recurs, and Mira's musician's lens shapes description ("clockwork hearts beating"). However, diction drifts toward elevated register during peak beats: "suspended in the gap between knowing and understanding," "kinship, recognition, invitation" reads more lyric-essay than character-particular thought under pressure. The grandmother's dialogue "They policed it with living statues" and Mira's interior "She understood then" are serviceable but lack the idiomatic texture that would distinguish this voice from template fantasy. No head-hopping; psychic distance remains controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and syntax supports emotional beats. Information density is adequate; most sentences advance story or atmosphere. Two paraphrase loops: "She began to play. Not the cheerful marches… She played something older" restates intent across three sentences without added pressure (−0.2). "The melody was resonantly soft, barely louder than breath, but it traveled differently than sound. It moved through her chest first" recycles the same content (−0.2). Stock metaphor "ripples in still water" and "morning frost" appear in adjacent paragraphs without transformation (−0.3). No filter-verb stacks or gross template cadence; clarity remains high.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The musician-liberates-enchanted-trees premise echoes familiar fantasy templates (magic as music, statues as guards, mechanical dystopia softened by organic wonder). The locust-shell metaphor and heart-rhythm signal offer specific texture, yet the emotional arc—lone artist changes the world through beauty, no personal cost—follows a well-worn path. The statues' confusion and the trees' voluntary migration provide a fresh inflection, but the lack of resistance or trade-off limits transformation of the template. The piece commits fully to its premise without retreat, earning mid-band placement, yet the synthesis feels more competent than surprising.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira present throughout; her decision to play (rather than take fruit) and to lead the trees back are on-page choices that drive two beats and shape the ending. Elevated by causal pressure and closure linkage, yet her choices lack visible cost or failed attempts that would push higher.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Locust shell appears twice: tumbles from case (beat 1), hung as ornament in final image (beat 2). The reprise reweights "transformation and flight" from grandmother's lesson to closure symbol, satisfying the lyric-resonance allowance. Caps at mid-6s because it does not constrain a middle choice or impose cost; it recurs with thematic charge but remains observational.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Breaking free" shapes Mira's realization ("becoming something that could fly") and the trees' uprooting, altering tactics across two beats. The concept participates in closure—statues shift purpose, trees relocate—changing options on the page. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage lift the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Resonantly soft" recurs three times and characterizes Mira's playing, but it does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost. The trait is label-present and thematically consistent, yet swappable with "gentle" or "quiet" without breaking story logic. One beat involvement (the playing scene) and closure mention, but no demonstrated trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Uproot" drives the central turn (trees pulling free) and the thematic closure (replanting in the city, redefining "uproot" as invitation rather than destruction). Present in setup (orchard), development (procession), and payoff (plaza planting). High irreplaceability; the physical act and metaphorical weight are indispensable. Minor cost visibility issue prevents 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Heart-rhythm signal appears in setup ("her heart-rhythm leading them"), constrains the middle choice (statues confused by the rhythm's non-threatening intent), and is present in closure ("her heart-rhythm calling"). The mechanics matter: it differentiates Mira's playing from theft-intent. Lacks a visible cost tied to the method (e.g., exhaustion, arrhythmia) that would elevate further.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Enchanted orchard with living statues pressures Mira's approach, supplies the trees as resource, and its rules (statues sense intention) shape her tactic (non-threatening melody). Present in setup, development (statue confusion), and payoff (statues relocate as guardians). The orchard's dual nature—prison and sanctuary—charges the final reconfiguration. Strong across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Gap between knowing and understanding" is poetic setup but does not function as a timeframe that tightens decisions. Dusk-to-dawn-to-noon progression tracks elapsed time without imposing urgency or altering tactics. The phrase reappears only once; no middle development or closure payoff. Swappable with "twilight" or omissible without harm.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mira's desire "to reawaken beauty" is stated early and drives her choice to play rather than take fruit, shaping two beats. The motivation participates in closure (city's clockwork hearts "less precise but more alive"). However, the desire is told more than dramatized—no on-page friction between her want and a competing cost (safety, anonymity, arrest risk). Functional across setup and payoff; lacks middle conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Tarnished wonder" coheres through "chrome borders," "clockwork hearts," "amber-gold locust shell," and "glowing purple fruit," modulating as the city accepts the orchard. The tone charges the final image: "tarnished place where magic struggled against rust, something ancient had taken root again." Present in all three gates with consistent texture and a clear shift at closure that supports the Resonant Reconfiguration.</comment>
