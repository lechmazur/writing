<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Thessaly's scattered nature is more atmospheric device than psychological reality—her "dispersed self" never creates an embodied choice dilemma or micro-hesitation that would show contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The dissolution at closure ("felt herself dissolving") reads as passive transformation rather than earned renunciation with visible cost. The refugees function as mood chorus rather than pressure sources; no relationship tests commitment or forces a tradeoff. Minor deduction for therapy-adjacent phrasing ("bound release") appearing as meta-commentary rather than lived experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates song fragments and light threads toward a collective singing that ignites the window—a valid pattern-to-crescendo design. Orientation anchor arrives promptly (mirror world, greenhouse, seven generations). However, the closure beat ("Thessaly was everywhere now") dissolves agency into abstraction; the cost is told ("spreading thinner") rather than shown through a specific forfeiture or tactical constraint that the reader witnesses. The final image reweights prior material but the felt price remains diffuse.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse supplies vivid anchors (phosphorescent fruit trees, mica window, silver-leaved trees) and the perpetual cold pressures the refugees' presence. The mica window's mineral composition (layered sheets) grounds the swaddling action concretely. Spatial choreography remains clear across Thessaly's movements. However, the setting never constrains a tactical choice—Thessaly gathers songs and weaves light without environmental friction or resource scarcity altering her method.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (rekindle the dying realm via collective song) signals early and accumulates through gathering fragments. One meaningful tightening: "the realm was dying faster than she could weave" raises urgency before the climactic gathering. The swaddling choice and Thessaly's self-dissolution carry conceptual weight but lack visible trade-off—no prior option is demonstrably foreclosed, no relationship or resource visibly sacrificed. The ending reconfigures meaning but the protagonist's agency at closure reads passive (dissolution happens to her) rather than a decision that narrows options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (community memory and collective creation vs. isolation and forgetting) emerges organically from the gathering and singing rather than assertion. The bound-release paradox charges the ending image when Thessaly's fragmentation becomes wholeness through dispersal. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("Communities that had forgotten they belonged to each other remembered now") rather than letting the image resonate without gloss. The woven-dawn motif accumulates purposefully and reweights at closure, avoiding token recurrence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited with stable distance; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but generic (translucent fingers, dispersed consciousness) without character-specific bias in what Thessaly notices or ignores. Diction occasionally drifts elevated ("alchemical," "translucent") without clear POV justification—Thessaly's interior lexicon is never established through micro-choice or idiom. The prose modulates with pressure (short clauses at the climax) but lacks a rhythmic signature that distinguishes this narrator's mind under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Clarity and propulsion are generally clean; sentence openings vary and paragraphs create visual rhythm. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "gathered what they forgot, holding their scattered memories when they could not" restates the opening premise; "The singing grew stronger. The light grew brighter" cycles template stems without added detail. Minor metaphor muddle: "bound release" as title concept is never concretely embodied in action or image, remaining abstract. Filter-verb stack in the final third ("felt herself dissolving," "felt her scattered self") dulls immediacy at a peak beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise (collective singing restores light) echoes familiar "lost-magic-rediscovered-through-community" templates without a sharp transformative angle. The scattered-memory-keeper conceit is vivid but underused—her fragmentation never creates a tactical constraint or ironic limitation that another character type would avoid. The swaddling image offers a fresh inflection on nurturing-as-creation but arrives late without prior setup. Emotional trajectory (despair to collective hope) follows a median arc; no bold risk or non-obvious moral calculus emerges.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Thessaly (scattered memory keeper) is present throughout and her gathering action drives the accumulation, but her choices are largely iterative (collect this song, then that one) without a key turn where her decision alters tactics or forecloses an option. The dissolution at closure happens to her rather than being chosen. Setup and development gates met; closure participation is passive observation of her own transformation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mica window appears early (void-showing surface), returns at midpoint (gathering point for refugees), and receives the swaddling action at closure where it blazes and "poured...first true light." All three gates met with strong closure linkage. The mineral-sheet detail (layered surface) enables the wrapping tactic. Specificity is high; removing this exact object (substituting a mirror, lens, or door) would break the swaddling logic and the layered-transparency metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Woven dawns (core concept) frames the premise and supplies the central tactic: songs materialize as light threads that Thessaly gathers and weaves. Setup and payoff gates met; development shows the threads growing stronger through accumulated songs. The concept shapes on-page action (gathering, weaving, swaddling) rather than remaining thematic. However, the mechanics are never constrained—no failed weaving, no wrong song that tangles the threads—so the concept enables without visible cost or friction.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Knits communities together" (attribute) is signaled early ("work knits communities together") and demonstrated when strangers gather to share melodies, completing fragments cooperatively. Setup and development gates met. However, the knitting itself never forces a tradeoff—no faction resists, no personal memory must be sacrificed for the collective whole. The attribute describes an outcome rather than constraining a choice; removing it would simplify theme but not break plot logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Swaddle (action) arrives in the climactic beat where Thessaly wraps the mica window in dawn-threads "like a mother protecting an infant against the cold," directly causing the window to glow and the realm's darkness to crack. Strong closure linkage and irreplaceability (weaving alone would not activate the window; the nurturing enclosure matters). Setup is light (no prior swaddling practice) but the image is specific and transforms prior gathering into protective act, charging the final turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Through forgotten songs (method) is signaled early (child's lullaby makes light threads appear) and recurs across beats (harvest hymn, spinning song, collective singing). All three gates met. The method shapes attempts (Thessaly must coax and recover rather than invent) and the collective singing at closure enacts the method one final time at scale. However, no song ever fails or produces wrong-color light, so the method enables without friction or visible cost tied to its mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Alchemical orchard greenhouse shrouded in endless night (setting) anchors who/where/when early, supplies vivid detail (phosphorescent trees, perpetual cold, refugee sanctuary), and the mica window as focal object charges the ending. Setup and payoff gates met. However, the setting never constrains tactics—no tool shortage, no spatial bottleneck, no environmental hazard that Thessaly must work around. The setting pressures mood (cold, refugees huddling) but not tactical choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>In the mirror world (timeframe) establishes the alternate-reality frame early and the "seven generations" duration anchors the scale of darkness. However, no scene-level clock tightens decisions; "the realm was dying faster than she could weave" declares urgency but no countdown or visible decay rate alters Thessaly's method or forces a rushed choice. The mirror-world frame enables the fantastical premise but remains static backdrop. Missing development and weak closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>To rekindle a dying realm (motivation) is present from the opening and drives Thessaly's gathering across beats; the "last luminescent tree began to dim" tightens urgency before the climax. Setup, development, and payoff gates met. However, the motivation is never conflicted—no moment where Thessaly weighs self-preservation against the realm's need, no friction between rekindling and the cost of dissolution. The desire is monolithic and told rather than tested through a micro-choice with visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Bound release (tone) is named in the text ("This was the bound release") and the paradox (duty holds together, duty frees into dissolution) shapes the final emotional arc. However, the tone is more declared than enacted—Thessaly's earlier fragmentation never feels like bondage; her dissolution reads as transcendence without the "bound" constraint visibly limiting her earlier. The tone modulates from cold/desperate to warm/hopeful but the bound-release paradox charges only the final beat rather than inflecting pressure throughout.</comment>
