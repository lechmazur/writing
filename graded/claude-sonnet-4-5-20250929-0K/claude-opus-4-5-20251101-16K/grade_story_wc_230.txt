<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and profession-specific ("reading soil, understanding the logic of fungal networks"), and her drive for psychological safety emerges from embodied pressure rather than abstraction. The glass eye experiment lands with visible cost—weeping "with something adjacent to gratitude"—and her final micro-choice to "pause first" forecloses the path of unfiltered truth-telling. Minor slip: the phrase "terrible transparency the virus had gifted humanity" tilts slightly toward thesis statement rather than lived perception, though it recovers quickly through embodied action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Maren accepts that she cannot lie but earns the fractional grace of choosing which truths to voice, a stance crystallized in "interiority was worth fighting for." The lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered reflection (virus context, glass eye provenance, night experiment) that converges in a single cadence shift ("That was not dishonesty. That was not evasion"). Cost is visible: she returns the eye, renouncing a false cure but keeping the lesson. The before/after is legible—she moves from craving occlusion to claiming pause as agency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The hanging orchard functions as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image: cables sing, apples fall, "some remained, clinging with the stubbornness of all living things that refuse comfortable endings" directly mirrors Maren's stance. Storm pressure is woven through action ("tonight, with storm winds screaming") rather than postcard description. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("roots dangling in perpetual mist," "fruit that survived grew dense and honest—bruised but sweet"). The glass eye as recurring object also qualifies under micro-setting rules, handled twice with reweighted meaning.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—psychological safety via occlusion—is signaled early and tightens through one meaningful deepening: the glass eye test yields not a veil but "the faintest hesitation…a pause," redefining her goal from evasion to selective voice. Agency is renunciation with visible cost: she returns the eye but keeps the practice. The tightening forecloses the path of seeking magical cures and opens the path of disciplined interiority. Under the Accumulative lens, the escalation reads as density increase culminating in a cadence shift ("That was not dishonesty") that reweights the dominant stake.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—interiority as shelter, transparency as wound—emerges through particulars: the glass eye's provenance, the woman who found salvation not in lying but in remembering interiority's worth, apples clinging post-storm. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing: "fractured grace of remaining human in a world that demanded transparency like a wound demands air." Subtext operates in silence and gesture (Maren's weeping, her choice to return the eye). The story resists tidy resolution; pause is not cure but worthy struggle, and the ending reweights the premise conceptually.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and profession-specific: "rational to her marrow," soil-reading idiom, technical precision ("rewiring neural pathways"). Psychic distance is controlled; reflection anchors in present stimuli (unwrapping the eye, testing speech). Diction remains within POV lexicon except one slip: "occlude" in "a way to occlude the terrible transparency" reads slightly elevated for internal thought, though it recovers through embodied testing. POV modesty holds—inference reads as inference. Rhythmic control under pressure is strong: sentence fragments and repetition ("True. Also true.") modulate naturally with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (setting + character + theme). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating during the eye test and breathing in reflective passages. Minor loop: "apples fell into the mist below, lost. But some remained, clinging" and the prior "fruit that survived grew dense and honest" nearly paraphrase the same thematic content without added pressure—apply −0.2. Stock metaphor "swallowing glass" is apt but familiar. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence; clarity and propulsion remain strong throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The premise—post-virus involuntary truth + antique occlusion prosthetic—offers a fresh angle on body horror and autonomy. The synthesis feels specific: forager-turned-orchardist, glass eye from 1890s occultism, ravine setting that mirrors psychological precarity. Transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on these exact particulars. The ending's insight—pause as agency rather than evasion—is earned and non-obvious, resisting the easy dystopian moral. Risk-taking in voice (extended reflection justified by solitary night vigil) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maren's rational training shapes key choices: she traces provenance "through three collapsed governments," demands evidence, tests the eye empirically. Her decision to return the eye rather than hoard it and her pivot to practicing pause both grow from her methodical nature. Present in setup, middle choice (testing), and closure (disciplined practice). Causal pressure is strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The glass eye appears in four beats: unwrapping, historical sketch, experimental use, return to hiding. Each use reweights meaning—from rumored cure to reminder of interiority's value. It constrains the climactic choice (does not restore the veil, only a pause) and charges the final image via the asylum woman's lesson. Specificity (milk-white veined with amber, painted iris) matters; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Smuggling network is established early ("smuggler's network that operated out of the storm shelters"), shapes Maren's tactics (six months' fruit, silence about tunnel sights), and the relic's black-market provenance underpins the story's post-collapse economy. The concept constrains her options—she cannot lie to acquire it, must trade tangible goods. Present in setup and development; closure hinges on the relic's failure to deliver occlusion, redefining the stake.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Involuntary truthfulness drives every beat: "she could not lie. None of them could," the virus mechanism (glass-swallowing sensation), her craving for "unspoken thought," the experimental test lines, and the final acceptance that pause—not lie—is the achievable grace. The trait constrains all tactics, generates the core conflict, and the closure reconfigures what "psychological safety" means under that constraint. Visible cost throughout.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Occlude" is the story's spine: Maren's search for occlusion, the eye's alleged function ("restore the veil between souls"), the night experiment that fails to occlude but offers pause, and the final understanding that occlusion is unattainable but selective voice is. The action redefines her goal and forecloses the magical-cure path. Major turn traces directly to this verb; swapping it would collapse thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The method—discredited 1890s texts, phrenology margins, occultist sketch—is signaled early and shapes Maren's rational quest ("she'd traced the eye's provenance"). The textual lineage matters: it signals quackery reappraised under desperation, and the method's failure (no veil restored) drives the closure insight. Present in setup and development; mechanics (woman in asylum, apology prosthetic) charge the ending's meaning.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The hanging orchard supplies resources (preserved fruit for trade), pressures choices (storm damage, harvest urgency), and charges the final image (apples clinging post-storm = Maren's endurance). Ravine storms recur in three beats: opening, night experiment backdrop, morning aftermath. Micro-setting (cables, mist, suspended roots) alters tactics and emotional texture. Strong reprise at closure elevates integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Post-virus timeframe establishes the world rule (involuntary truth), economy (relics as contraband), and Maren's profession shift (forager to orchardist). It shapes the dominant stake and tightens decision pressure (survival uncertainty, "I don't believe any of us will survive the year"). Present in setup and ending; the timeframe does not function as a live countdown but as backdrop condition that enables all conflict.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Psychological safety is dramatized early ("the simple grace of an unspoken thought"), tested in the eye experiment (seeking a veil), and redefined at closure (pause as shelter, not occlusion). The desire conflicts visibly with the virus constraint and the available means, generating friction and cost. Maren's final choice—practicing selective voice—directly addresses the motivation with a credible, costly compromise. Strong causal linkage across beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Fractured grace operates consistently: "bruised but sweet" apples, Maren's rational hope meeting quackery, "something adjacent to gratitude," the asylum woman's salvation-via-reminder. Tone modulates with pressure—methodical in provenance recounting, taut during the experiment, softening into the lyric final image. The phrase "fractured grace of remaining human" explicitly names and charges the closure, synthesizing tone into thematic statement without moralizing.</comment>
