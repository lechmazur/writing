<comment>Mira's interiority carries distinct texture through the doorknocker twist and scar-linking choice, and her shift from isolation to provisional teaching reads as earned endurance with visible cost. However, several beats rely on therapy-speak ("suffocating to breathe," "shadows as teacher") that abstracts crisis rather than embodying it, and the girl remains a stock seeker whose scars function as plot token rather than individuated motive. The final choice to stay among ashes while sending others forward demonstrates Earned Stasis, but the micro-choices leading there feel more thematic than conflicted—Mira's hierarchy of values is declared more than dramatized under pressure.</comment>

<comment>Orientation anchors quickly (charcoal sanctuary, Mira post-isolation, girl's arrival), and the piece coheres under an Accumulative/Textural lens through a density shift: the girl's arrival forces Mira to enact the teaching she fled, crystallizing her renunciation of full solitude with the cost visible in "burn this bridge carefully too." The closure qualifies as Charged Poise/Earned Stasis—Mira will remain while sending the healed forward, a recursion with felt cost. One friction: the "fading threshold" motif is invoked twice but never constrains a tactical choice on the page; it decorates rather than pressures, leaving the escalation slightly abstract in the middle third.</comment>

<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The charcoal sanctuary and ash-laden setting supply vivid, recurringanchors (blackened limbs, charred pews, motes under starlight) that frame tone and reflect Mira's isolation. The doorknocker ring is handled twice with reweighted meaning (closing the family door → "works both ways"), charging the final image of gentle watch. Minor gap: spatial choreography between Mira and the girl is vague—"sat beside her" on a pew, but the physical distance and body language remain generic, reducing the scene's tactile presence when embodied detail would heighten the suffocation-to-breath arc.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—whether Mira will reengage as teacher or preserve her sanctuary—is signaled early and tightens when the girl arrives, forcing a choice. The escalation is clean under the Accumulative lens: Mira's monologue and shared silence deepen the girl's crisis and Mira's stance, and the ending renunciation (staying while sending others) forecloses full isolation with visible cost. Weakness: the girl's arrival feels coincidental rather than causally motivated (how did seekers keep finding her if she burned bridges?), and no on-page reversal tests Mira's commitment—she decides to help almost immediately, flattening potential friction.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges cleanly from the scar-linking particulars and the doorknocker's dual function (closing/knocking), avoiding direct thesis statements until the final paragraph's "breath, stubborn and holy" risks soft moralizing but remains image-anchored. The recursion of bridge-burning with care versus solitude creates a non-obvious thematic question, and the ending offers a resonant answer: teaching requires presence with cost, not distance. One slip: "loaded emptiness" and "shadows as teacher" are invoked as concepts more than earned through scene pressure, leaning toward abstraction in places where concrete image would deepen resonance.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; Mira's perceptual signature (ash-mote focus, doorknocker twist, bridge-burning metaphor) is distinct and voice-motivated. Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit ("They shouldn't have said anything" / "I know" balances deflection and engagement), and the girl's fragmented speech contrasts Mira's measured cadence without caricature. Distance modulates purposefully from close interior ("She had learned") to a slightly elevated lyric register at closure ("stubborn and holy"), supporting the tonal shift. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy; the prose reads as character-filtered throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies (short crisis beats, longer reflective blocks), and information density is high in the scar exchange and doorknocker sequence. Clarity remains strong with no pronoun drift or time-line confusion. Two frictions lower the score: multiple beats lean on template stems ("The girl was [state]. Mira [verb]") without taught pattern, creating mild monotony, and several figurative phrases ("tender shadow keeper," "loaded emptiness," "threshold fading") repeat across paragraphs as thematic labels rather than evolving images, edging toward decorative rather than propulsive. No paraphrase loops or mixed metaphors; the craft is solid but not exceptional under pressure.</comment>

<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The scar-linking method and doorknocker-as-bridge metaphor offer modest freshness, and the recursion of teaching-by-remaining transforms the mentor-seeker trope into Earned Stasis rather than tidy rescue. However, the core frame—isolated healer in liminal sanctuary approached by desperate youth—follows a widely used template (hermit sage, burnt chapel refuge), and the emotional arc (suffocation → shared silence → tools for re-entry) proceeds predictably once the girl arrives. The piece commits fully to its premise and executes competently, but lacks a bold turn or synthesis that would feel inevitable in hindsight rather than familiar.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Mira's identity as "tender shadow keeper" frames her past role and present isolation, shaping the decision to help the girl and then renounce full solitude at closure. The attribute appears early, recurs in her monologue about darkness as teacher, and charges the final image of "shadows kept gentle watch." Friction: the phrase functions more as thematic label than on-page constraint—Mira's specific keeper methods (scar-linking, breath demonstration) do the causal work, while "shadow keeper" decorates. Two-gate presence (setup, payoff via thematic callback) with modest causal pressure lifts it to mid-band, but swappability with "healer of trauma" or similar role limits irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>The doorknocker ring appears in two distinct beats: catching starlight early (signaling the closed family door), then twisted at the turning point ("a door works both ways") to justify Mira's choice to engage. The reweighted meaning—closing versus knocking—directly supports the closure's Earned Stasis logic. Solid three-gate coverage (setup, middle choice enabler, payoff) with causal linkage. Deduction: the ring is described and thought about but not physically handled in a way that alters an immediate tactic (e.g., removing it, using it to gesture); it remains more symbolic anchor than tool under pressure, capping it slightly below high-integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>4.2</grade>
<comment>"Fading threshold" is invoked twice (Mira feels it thinning, then notes people kept crossing it) but never constrains a choice or alters tactics on the page. The concept decorates the isolation-versus-engagement theme but does not create escalation—Mira's decision to help the girl unfolds via scar recognition and monologue, not threshold mechanics. Two-gate presence (setup mention, thematic echo at closure) without middle development or causal pressure places it in functional-but-replaceable range; "boundaries weakening" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>"Burns bridges carefully" is demonstrated twice: the closed family door (backstory anchor) and the stated intention to send the girl away after one night, maintaining isolation with "intention rather than rage." The trait shapes Mira's stance and primes the Earned Stasis closure (she will keep burning bridges while still teaching). Friction: the attribute is told and explained more than tested—no on-page moment forces Mira to choose between careless severance and costly care under pressure. Two-gate presence (setup via backstory, payoff in closing stance) with thematic coherence but limited visible tradeoff caps it at mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>The girl "encroaches" by arriving from the tree line, triggering Mira's choice to engage rather than flee deeper into ash lands. This action initiates the main sequence and enables the closure. Weakness: the arrival is presented as fait accompli rather than a tactical beat—Mira "should have fled" but waits, with no on-page deliberation or near-miss that raises cost. The element is present and functional but easily swappable with "approaches," "interrupts," or "intrudes" without structural change. Two-gate presence (inciting event, closure enabler) with modest irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>"Linking through scars" is signaled early ("the only honest method she knew"), demonstrated in the beat where Mira shows her wrist-to-elbow line and the girl's eyes widen, and called back at closure as the means by which Mira will send the girl forward with tools. Three-gate coverage. Friction: the method is more metaphorical gesture than dramatized mechanics—we see the scar reveal, but not how the shared wound "links" or what cost or risk that incurs in the moment. The concept charges the theme but does not constrain Mira's attempt or complicate the girl's response, limiting causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The "ashen charcoal sanctuary under starlight" anchors every beat, supplies recurring micro-details (ash motes, charred pews, blackened limbs), and charges the final image ("shadows kept gentle watch"). The setting reflects Mira's isolation and frames the tonal shift from solitude to shared presence. Three-gate coverage with strong closure linkage. Minor gap: while the sanctuary provides atmosphere and symbolic resonance, it does not constrain a tactical choice (e.g., the pew's fragility, the ash underfoot)—it remains postcard-vivid rather than a resource or obstacle that alters Mira's or the girl's moves under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>3.6</grade>
<comment>"After cutting off all contact" establishes Mira's three-year isolation (backstory anchor: "closed behind her for the last time three years ago") and primes her reluctance when the girl arrives. The timeframe shapes the premise but does not tighten on-page decisions—no clock, no deadline, no escalating consequence of delay. Two-gate presence (setup via backstory, thematic consistency at closure) without middle pressure. The element is functional but replaceable; "years of solitude" or "self-imposed exile" would serve identically, and the lack of temporal escalation keeps it in low-mid range.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>Mira's past purpose "to teach suffocating to breathe" is stated early, drives her monologue to the girl ("let the shadows in… so we can breathe"), and motivates the closure choice to send the healed forward while staying behind. Three-gate coverage with thematic coherence. Friction: the motivation is told more than dramatized in conflict—Mira decides to help almost immediately with no on-page struggle between the desire to teach and the cost of engagement. The want-versus-cost tension is asserted ("People kept encroaching… I thought I needed walls") but not tested in a choice beat, reducing felt friction and capping causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>"Loaded emptiness" is invoked early ("not absence, but presence of a different kind"), recurs in sensory beats (ash motes suspended, silence thick, space between stars), modulates with the girl's arrival (her desperate grip loosening), and charges the final image ("sanctuary held them both… shadows kept gentle watch"). The tone coheres across turns, supports the Accumulative lens, and reweights at closure from oppressive void to generative holding. Three-gate coverage with strong closure linkage and rhythmic control. Minimal friction: one or two invocations edge toward label rather than embodied sensation, but the overall effect is purposeful and integrated.</comment>
