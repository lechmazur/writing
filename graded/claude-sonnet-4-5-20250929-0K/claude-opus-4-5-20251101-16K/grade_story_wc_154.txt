<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's interior landscape is consistently rendered through embodied perception—the coral fragment pressed to lips, the physical weight in her chest—and her decision to share the Solomons stories represents a genuine shift earned by discovering Lila's notes. The backstory is substantial (~25% of text) but anchored to present stimuli and tilts her stance toward transparency. Minor slip: Lila's "shrewdly innocent" trait is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory action. The final embrace and loosening knot deliver an earned emotional progression with visible cost (abandoning protective concealment).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through layered reflection anchored to concrete present objects (cast, coral, mist), building to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where Maya's stance crystallizes: she will share her trauma rather than hide it. The cost is legible—she forecloses the protective-mother path she'd believed necessary. Orientation is clean by paragraph two. One meaningful deepening occurs when reading the cast notes reweights the entire maternal concealment strategy. The forty-minute frame provides temporal constraint without becoming a live ticking clock.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium functions as micro-setting that mirrors internal fog and provides spatial containment for reflection; twilight deepening to dusk tracks emotional progression. The brain coral fragment is handled twice (opening, pre-ending) and charges the closure by linking memory to present choice. Sensory detail is purposeful—salt taste, glass ceiling, vapor between palms—and filtered through Maya's professional habit of decryption. The hospital garden setting doesn't constrain a choice but supplies symbolic texture that supports tone without becoming postcard.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear early: whether to continue hiding damage from Lila or risk transparency. The cast-notes discovery provides one meaningful tightening that narrows Maya's protective-concealment option by revealing Lila already carries the weight. Agency is decision (to tell the Solomons stories tonight) that forecloses the hide-and-protect path. The cost is visible: abandoning the "fake wholeness" stance she never felt. No antagonist required; the pressure is internal contradiction meeting external evidence. Escalation reads as deepening under the Accumulative lens rather than plot reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of inheritance and shared repair emerges through the coral/basket/weaving motif and the cast as artifact of "fierce and tender courage." The final image—shared anxieties transformed from burden to bridge—reweights prior material without stating a moral. Minor deduction: "graft new meaning onto old wounds" is articulated too cleanly in paragraph five, edging toward thesis statement. The lotus-hearted ache phrase in paragraph six borders on ornamental lyricism but ties to the Solomons setting enough to avoid full thematic echo penalty. Subtext operates in Lila's hidden notes and Maya's unspoken decision process.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited through Maya; psychic distance modulates purposefully from close (coral fragment details) to slightly elevated (reflective summary of fifteen years). Perceptual signature is consistent: decryption metaphor ("unknot the words"), professional filter (monsoon-damaged documents), sensory anchoring to touch and weight. The prose rhythm varies—longer reflective sentences compress to shorter beats at the ending. Dialogue is minimal (one line at close) but voice-appropriate. Diction remains within Maya's register; no head-hopping. Slight density in reflective blocks but each advances stance toward transparency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., coral fragment establishes character history, present action, and thematic anchor simultaneously). Rhythm varies with emotional beats. Minor template-cadence slip: "About the fear, yes, but also about... about... about" in the penultimate paragraph creates a list-like stack. The "lotus-hearted ache" phrase reads as slightly elevated for the moment's pressure but doesn't obscure causality. No major loops; the weaving/basket/coral motif recurs with purpose. Sentence openings vary; paragraph structure supports momentum. One paraphrase near-loop: "shared anxieties" concept appears in paragraphs four and nine with similar framing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cast-as-secret-diary turn offers a specific, non-obvious discovery mechanism. The conflict-zone translator premise is fairly well-worn but gains freshness through the decryption skill applied to parenting. The mist-clad atrium and brain coral fragment are vivid particulars. Deduction: the core emotional arc—parent hides trauma, child already knows, parent decides to share—follows a recognizable template without full transformation. The Solomons weaving metaphor is earned but not entirely surprising. The piece commits fully to its premise and executes with care; originality resides more in texture than structure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Maya's translator background is introduced early, supplies the decryption skill used at the key turn (unknotting Lila's notes), and shapes her decision to share war stories at closure. Present in setup, middle (skill application), and payoff (storytelling decision). The profession enables the central discovery and alters tactics from concealment to transparency. Causal pressure is moderate; the skill could theoretically be replaced by another interpretive profession, but the conflict-zone history is irreplaceable for thematic weight and the Solomons anchor.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Brain coral fragment appears in opening paragraph (tactile anchor), returns in paragraph six (pressed to lips with salt/time), and lives in her pocket at closure but isn't actively used there. Two distinct beats, early setup, thematic link to weaving/repair motif. It charges memory and provides sensory particularity but doesn't constrain a choice—Maya's decision pivots on the cast notes, not the coral. The fragment deepens setting and tone but remains more symbolic than causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Shared anxieties frame the dominant stake from paragraph four onward, shape Maya's protective concealment tactic, and are explicitly transformed at closure ("no longer a burden but a bridge"). The concept drives the plot: Lila's inherited panic caused the fall, Maya's concealment strategy fails when the cast reveals mutual awareness, and the ending reconfigures the sharing as healing rather than damage. Present in setup (the fall explained), middle (cast discovery), and payoff (Bridge image). Essential across beats; removing it collapses the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Shrewdly innocent" is applied to Lila in paragraph four but never dramatized through contradictory on-page behavior—Lila doesn't appear until the final paragraph, groggy and passive. The trait is label-only, ornamental. It doesn't constrain a choice or create visible cost. The cast notes show tenderness and understanding but not the specific tension between shrewdness and innocence. Present in setup as a claim, absent from middle action, not verified at closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Unknot" appears as the verb in paragraph five when Maya deciphers the smudged cast notes—the pivotal discovery that redefines her protective strategy. The action is signaled (she "began to unknot the words"), executed on the page with sensory detail (ink bleeding, tilting toward light), and directly triggers the emotional turn and decision to share stories. Present in middle and shapes payoff. Swapping it for generic "read" would lose the decryption-skill link and the tactile struggle that embodies effort. Strong integration but not quite indispensable—"decipher" could serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The method—decrypting smudged notes on the cast—is signaled in paragraph five with concrete mechanics (water-damaged comparison, ink bleeding, cramped handwriting), drives the key turn (discovery of Lila's awareness), and the cast with its messages is held at closure as "artifact of her daughter's fierce and tender courage." The decryption skill is seeded early via her translator background. Present in all three gates: setup (translator skill), middle (unknotting action), payoff (holding the artifact). The method is irreplaceable; without this exact mechanism the plot's causal chain breaks.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mist-clad atrium at twilight is introduced in the opening line, provides spatial containment and sensory texture (vapor, glass ceiling, ferns), and the mist thickens as twilight deepens to dusk, tracking emotional progression. Present in setup and briefly revisited at closure. It supplies mood and symbolic resonance (clarity emerging from fog) but doesn't constrain Maya's choice—she could decrypt the cast and decide to share stories in any setting. The setting enriches tone and grounds reflection but remains somewhat swappable; a hospital waiting room without mist would allow the same beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The forty-minute anesthetic window is announced in paragraph one, frames the waiting period, and provides temporal structure. However, the time isn't tracked or leveraged to tighten decisions—Maya's reflection unfolds without urgency, and the ending arrives when "somewhere beyond the glass walls, a nurse was wheeling Lila back" without on-page pressure from the countdown. Present in setup, vaguely referenced at closure, but not developed in the middle to alter tactics. Functional framing but replaceable; any waiting period would serve equally.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Graft new meaning onto old wounds" is explicitly articulated in paragraph six as Maya's belief, demonstrated through her weaving metaphor, and enacted at closure when she decides to share scars rather than hide them. The motivation shapes her final choice and is tested against Lila's counter-offer (daughter willing to carry part of the weight). Present in setup (implicit in her translator-to-community-work shift), middle (articulated and linked to Solomons memory), and payoff (enacted through storytelling decision). Slightly over-articulated in paragraph six, edging toward tell, but the desire drives the ending with visible cost (abandoning protective concealment).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Lotus-hearted ache" appears in paragraph six as a descriptor of the bittersweet recognition—"that particular pain that was also somehow sweetness." The tone of tender sorrow mixed with hope is consistent across the piece: the bruise-like twilight, the weight that never lifts, the fierce-and-tender courage, the knot loosening. The phrase itself is somewhat elevated/ornamental for the moment's pressure but the affect it names modulates appropriately—heavier in the backstory sections, lighter at the embrace. The tone charges the final image (shared anxieties as bridge, ache transformed) without becoming static.</comment>
