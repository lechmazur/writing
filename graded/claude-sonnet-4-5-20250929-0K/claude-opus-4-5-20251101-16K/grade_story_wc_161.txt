<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is specific and embodied—her throat tightening at Kaya's name, her watching dust motes as meditation—and the final choice to sing is earned by the on-page collision between her three-year silence and Marcus's direct confrontation. Internal conflict registers through contradictory impulses: she rehearsed escape yet stays; she silenced herself yet preserves songs. Minor deduction for the moment "trust was a muscle too"—the metaphor edges toward label-speak but recovers quickly with concrete actions (mapping, training, learning). The renunciation of hiding forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph (Elara, attic, post-reinvention present). The drive lens reads Situational: Marcus's arrival forces Elara to crystallize her stance between silence and voice. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—"Tell me about them" crystallizes her acceptance of being found and commits to future witness-work, reweighting her three-year isolation with felt cost (exposure, end of hiding). One meaningful tightening occurs when Marcus names her "Miriam" and she must decide. Minor penalty: the meteorite's symbolic weight (impossible distances finding their way) is stated rather than dramatized, and the final lines lean slightly toward thematic echo rather than pure image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The attic's skylight, dust motes, and pigeon coop anchor the setting and constrain Elara's ritual practice; the space is tactile and particular (old ink, feather dust). The meteorite's physical properties (cold, dense) charge the final beat. Spatial choreography is clean: Marcus at the door, Elara at the skylight, pigeons in their coop. The vintage bookshop below and forged grandmother backstory add occupational texture without slowing the scene. The setting coheres with her isolation and preservation work, though the dust-mote mapping as method borders on symbolic convenience—it's introduced early but its mechanics remain abstract.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Elara's choice between continued hiding and reclaiming her voice, signaled early and tested when Marcus names her. One meaningful tightening: the lullaby demand forces her to break three years of silence on the page. The cost is legible—she ends isolation, risks exposure—but escalation is somewhat passive; Marcus delivers the test rather than Elara's agency driving the turn. The meteorite's inheritance condition (sing correctly) provides external pressure, and her decision to engage ("Tell me about them") forecloses hiding. Band entry at 7.0+ justified by the trade-off and visible price, but protagonist agency in the middle beat is reactive rather than driving.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—preservation through voice versus erasure through silence—emerges organically from Elara's father's theft and her penance-keeping of stolen songs. The dust-mote ritual and pigeon training parallel her self-imposed isolation and the meteorite's "impossible distances" image. The ending offers a non-literal answer: speaking the lullaby and agreeing to remember others reweights her silence with meaningful cost. Minor deduction for the explicit "trust was a muscle too" line, which verges on stating theme, and the "blooming work of letting hers be found" metaphor in the final sentence, which leans toward summary. The lullaby itself—concrete, embodied, aching—anchors theme in action rather than assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited focalization remains stable throughout; POV is tightly bound to Elara's knowledge and perceptual signature (dust as music, songs as penance). Dialogue is sparse but functional: Marcus's lines pursue goals (identify her, deliver the meteorite condition), and Elara's responses carry subtext (deflection, then capitulation). Diction is elevated but consistent with an educated soprano's interior voice; "blooming and withering" language in the opening recurs purposefully at the end. One minor filter-verb cluster in the middle ("she remembered," "she recognized") slightly dulls immediacy. No head-hopping, clear psychic distance, and the narrative voice modulates effectively under pressure (short syntax when Marcus names her, longer when she sings).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies effectively: short when stakes spike ("That's not my name"), longer and lyrical during reflection. Information density is high—backstory on her father, Kaya, the reinvention, and pigeon work compresses without scaffold. Minor penalties: "blooming and withering" recurs as a motif but the final phrase "slow, blooming work of letting hers be found" edges toward overwriting; the "trust was a muscle" line is near-cliché; "sent her world into flames" is stock metaphor. One paraphrase loop: "teaching herself to balance… learning to balance" across two paragraphs. The skylight/dust-mote ritual description is vivid but slightly abstract ("patterns she'd learned to read like music"). No pronoun confusion, tense is stable, and the opening/closing bracket (dust motes/letting hers be found) charges the frame.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of courier pigeons, stolen indigenous songs, and a Mars meteorite as inheritance is fresh and non-obvious; each element grows from the premise rather than ornament. The dust-mote mapping ritual offers a specific, grounded inflection on meditation and watchfulness. Elara's choice to preserve songs through memory rather than performance is a compelling moral calculus. Minor deduction: the meteorite's symbolic function (impossible distances) is somewhat on-the-nose, and the "paper trails" concept appears more in backstory summary than as an active tactical constraint on the page. The risk of combining multiple high-concept elements (reinvented identity, pigeon trainer, ethnomusicology, meteorite) is managed through tight integration, though the dust-mote method reads slightly decorative. Transformation test passes—plot and arc depend on these exact details.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Courier pigeon training is present throughout (seventeen pigeons, love letters, secrets via birds) and frames Elara's isolation work, but her choices in this scene do not turn on pigeon-training skills. The pigeons react to her singing (settle, listen) and one launches at the end as a symbolic parallel, but they do not constrain or enable the core decision. The role signals her controlled, mediated communication and her self-imposed distance, but the climactic choice—to sing—could occur without this occupation. Two beats: setup (attic coop described), closure reprise (pigeon launches). Not swappable (the role fits her isolation), but not causal to the turn. Mid-band for presence and thematic fit without driving the choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mars meteorite chip is introduced early (Marcus withdraws it), its physical properties described (cold, dense, rust-red), and it is the pivot for the lullaby test. Kaya's belief—"impossible distances can find their way to us"—is stated, and Marcus places it in Elara's palm after she sings. Three beats: introduction, test condition, transfer. It is the object that forces the choice and rewards the voice; removing it would break the scene's logic. The symbolic function is slightly over-explained in Marcus's dialogue, but the object's necessity and causal role are clear. High integration, essential to closure, but the thematic statement about it lowers irreplaceability slightly—another heirloom could work with minor rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Paper trails appear in backstory exposition ("forged documents," "paper trails that led nowhere") and Marcus mentions "impressive work" on them, but they do not constrain or enable on-page action. Elara does not use document skills in this scene, nor do the trails shape her tactics or the closure choice. The concept frames her past reinvention but remains summary-only. One beat: Marcus's acknowledgment. Functional background element without causal pressure. Swappable with "false identity" or similar. Mid-low band for presence without development or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Reinventing personal history is the premise: Elara became someone else, erased Miriam Voss, invented a grandmother. This constrains her present—she has hidden for three years—and Marcus's naming "Miriam" forces the choice to reclaim or continue hiding. Two beats: backstory setup, Marcus's confrontation. The trait enables her isolation and makes the closure choice costly (exposure). Not swappable; the reinvention is the reason she can be "found." Cost is visible (end of hiding). Solid integration, but much of the work is in backstory rather than on-page tactics. Mid-band for constraint and closure linkage without further beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Balance appears in the dust-mote ritual description ("teaching herself to balance between watching and being watched, between stillness and flight") and in the ending metaphor ("blooming and withering"). The concept frames her internal state but does not drive a specific choice or action on the page. The balance metaphor is thematic—stillness vs. flight, silence vs. voice—but the action that matters is singing, not an act of balancing. Two beats: ritual description, final image echo. Lyric resonance between early and late, but the action itself is "sing" rather than "balance." Mid-band for thematic presence and reprise without causal mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Mapping dust motes under the skylight is described early as Elara's daily ritual and meditation, teaching her to read patterns "like music." It appears again when she watches motes before singing, but the method does not enable or constrain the singing; she does not use dust-reading to decide. The method is ornamental—atmospheric and thematically apt (patterns, music, light/shadow) but not mechanically active. Two beats: description, reprise before singing. Swappable with another contemplative practice. Functional presence without causal work. Low-mid band for setup and reprise without pressure or cost linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vintage bookshop attic is the sole location, housing the pigeons, skylight, and dust-mote ritual space. It anchors Elara's isolation, provides the skylight for her method, and is the stage for the confrontation. The attic is the reason Marcus had to find her ("you're hard to find") and its containment—she planned escape routes but staying means "abandoning the pigeons, the attic, the fragile peace"—pressures her choice. Three beats: setup, middle choreography, closure context (staying vs. fleeing). The space constrains her decision and provides the resources (pigeons, skylight, seclusion) that define her life. Essential to closure; removing it would require full rewrite. High integration, causal role, closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Timeframe "across learning to trust again" is the story's arc: Elara spent three years learning not to trust, and the scene dramatizes the first step toward trust (agreeing to work with Marcus). The three-year silence is mentioned early, and the ending choice—"Tell me about them"—crystallizes her shift. The time constraint (three years of hiding ending now) shapes the stakes. Two beats: backstory anchor, closure shift. The arc is present and coherent, but time does not tighten decisions within the scene—no clock pressure or deadline. The timeframe is structural (before/after trust) rather than tactical. Mid-band for arc coherence and closure linkage without immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Preserving lost songs is Elara's stated penance and the reason she kept Kaya's lullaby in memory. This desire is dramatized when Marcus asks her to sing—she must choose between continued silence (preservation without voice) and active witness (singing the songs). The motivation drives the climactic choice and is tested with visible cost (exposure, breaking silence). Three beats: backstory motivation, the lullaby test, agreement to continue witness-work. Friction between preservation (silence) and preservation (voice) is clear and conflicted. Essential to closure; the choice depends on this exact motive. High integration, causal pressure, closure participation, cost connection. Strong.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Blooming/withering imagery appears early ("blooming in the light, withering into shadow, blooming again") tied to the dust-mote cycle and recurs in the ending ("slow, blooming work of letting hers be found"). Tone modulates from constrained isolation (attic, silence, watching) to tentative opening (singing, agreeing to remember). The imagery charges the final line and reweights the cycle metaphor—withering (hiding) gives way to blooming (witness). Two beats: early pattern, closure reprise. The tone coheres and the image shapes the final emotional charge, though the final phrase leans slightly toward over-writing. Strong integration, closure linkage, purposeful modulation. High-mid band for coherence and charge with minor stylistic excess.</comment>
