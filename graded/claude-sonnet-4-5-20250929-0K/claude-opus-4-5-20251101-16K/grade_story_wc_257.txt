<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera's interior life is rendered through concrete objects (ashes, hair, glass spheres) and the stencil functions as an embodied anchor for grief. However, Marcus remains largely a vessel for receiving wisdom rather than a character with contradictory impulses; his grief is described ("curtains of intention") but not dramatized through competing wants. The piece leans heavily on reflective summary ("These curtains, Vera knew, were the hardest to part") rather than showing Vera making micro-choices under present pressure. The final exchange with Marcus feels more like delivered insight than earned struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens through the observatory framing and mourning-jewelry craft, holding it to closure. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first two paragraphs. The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—Vera's work continues, grief transforms—but the cost remains abstract; we don't see a specific choice or renunciation that forecloses a path on the page. The Marcus encounter functions more as illustrative repetition than a turn that narrows Vera's options or changes her knowledge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The observatory is vividly particular: "constellations that belonged to no earthly sky," the telescope that manifests grief-specific stars, the workbench with mourning jewelry materials. The stencil—"flower blooming from a skull's eye socket"—charges multiple beats and the final image. The "timeless" quality constrains the narrative (years/no-time paradox) and the objects (ashes, hair, vellum) are handled tactilely. Spatial choreography between Vera's bench and the observation chamber remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming grief into containers that allow forward motion—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, the piece offers no meaningful tightening or trade-off; Vera's work with Marcus proceeds without complication, and his acceptance of the pendant doesn't foreclose any live option or cost her anything visible. The telescope vision functions as demonstration rather than test. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen or a pattern should break; here the repetition of Vera's established practice flattens rather than escalates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the flower-from-skull stencil, the craft of mourning jewelry, and the contrast between "formless grief" and contained transformation. The line "I teach withering to bloom again" risks on-the-nose declaration, but it's tied to concrete action (the pendant, the telescope) and the daughter's stencil anchors it in prior loss. The final image—"grief needed somewhere to live / But it also needed permission to change"—functions as subtle reweighting rather than sermon. The piece resists tidy resolution; Marcus's futures remain unnamed possibilities rather than guaranteed redemption.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and controlled, with a distinct perceptual signature: Vera notices textures (ashes, vellum, glass), her grandmother's vocabulary, the observatory's paradoxes. Dialogue with Marcus is sparse and purposeful, carrying subtext in the exchange about whether the pendant will help. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance shifts intentionally between Vera's workbench focus and the observatory's wider frame. One slip: "These curtains, Vera knew, were the hardest to part" tells rather than shows through her action or perception, breaking the established filter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with strong specificity in craft detail (silver photographs, breath in glass, vellum stencil). However, several lines loop: "Grief needed somewhere to live" appears twice with only minor variation, and "Years later—or perhaps no time at all; the observatory defied such measurements" restates the timeless quality already established. The phrase "woman-shaped wound" and "subdued ardor" feel slightly elevated for the otherwise grounded register. The Marcus section includes filter-verb stacking ("His grief hung," "Vera knew," "She thought") that dulls immediacy in a key beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The mourning-jewelry premise combined with the timeless observatory offers a fresh angle on grief fiction, and the origami-crane recruitment method is specific. However, the core emotional arc—mentor guides grieving visitor toward acceptance—follows a familiar template, and the Marcus encounter doesn't transform the established pattern. The stencil (flower from skull) is well-integrated but the symbolic pairing is conventional. The piece commits fully to its premise without retreat, but the visit structure and Vera's unchanging role limit ingenuity.</comment>
