<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vela's interiority is concrete and purposeful—"shadow-laced peacekeeper," her method of not chasing visions—but her emotional range remains narrow throughout. The final choice (preparing for the next visitor) feels like a return to stasis rather than a path foreclosed with visible cost. Sera's arc is more dynamic (grief to purpose), but she exists primarily to receive exposition. The "calmly intuitive" trait is claimed more than dramatized under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (lighthouse, orchard, ice floes, Vela's role). The piece operates under an Accumulative lens: Vela receives fragment → performs ritual → delivers message → Sera departs with purpose. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Vela returns to her mirrors, waiting—but the cost feels ambient rather than sharp. The line "This was what it meant to reconstitute" states theme rather than charging the final image with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard above ice floes is vivid and specific; apples "defiant and sweet" in the cold. The seventeen mirrors are established early and used in the ritual. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—it provides atmosphere and a work surface. The final image of ice groaning and apples releasing fragrance adds sensory texture but does not participate in the closure's reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake is established (reconstitute the mother's final message), and one meaningful deepening occurs when Sera learns her father is alive. However, Vela faces no opposition or dilemma; the ritual succeeds without friction. Sera's question "How could she?" offers a micro-turn, but it resolves immediately via Vela's explanation. No visible cost forecloses a path; Vela simply continues her work unchanged.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: "to reconstitute: not to undo the past, but to recover its hidden meanings." The final image of Vela waiting, "shadows embraced her, familiar as breath," offers quiet resonance. Yet the piece edges toward stating its thesis ("This was what it meant," "This was the weight she carried") rather than letting the ending image reweight prior material without summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Vela; psychic distance is controlled. Prose has texture—"constellation, points of light connected by invisible threads"—and the narration filters through Vela's professional lens. Sera's brief dialogue ("How could she? After what he did?") feels natural. A few filter-verb clusters ("Vela felt the question building," "Vela watched Sera leave, watched her walk") slightly dull immediacy in the final third.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; information density is high in the ritual sequence. Minor template cadence in the final paragraphs: "This was what it meant... This was the weight... Someone was always coming" creates a declarative drumbeat. The phrase "shadow-laced peacekeeper" and "shadows that laced through Vela's skin" repeat the same metaphor without evolution. No paraphrase loops or clarity breaks, but some lines lean toward telling peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard above ice and the role of memory-reconstituter offer fresh synthesis. Yet the emotional arc follows a familiar template: enigmatic specialist performs ritual, delivers wisdom, client departs transformed, specialist remains unchanged. The piece does not transform the "magical consultant" trope through risk or a non-obvious moral calculus. Specificity in world-building elevates but does not fully overcome the derivative structure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Vela is present throughout and performs the reconstitution, but her choices do not create turns—she executes her method without friction or dilemma. Setup and development gates are met; closure participation is passive (she returns to waiting). Mid-band for presence across beats without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The crystal fragment is handled in the opening, placed before the mirror for the ritual, and returned to Sera. Three beats; early setup; closure linkage via Sera taking it back. However, its unique properties (broken, dead woman's letter) do not constrain the ritual or alter tactics. Causal work is thin; it functions as a vessel more than a driver.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The phrase "courageous anomaly" appears once as a label ("this was her calling, the courageous anomaly she had become"). It does not shape stakes or tactics on the page; Vela faces no opposition or moral calculus that tests courage. The concept remains thematic decoration rather than a driver of choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Calmly intuitive" is claimed early ("Vela remained calmly intuitive, letting the images wash through her") but not tested under pressure. No moment where intuition fails, competes with urgency, or incurs a cost. The trait describes her method but does not constrain or enable a contested choice. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Reconstitute" is established in the opening, executed in the middle ritual, and named again at closure ("This was what it meant to reconstitute"). The action drives the plot and defines Vela's role. Removing it breaks the story's logic. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff with thematic reprise.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The mirrors are signaled early (paragraph 4), used in the ritual ("placed the crystal fragment before the largest mirror"), and the visions ("glimpses came slowly") arrive through them. Mechanics are legible; the mirrors enable the reconstitution. However, the mirrors could be replaced with another scrying tool without altering tactics. Solid development and closure presence; moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard is described vividly in the opening and returns in the final image ("ice floes groaned... apple trees released their fragrance"). Setup and payoff gates met via lyric reprise. However, it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. The setting frames atmosphere but does not pressure tactics. Mid-band for resonant reprise without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The phrase "weighted breath before reply" appears once when Sera nearly asks if the ritual is working. The timeframe does not tighten decisions; the ritual proceeds without urgency or a live clock. Ornamental mention without causal pressure or closure linkage. Below-functional.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Map empathy onto action" is stated early as Vela's calling and demonstrated when she reads the mother's perspective and delivers it to Sera. The motivation drives her role and the plot's throughline. However, it is not conflicted or tested—Vela succeeds without friction. Setup, development, and thematic payoff present; lacks visible cost or dilemma.</comment>
