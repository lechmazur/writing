<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Miriam's motivation is clear and her interior contradictions are well-embodied—the "fierce meditation" practice and her grief are shown through concrete action rather than label. The grandmother's spectral presence feels earned through the monument-carving lineage. Minor slips: the breakthrough moment ("They mourn as one") tips toward epiphany-speak, and the final dialogue exchange risks didacticism, but the cost of her grandmother's absence is palpable throughout and the closure choice (spiral design) is motivated by prior particulars.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through the greenhouse visits, spectral guidance, and poem-memory strand, culminating in a conceptual repricing when Miriam synthesizes collective grief into the spiral design. The closure lands on the page with felt cost—her grandmother's departure is conditional, and the realization reweights all prior material. One transition (week four) is clean and the pattern holds through the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The greenhouse at dusk is not mere backdrop: the monarchs' migration rhythm structures Miriam's visits, the cracked glass and ferns ground her grief practice, and the ten thousand wings at peak migration directly enable her breakthrough ("They mourn as one"). The woven ribbon becomes a tactile anchor for measurement and sketch. The setting constrains choice (she comes at dusk, sits among particulars) and charges the final image when darkness and wings hold her in place.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: how to carve collective grief after the factory fire. Pressure tightens in week four when the grandmother's voice instructs "retrace," forcing Miriam to study old monuments and shift tactics. The monarchs' accumulation across weeks parallels her search and the spiral-design choice narrows options with visible cost (visitors must walk the full path). Agency is decision and the cost is palpable, though the turn could impose sharper friction—Miriam's realization arrives smoothly without a failed attempt to test her earlier approach.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: monarchs carry maps in blood, gravestone carvers speak to the dead through stone, poems pass across tables like bread. The spiral memorial design offers a resonant, non-literal answer to collective grief without stating a moral. The final image—"carrying their dead forward in the only way the dead could travel—through the bodies of those who remembered how to fly"—reweights inheritance and flight as enacted practice rather than abstraction. No thematic echo or sermon intrudes at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Miriam notices weathered benches, letter spacing, grief-sharp edges. The grandmother's voice arrives "not as sound but as weight against her chest"—an embodied, character-specific filter. Dialogue is sparse and purposeful; the grandmother's instructions ("Retrace") carry subtext and Miriam's question ("Will you keep coming?") pursues relationship stakes. One brief filter stack ("remembered," "understood") in the poem-memory paragraph slightly dulls immediacy, preventing a higher score.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high: most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or conflict. Strong images include "orange wings catching October light like stained glass" and "thundering calm of understanding." Minor artifacts: "the dead forward in the only way the dead could travel" loops conceptually in the final line, and "monumentality as conversations" risks abstract summary. Template cadence appears briefly in the middle ("She pulled... studied... visited") but does not obscure causality. No loops touch the closure beat directly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The combination of gravestone carving, spectral mentorship, and monarch migration is specific and purposeful. The spiral memorial design synthesizes these elements in a non-obvious way that grows from prior particulars. However, the premise of a skilled artisan receiving spectral guidance to solve a creative problem follows a familiar template (mentor ghost + craft crisis), and the monarchs-as-metaphor for collective memory risks symbolic convenience. Transformation is present but not radical; the emotional truth and carved-stone lineage elevate the execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Miriam's role as gravestone carver is established early, shapes her retracing tactic (she studies old monuments), and drives the spiral design choice at closure. Her decisions alter tactics twice: accepting the commission and synthesizing the pattern. The craft detail is specific and the final design grows from her occupation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The woven ribbon appears in two beats: Miriam traces it during the first visitation (week four) and unrolls it to sketch by dying light at closure. Its function (measuring letter spacing) is specific and it enables the final design. However, the ribbon does not constrain an earlier choice or accumulate pressure across beats; it serves as a tool at the end rather than shaping middle conflict.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Spectral mentorship is signaled early (week four visitation), structures the middle (grandmother instructs "retrace"), and shapes closure stakes ("Will you keep coming?"). The concept alters options: without the grandmother's voice, Miriam would not study old monuments or synthesize the spiral pattern. The mentor's conditional departure imposes visible cost and the teaching-through-presence mechanic is indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Fiercely meditative" is introduced early and grounds Miriam's greenhouse practice ("the hard holding-on, the deliberate examination of each grief-sharp edge"). It shapes her retracing tactic and the final scene shows her "fiercely meditative, holding her grief... with equal tenderness." However, the trait does not constrain a choice with visible cost; it describes her method rather than imposing friction or forcing a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Retrace" is the grandmother's instruction at the first visitation and drives the entire middle sequence: Miriam pulls old commissions, studies monuments for mining disasters and epidemics, and returns to the greenhouse. The action redefines her options and enables the breakthrough. Without retracing, the spiral design and collective-grief insight would not occur. The word itself is weighted and returned to in the ending (visitors "retrace the path").</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The family custom of trading poems is seeded early (dinner practice with grandmother) and returns at the peak moment when Miriam remembers the monarch poem her grandmother sent. The memory triggers the breakthrough ("They mourn as one"). However, the custom is not dramatized on the page—no poem is quoted or traded in scene—and it does not shape an earlier attempt. It functions as backstory that primes closure rather than mechanics that alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ancient greenhouse at dusk is established in the opening line and structures every visit. The cracked glass, overgrown ferns, weathered benches, and ten thousand wings at peak migration directly enable Miriam's breakthrough ("watching the butterflies pulse together"). The setting imposes rhythm (dusk visits for three weeks), supplies the resource (monarchs), and charges the final image ("darkness and wings"). Removing this exact setting would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The butterfly migration timeframe is signaled early (monarchs arrive "the same week" as the grandmother's death) and tracked across weeks (three weeks of visits, week four visitation, peak migration). The timeframe tightens decisions: Miriam must solve the memorial design before the monarchs leave, and the peak-migration moment delivers maximum pressure for her realization. The ending acknowledges urgency ("The monarchs would leave soon") and the cycle structures the closure stakes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Miriam's motivation to discover "the shape of collective grief" is dramatized through her commission acceptance, her inability to begin, and her active search (studying old monuments, visiting the greenhouse). The desire faces friction: "Individual loss she understood... But collective grief was a different architecture, and she could not find its blueprints." The cost is her disorientation and the grandmother's conditional presence. The motivation drives every choice and the spiral design resolves it on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Thundering calm" is introduced at the breakthrough moment ("The thundering calm of understanding descended. Not loud, but enormous") and grounds the ending's tone: Miriam stays in darkness, fiercely meditative, with "equal tenderness." The oxymoron coheres with the piece's restraint under pressure—grief held without collapse. However, the phrase appears only once at the peak and the modulation across earlier scenes is subtle; the tone supports closure but does not charge every beat.</comment>
