<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's ghost-state interiority is consistently particular ("driftingly alert," perception spreading "like watercolor"), and her motivation to encode messages is clear. The piece does not earn a meaningful change—Mira remains in the same state at the end, waiting to add another phrase—so Earned Stasis would need to show visible cost, which is absent; she simply continues her pattern. The young caretaker's unspoken needs are told rather than dramatized, and we see no on-page micro-choice from either character under pressure. Internal contradiction and embodied emotion are present but not tested by a pivotal decision.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (pattern of encoded songs across decades, final spiral message). Orientation anchors who and where by the opening lines; when is more elusive but acceptable given the ghost frame. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the new spiral waits to be discovered, crystallizing Mira's patient intention and the caretaker's potential recognition. However, the cost is implied rather than felt on the page—no visible forfeiture or pressure that narrows options in the ending image. Under accumulative logic, one meaningful deepening occurs (the new message), but it does not reweight prior material with undeniable force.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The misty courtyard above clouds is vivid and purposefully atmospheric; the flower-press bolt plate is handled concretely and returned to in the final beat, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clear (eastern wall, fountain, hidden alcove). The environment constrains Mira's method (stone surfaces, moisture stains that disguise her marks) and the setting's vapor-and-stone textures are filtered through her ghost-state perception, meeting the 9+ gate requirement of setting constraining choice or charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Mira's need to articulate unspoken truths and reach the caretaker. One tightening occurs when Mira encodes the new message, but this is a repetition of her established pattern rather than a turn that narrows live options or raises cost. The caretaker's arrival provides context but not on-page pressure; Mira faces no dilemma or obstacle that tests her commitment. Agency is present (she chooses to encode) but the act does not foreclose a path or alter tactics, limiting escalation under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: voice constrained by context, indirect expression finding alternate pathways, the patient accumulation of meaning. The final image (bolt plate, mist, waiting) offers a non-literal answer to "How do silenced voices persist?" without stating a moral. "You are heard. Your silence is not your cage. Let your voice leak sideways if it will not march straight" is an explicit thematic statement embedded in Mira's message, verging on moralizing, but it reads as in-world text rather than authorial intrusion and is offset by the concrete encoding action that dramatizes the theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is lyric, consistent, and textured: "driftingly alert," "clicking and settling into patterns," "dreams finding their shape." POV is stable third-person-limited ghost consciousness; perceptual signature (awareness kindling between lightning and thunder, spreading like watercolor) is distinct and voice-motivated. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close interiority, then wider atmospheric sweeps). No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. Diction occasionally elevates ("articulate the aching things," "consensus reality" overtones in "the desperate need") but remains within the lyric register established early.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but largely coherent ("prayer beads clicking," "slow gray whales," "watercolor across wet stone"). Some paraphrase loops appear: the opening establishes Mira as ghost, then restates "She was the ghost in code now" two paragraphs later; "driftingly alert" recurs identically. Filter verbs ("had been," "had valued," "had learned") stack in the backstory passage but are voice-motivated for the elegiac tone. Information density is high; no obvious scaffolding. Minor redundancy and elevated diction in peak beats (final paragraph) slightly dull propulsion but do not obscure the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of ghost-as-code, graffiti-as-message, and the floating monastery courtyard is specific and non-obvious. The bolt-plate encoding method and "songs scratched into stone" transform the familiar silent-artist trope through tactile, lived-in detail. Emotional specificity (throat-caught ballads, silence as cage then as medium) avoids generic templates. Risk-taking in the lyric, reflection-heavy mode heightens thematic resonance without obscuring clarity, though the piece does not take structural or perspectival risks that would push higher.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira the seldom-heard balladeer is named and her past humming/singing establishes the character early. Her decision to encode the new spiral message is the key turn, altering tactics (choosing this message now for this caretaker). She is present in the setup, drives the middle encoding action, and shapes the closure image (waiting, bolt plate in alcove). Causal pressure is moderate—she chooses to act but faces no on-page obstacle or cost that would elevate the score into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The flower-press bolt plate is introduced early (paragraph 4), used to scratch songs into stone (middle), and returned to in the final paragraph where it "rested in its hidden alcove, worn smooth by a thousand encoded truths," charging the closure image. It enables Mira's encoding method and its worn surface embodies the accumulated effort. However, it does not constrain a choice or impose a visible cost in the ending beat—it simply waits, affirming continuity rather than reweighting prior material decisively.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Ghost in code" is stated explicitly ("She was the ghost in code now") and the concept shapes Mira's form of existence and her encoding method (pattern woven into walls, existing in gaps between signal and noise). It frames the setup, drives her middle encoding action, and is restated at closure ("the pattern of her intention woven into the very walls"). The concept alters her options (she cannot speak, so she encodes) but does not impose a visible cost or narrow tactics under pressure in the ending beat, keeping it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Driftingly alert" appears twice as a label (opening and closing paragraphs) but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. It colors Mira's perceptual mode (spreading awareness, patient waiting) but remains descriptive rather than causal. No tradeoff is dramatized—her alertness does not prevent or enable a choice that another state would reverse. Present and thematically apt, but the trait does not drive a beat or participate in closure beyond mood.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Encoding is Mira's primary action throughout: she encodes songs over forty years, she encodes the new spiral tonight, and the final image rests on "a thousand encoded truths." The major turn (creating the message for the caretaker) traces directly to this action. However, the encoding is habitual rather than a one-time decisive act that redefines options; it continues her established pattern. The action is essential but does not foreclose a path or impose a new cost at closure, limiting the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Messages encoded in graffiti art (spirals, symbols that look like moisture stains) are signaled early and their mechanics matter: Mira uses the bolt plate to scratch, the marks disguise as weathering, the code is read rather than heard. The method shapes her encoding attempts throughout and is present in the closure image (new spiral near fountain, "language older than sound"). The method is purposeful and irreplaceable but does not constrain a choice under pressure in the ending beat, keeping it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The misty courtyard above clouds is established immediately and returns in the closure image ("mist curled through the courtyard like dreams finding their shape"). The setting constrains Mira's method (stone walls absorb her marks, moisture disguises them), supplies the fountain where the caretaker pauses, and the vapor-on-stone textures charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (eastern wall, fountain, alcove). The courtyard is indispensable to the encoding logic and the ending's atmospheric resonance, meeting high integration thresholds.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "between lightning and thunder" is invoked lyrically in the opening ("Mira woke in the spaces between lightning and thunder") and closing ("somewhere below the clouds, thunder finished its conversation with the light"). It colors Mira's awareness but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics—no live clock pressures her choices, and the timeframe functions as metaphor rather than constraint. Present in setup and closure for thematic resonance, but does not drive a beat or impose cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation to articulate unspoken needs is stated explicitly ("the desperate need to articulate the aching things inside") and dramatized through Mira's encoding acts. It drives her forty-year pattern and her choice to create the new message for the caretaker. Friction appears (songs catch in her throat, she must encode sideways), and the cost of silence is felt. However, the ending does not test this motivation under new pressure or force a tradeoff; Mira continues her pattern, so the motivation shapes beats but does not crystallize at closure with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Tone reads as lyric wonder with elegiac patience: "watercolor across wet stone," "slow gray whales," "dreams finding their shape," "the patient accumulation of meaning." The tone is coherent through turns and modulates subtly (opening kindling, middle encoding, closing waiting-and-dreaming). It charges the final image (mist, bolt plate, held breath) and supports the theme of patient, indirect expression. The tone is consistent and purposeful but does not shift dramatically under pressure, remaining steady rather than escalating, which limits the score in the higher bands.</comment>
