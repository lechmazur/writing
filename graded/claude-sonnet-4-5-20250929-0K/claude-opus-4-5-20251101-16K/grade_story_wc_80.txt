<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and character-particular through the inkwell inheritance and her surveyor's dual practice. The "stoically sensitive" attribute is explicitly named rather than shown through contradictory impulses in scene, weakening embodiment. Her motivation to document what official records miss is consistent, but the final choice to seal notes feels inevitable rather than costing her something on the page—no visible path is foreclosed. Internal contradiction exists (professional vs. private work) but operates sequentially rather than simultaneously under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece gathers density through artifact discovery (marble, button) and note-placement, culminating in a pattern of witness that reweights the pavilion's meaning. Orientation anchors (Maren, flooded pavilion, post-drawbridge twilight) land cleanly in the opening. Closure operates as Resonant Reconfiguration—the final vigil stance crystallizes her devotion with felt cost (the world "already ended but refused...to be entirely gone"), though the cost remains atmospheric rather than a specific forfeiture. One meaningful deepening occurs when she finds the button and the stories "branched infinitely," accepting uncertainty as the nature of witness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The submerged pavilion pressures Maren's choices: rising water (new waterline noted) creates urgency, foundation patches provide hiding places for notes, and the marble columns anchor her spatial movement. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—brackish water, amber light, silt—filtered through her surveyor's eye. The inkwell functions as micro-setting, constraining her documentation method and charging the final image through its cartographer inheritance. The flood's incremental encroachment (one centimeter rise) subtly mirrors the interlaced absence theme without becoming overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: documenting what will be lost before the pavilion is fully claimed. One meaningful tightening occurs when Maren notes the water has risen another centimeter, confirming the structure will soon be "fully claimed" and thus narrowing her window. Agency manifests as endurance—continuing the vigil despite futility—but no live option is visibly foreclosed on the page; she will return tomorrow to official duties with no dramatized cost. The escalation under the Accumulative lens shows deepening through artifact accumulation (marble, button) and thematic weight, meeting the lens requirement, though the stakes remain consistent rather than raised.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme of "interlaced absence" emerges organically from the pavilion's layered losses (music, laughter, couples, children) without meta-commentary. The final image—standing vigil "for a world that had already ended but refused...to be entirely gone"—offers a resonant answer to the central question of how to honor disappearing worlds. Subtext operates cleanly in the notes hidden in foundation repairs, the grandmother's inkwell as inheritance of map-making, and the tension between official/private archaeology. Minor slip: "stoically sensitive" is explicitly named rather than earned through scene particulars, and "wrest meaning from dissolution" edges toward abstract philosophizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited with consistent access to Maren's perceptions and no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is character-specific: she notices waterlines, structural assessments, and archival photographs through her dual surveyor/archivist lens. Diction remains controlled and purposeful ("interlaced absence," "hushed blaze") with vocabulary appropriate to her educated, reflective register. Minor slip: "stoically sensitive—her father had called her that once, not understanding it was a compliment" shifts briefly into explanatory mode rather than trusting dramatization, and the phrase reads slightly imposed rather than emerging from her voice under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or thematic pressure. Rhythm varies purposefully with paragraph lengths creating visual cadence. Two minor artifacts: "Each absence threaded through the others, creating a fabric of what was no longer" edges toward abstract metaphor that slightly blurs the concrete, and "someone had to document what the official records would never capture" tells the mission rather than showing it through her note-taking action already on the page. Sentence openings vary effectively, and no loops or template cadence appear. The closure beat ("stood among the columns like someone keeping vigil") lands cleanly without overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—surveyor secretly archiving emotional history of flooded structures—offers a fresh angle on climate-loss material through the dual official/private archaeology frame. Emotional specificity in the artifact descriptions (marble with white spiral, brass military button) avoids generic templates. The combination of elements (inkwell inheritance, foundation repair hiding spots, post-drawbridge ritual) feels organic rather than checklist-driven. Minor limitation: the frame of witness-as-devotion in the face of inevitable loss, while executed cleanly, follows a recognizable template of elegiac preservation without a sharp turn or non-obvious moral calculus that would elevate it further.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Present throughout; her surveyor role enables access and repair-ordering that creates note-hiding opportunities. Her choices to wade in, document artifacts, and seal notes are on-page actions, but they express a pre-existing devotion rather than altering tactics or creating a turn—she will continue tomorrow unchanged. Setup clear, middle beat involvement (artifact discovery and note-writing), closure participation (vigil stance). Functional across beats but decisions reinforce rather than redirect.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Appears in three beats: introduced with grandmother's cartographer inheritance, used to write notes mid-story, capped at the end ("Maren capped the inkwell"). The inheritance detail charges its meaning (map-making lineage), and the final capping reinforces the completion of this session's work. Setup early, middle use, closure reprise present. The inkwell enables her method but could be replaced with any writing instrument without breaking story logic; the brass-and-compartments specificity is textural rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Named explicitly and then demonstrated through layered examples: music, laughter, light, the couple's lineage "all scattered now to higher ground." The concept shapes her stake—to document these woven losses—and her method of cataloging particulars. It constrains her approach (she must capture what official records omit) and charges the closure image (world "refused...to be entirely gone"). Setup clear, beats involve identifying interlaced threads (marble/child's game, button/soldier-musician branches), closure links directly. The articulation "interlaced absence—that was what Maren had come to understand" edges toward telling, slightly lowering irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Explicitly labeled ("Stoically sensitive—her father had called her that once") rather than demonstrated through on-page tradeoff. The label claims she presents composure while feeling deeply, but no scene pressure forces her to suppress visible emotion at cost—she works alone at twilight with no witnesses requiring composure. The attribute is announced, not enacted. Present as character background but does not constrain or enable a key choice; purely ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The verb "wrest" appears once in the phrase "trying to wrest meaning from dissolution." This frames her interpretive effort but is summary rather than action—the on-page work is observe, write, seal. The wrestle is asserted rather than shown through struggle or resistance that she overcomes. The concept of extracting meaning is present throughout her note-taking, but "wrest" itself does not drive turns; it could be replaced with "extract," "salvage," or "preserve" without altering beats. Thematic presence without mechanical necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Signaled in the middle ("foundation repairs she'd ordered last month"), executed on-page ("pressed the notes into small gaps...Marine epoxy sealed each message"), and explicitly motivated (preserves witness for "future surveyors"). The method shapes her approach—she must compress and waterproof notes, target specific gaps—and enables the secret archive that differentiates her private work from official reports. Setup present, development shows mechanics and constraints (epoxy, gap placement), closure beat references the "notes multiplying in the foundations." The method is essential to her dual practice and would break her differentiation from standard surveying if removed.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The pavilion pressures every choice: knee-deep brackish water Maren must wade through, marble columns that hold artifact cracks (marble lodged in northeast corner), foundation patches that hide notes, and rising waterline that creates urgency ("risen another centimeter since her last visit"). The structure's partial survival ("bones of something that refused to disappear entirely") mirrors and charges the closure stance. Setup immediate, middle beats show spatial navigation and artifact discovery tied to architecture, closure image plants her "among the columns" in vigil. The submerged state is irreplaceable; a dry ruin would not create the same tidal metaphor or physical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Opening anchor is clear ("after the drawbridge rose...lifted the only passage") and closing reference appears ("drawbridge would lower again at dawn"). The timeframe isolates her in the flooded district and marks this as ritual repetition, but it does not tighten decisions within the scene—no clock pressure or tactics altered by the window. She completes her documentation without time constraint affecting her moves. Setup present, but no middle escalation or closure participation beyond framing the session. Functional isolation device, not a live pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Stated explicitly ("trying to wrest meaning from dissolution. That was her true work now, to become the archeologist of abandoned dreams") and demonstrated through artifact cataloging and note-sealing. The desire drives her presence and method, but no on-page friction tests it—she encounters no obstacle to this work, no competing pull, no moment where the dream-archaeology costs her something she wants. Setup clear, beats show enactment (writing coordinates, sealing notes), closure vigil embodies the role. Told and enacted but not conflicted; desire met without trade-off visible on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The phrase "hushed blaze" appears explicitly ("amber light...seemed to burn without heat. A hushed blaze, Maren thought, like the last of someone's faith") and the tone it names—quiet intensity, muted passion—coheres throughout: restrained diction, elegiac rhythm, controlled sensory detail that accumulates without shouting. Tone modulates subtly from the opening's mechanical groan to the closing's vigil stillness, supporting the accumulative structure. The final image charges the phrase by staging Maren in that exact quality of light and devotion. Setup mid-story, but the tone is consistent from the opening and crescendos at closure. The explicit naming is a small tell rather than pure enactment, preventing top-band score.</comment>
