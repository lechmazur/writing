<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elena's perceptive, methodical curiosity is embodied through concrete choices: returning to the map's edge, studying notes, comparing footage. Her decision to contact the heritage board shows agency with visible social risk. Internal states remain somewhat generic ("shielded openness, cautious in her approach") and the motivation to "understand why someone would seal away a place that spoke" is asserted more than dramatized through conflicting impulses under pressure. The final choice feels earned but lacks the contradictory internal friction that would push this higher.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story accretes through layered investigation (torn map → notes → footage comparison → fresco revelation) and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration when Elena stands in the whispered chapel and chooses to share rather than preserve silence. Cost is legible: she abandons the framer's ethic ("some maps had to stay torn") yet commits to exhibition, a trade-off charged by prior material. Orientation anchors cleanly (map framer, March, university district). One meaningful deepening occurs when footage comparison reveals transformation, reweighting the chapel from haunting to record and narrowing Elena's options toward institutional engagement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The torn map, fresco vault, and whispered chapel anchor the investigation with purpose-driven sensory detail (archival paper smell, rain-scoured limestone, voices as "physics and faith colliding"). The map's tear functions as micro-setting, dividing known from unknown and constraining Elena's interpretive method. Spatial choreography inside the vault is clean ("moved to the spot Dr. Marsh's notes had described"). The recurring rain operates causally (seepage reveals layers, stops for reopening), and the final image of rain resuming as Elena leaves charges the closure with texture and stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: understanding why the vault was sealed. Pressure coheres through investigation steps, and one meaningful tightening occurs when Elena realizes the frescoes transform rather than deteriorate, reweighting the mystery. Her decision to contact the heritage board is protagonist-driven with visible professional and social cost (shielded approach, four-month negotiation). However, the escalation lacks a live obstacle or trade-off scene; the university's refusal is summary-only and Dr. Marsh's abandonment remains off-page, softening the felt resistance Elena must overcome.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: preservation versus revelation, silence as record, empathy as interpretation method. The torn map returns charged at closure ("some maps had to stay torn") yet Elena chooses exhibition, a non-literal answer that reweights prior particulars without moralizing. Subtext operates through the whispered chapel as both acoustic phenomenon and visual palimpsest. The final image ("centuries of voices released by the specific geometry of her position") resonates without diagnosing the theme. One minor slip: "To interpret silence with empathy" in the penultimate paragraph edges close to a thematic echo, though it remains embedded in action and image rather than standing alone as thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with consistent distance and a perceptual signature rooted in Elena's framer expertise (noticing when "a crease did not match its fold"). Diction fits her professional register ("archival paper," "conservation adhesive," "Terra Incognita"). Narrative certainty matches her knowledge state, and the retrospective stance ("She understood then") reflects controlled reflection. However, several filter verbs stack in the vault scene ("She could not understand the words, but she understood their weight") and a few abstract phrases ("shielded openness," "accepting that some things could not be preserved in frames") drift toward essayistic diction under peak pressure, softening immediacy slightly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is clean and purposeful with high information density ("The tear ran diagonally through the center, severing the charted stones from an unmarked region"). Rhythm varies naturally and sentence openings diversify. Two frictions lower the score: (1) a paraphrase loop in the opening ("methodically curious by nature, the kind of person who noticed when a crease did not match its fold" is restated moments later as "A perceptive map framer learns to read what is not written"), and (2) a mild template cadence in the investigation middle ("She began… She found… By comparing…"). No artifacts touch the closure image, which remains vivid and propulsive ("already planning the exhibition that would share these whispers with the world").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of map framing, acoustic archaeology, and visual palimpsest feels specific and non-obvious. The fresco reveal (transformation rather than deterioration, layers uncovered in reverse) offers a fresh inflection on the haunted-site trope. Elena's professional lens and methodical investigation ground the material in lived detail. The choice between sealing and sharing avoids binary moralizing. One soft spot: the "whispered chapel" itself leans on familiar gothic-mystery beats (voices in walls, sealed vaults), and while the story transforms it through specificity, the core frame remains recognizable from genre templates.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elena's perceptiveness shapes three distinct beats: returning to the map's edge (setup), comparing footage to discover transformation (middle turn), and standing in the vault to verify acoustic phenomenon (closure participation). Her choices—contacting the heritage board, negotiating reopening—drive the resolution with visible professional and social cost. The trait is not merely label but enacted through observation that narrows options and forces decisions.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The henge appears in setup (map arrives depicting it, researcher's project centers on it) and closure (Elena stands "beneath the ancient henge's shadow" as workers remove the barrier). However, its physical presence is largely scenic; the stones themselves do not constrain Elena's investigation or alter her tactics. The vault beneath the henge does the causal work, making the henge itself more backdrop than active element.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The whispered chapel concept is seeded early (Dr. Marsh's notes on "acoustic phenomenon"), drives the middle investigation (Elena seeks to understand why it was sealed), and delivers the closure beat (Elena stands in the geometry that releases voices, grasps the stakes, and commits to exhibition). The concept redefines the mystery from haunting to record and shapes Elena's final choice between preservation and revelation, with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Methodically curious" is signaled early ("She was methodically curious by nature") and shown through her return to the map's edge, study of Dr. Marsh's notes, and systematic footage comparison. It enables the discovery that frescoes transform rather than deteriorate. However, the trait does not visibly constrain a choice or impose a tradeoff; it functions more as consistent characterization than as a pressure point with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The decision to reopen the vault is seeded in the middle ("She made her decision with shielded openness"), drives the four-month negotiation with the heritage board (a credible obstacle), and delivers the closure scene where Elena stands inside and commits to exhibition. Removing this action would collapse the arc; it redefines Elena's options from solitary investigation to public revelation with professional and relational stakes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The method is introduced early (Elena finds footage archives), used in the middle to discover the key turn (frescoes changing across decades), and its mechanics matter on the page ("Silent sixteen-millimeter film from 1962... security camera footage from Dr. Marsh's recent expedition"). The comparison constrains Elena's understanding and enables the realization that water reveals layers rather than erases. This method is irreplaceable; another research path would not yield the same temporal contrast.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The vault is present in setup (researcher's project, fresco details in notes), drives the middle investigation (Elena studies footage, realizes transformation), and delivers the closure scene where Elena stands in the acoustic geometry to verify voices and commits to exhibition. The rain-scoured surfaces supply the mechanism (seepage reveals layers), and the specific geometry of the vault enables the whispered phenomenon, both altering Elena's tactics and charging the final image with cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The torn map and its liminal edge ("that spot where knowledge stopped and mystery began") anchor the thematic frame early and recur at closure ("some maps had to stay torn"). The boundary between documented and Terra Incognita shapes Elena's interpretive method and supplies the title image. However, the "spot" functions more as conceptual setting than as a live spatial constraint during beats; it charges meaning more than it alters tactics, placing it in the upper-middle band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To interpret silence with empathy" is dramatized through Elena's choice to stand in the vault, listen without demanding translation ("She could not understand the words, but she understood their weight"), and commit to sharing rather than sealing. The motivation drives her investigation after Dr. Marsh abandons the project and informs her final decision to reopen and exhibit. A friction: the phrase itself appears in the penultimate paragraph as near-thesis statement, but it remains embedded in action and image rather than standing as pure assertion, and the choice carries visible cost (abandoning the framer's ethic of preservation).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Tone of "shielded openness" is established early (Elena's methodical curiosity, caution) and modulates through pressure: careful investigation, tentative contact with the heritage board ("She did not demand. She requested. She invited them to see"), and final commitment to exhibition despite prior restraint. The tone charges the closure image, where Elena's decision to share the whispers contradicts the framer's instinct to preserve as-is, making the openness costly. The specific phrase appears on-page ("her decision with shielded openness"), anchoring the tonal choice in action.</comment>
