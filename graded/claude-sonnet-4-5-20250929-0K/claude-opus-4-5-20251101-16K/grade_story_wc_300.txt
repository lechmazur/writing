**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural — the story builds through layered imagery and reflection toward a stance crystallization.

**Closure Unit:** Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) — Vera decides to call her daughter, carrying the pearl as emblem of transformed understanding. The before/after (walled-off → committed to vulnerability) is legible.

**BRR Assessment:** Reflection exceeds 30% but is anchored to present stimuli (shell, pearl, cave) and interleaved with micro-choices (lifting shell, pressing pearl to forehead, pocketing it). Exception applies, though some flattening of pressure occurs.

<question>1</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Vera has occupational specificity and defined emotional landscape (failed marriage, estranged daughter), but the epiphany is unearned — reading confessions on a shell triggers complete self-understanding without dramatized internal struggle. "The professional distance she maintained... as if proximity might break her" is diagnostic label-speak rather than embodied contradiction. The press-pearl-to-forehead moment is the strongest micro-choice but is immediately explained rather than trusted.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean by ~60 words. The accumulative design is identifiable but causality is thin: why does this particular shell transform Vera after seventeen years of encountering abandoned hopes? The pearl's impossibility is acknowledged then accepted without friction. Cost proof test: the ending declares anticipated vulnerability ("Tomorrow, she would call her daughter") but no specific on-page sentence makes cost viscerally legible at the closure beat — it's projected rather than felt, earning a −0.5 deduction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Quartz formations rose from the floor like frozen prayers" and the flashlight refractions are genuinely evocative. The bunker-inspection world is grounded with oxygen filters and water purification systems. However, the caves function as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraint — they don't force choices or alter tactics. Sensory palette is almost entirely visual; the tactile quality of the shell and pearl deserved more grounding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake (isolation vs. connection) is entirely internal with no external opposition or complication. There's no genuine escalation — the confessions deepen thematically but don't narrow options or raise costs. Vera faces no resistance to her transformation; the discovery sequence is frictionless. No price is paid that alters later tactics. The want/need tension (distance vs. connection) is stated rather than dramatized through competing pressures.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Theme is coherent but explicitly stated throughout rather than emergent: "The bunkers she inspected were monuments to separation" and "Her motivation crystallized... to dissolve the walls between hearts." The final paragraph is direct thematic summary: "crowned with abandoned hopes that were no longer abandoned, carrying latent radiance into a world that had forgotten how to glow" — this articulates the story's thesis in prompt-like language, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty (−0.7 for final paragraph). Theme replaces scene pressure rather than arising from it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited with a consistent lyric register. The inspector's perceptual signature is present early ("cataloging the shapes that human fear took") but fades as reflection overtakes observation. No dialogue to evaluate. The voice occasionally over-reaches into abstraction that exceeds the POV's plausible register for a bunker inspector: "latent radiance into a world that had forgotten how to glow" reads as authorial rather than character-filtered.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Strong images ("carrying them like stones in her pockets") compete with stock metaphors ("like a key finding its lock," "warming the cold places she had guarded for so long"). Paraphrase loops: "walls between hearts" / "not of walls but of bridges" / "monuments to separation" restate the same idea three times. The final sentence stuffs multiple prompt elements into one clause, creating artifact density at closure. Figurative density in peak beats exceeds clarity needs without being pattern-taught.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The bunker-inspector angle and crystal-cave setting provide fresh surface elements, and the confessional seashell is imaginative. However, the emotional arc — isolated professional discovers artifact that teaches her about human connection — follows a well-worn template. The "walls vs. bridges" metaphor is familiar territory. The resolution (calling her daughter) is predictable once the thematic direction is established. The impossible pearl is accepted without the friction that might have generated genuine originality.</comment>
