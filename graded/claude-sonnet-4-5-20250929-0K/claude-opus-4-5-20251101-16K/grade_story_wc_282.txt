<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera's internal state is concrete and embodied through the fossil's physical presence, and her motivation to "become the voice of the unknown" generates purposeful micro-choices (entering chambers, adjusting sensors, continuing deeper). The interiority occasionally slips into abstraction ("impossible gaps: past to present, waking to sleeping") and the final action lacks visible cost—she simply continues mapping without a path foreclosed. The connection to her daughter provides genuine emotional texture but remains reflective rather than driving a present choice with consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: sensory details and emotional signatures layer toward the third-chamber encounter, which offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (her role as witness crystallizes with the fossil warming, bridging the gap to her daughter). Orientation anchors cleanly by line 2. The closure reweights her task from technical mapping to bearing witness, but the cost is conceptual rather than visible—no tactic changes, no option forecloses on the page. The piece teaches its pattern early and holds the lens through the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cave network supplies concrete constraints: upward-flowing water, backward-traveling sound, floating objects under specific conditions, and mineral-dense air that creates visual manifestations. The third chamber's crystalline resonance directly enables the climactic encounter with the floating figures. The elm fossil functions as micro-setting, warming in her palm and charging the final image. Sensory hierarchy (thermal signatures, glowing walls, translucent shapes) is filtered through Vera's professional lens and accumulated pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—documenting the unknown and connecting to her sleeping daughter—is signaled early and tightens in the third chamber when active emotional signatures appear. The encounter with floating figures narrows her understanding (they are echoes, not ghosts) and deepens her role from technician to witness. However, the resolution lacks visible cost: Vera adjusts her sensors and continues without forfeiting an option or facing a trade-off. Escalation under the Accumulative lens is present but the price remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of bridging impossible distances (past/present, waking/sleeping, known/unknown) emerges organically through the fossil, the hibernation premise, and the cave's "factually mystical" phenomena. The third-chamber encounter dramatizes this gap without stating it. The final image—"bridging what was with what might still be"—offers resonance but edges toward explicit summation. Subtext operates well in the mineral resonance explanation and the daughter's presence felt through the warming fossil.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and perceptual filtering through Vera's professional vocabulary (sensors, thermal fluctuations, emotional residue). The prose maintains distinct texture in diction ("factually mystical," "crystalline resonance"). Minor slips: "belonged to those who remain awake" in the opening leans expository, and "transitional object her therapist had named it" intrudes with a filter that could be tighter. No dialogue present to evaluate. Narrative certainty matches Vera's knowledge throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high, with most lines advancing setting, character, or atmosphere. Minor scaffold: "She pressed the elm leaf fossil against her chest, drawing comfort" → "The fossil stayed warm in her pocket" repeats the same comfort gesture without added pressure. "Transitional objects worked this way, bridging impossible gaps" is slightly expository. The phrase "factually mystical" recurs three times, which borders on template cadence but serves voice. No major loops or clarity breaks; propulsion is steady.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The hibernation premise and "factually mystical" caves offer a fresh synthesis, and the sensory-mapping occupation is specific. The emotional heat-mapping concept is original in execution. However, the core arc—isolated worker finds meaning through connection to absent loved one—is a familiar template. The floating figures and mineral resonance provide a distinctive lens, but the final image ("bridging what was with what might still be") abstracts rather than transforms. The piece commits fully to its premise and avoids hedging.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Vera (sensory map maker) is present throughout, makes key observational choices (entering chambers, calibrating sensors), and her role as witness crystallizes at closure. However, her professional actions (mapping, adjusting equipment) do not create reversals or narrow options—she continues unimpeded. The character shapes tone and perspective but does not drive a decisive turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The elm leaf fossil appears in three distinct beats: introduced as her daughter's object (setup), pressed against her chest for comfort in the third chamber (middle), and stays warm in her pocket at closure (payoff). It accumulates meaning across these touches and charges the final image by embodying the transitional-object concept. However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—its role is symbolic resonance rather than causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "transitional objects" concept is named explicitly and exemplified by the fossil bridging past/present, but it functions primarily as theme rather than shaping on-page stakes. The concept frames Vera's motivation and the closure image, yet does not constrain a tactical choice or create visible cost. It appears early and returns at the end, offering lyric resonance but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Factually mystical" is signaled early, demonstrated through upward-flowing water and crystalline resonance, and enables the third-chamber encounter (the mineral composition creates visual manifestations). The attribute constrains what Vera can perceive and document. However, it does not impose a visible tradeoff or force a difficult choice—Vera observes and maps without friction from the mysticism itself.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Floating appears in the cave's rule-set (objects float under specific conditions), the translucent figures float above the stone floor, and this visual manifestation is central to the third-chamber climax. The action defines the encounter's stakes and enables Vera's role as witness. Removing "float" would require substantial rewrite of the cave's properties and the figures' presentation; the action is integral to the mystical-yet-documented tone.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Heat-mapping emotions is Vera's primary tool, signaled in paragraph 2, used actively to detect residual feelings (orange awe, blue contemplation, violent reds), and registers the dramatic spike in the third chamber. The method shapes her attempts and the story's sensory vocabulary. However, the mechanics do not create a constraint or cost—the equipment functions smoothly without trade-offs or calibration limits that narrow her choices.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The coastal cave network is present from the opening, supplies concrete constraints (upward-flowing water, backward-traveling sounds, mineral-dense air), and the third chamber's specific properties enable the climactic encounter. The setting pressures Vera's work and supplies the crystalline resonance mechanism. Removing this exact setting would collapse the story's logic and sensory architecture.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after humans hibernate" establishes Vera's isolation and the three-month window belonging to the awake, but it does not tighten a decision or create urgency. The hibernation premise motivates her daughter's absence and Vera's role, yet the current mapping task proceeds without a ticking clock or timeline pressure. The element frames context but does not constrain tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"To become the voice of the unknown" is stated as her deeper motivation beyond official mapping duties, and it drives her choice to document the third chamber's unidentifiable emotional signatures. The motivation shapes her stance at closure when she bears witness. However, the desire is told more than dramatized—no moment forces her to choose between official duty and personal mission, and the friction between her wants and costs remains abstract.</comment>
