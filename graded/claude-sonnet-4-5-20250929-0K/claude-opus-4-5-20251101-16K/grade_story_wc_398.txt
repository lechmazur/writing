<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Clara's interiority is concrete and her micro-choices (missing the bus, keeping the letter fragment) are body-anchored. The internal arc from blame-seeking to "intersubjective understanding" is traced through on-page particulars—Marguerite's vine parable, the shifted reading of Thomas's phrase. However, the final epiphany ("some beautiful things were simply never meant to grow together—and that this was tragedy enough without adding blame") edges toward tidy articulation that summarizes rather than showing contradictory impulses still at play. Marguerite remains instrumental rather than pressured by her own stake.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors clearly by line 2 (Clara, hill path, pavilion, autumn dusk). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (understanding as arrival) with felt cost: Clara transforms her reading of the letter and accepts the mismatch without blame, foreclosing the path of seeking fault. The vineyard parable and amber-pavilion framing charge the final image. One minor slip: the "intersubjective understanding" label in Marguerite's dialogue risks stating the theme rather than letting the vine analogy carry it alone, but the cost remains legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The amber pavilion, vineyard rows, and vacant station below anchor choices: Clara climbs to the pavilion, watches the bus go, and follows Marguerite to the cottage. Sensory details (fermenting grapes, purple dusk, honeycomb glow) are filtered through Clara's reflective state. The thinned vine section near the eastern fence functions as micro-setting that constrains the parable and charges the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: understanding what went wrong with Thomas. The tightening occurs when Marguerite's vine parable reframes the letter fragment, shifting Clara from blame to acceptance of the mismatch. Agency is attention and renunciation (letting go of fault-seeking) with visible cost: she keeps the fragment "transformed" rather than destroyed or worshipped, foreclosing the paths of either erasure or idolatry. The single meaningful deepening is sufficient for this length under the Accumulative lens, though the pressure remains contemplative rather than urgent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme (incompatibility as tragedy without blame) emerges from the vine parable and the burned letter edge, both returning with reweighted meaning at closure. The final image offers a resonant answer without stated moral. One persistent weakness: Marguerite's explicit naming of "intersubjective understanding" and "destined mismatches" risks thematic echo, treating the reader as student rather than allowing the particulars to resonate alone. The specificity of the mismatched graft rescues the moment, but the label still flattens what the image could carry unaided.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and anchored in Clara's perceptual filter. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: tighter in the opening action (missing the bus, climbing steps), looser in the reflective exchange. Marguerite's dialogue carries distinct idiom ("the right nowhere," "I watch these vines") that contrasts with Clara's educated introspection. The prose rhythm varies with emotional weight: short declaratives at closure ("She followed") after longer reflective passages. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the vine parable and letter-handling beats. Two minor artifacts: "Some arrivals required no departures; some questions needed geography to answer them" (opening) and "But she knew she would return to this place in memory…" (penultimate paragraph) edge toward elevated summary that slightly mismatches Clara's embodied urgency elsewhere. One paraphrase loop: the closing two paragraphs restate "arrived somewhere new" / "already arrived" without adding pressure. Deduction: −0.4 for template elevation + loop in final third; disallow 9+ globally per artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The vine-graft parable as analogy for relationship mismatch is a fresh synthesis, grounded in seasonal and occupational detail. The burned letter edge (partial phrase survival) is a strong specific. However, the core frame—protagonist visits the place where a failed relationship began, receives wisdom from a local elder, and achieves acceptance—is a widely used template. Transformation is partial: the vineyard sentinel and grafting specifics add texture, but the arc's bones remain recognizable. The didactic tone in Marguerite's explanations reduces bold risk. Mid-band: functional freshness without full reinvention.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marguerite (lone vineyard sentinel) is present by paragraph 4 (setup ✓), offers the vine parable that narrows Clara's interpretive options (development ✓), and implicitly enables the closure acceptance (payoff ✓). Her choice to share the parable and invite Clara to the cottage creates two key beats. Causal pressure: her analogy reframes the letter fragment and shifts Clara's stance. Cost connection: Clara's transformation depends on Marguerite's perspective. Specificity: "forty years" watching vines, the mismatched graft detail. One friction: Marguerite's role is pedagogical rather than conflicted; she does not wrestle with her own stake. Deduction: −0.8 for low personal cost. Strong integration otherwise.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The burned letter edge is present by paragraph 8 (setup ✓), Clara handles it and reads it twice (two beats ✓), and she folds it carefully at closure with reweighted meaning: "transformed" (payoff ✓). The partial phrase "never meant to hurt" shifts from excuse to empathy under the vine parable's pressure. Causal linkage: the fragment anchors Clara's question and the parable reinterprets it. Specificity: the charred state and lone surviving phrase matter. One friction: the closure handling is brief and could be more tactile; the fold is efficient but not deeply embodied. Strong integration with slight lyric underuse.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The core concept (destined mismatches) is explicit by paragraph 13 ("Destined mismatches") and shapes the parable's stakes (setup late but signaled ✓). It reframes Clara's understanding in the vine analogy (development ✓) and underwrites the closure acceptance: "some beautiful things were simply never meant to grow together" (payoff ✓). Causal pressure: the concept changes Clara's interpretive options. One major friction: the concept is stated rather than only shown; Marguerite names it directly, reducing its emergence from action. Deduction: −0.6 for didactic delivery. Solid thematic integration with pedagogical drag.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Gently persuasive" appears as descriptor in paragraph 14 ("Marguerite's tone was gently persuasive, not insistent"). The trait enables Marguerite's parable to land without triggering Clara's resistance (one on-page action with cost: Clara listens and shifts stance). Setup: implied in early dialogue; explicit mid-story. Development: the non-insistent delivery allows Clara to receive the analogy. Payoff: the transformation hinges on tone. One friction: the attribute is told rather than demonstrated through specific speech rhythms or gesture; we are instructed it is "gently persuasive" rather than feeling it in cadence. Deduction: −0.8 for label-only trait. Functional but underembodied.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The action "rediscover" is stated in paragraph 10: "I thought if I stood in the same place, I might rediscover what went wrong." This frames Clara's goal (setup ✓). The subsequent beats test this desire: the parable offers a new lens (development ✓), and the closure replaces rediscovery of fault with acceptance of mismatch (payoff ✓, the action is transformed rather than completed). Causal pressure: the attempt to rediscover drives Clara to the pavilion and opens her to Marguerite's perspective. One friction: the action is more motivational backdrop than dramatized attempt; Clara does not actively search before the parable arrives. Deduction: −0.9 for summary-only use. Present and functional but not fully physicalized.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The method "by drawing parallels" is both stated and enacted. Marguerite explicitly says "by drawing parallels, we sometimes understand what direct examination obscures" (paragraph 14), and the vine-graft analogy is the parallel in action (setup + development ✓). The method shapes Clara's shift from blame to understanding (payoff ✓). Causal pressure: the parallel narrows Clara's interpretive options and enables the closure reframe. Specificity: the mechanics (mismatched graft → mismatched love) are concrete and load-bearing. One friction: the method is named in addition to being shown, risking slight over-instruction. Deduction: −0.3 for didactic naming. Strong integration overall; the analogy does heavy lifting.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The amber pavilion is present by paragraph 2 (setup ✓), Clara climbs its three steps and sits within (beat involvement ✓), and the closing image references leaving it "empty behind them" (payoff ✓). The setting provides spatial anchoring and a framing device for the conversation. The "honeycomb glow" and "amber hour" charge the reflective tone. One friction: the pavilion is more stage than constraint; it does not pressure Clara's choices beyond offering a place to sit and talk. The vacant station below contrasts arrival/departure but remains symbolic backdrop. Deduction: −0.6 for postcard function over tactical pressure. Solid atmospheric integration without mechanical stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The timeframe is anchored in the opening: "The final bus groaned away" (setup ✓). Clara's deliberate missing of the bus establishes the temporal constraint. Marguerite notes "The next bus isn't until morning" (payoff ✓), and the invitation to the cottage closes the window. Development: the stranded state enables the extended conversation; if the bus were still available, Clara could leave. Causal pressure: the timeframe creates opportunity rather than urgency; the "until morning" frame is loose. One friction: no on-page clock tightens decisions; the bus departure is catalyst, not live countdown. Deduction: −1.1 for vague tracking after setup. Present and functional but does not escalate pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The motivation "to nurture intersubjective understanding" is explicit by paragraph 15: Marguerite names it, and Clara enacts it by shifting her reading of Thomas's phrase to include his perspective. Setup: implied in Clara's search for understanding; named mid-story. Payoff: the closure hinges on Clara recognizing "another person's truth is as real as your own, even when they cannot meet" (✓). One major friction: the motivation is told and labeled rather than dramatized through conflicted choice; Clara does not resist or pay visible cost to achieve this understanding—it arrives via the parable without struggle. Deduction: −1.4 for label-only + no on-page friction. Thematic presence without embodied conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tone "passionate subtlety" coheres throughout: restrained lyricism ("honeycomb glow," "purple dusk"), intimate stakes handled without melodrama, and the closure modulates to quiet resolve ("she followed"). The burned letter and vine analogy carry charged meaning without overt declaration. The tone supports pressure: reflection deepens rather than stalls. One friction: Marguerite's explicit naming of concepts ("intersubjective understanding," "destined mismatches") briefly breaks subtlety in favor of instruction. Deduction: −0.4 for didactic moments mid-story. Otherwise the tone charges the final image and modulates cleanly with emotional weight.</comment>
