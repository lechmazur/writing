<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Meren's interior life is concrete and character-particular ("symphonically minded" organizes her perception), but she faces no meaningful internal contradiction—her stubbornness never wavers, no competing impulse tests her commitment. The hedgehog functions more as atmospheric prop than relational pressure. The final tears feel gestural rather than embodied through specific sensation, and the "willingness to offer without guarantee" reads close to thematic label-speak at the climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean within 120 words. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: three years of silence → three days ago discovery → three-day rebuild → present strumming → sound returns through incremental intensification. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the grove remembers its voice) with felt cost in Meren's aching fingers and sustained offering. The causal chain from porcelain insight to rebuild to sound is present but relies heavily on assertion ("she understood then") rather than dramatized discovery beats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The grove is vivid and selective—siskin alders, northeastern corner, specific porcelain placement. The porcelain insulator's stress cracks constrain Meren's redesign (receiving vs. projecting) and the grove's spatial arrangement matters to her instrument's architecture. The hedgehog's turn and proximity shift charge the closure image with micro-setting payoff. Sensory hierarchy reflects Meren's sonic bias throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (coax sound back) is signaled immediately. One meaningful deepening occurs when Meren shifts from forcing sound outward to absorbing (porcelain lesson), narrowing her tactical options. The first note's arrival and hedgehog's approach constitute escalation under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible in her aching fingers and sustained offering, though the price feels modest—no foreclosed path, no visible trade-off that tests her commitment beyond endurance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (empathy as patient reception) emerges through the porcelain's fractures and Meren's tactical shift. The final image reweights "listening hard enough to be heard" without moralizing. However, "empathy in motion" appears twice as near-label, and the piece leans toward illustrating the prompt concept rather than complicating it—Meren's offering succeeds without ambiguity or counter-pressure that would deepen resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with controlled distance. Perceptual signature is strong: "symphonically minded" filters all observation through sonic metaphor ("movements and crescendos," "percussion of imagined footfalls"). Diction remains within Meren's lexicon. One minor slip: "empathy in motion: the willingness to offer without guarantee" at the climax edges toward essayistic summary rather than embodied thought, but the voice recovers immediately in the final beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Information density is strong; most lines advance situation or character. Opening and closing images anchor effectively. Two paraphrase loops penalize: "They carried vibrations...memories of storms" restates living/growth without added detail; "half-present" echoes "barely there...more felt than heard" within adjacent beats. "Symphonically minded" appears twice in identical phrasing. Template cadence appears once: "She played for the grove, for the small creature watching her, for the cracked porcelain..." The loops and stem repeat collectively warrant −0.6 under the artifact pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The acoustic-collapse premise is fresh, and the porcelain-insulator-as-listening-archive offers a non-obvious synthesis. The hedgehog ritual and stress-crack methodology feel specific. However, the emotional arc (patient offering → sound returns → tears) follows a predictable template for restoration stories, and the Quiet's scientific/mystic explanations read as genre furniture. The piece commits fully to its premise but the final breakthrough arrives without complication or ironic cost that would elevate inevitability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Tree-song sculptor frames Meren's expertise, drives her three-year instrument-carving attempts, and her pivot from projection to absorption. Her choice to rebuild her approach entirely and strum the new strings creates the key turns. Present early, shapes middle tactics, and delivers closure action.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Porcelain insulator is introduced at the discovery beat, analyzed for stress cracks that teach the receiving-vs-projecting lesson, repositioned at grove center to guide instrument shape, and reappears in the strumming paragraph as the teaching artifact. Three beats, causal pressure on tactics, closure linkage, irreplaceable mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Empathy in motion is named twice and dramatized once in the shift from forcing-outward to absorbing-first. The label appears explicitly at the climax ("This was empathy in motion: the willingness to offer"), which reads thematic rather than tactical. The concept shapes her redesign choice but does not constrain later options—swappable with "patience" or "humility" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Symphonically minded appears twice, organizing how Meren composes in her head and arranges perception in "movements and crescendos." It constrains her ritual (watching the hedgehog as clock-analog) and primes her instrument design. Present early, colors perception throughout, but no visible on-page cost or trade-off tied specifically to this trait—her symphonic framing never conflicts with another impulse.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Strumming is the closure action: Meren strums the alder strings, motion travels through wood, hedgehog pauses and approaches, first note rises, music grows. The action cannot be swapped without losing the tactile offering that earns the sound's return. Present in final third with full causal weight and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Analyzing stress cracks is introduced at discovery, yields the receiving-vs-projecting insight that redirects her entire approach, and the fracture patterns guide the new instrument's shape. The method is signaled, mechanics matter (cracks record forces), and it shapes the middle rebuild. Strong causal role and specificity, though the analysis itself happens off-page between discovery and redesign.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Siskin alder grove anchors every beat: northeastern corner for discovery, oldest alder for grain-tracing, grove center for insulator placement, branches for string installation, and the grove "begins to remember its voice" at closure. Setting supplies resources (fallen branches, spatial arrangement) and charges the final image. Essential across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Hedgehog uncurling establishes the ritual frame and closes when it "curled back into sleep," bracketing the session. Time anchors the opening and ending but does not tighten decisions—Meren could strum longer or shorter without altering the sound's return. Present in framing but does not pressure tactics or create a live clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Creating music in a silent world is the dominant stake, signaled immediately, tested through three years of failed instruments, redirected by the porcelain lesson, and realized when the first note rises. The desire drives all choices and is dramatized in the redesign and sustained strumming despite no expectation of success. Cost is aching fingers and years of grief. Causal backbone and closure participation are strong.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Intensely quiet tone is coherent throughout: "silence had pressed against everything like deep water," no rustle, acoustic collapse, half-present note "thin as spider silk." Tone modulates with the note's arrival (tears, fragile music) without breaking the quietness. The final image ("someone was finally listening hard enough to be heard") charges silence with reciprocal attention, sustaining and deepening the tonal frame at closure.</comment>
