<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The queen's interior life is textured with embodied disenchantment—"hollow space where faith once lived"—and her softly commanding will is shown through specific action (climbing despite physical cost). The shadow-woman functions as externalized alternative rather than a fully-pressured second character, which keeps interiority dominant. The final choice (removing the crown) is motivated by accumulated weariness but arrives without visible internal contradiction in the decisive moment; the renunciation reads as release rather than torn agency. Micro-choices under pressure are present but muted by the reflective register.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page as Earned Stasis with conceptual cost: Thessaly chooses transformation and forecloses return, the kingdom "dreaming of a queen who would not return" makes the price legible. The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early (dream motif, starlight imagery) and holds it through to the final image where "transformation began its patient, terrible work." Orientation anchors are clear by the opening beat (queen, court, climb begins). One meaningful deepening occurs when the shadow-woman reveals herself as "the path not taken," narrowing Thessaly's options to stay or return.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cobalt grotto constrains the climactic choice by its literal and symbolic remoteness—Thessaly must climb into thin air to reach it, and the impossible cold signals threshold crossing. The bleeding starlight becomes tactile (pooling, turning stone to ember), charging the closure image with environmental specificity. Fireflies at altitude create purposeful impossibility that marks the space as transformative. The ridge, clouds, and switchbacks build a legible vertical geography that pressures the ascent and isolation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to embrace transformation or return—is signaled by the seer's warning and sharpened when the shadow-woman offers the binary choice explicitly. One meaningful tightening occurs when Thessaly sees the grotto matches her dreams, confirming the irreversibility of the path. The cost is conceptual and social (abandoning the kingdom) rather than viscerally embodied in the moment of choice; the final act of removing the crown forecloses return with felt weight, but the decision itself reads as yielding rather than torn agency under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—disenchantment as prelude to re-enchantment—emerges through concrete images (hollow crown, bleeding stars, ember stone) without thesis statement. The final image of transformation beginning "its patient, terrible work" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether escape from hollow rule is possible, reweighting the opening disenchantment with undeniable cost. The shadow-woman as "the path not taken" deepens the thematic question through specific encounter rather than allegory. No explicit moralizing; the piece trusts the image to carry meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is elevated and consistently lyric—"voice cracked like dry riverbed," "wound-water from distant stars"—with a distinct perceptual signature favoring metaphor and sensory compression. POV remains stable in third-limited; no head-hopping. The register holds under pressure, though some phrases ("gentle authority expecting obedience from flesh") tilt toward abstraction in peak beats. Dialogue is minimal and purposeful; the shadow-woman's lines carry threat and subtext without over-explanation. Psychic distance modulates intentionally between close interior and wider landscape.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Figurative density is high but mostly coherent: "light that dripped like wound-water," "smile was a blade wrapped in silk," "stars bleeding...like honey, like tears." One mixed vehicle: "wound-water" pairs injury with liquid in a way that strains clarity. Sentence openings vary; rhythm modulates with scene pressure. Minor scaffold: "The dreams had not been summons but mirrors" tells what was just dramatized. Information density is strong overall; no loops or template cadence detected. Proofread clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—queen choosing mystical transformation over rule—is familiar but executed with specific imagery (cobalt grotto, bleeding starlight, fireflies at altitude) and tonal commitment ("lacy menace") that avoid generic fantasy tropes. The shadow-woman as externalized alternative self is not wholly original but is rendered with purposeful ambiguity. Risk-taking in the lyric register and the quiet, irreversible ending elevate the piece; the transformation is patient rather than explosive, which feels earned rather than convenient. Proximity check: no close echoes of famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Thessaly's disenchantment is signaled in the opening third ("hollow space where faith once lived"), drives the climb (middle action), and culminates in removing the crown at closure. Her choice to "unravel the mystery" shapes two key beats: deciding to climb despite warnings, then choosing transformation over return. The final renunciation forecloses her queenship with visible cost. Causal pressure is clear and the element is indispensable to the arc.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ember grotto appears early (journey goal), is reached at midpoint (becomes the setting for confrontation), and charges the closure as the site of transformation. Its cobalt walls and bleeding starlightPooling to ember are handled with specificity. The grotto's remoteness and impossible temperature constrain Thessaly's choice by making return difficult. Removing it would collapse both setting and stakes. Strong causal role across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Bleeding starlight is seeded in dreams (winter visions of "light that dripped like wound-water"), becomes visceral at the grotto ("stars bleeding...dripped like honey"), and persists through the closure beat ("The stars continued to bleed their ancient light"). It functions as atmospheric motif and visual anchor but does not constrain a tactical choice or alter Thessaly's options directly. The element reweights meaning (transformation as beautiful wound) without driving a turn. Lyric reprise with thematic charge but not plot pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Softly commanding" is labeled early ("that gentle authority expecting obedience from flesh") and shown in the climb (her will drives her body despite pain). It does not constrain a choice or create visible tradeoff at closure; the attribute enables the journey but does not cost her anything on the page. Present in setup and development, absent from closure participation. Functional but not indispensable; another trait could serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The climb is the story's spine: signaled in the opening ("Now she began to climb"), occupies the middle journey (switchbacks, burning lungs, thinning air), and delivers Thessaly to the grotto where the climactic choice occurs. Removing the climb removes the physical ordeal and the threshold-crossing logic. The ascent narrows her options by isolating her from the kingdom and advisors. Irreplaceable and causally central across all gates.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"A shared exhale spotting the first fireflies of summer" appears at the grotto scene and binds Thessaly to the shadow-woman in perception. It marks a moment of unity ("becoming one perception") but does not shape prior attempts or constrain the choice itself—the decision to stay follows but is not mechanically dependent on the shared breath. The method is present at closure but not seeded earlier or used to alter tactics. Lyric moment without causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The cobalt grotto above clouds is the journey's destination (setup), the site of confrontation (development), and the locale of transformation (closure). Its altitude, impossible cold, and bleeding starlight create pressure by signaling irreversibility. The setting's remoteness forecloses easy return, shaping Thessaly's final choice. Spatial specificity (fissure in ceiling, pooling light turning stone to ember) alters the emotional charge. Indispensable across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"After the final warning" anchors the story three days past the seer's prophecy and frames urgency: Thessaly acts despite prophecy. The timeframe does not create a ticking clock during the climb or grotto scene, but the "three warnings" tradition and the progression from winter dreams to present ascent give temporal shape. The element is present in setup, implied in the middle (journey duration: "Hours dissolved"), and implicit at closure (kingdom sleeps, unaware). Functional frame without live pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Thessaly's desire "to unravel the mystery of recurring dreams" is stated early, dramatized through her defiance of warnings and the physical climb, and tested at the grotto when she learns the dreams were mirrors, not summons. The motivation shifts under pressure (from mystery-solving to transformation-seeking) with visible cost: she chooses the unknown over rule. Friction between want (answers) and cost (abandoning the kingdom) is legible. The element drives two beats and shapes closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Lacy menace" is embodied in the shadow-woman's "smile was a blade wrapped in silk" and "menace in her beauty, threat woven through her elegance," sustained through "bleeding starlight" and "patient, terrible work" at closure. The tone modulates from foreboding (seer's warning) to awe (grotto discovery) to inevitability (transformation begins), charging the final image. Coherent across turns and integral to voice. The element shapes atmosphere rather than choice, but its presence in the closure image elevates resonance.</comment>
