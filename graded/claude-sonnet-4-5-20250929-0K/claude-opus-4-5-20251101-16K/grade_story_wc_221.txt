<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is grounded in physical sensation ("temporal distortion," "cells synchronized") and embodied action (charcoal sketching, touching the applique). The shift from paralysis to motion is earned through her realization that "true north wasn't a fixed point," leading to a credible renunciation of rescue in favor of forward movement. Minor weakness: the epiphany risks abstraction ("direction: forward, always forward") without a concrete micro-choice in the final beat to anchor the cost. Internal contradiction between isolation and agency is visible, but the final pivot could sharpen by showing a visible trade-off rather than stating intent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation is clear by ~80 words (observation deck, temporal anomaly, Mira stranded). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered reflection on the sketching tradition, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) when Mira accepts her condition and commits to drawing as navigation. The closure cost is conceptual—abandoning hope of rescue and reframing motion as home—legible in "until motion itself became home." One meaningful deepening occurs when she glimpses the pattern in her sketches and reinterprets her grandmother's compass rose. No causality breaks; the ending reweights prior material under the accumulative lens without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observation deck's temporal distortion actively constrains Mira's options (rescue ships aged, she cannot leave), satisfying the micro-setting test. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "stars blur into threads," "silence pressed against her ears like water," "stretched silence." The journal's gilded compass rose charges the closure by reappearing with shifted meaning. The setting modulates with her internal state—emptiness becomes potential—and the final image ties environment to choice. Spatial choreography is clean (viewport, journal, charcoal). Minor gap: the mechanics of time dilation could be more tactile in a mid-beat to deepen constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: Mira's isolation and paralysis in the anomaly. One meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes "true north wasn't a fixed point" and shifts from passive waiting to active sketching as navigation. The escalation is accumulative—each sketch becomes a course correction—and the cost is legible: she forecloses rescue and commits to motion through fractured time. Agency is clear (she chooses to draw what she wants to go toward), and the final image ("motion itself became home") reweights her stance with visible renunciation. No false solutions; the resolution arises from her alteration. Minor note: a second on-page micro-choice in the closing beat would tighten the price further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the family sketching custom, the compass rose applique, and the shifting constellations. "Find your true north, even when the stars lie" is dramatized through Mira's realization that direction is motion, not destination. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"motion itself became home"—without moralizing. Subtext operates in the journal's tactile presence and the grandmother's needle binding metal to leather. The pattern (north star as heartbeat) reweights prior material without stating a thesis. Minor slip: "stubborn inheritance" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic summary, though the final image recovers specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with clean focalization on Mira. Perceptual signature is consistent: time metaphors ("seconds pooled like spilled mercury"), sensory precision ("gilded edges sharp against her fingertip"), and reflection filtered through physical anchors. Distance modulates purposefully—closer during the sketching beats, slightly elevated during backstory. The prose rhythm shifts with emotional intensity: shorter sentences at the epiphany, longer at the opening. Minor weakness: "blessed pariah" and "living paradox" lean toward externalized summary rather than Mira's own idiom, and "stubborn inheritance" in the final third feels slightly elevated beyond her established texture under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance situation or interiority. Sentence openings vary, and rhythm supports momentum ("Tonight was an anniversary" pivots the scene cleanly). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor deductions: "The confusion that had paralyzed her since the shutdown began to shift" summarizes rather than showing the shift through micro-action. "Each sketch was an anchor. A refusal to drift entirely into the stretching void" is near-paraphrase across adjacent lines (−0.2). "The pause before a first step" risks stock phrasing. Filter verbs ("glimpsed," "heard") are acceptable but cluster slightly in the middle third. Overall clarity and propulsion remain strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The temporal-distortion stranding premise is familiar but transformed through the specific detail of the family sketching custom and the compass rose applique. The realization that "true north wasn't a fixed point" feels earned in hindsight by the pattern of her grandmother's and mother's sketches. Emotional specificity (charcoal, leather journal, starlight on gilded metal) avoids generic templates. The turn from paralysis to navigation through sketching is fresh within the isolation-story frame. Minor limitation: the "blessed pariah" frame and the rescue-ships-gave-up setup echo well-worn SF tropes without full transformation; the closure's originality lifts the score but does not fully escape the template shadow.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira (blessed pariah) is present throughout and her decision to "sketch not what she saw, but where she wanted to go" drives the closure. She touches the compass rose, opens the journal, and commits to forward motion. Setup clear, middle choice (reinterpreting the custom), and closure participation all present. Causal pressure: her realization narrows options (abandon rescue, embrace motion). Cost: forecloses return. Minor cap: the "blessed pariah" label appears only as exposition; the trait's consequences (temporal sync, isolation) shape stakes but the phrase itself does not recur or charge the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The gilded compass rose applique appears in three distinct beats: mid-story touch ("sharp against her fingertip"), late realization ("Her grandmother had never meant for her to find a destination"), and final image ("caught the light once more as she closed the journal"). Setup in first third, middle beat reweights meaning, closure reprise. Specificity high (gilded, sewn by grandmother, needle and thread binding). Causal pressure: the applique anchors her epiphany that direction ≠ destination. Cost tied: she renounces arrival in favor of motion. Solid integration; not indispensable (story survives without it) but deeply woven.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"True north" shapes stakes throughout. Setup: grandmother's phrase "Find your true north, even when the stars lie." Development: Mira realizes "True north wasn't a fixed point. It never had been." Closure: "she found her true north at last. Not a star. Not a place. A direction: forward." The concept constrains her options (abandons fixed rescue hope) and enables her tactic (sketching as navigation). Cost: she reframes her entire stance. The concept is irreplaceable; removing it breaks the thematic and tactical arc. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Temporally stretched" is established early (cells synchronized, seventeen days/centuries confusion) and constrains Mira's situation: she cannot leave, rescue ships age. Setup clear, middle pressure (isolation forces her to reinterpret time), closure linkage (she chooses to "flow through" dilated time). Causal: the attribute creates the stakes. Cost: her body is a paradox, forecloses normal rescue. Minor cap: the trait enables the premise but does not evolve or charge the final image beyond initial setup; it remains static constraint rather than dynamic tool. Solid functional integration, not indispensable to the sketch-turn.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Glimpse" is the pivot action: "She glimpsed, in the slow accumulation of drawings, a pattern she hadn't seen before." This beat triggers her realization that Polaris moves "like a heartbeat" and true north is motion, not fixity. Setup (sketches accumulate), development (glimpse reveals pattern), closure (insight drives new sketches and forward commitment). Causal pressure high: the glimpse redefines her options from passive waiting to active navigation. Cost: she abandons rescue fantasy. Specificity: the verb is precise (not "saw" or "noticed"). Removing "glimpse" would require substituting another discovery verb, but the accumulation-to-insight structure depends on this exact beat. Strong integration, nearly indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The family custom of sketching constellations on anniversaries is seeded early ("Every year since her grandmother first looked up..."), constrains middle action (Mira continues despite distorted stars), and drives closure (she sketches "where she wanted to go" and commits to repeat "until motion itself became home"). Setup, development (custom becomes navigation tool), and closure participation all present. Causal: the custom's mechanics (recording shared sky, connection across distance) reframe as anchor and course correction. Cost: she transforms remembrance into forward motion, forecloses past-focused ritual. Specificity high (charcoal, journal, anniversary). Essential to the narrative arc.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The observation deck is present throughout, pressures choices (Mira cannot leave due to temporal sync), and supplies the distorted starlight that forces her to sketch from memory rather than observation. Setup immediate, middle pressure (isolation amplifies her need for the custom), closure participation (deck's "stretched silence" becomes potential, final sketching occurs there). Micro-setting test satisfied: the deck constrains her physically and its anomaly redefines the sketching method. Cost: she must navigate by unreliable stars. Strong causal and closure linkage; nearly indispensable to the time-dilation premise and sketch mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After the shutdown" anchors the timeframe early and sets up Mira's isolation (three years outside, seventeen days/centuries for her). The anniversary timing triggers the sketching ritual and her realization. Setup present, middle development (time's meaninglessness pressures her to reinterpret motion), closure linkage weak ("tomorrow—whatever tomorrow meant here—she would sketch again" acknowledges but does not tighten time further). The timeframe enables the premise but does not escalate pressure in the final third; the closure rests on her conceptual shift rather than a temporal deadline. Functional but not essential to the ending's charge.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation "to turn confusion into exploration" is dramatized through her shift from paralysis ("confusion that had paralyzed her") to active sketching ("she would flow through it"). Setup: confusion stated early. Development: she reinterprets the custom and compass rose as navigation tools. Closure: "Mira found her true north at last...forward, always forward" and "motion itself became home." The motivation shapes her final choice and forecloses rescue fantasy (cost). Friction visible: she must abandon clarity and destination in favor of perpetual motion. Strong causal and closure linkage; the motivation is irreplaceable to the arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Echoed silence" is established early ("cathedral of glass and silence," "echoed silence...pressed against her ears like water") and modulates through the story: oppressive emptiness becomes "potential" and "the quiet between heartbeats." Setup clear, development (tone shifts with her stance), closure participation (silence reweighted as pause before action). The tone is coherent, supports pressure, and charges the final image ("the pause before a first step"). Specificity: "echoed" is precise (suggests layered, reflected quiet in vast space). Minor cap: while purposeful, the tone could intensify more sharply at the closure beat to fully elevate the ending. Strong integration overall.</comment>
