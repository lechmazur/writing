<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus's eleven years of routine knowledge becomes his tool for solving the crisis, showing trait-driven problem-solving. His "resiliently positive" nature is claimed but functions more as label than embodied contradiction—he feels wonder immediately without visible struggle against fear. The final choice to "choose arrival" reads as assertion rather than a micro-choice with visible cost; we don't see what path he forecloses or what price he pays in that moment. Internal contradiction and embodied emotion under peak stress remain thin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a Hybrid lens (causal linkage via Marcus's radio transmissions married to accumulative textural patterns in the grotto walls), and closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Marcus chooses arrival, the grotto dissolves, ordinary light returns. Orientation anchors cleanly within the first 120 words. The cost is somewhat abstract: we're told passengers disembark "without knowing they had ever been elsewhere," but Marcus's personal price—what he gives up or what changes for him beyond carrying a warm hourglass—is not made visceral on the page. One meaningful tightening occurs when the woman explains the loop and Marcus applies his route knowledge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The spectral grotto with crystalline walls and luminescent water provides vivid sensory anchors that constrain Marcus's options—he must use the hourglass, the radio, and the visual patterns to navigate. The setting is filtered through Marcus's professional lens (coordinates, tides, schedules) and directly charges the closure: starlight fills the hourglass, the grotto dissolves, morning light breaks. Spatial choreography remains clear; the ferry, wheelhouse, foredeck, and captain's desk track cleanly. Minor deduction for the grotto's exact mechanics (how patterns "resonate" via radio) remaining slightly abstract rather than tactile.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—freeing the ferry and passengers from the temporal fracture—is signaled early and tightens when the woman reveals "two hundred and seventeen" prior attempts and growing transparency. Marcus's agency drives the turn: he uses his memorized patterns to call across timelines, aligning reflections. The escalation is clear, though the final convergence happens quickly without a visible tradeoff or secondary complication. Cost is felt (the woman and others were trapped, now freed) but Marcus's personal sacrifice or what option he forecloses by choosing arrival over departure is not made explicit on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete images: the empty hourglass waiting to be filled, clocks running sideways, the ferry existing in "permanent transient" until Marcus chooses one state. The ending image—hourglass in his pocket, warm and waiting—reweights prior material without overt moralizing, suggesting ongoing readiness rather than closure. The piece resists tidy resolution; passengers are unaware, and Marcus alone carries the knowledge. Minor slip: "permanent transient" is stated as a concept ("Marcus understood the tone of this place now") rather than fully dramatized through prior action, though the phrase does charge the final beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Marcus; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present: Marcus filters the crisis through his ferry knowledge ("coordinates, tides, the rhythm of daily passages") and resiliently positive stance. The woman's speech is distinct and crisp ("You could end this"), though brief. Minor deduction for one line of light exposition: "'The loop. The split. When the original accident happened...'" reads as convenient info-dump rather than Marcus discovering it through action. Psychic distance is consistent; the prose anchors in Marcus's wonder and professional competence throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Clarity and rhythm are generally strong; sentence variation supports the shifts from ordinary ferry routine to spectral crisis. Minor loop present: "The morning the ferry vanished" followed immediately by "the ferry slipped between frequencies" restates the vanishing without new detail. One template-cadence run: "coiling rope," "calling for help," "chose arrival"—each beat uses a participial or simple verb stem without syntactic variety. The final image ("smiled, and prepared for the next voyage") lands cleanly. Figurative density is high ("crystalline walls catching starlight," "broadcast signal losing strength") but remains legible and voice-consistent. No major artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—ferry fractured across timelines, deckhand's route knowledge as solution—offers a fresh angle on the "vanishing in fog" trope. The empty hourglass that fills with starlight rather than sand is a memorable specific. Deduction for the fairly template convergence climax: using radio to align reflections and "merge timelines" hits familiar beats in portal-fantasy problem-solving. The woman's transparency mechanic and "two hundred and seventeen times" add specificity but also lean on stock multi-timeline tropes. Risk-taking is present (clocks running sideways, "permanent transient" as metaphysical state) without full transformation; the emotional and moral calculus remain somewhat abstract rather than grounded in lived particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus is present from the opening line, drives the radio solution in the middle, and makes the final "choose arrival" decision. His eleven years of ferry knowledge and positive nature enable the convergence. His choices create the key turn (calling to himself across timelines) and the closure (choosing arrival). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; minor deduction because the final choice feels asserted ("He chose arrival") rather than dramatized with visible micro-steps or tradeoff on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The hourglass appears in two distinct beats: discovered empty on the captain's desk (middle) and filling with starlight during convergence (near-end). Its emptiness is explained ("time here ran sideways. But patterns could") and its transformation charges the closure sequence. The object constrains Marcus's solution—he must fill it with patterns, not sand—and its warmth in his pocket at the end signals ongoing readiness. Strong closure linkage and irreplaceability; the exact mechanism of filling (starlight) could be slightly more tactile.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The vanishing commuter ferry is the inciting incident, drives every beat (Marcus must solve the fracture), and the ordinary 7:15 crossing frames both opening and closure. The concept shapes stakes (passengers lost, timelines split) and tactics (Marcus uses ferry route knowledge to merge them). The ending hinges on the ferry "completing its crossing"—without this concept, no story. Strong setup, development, and closure participation; high irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Resiliently positive" is claimed early ("Marcus was resiliently positive by nature, perhaps annoyingly so") and noted again at the crisis ("Even now, facing the impossible, he felt something like hope"). It enables his decision to act rather than panic, but the trait is told more than embodied—we don't see him wrestle with fear or make a visible tradeoff between optimism and caution. One functional beat (he radios with confidence) but no on-page cost or constraint tied to this exact trait. Mid-band for presence without deep integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Radio use appears in three beats: initial Mayday that reveals parallel timelines, the woman's instruction to "merge them," and Marcus's decisive call across versions of himself to align reflections. The action drives the major turn (convergence begins when he transmits patterns) and is indispensable—no other tool or method is available. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability; the story would fail without this exact action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The method is signaled early (grotto's "interconnected patterns," "reflections within reflections") and explained by the woman ("patterns connected like neurons, like shipping lanes"). Marcus applies it by transmitting route coordinates; "the crystalline walls resonated" and "reflections began to align." It shapes his tactics and enables the convergence. Minor deduction: the mechanics remain slightly abstract (how radio transmissions cause physical resonance) rather than concretely embodied. Strong development and closure participation; moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The grotto appears immediately after vanishing, dominates the middle (crystalline walls show patterns, luminous waters), and dissolves at closure when Marcus chooses arrival. It constrains choices: Marcus cannot leave until he solves the hourglass/pattern puzzle. The setting supplies resources (starlight, reflections) essential to the solution. Strong setup, development, and closure participation; high irreplaceability—the story hinges on this exact space.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Clocks run sideways" is introduced early (all timepieces show time moving "perpendicular") and explains why the hourglass is empty. It complicates the stakes (normal time doesn't apply) and primes the solution (patterns, not time, fill the hourglass). The timeframe reappears at closure when ordinary time resumes ("Morning light broke"). Moderate causal pressure and closure linkage; the sideways-time mechanic is elegant but functions more as premise than live constraint that alters Marcus's tactics beat-by-beat. Two-gate participation (setup, payoff) with purposeful reprise.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Marcus's goal—to merge timelines and free passengers—is established when the woman explains the loop and urges him to "end this." It drives his radio transmissions and the final choice to "choose arrival." The motivation is clear and goal-oriented, though internal friction (does he want to preserve the loop? fear losing the miracle?) is minimal. Strong development and closure participation; moderate cost visibility—his desire is stated but not deeply conflicted on the page. Two beats with closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Permanent transient" is declared late ("Marcus understood the tone of this place now") and explained: "They had always been arriving. They had always been departing." It charges the final choice (Marcus chooses arrival, ending the loop) and the closing image (hourglass "warm and waiting" suggests ongoing readiness). The tone modulates from wonder to resolution and coheres through the piece. Deduction for late explicit labeling rather than accumulation through image; the phrase is told more than felt. Purposeful reprise at closure with moderate charge.</comment>
