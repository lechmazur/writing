<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior is concrete and particular—"esoteric realist" is dramatized through her methodical building and refusal of easy naming. Embodied emotion lands in "She did not cry. She was not the crying kind. But she stayed," a renunciation choice with visible cost. The piece edges toward label-speak with "blushing stillness" and "verdant" recurring as adjectives rather than perception, but the final stance—keeping watch over absence—feels earned by her seventeen years of tending and her articulated philosophy.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (grotto, Mira, building) by the second paragraph. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through moth wing, monarch migration, and the structure's completion toward a cadence shift at closure. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mira stays, accepting that "silence was also answer," a stance crystallization that forecloses hope of a sign with felt cost ("the cadence would remain interrupted"). Cost is legible in the final image—the moth wing's flame extinguished by clouds—but the RR leans on atmosphere more than a visible trade-off, keeping it mid-high band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The grotto setting is vivid and selective: "green-filtered light," clouds shifting below, rose and amber evening. The moth wing (micro-object-as-setting) charges the final image, catching light "like a small blue flame." The structure itself—birch, grasses, spider silk—constrains Mira's method and supplies the closure beat's focal object. Environment pressure is light (grotto "holds itself quiet"), but the setting's metaphoric weight and closure participation push it into the 8-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: honoring overlooked extinction during the monarch collapse. The tightening is modest—Mira completes the structure, waits, nothing comes—meeting the Accumulative lens's requirement for one meaningful cadence shift. Agency is endurance with cost: she stays "transiently rooted" despite absence. No coincidence resolves; the piece withholds rescue. The cost (watching loss continue) is felt but not a high-stakes trade-off, capping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—interrupted cadence, absence as presence, honoring the overlooked—emerges from image and action without thesis statements. The moth wing (extinct species) nested in a structure for the dying monarchs creates resonance. The final image offers a non-literal answer: the blue flame held then extinguished, "blushing stillness" as the world's tender failure. No moralizing. The piece risks lushness ("verdant," "blush" recurring) but the conceptual architecture is clean and the ending reweights prior material with quiet authority.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close in paragraph 2's philosophy, pulled back for the grotto's "embarrassed" beauty). Perceptual signature is clear: Mira notices moth wings, knot mechanics, "transiently rooted" as self-concept. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("blushing stillness," "verdant") that reads slightly imposed rather than wholly voice-motivated, but rhythm and syntax remain controlled. No dialogue to judge. Minor lexical reach ("esoteric realist") is anchored quickly, keeping the piece in high 7s.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is lyric and purposeful, but "blushing stillness" and "verdant" recur as decorative adjectives rather than functional pressure ("blushing" appears three times, "verdant" twice, without evolving meaning). "Transiently rooted" is used twice in identical phrasing. Sentence openings vary well; rhythm modulates appropriately. Information density is high in the structure-building paragraphs. The figurative load is elevated but mostly coherent; "small blue flame" is precise. Template cadence and loops are absent. Slight overwriting and adjective recycling prevent entry to 8.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—esoteric realist building ephemeral signals in a cloud grotto during monarch extinction—is specific and non-obvious. The moth wing (Xerces blue, extinct eighty years) nested within the monarch timeline adds historical depth. Risk is present in the quiet, non-rescue ending and the embrace of "absence as presence." Execution avoids template emotional beats. The premise reads original within its lyric-ecological niche, though the grotto-as-liminal-space and watcher-of-extinctions roles have precedent in contemporary speculative fiction. Fresh inflection earns mid-7s; a bolder structural or conceptual leap would lift it higher.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira ("esoteric realist") is present throughout and her philosophy ("magic…follows rules…can be documented") shapes her method: methodical knot-tying, refusing to name creations, accepting silence as answer. Her choice to stay at the end is the closure beat. She appears early, drives two beats (building, waiting), and her trait enables the final stance. Swappability is low—her specific philosophy underwrites the acceptance of absence. Solid causal work and closure linkage push into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Moth wing (Xerces blue, extinct eighty years) is introduced mid-story, handled in two beats: unwrapping and positioning at the structure's center, then catching light in the final image as "a small blue flame." The reprise reweights meaning (one forgotten species memorializing another). Specificity is high—Xerces blue detail matters. Cost connection is oblique but present (honoring the overlooked). Late first appearance and lack of earlier constraint keep it below 8.0, but closure charge and irreplaceability earn high 7s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Interrupted cadence" is articulated explicitly mid-story ("some melodies simply stopped…You were left hanging in the space where completion should have lived") and shapes Mira's stakes—she honors endings without resolution. The concept reweights the final image (cadence remains interrupted, clouds close). Present in setup (implied), development (articulated), and payoff (enacted). The explicit naming reduces subtlety, but the concept drives the acceptance choice and charges closure. Solid integration across all three gates justifies mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Transiently rooted" appears twice as self-description (paragraph 1 and final paragraph) framing Mira's condition—she tends the grotto but does not possess permanence. The trait enables her acceptance that "the structure would stand for three days, perhaps four, before weather claimed it." It constrains her stance (she cannot offer permanence) and charges the closure posture. Lyric reprise without mid-scene constraint; label-only in both instances. Purposeful early–final framing and cost linkage (impermanence accepted) place it near 6.0, but lack of middle dramatization caps it there.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Knot" appears throughout as the action anchoring Mira's method: "each knot tied with intention," "Her fingers knotted another joint," "securing it with a final knot." The structure-building is the primary beat; the final knot completes the memorial and enables the waiting beat. The action is irreplaceable—swapping for "weave" or "bind" would lose the specificity of intention and joint-by-joint assembly. Present early, drives two beats (building, completion), shapes closure participation. High irreplaceability and beat involvement push it into high 7s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Building temporary structures as signals" is introduced in paragraph 3 and defines Mira's method for seventeen years; the current structure is this method enacted. It shapes the entire building sequence and the waiting beat (will the signal be received?). The ephemeral architecture enables the closure stance—accepting the signal may go unreceived. Present early, drives the dominant beat, and underwrites the final question. Specificity is high (birch, spider silk, doorway/cage form). Strong causal work and closure linkage; no visible cost tied uniquely to the method caps it at 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The "verdant grotto above the clouds" is named in paragraph 1, described throughout ("green-filtered light," "between earth and sky"), and supplies the spatial anchor for all action. The setting enables Mira's isolation and signals-between-worlds method; the clouds shifting and closing in the final beat supply the closure image's constraint (isolation renewed). Present early, affects method (grotto as signal-sending site), and charges the final image when clouds close over. Micro-setting function is moderate—grotto holds rather than pressures. Solid presence across all gates earns mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"During the migration of the last monarch butterfly" is introduced in paragraph 5 as "the timeframe that mattered"—population collapse complete, final generation flying south. The timeline anchors Mira's urgency (building during this window) and the stakes (memorial for one species during death of another). Time is not a ticking clock but a background constraint that reweights the structure's purpose and the absence in the final beat. Present early, shapes middle stakes (why now), and charges closure irony (monarchs flying below, unseen). Strong thematic integration; lack of tactical pressure keeps it at 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To honor overlooked histories" is stated explicitly in paragraph 9 ("This was why she did this work: to honor overlooked histories, to create markers for the passages no one else witnessed") and dramatized through moth wing selection (Xerces blue "overlooked in its dying, mourned by almost no one") and the final stance (keeping watch). The motivation drives both the building beat and the endurance choice at closure. Desire is conflicted only lightly (she accepts no response may come) but cost is visible (she stays despite absence). Strong closure linkage and irreplaceability; slight tell-heaviness and modest friction keep it below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Blushing stillness" is named three times (paragraph 4, final paragraph reprise, and as "that tender, embarrassed quiet" in the closing sentence) and defines the grotto's atmosphere. Tone modulates with pressure: quiet during building, charged when golden light pours through, subdued again at closure. The reprise in the final sentence reweights the tone as "a world that knows it is losing something precious but cannot seem to stop," charging the closure image. Coherent and purposeful, but the recycled adjective ("blushing") and static affect (always tender-quiet) limit score. Lyric reprise and closure charge earn low 6s.</comment>
