<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's professional discipline and method are established through concrete action (climbing, measuring, documenting). Her interior voice is consistent and purposefully filtered through investigative rigor—"truth emerged in stillness," the Webb patch moment, the final walk-back all anchor her priorities. The reflective passages about competent workers dying anyway and the irony of expertise are deeply specific to her role, though the final paragraphs risk edging toward essayistic closure rather than lived-in choice. Minor weakness: no on-page contradiction or mistake tests her method; she executes flawlessly, which flattens potential internal friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation is swift: who (Mira), where (port container maze), when (midnight survey, three nights post-accident). The investigative lens holds throughout, building from anemometer readings to the wind-funnel insight to the system critique. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "this time, someone would be watching"—her report will alter protocols, a conceptual cost (system indictment) made undeniable. The piece signals its accumulative/causal hybrid early and lands cleanly. One hairline slip: the final two paragraphs slightly over-articulate theme rather than letting the image speak, but cost and lens coherence remain intact.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is rendered with vivid, functional specificity: "corrugated steel walls rising forty feet… creating canyons that channeled and twisted the harbor wind." The setting constrains Mira's survey (ghost architecture, rearranged stacks, ladder climb), and the wind convergence at the accident site is the story's physical engine. The anemometer, drainage seam, and ladder are tactile anchors. Micro-setting (the patch wedged in corroded metal) charges the final beat. Sensory hierarchy follows POV: salt air, diesel, wind moan, pink dawn—all filtered through investigative attention. No wasted detail; every element pressures or illuminates.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding how Webb died and preventing recurrence—is signaled immediately and tightens through each measurement. The climb to the accident site is a single, decisive pressure point: Mira physically experiences the wind convergence that killed Webb, earning her systemic insight. The discovery of the flight engineer's patch deepens cost (his expertise didn't save him) and reweights her mission. Agency is clear: her documentation will alter stacking protocols. The resolution is Charged Poise—"someone would be watching"—with the conceptual price (indicting optimization culture) legible on the page. No false reversals; escalation is steady and purpose-driven.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—the failure of individual competence against systemic design flaws—emerges organically from the wind-funnel discovery and Webb's aviation patch. "The universe didn't reward foresight; it demanded it, and even then, sometimes, the variables conspired" is earned by the climb and the corroded seam. The final image (wind waiting for "the next singular convergence" / "this time, someone would be watching") reweights the entire investigation without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the ghost architecture metaphor and the contrast between Mira's precision and the port's "roaring metabolism." Minor slip: "translating chaos into data, data into change" risks thematic echo, though it stays rooted in her role. No false equivalence; the story indicts the system without hedging.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited, with a distinct perceptual signature: investigative, technical, alert to invisible forces. Diction stays consistent ("corrugated steel," "anemometer," "configuration logs," "statistical margin") without sliding into Wikipedia voice—every term serves her method. Rhythmic control modulates: short, crisp beats during the climb ("The wind hit her at the second tier, a sudden shove"), longer cadences in reflection. No dialogue; none needed. Free indirect style is clean. One slight weakness: the final two paragraphs compress reflection heavily, and "cultivation of foresight in action where intuition alone had failed" edges toward corporate register, though it's defensible as Mira's professional idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Line-level craft is precise and propulsive. Sentence variety supports rhythm: "The port fell silent at midnight, and that was when Mira Chen began her survey" establishes cadence; "At the top, standing where Marcus Webb had stood, she understood" delivers the turn cleanly. Information density is high—nearly every line advances investigation or insight. No paraphrase loops, no template stems. Figurative language is controlled: "temporary city of metal boxes," "invisible rivers," "roaring metabolism." The climb sequence is especially clean, with spatial choreography legible and no scaffold. Minor deduction: "hazy with exhaustion, but her notes were precise" leans slightly toward summary balance rather than embodied perception, and the final reflection risks over-articulation, but neither obscures closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The accident-investigator-as-wind-mapper premise is fresh and grounded in verifiable method. The container-labyrinth funnel effect feels researched and specific, not stock. The flight engineer's patch transforms the investigation from procedural to elegiac without sentimentality. The systemic critique (optimization without calculating invisible currents) is non-obvious and earned. Risks: extended reflection on competence versus fate, sustained technical voice under pressure. Minor limitation: the investigative frame itself—lone professional solving a puzzle through expertise—is familiar, though the wind-pattern angle and the specific irony (aviation mechanic killed by his old domain) lift it. Transformation test passes: swap Mira for a generic investigator and the emotional particulars dissolve.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's role as accident investigator is signaled immediately and drives every beat: midnight survey, anemometer readings, climbing to the accident site, documenting the patch, concluding the systemic flaw. Her decision to continue measurements after the discovery and to frame the report around wind sensors constitutes agency. The role is irreplaceable—only an investigator would walk ghost architecture, overlay logs, and translate wind into protocol change. Present in setup, middle (climb/insight), and closure (report framing). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The flight engineer's patch appears at the accident site (midpoint), anchors Webb's backstory (aviation mechanic downsized into port work), and charges Mira's reflection on expertise failing to save him. It functions in two beats: discovery and thematic reweighting. The patch itself does not constrain a later choice or return in the final image; its work is symbolic rather than tactical. Lyric reprise is absent. Setup is delayed (midpoint), development is present (reweights Webb's competence), but closure participation is weak. Scores in the functional-but-not-indispensable band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Singular convergence" is the story's engine: three wind channels meeting at a single point, the exact moment Webb straightened, gusts aligned. The concept shapes Mira's investigation (ghost architecture, configuration logs), drives the climb beat, and anchors the final image ("waiting for the next singular convergence" / "this time, someone would be watching"). Present in setup (accident framing), middle (physical experience of convergence), and closure (systemic prevention). Irreplaceable: the entire causal chain depends on this convergence insight. Strong pressure, specificity, and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Rapidly adapting" describes the port as "a living organism" whose container arrangements shift constantly. This trait complicates Mira's investigation—she walks "ghost architecture," measuring "currents that no longer quite existed." It imposes a constraint (she must use configuration logs) and elevates the difficulty of her work. Present in setup (paragraph 4), shapes middle tactics (ghost-map method), and implicitly underpins closure (her sensors will track future reconfigurations). The cost is modest but legible: her data reconstruct a vanished state. Functional across beats, though not foregrounded at closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The survey is Mira's through-action: anemometer at intersections, climbing the ladder, measuring wind pulses at the top, photographing the patch, continuing measurements until dawn. Every major turn traces to survey beats—the funnel insight, the patch discovery, the systemic conclusion. Present from the opening sentence, drives the entire middle, and anchors closure ("her tablet full of numbers"). Removing the survey collapses the investigation. The method is specific (anemometer, tablet, configuration overlay) and irreplaceable. Exceptional causal pressure and indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Documenting wind patterns between buildings" is Mira's core method, signaled in paragraph 2 and enacted throughout: anemometer readings, mapping currents, climbing to measure pulses. The method is specific and shapes every attempt—without wind data, she cannot diagnose the funnel effect or recommend sensors. Present in setup, drives the middle discovery, and frames closure (her report will install wind sensors at critical junctions). Irreplaceable: swap for generic evidence-gathering and the technical particularity dissolves. Strong mechanics, causal pressure, and closure relevance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The towering container labyrinth is indispensable. It creates the wind funnels that killed Webb, structures Mira's investigation (ghost architecture, ladder climb, corrugated steel canyons), and supplies the accident site as the story's spatial climax. Every beat depends on this setting: anemometer placement, the climb sequence, the convergence insight, the drainage seam hiding the patch. The setting is rendered with vivid specificity ("forty feet," "corroded drainage seam," "pink with dawn") and actively constrains choices (Mira must climb, the wind channels dictate measurement points). Present in setup, middle pressure, and closure image. Fully integrated.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"After the town goes silent" is adapted as "midnight" when "the port fell silent," framing Mira's survey window. The timeframe shapes tactics: she works at night when cranes stop and trucks idle, gaining access and stillness for wind measurement. The six-hour countdown ("the port would wake in six hours") and dawn arrival ("first gray light," "first trucks began to rumble") bookend the investigation and create urgency. Present in setup, subtly pressures middle (she must finish before operations resume), and anchors closure timing. Not a ticking-clock crisis, but a credible constraint that alters her method.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation—"to cultivate foresight in action where intuition alone had failed"—is dramatized through her survey work and her reflection on Webb's expertise not saving him. The desire to prevent future deaths drives her midnight effort, her meticulous documentation, and her conclusion that wind sensors and protocol changes are needed. Present in setup (truth emerges in stillness), tested in middle (the climb, the patch), and anchored at closure (her report "might cultivate foresight in action"). The phrasing in the final third risks label-speak, but the motivation is consistent and pressured. Cost: exhaustion, solitary night work, the weight of knowing prevention is probabilistic.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Hazy precision" is an apt descriptor and coherently executed: Mira's vision is "hazy with exhaustion" yet "her notes were precise." The tone blends forensic clarity (anemometer readouts, configuration logs, spatial measurements) with lyric melancholy (salt air, ghost architecture, the cruel irony of competence failing). Diction stays controlled and technical without coldness; reflection modulates without breaking investigative focus. The tone charges the final image: exhaustion plus determination, mourning plus systemic critique. Present throughout, modulates under pressure (climb urgency, patch discovery), and supports closure. Minor slip: the final paragraph edges toward essayistic summary, slightly loosening the hazy/precise tension.</comment>
