<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to preserve culture is consistently embodied through concrete actions—guiding tours, baking initial-bread, teaching patterns. Her interior life shows genuine complexity in the "rosewater dread" mixed with hope, and the decision to teach both Katya and the beekeeper's daughter carries visible cost (expanding exposure risk). The reflective passages anchor well in present stimuli (the lens, the thaw, the bread) and tilt present choices. Minor weakness: the internal contradiction could deepen further; her grief and duty feel harmonious rather than in friction at peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes an Accumulative lens—pressure builds through layered images (thaw, Tomasz's absence, the daughter's arrival) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. Orientation anchors (Mira, grotto, post-visit timeframe) land cleanly within the first 120 words. The arrival of the beekeeper's daughter produces a meaningful tightening: Mira gains a successor but accepts expanded risk, and the cost is legible in her choice to begin instruction. The final image (emerald lens beside warm bread, teaching to continue) reconfigures the stake from survival-in-hiding to active transmission with visible exposure cost. One hairline slip: the causal chain from Tomasz's death to the daughter's commitment could be slightly more pressured on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The grotto city behind the waterfall constrains choice effectively: the thaw thins concealment, raising exposure stakes; the secret passage enables contact; the clay oven and limestone bakery ground the bread custom. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through Mira's museum-guide lens (the "dripping halls," "slick passage," waterfall's "eternal song"). The emerald lens functions as micro-setting, reappearing to spot the daughter and later resting beside the bread in a charged final image. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves (museum corridors, bakery, passage descent). The setting supports both atmosphere and tactical constraint without postcard drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve culture under concealment—signals early and tightens once: the beekeeper's death removes supply and news, but his daughter's arrival offers succession at the cost of expanded exposure. The tightening is protagonist-driven (Mira's choice to teach the newcomer) and forecloses the path of passive waiting. The "three weeks since the beekeeper's last visit" and spring thaw create coherent pressure under the Accumulative lens. Cost is legible: teaching the daughter means revealing the community to another outsider. Minor gap: the antagonistic pressure (soldiers, the world that forgot them) remains abstract; a single on-page complication from the thaw (e.g., a near-sighting) would sharpen urgency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme—memory and transmission as resistance to erasure—emerges organically from the bread custom, museum artifacts, and Mira's teaching without thesis statements. The emerald lens and initial-bread recur with shifted meaning: first as relics of loss, finally as tools of continuity. The ending offers a non-literal answer: "The arts would not die—not while displaced hands still remembered how to press flour into meaning." The dread/hope tension remains unresolved but charged, and the final image (lens beside warm bread) reweights prior material with undeniable cost. Subtext operates cleanly in Mira's bodily gestures (clutching honey "like a relic") and the daughter's gaunt urgency. One minor note: "rosewater dread" as a phrase verges on decorative when not fully embodied in action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and intimate, filtering setting and event through Mira's museum-guide sensibility ("catalogued every artifact," "the color of memory"). Diction stays character-apt: cultured but not academic, elegiac without purple excess. The two brief dialogue exchanges feel natural and goal-driven, each advancing plot (Katya's question earns transmission; the daughter's whisper cements succession). Psychic distance shifts purposefully (zooming to the emerald lens view, pulling back for the waterfall's "eternal song"). Minor slip: "rosewater dread" and "rosewater left too long in the sun" repeat the metaphor stem, creating a small template echo. Filter verbs ("she feared," "understanding that") appear but remain voice-consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean, with varied sentence rhythm and high information density; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Figurative language is controlled: "tears the city itself was weeping," "flames took him," "waterfall's children" serve voice without stacking. Two localized artifacts lower the score: "rosewater" as a descriptor appears twice in similar stems ("rosewater dread," "like rosewater left too long"), creating a minor synonym loop; "she had catalogued," "she guided," "she taught" in adjacent paragraphs risk template cadence. The final paragraph's list structure ("cleaned the emerald lens and placed it... beside the bread... Tomorrow she would teach") approaches scaffolding but lands cleanly enough. No major opacity or causality break. Proofreading is solid.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The grotto-behind-waterfall premise and the initial-bread custom offer specific, non-generic cultural preservation tactics that feel earned and integral. The emerald opera-glass lens (missing one lens, carried through displacement) is a vivid, character-particular object. The turn—grief over Tomasz's death reweighted as succession through his daughter—grows from established material and avoids convenience. Modest deduction: the "displaced persons in hidden city" frame echoes familiar exile narratives without a bold structural or moral twist; the resolution (teaching continues, new ally recruited) is warm and hopeful but does not risk a darker or more ambiguous stance. The piece commits fully to its premise and executes at a high level within that frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's role as museum guide constrains and enables throughout: she catalogues artifacts (setup), teaches children the old patterns (middle development), and decides to educate Katya and the beekeeper's daughter (closure participation). Her choices—baking the "T" for Tomasz, descending to meet the daughter, beginning instruction—create key turns. The trait is causally active and irreplaceable; removing "museum guide" would erase her access to the community's memory and her authority to teach. Cost: teaching the newcomer expands exposure risk. Early signal, three-beat involvement, closure linkage, visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The emerald lens appears in three beats: peering through it at the forest (setup/middle), spotting the daughter (middle complication), and resting in its velvet case beside the bread (closure image). It carries heirloom weight and enables the sighting that drives the daughter's arrival. The final reprise reweights it from tool-of-vigilance to relic-beside-transmission-symbol. Deduction: the lens does not constrain a choice under pressure; Mira could spot the daughter without it, and its presence in the closure image is atmospheric rather than causally decisive. Two-gate plus lyric reprise, but swappability and lack of direct causal pressure limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Displacement shapes every stake and tactic on the page: the grotto city exists because of exile; concealment drives the worry over thaw; the museum and bread custom are responses to cultural erasure. The concept is causally active in multiple beats—Tomasz's covert visits, the secret passage, Mira's teaching, the fear of soldiers—and charges the ending (teaching will continue despite displacement). Visible cost: the community remains in exile, and accepting the daughter increases exposure. Early setup, sustained middle pressure, closure participation with conceptual cost. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Historically oriented" is signaled early (museum guide, artifact cataloging) and constrains on-page action: Mira's flashback to her father and the village burning informs her urgency to teach; her knowledge of "homeland they had never seen" enables her pedagogy; her nightly bread ritual enacts historical memory. The trait enables her authority and shapes her tactics (teaching patterns, baking initials). Minor deduction: the attribute does not force a visible tradeoff or cost at closure; it is foundational but not tested under pressure. Two-gate involvement, causal enablement, but limited felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The thaw is introduced early, signals exposure risk (ice thinning, "curtain... revealing glimpses"), and creates ambient pressure throughout. It does not produce a discrete on-page reversal or force a single pivotal choice; instead it functions as a timer that raises stakes and motivates Mira's vigilance. The daughter's arrival is the major turn, and the thaw enables but does not directly cause it. The element is causally linked to the dominant stake and appears in the closure reflection ("the thaw revealing and concealing in equal measure"), but it remains atmospheric rather than action-decisive. Two-gate plus closure mention, causal shaping without a discrete turn, moderate specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The bread custom is signaled early (Mira's nightly baking), demonstrated on the page with Katya watching (middle beat), and enacted at closure when Mira bakes the "T" for Tomasz and shares it with the newcomer, beginning her education. The custom is irreplaceable: it embodies the story's theme (memory consumed to live inside the body), constrains Mira's routine, and provides the vehicle for teaching succession. Visible cost: Mira extends the ritual to an outsider, expanding the circle of knowledge. Three-gate involvement, high specificity, closure participation with thematic and social cost. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The grotto setting supplies multiple constraints: the waterfall conceals but the thaw thins protection; the secret passage enables covert contact; the limestone bakery and clay oven ground the bread custom; the damp corridors house the museum. The setting pressures choices (vigilance through the lens, descent to meet the daughter) and charges the final image ("grotto city breathed in its eternal twilight"). It is irreplaceable—removing the waterfall-grotto would require total reconception. Early signal, sustained middle involvement, closure participation. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the beekeeper's last visit" is signaled early and tracked: "three weeks since" creates a ticking absence that sharpens Mira's dread. The arrival of the daughter at an unspecified later moment resolves the suspense. The timeframe enables the setup tension but does not tighten decisions on the page; Mira's actions (baking, teaching, watching) continue without time-driven escalation. It appears in the closure reflection ("That night") but does not constrain the final choice. One-gate plus atmospheric middle use, moderate causal shaping, no live clock that alters tactics. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to "rescue dying arts" is dramatized throughout: guiding children, teaching egg-painting and embroidery, baking initial-bread, and finally choosing to teach both Katya and the newcomer. The desire is tested by scarcity (Tomasz's death) and risk (expanding exposure), and the ending choice enacts it with visible cost. The motivation is causally active, shapes multiple beats, and anchors the closure. Early signal, sustained middle friction (dread vs. duty), closure participation with cost. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The tone "rosewater dread" is named on the page and embodied in Mira's contradictory feelings: fear for Tomasz, hope at the daughter's arrival, the bittersweet act of baking the "T." The prose sustains a melancholic, elegiac register throughout, modulating subtly (vigilance, grief, cautious hope). The final image holds the dread ("remained, delicate as rosewater") alongside warm bread, charging the closure. Minor deduction: the phrase "rosewater dread" is slightly ornamental and repeated, and the tone is more consistent than dynamically modulated under pressure. Two-gate plus closure reprise, coherent but static, moderate charge. Solid integration.</comment>
