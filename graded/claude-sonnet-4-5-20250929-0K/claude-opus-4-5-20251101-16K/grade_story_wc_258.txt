<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera's motivation to understand her grandmother's system is clear and drives her present actions, but her interior life remains abstract; we see her "steadily curious" but not contradictory impulses acting in scene. Marcus is functionally present to receive exposition rather than applying independent pressure. TheCards and measuring tape operate more as atmospheric props than constraints that force Vera into difficult micro-choices with visible cost. Interior life skews toward explaining the inherited system rather than embodying present emotional stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly and maintains causal coherence throughout. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing under an Accumulative lens: Vera adds her own notation to the measuring tape, continuing the work of mapping cultural patterns with the implicit cost of accepting an incomplete, inherited mystery. However, the final image reweights prior material only gently; the cost is implied (solitary labor, indefinite unraveling) rather than made undeniable on the page. The story teaches its reflective, encyclopedic mode early but never tightens meaningfully—Vera's stance at the end is functionally identical to her stance at the opening, and Marcus's departure changes nothing about her situation or knowledge state.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight, onyx ink, and measuring tape are vivid and atmospheric, establishing a coherent post-crash artists' loft. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Vera's professional lens (the ink "drinks" light, the tape marked with cultural events). However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—Vera could conduct this exact conversation anywhere. The micro-setting (cards, tape, skylight) charges the final image tonally but does not pressure the closure decision, capping the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding the grandmother's methodology—is signaled early but remains static throughout. Marcus's question ("Can it be reverse engineered?") could provide a tightening, but Vera's answer ("That's what I'm trying to do") simply restates her existing project without narrowing options or raising cost. No live alternative is foreclosed; Vera ends where she began, adding one notation in identical work. The piece accumulates texture (cards, tape, conversation) but never forces a trade-off or demonstrates visible price paid for this specific session. Under an Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening or cadence shift that reweights the stake is required; here the density remains constant and the closure beat is indistinguishable from prior moves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme (collective behavior as engineered trap, mapping cultural folly) emerges clearly from the grandmother's measuring tape and Vera's explanations. The cards and crash provide concrete anchors, avoiding pure abstraction. However, the piece leans toward expository articulation of theme rather than dramatizing it through specific conflict: Vera *tells* Marcus about narrowed paths and cultural currents instead of experiencing a trap herself on the page. The final image—Vera adding a notation—offers quiet continuity but no non-literal reweighting; it confirms the premise rather than complicating it. Thematic statements ("the culture could not see about itself") border on summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice is controlled, literary, and consistent throughout, with a distinct perceptual signature (onyx ink "drinking" luminescence, the skylight making "music" of rain). Dialogue between Vera and Marcus is naturalistic and carries subtext (Marcus seeking meaning beyond mechanics, Vera confiding rather than lecturing). However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that sits uneasily with Vera's present-tense interiority ("the architecture of possibility," "multiplying paths")—these feel more like thematic semaphore than her working vocabulary under pressure. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Psychic distance remains stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is polished with strong imagery (rain-beaded skylight, onyx ink, cards that "drink" light) and varied sentence rhythm. Information density is high in descriptive passages. However, template cadence appears in the middle section: "She traced...," "The cards revealed...," "Marcus was quiet...," "Vera considered..." cluster into a predictable stem pattern that flattens momentum during the reading. Minor paraphrase loop: "steadily curious" appears twice in identical phrasing (opening and near-close). No major artifacts touch the closure beat, limiting deduction. Figurative language is coherent and purpose-driven; no mixed metaphors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The onyx-ink cartomancer and post-crash setting offer a fresh combination, and the measuring tape marked with cultural events is a specific, memorable detail. However, the core emotional arc (inheritor decoding a predecessor's mysterious work, offering wisdom to a seeker) follows a familiar template without transformation. Vera's grandmother could be swapped for any mentor figure; the crypto crash for any collective trauma. The piece resists deeper risk: Vera's conviction never wavers, Marcus accepts her frame without friction, and the ending reaffirms the premise rather than testing it. Specificity in setting and object does not fully compensate for conventional character dynamics and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Vera gathers cards, lays spreads, and adds a notation at the end—three distinct beats. However, her actions are explanatory rather than consequential: she demonstrates her inherited method to Marcus without altering her own tactics or facing a choice that changes options. The notation at the end is continuity, not decision. She observes and explains; her role is docent. Removing her agency would break narration but not plot logic or closure, since the ending reaffirms her opening stance. Present and functional but not decisively causal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The measuring tape appears in three beats: initial description (marked with dates/events), Vera's finger-trace explanation to Marcus, and the final notation she adds. It carries specific mechanics (dates as densities of possibility) that shape the thematic frame. However, it never constrains a choice or alters tactics on the page—Vera could conduct this session without consulting it. The final reprise (adding a notation) charges the closure image tonally but does not reweigh prior stakes; it confirms ongoing work. Two-gate presence (setup, payoff) with strong specificity but no middle causal pressure. Lyric-resonance allowance applies; score lands in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Reverse engineering" is named explicitly when Marcus asks if the crash can be traced backward, and Vera confirms she is attempting to decode her grandmother's methodology. The concept shapes the dominant stake and appears in both setup and closure (Vera continues the work of "reverse engineering" the system). However, it remains thematic and expository; no on-page action demonstrates the mechanics of reverse engineering altering a tactic or narrowing an option. The concept is present and coherent but not dramatized as a method under pressure. One key turn (Marcus's question) links to it. Mid-range.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Steadily curious" is stated twice in identical phrasing (opening and near-end) and describes Vera's general posture toward the inherited mystery. It does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost; patience and curiosity are her consistent mode rather than a trait in friction with another impulse. Label-only use without dramatized trade-off. Present but ornamental; could be replaced with "diligent" or "methodical" with no structural change. Below functional band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Vera confides her mapping project to Marcus early in the scene, and this confession frames his follow-up question about reverse engineering. The act of confiding establishes intimacy and justifies the ensuing explanation. However, the confiding itself could be swapped for "explained" or "shared" with minimal narrative impact—it is tone-setting rather than a turn that redefines options. Present in setup and linked to one key beat (Marcus's question), but the action's specificity (confiding vs. explaining) does not leverage unique properties. Functional, one-beat involvement, some closure echo (she continues the work she confided). Upper-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Multiplying paths" is articulated by Vera when explaining her grandmother's theory: "Every cultural moment creates new possibilities." The method is signaled in setup and echoed in the final sentence ("the post-crash city breathed its quiet recovery, multiplying new paths"). However, the mechanics never shape an on-page attempt or alter tactics; it remains a thematic claim rather than a dramatized process. Lyric bookend (first third → last line) that reweights the stake conceptually but without middle causal work. Lyric-resonance allowance applies; score lands just above functional.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft is vividly established in the opening line and provides atmospheric coherence throughout (rain continues, light fragments, Marcus drips water). It anchors location and tone but never pressures a choice or supplies a resource that affects outcome. Vera could conduct this reading in any room; the skylight is postcard detail. Present in setup and mentioned at closure (skylight makes music of rain) but ornamental. No middle development or causal role. Introduced early but fails middle and causal gates; cap 4.6 per missing-development rule.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The cryptocurrency crash is established as backdrop (happened three years ago, transformed the neighborhood) and motivates Marcus's presence (he lost everything, seeks meaning). However, the timeframe itself does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page—Vera's work is ongoing and the scene is undated within the post-crash present. Time does not create urgency or alter moves. The crash is setup context for Marcus's motivation but does not participate in closure or constrain middle action. One-gate presence (setup only); replaceable with any collective trauma. Cap 3.8 per swappability.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Vera's desire to map cultural patterns is stated early, demonstrated through her study of the measuring tape and charts, and reaffirmed at closure when she adds a new notation. The motivation is coherent and drives her ongoing project. However, it is never conflicted or tested—no friction between this want and a competing cost appears on the page. She pursues it without obstacle or trade-off; the scene is continuity rather than choice. Two gates (setup, payoff) with thematic presence but no dramatized friction. Lyric-resonance allowance and ongoing-project framing allow mid-6s, but lack of visible cost and internal conflict limit upside.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Tone of "inherited mystery" is established immediately (grandmother's cards and measuring tape, reverse-engineering the system) and sustained throughout. The prose modulates subtly: intimate during Vera's confiding, clinical during the card reading, reflective at closure. The final image (Vera adding a notation, continuing the unraveling) charges the mystery with quiet perseverance rather than resolution, which coheres with the inherited-work premise. However, tone remains relatively static—curiosity and patience dominate without significant pressure modulation. Two gates (setup, payoff) with coherent modulation and closure linkage; no middle intensification. Upper-mid band.</comment>
