<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior landscape is vivid and her motivation is grounded in specific trauma (the Eastbridge collapse), but the story operates primarily in reflection and summary mode. The crisis-actor detail is present but never constrains a choice—she walks, whispers, and considers the chessboard without facing a decision that tests her drive or its cost. The final gesture of picking up the queen and setting it down again is observed rather than transformative; no internal contradiction acts in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when early and establishes a clear thematic stake (preserving forgotten gestures), but operates as Accumulative/Textural without a decisive closure unit. The interregnum frame and the gallery circuit structure the narrative, yet the ending—"she would keep walking their names"—reaffirms the opening stance without visible cost or tightening; it's a statement of ongoing intent rather than a Resonant Reconfiguration or Conceptual Repricing that reconfigures options. The Cost proof test fails: no on-page sentence at closure shows a foreclosed path or felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The whispering gallery is rendered with strong sensory detail ("nomadic penumbra," acoustic mechanics, the marble bench, shifting light), and the chessboard anchors space. The gallery's acoustic properties motivate Mira's walking pattern, constraining how she performs her ritual. Micro-setting (body and object) charges the final image when she picks up the queen, meeting the 9+ gate test and lifting the score above mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving small gestures—is clear and signaled early, but pressure remains static. Mira's ritual of walking and whispering is established in the opening third and continues unchanged; no reversal or tightening alters her options. The interregnum context and the chessboard's absence of pawns supply thematic resonance but don't force a decision or escalate cost. The story fits an Accumulative lens but lacks the meaningful deepening required for higher scores.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the chessboard metaphor, the whispering gallery's acoustics, and Mira's crisis-actor backstory. The interregnum frame and "luminous absence" work together to explore memory and erasure without overt moralizing. The final image—pawns gone, walls remembering—offers a resonant answer to the central question, though the ending restates intent rather than reweighting prior material with new pressure. The benevolently ruthless attribute and the unbind concept enrich thematic texture without forcing closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, literary, and controlled throughout; diction matches the reflective, memorial mode. The prose carries a distinct perceptual signature—"nomadic penumbra," "layers of luminous absence"—that fits Mira's role as historian of small gestures. Single-POV focalization is clean with no head-hopping. Psychic distance is stable and appropriate for the accumulative design. The lack of dialogue is not a penalty under the Global Dialogue Policy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The prose is polished and rhythmically varied, with high information density in many lines ("the acoustics held only Mira's whispered names"). However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "Neither fully in the light of official history nor entirely in the shadow of forgetting" restates the penumbra concept already established; "The pawns were still gone. The pawns would always be gone" is a loop that dulls the closure beat. Template-cadence runs in the whispered-name beats and elevated diction ("unbind," "nomadic penumbra") slightly drift from grounded interiority. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase and template artifacts touching closure (per Q7 artifact pack), plus −0.2 for register drift under pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of crisis actor, real trauma survivor, and historian of small gestures is fresh and non-obvious. The chessboard-as-memorial and the whispering gallery's acoustic mechanics offer specific, earned metaphors. The interregnum frame sharpens the theme of historical erasure. The piece commits fully to its lyric, reflective mode and avoids stock metaphors. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative, reflection-dominant) heightens thematic stakes without obscuring clarity, though the lack of a decisive turn or visible cost at closure prevents the highest band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira's dual identity as crisis actor and real survivor is seeded early and informs her motivation, but it does not constrain or enable a key on-page choice. The backstory enriches interiority yet remains exposition; no decision in the present turns on this tension. She walks, whispers, and reflects without the crisis-actor skill altering tactics or cost. Present in setup and development (thematic), absent from causal closure participation: cap at ~4.6 per missing-closure-participation; the causal thinness lowers further to 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The chessboard appears early and recurs in two distinct beats: the opening description and the final handling of the queen. Its absence of pawns seeds the theme and the final gesture—picking up and setting down the queen—charges the closing image. It does not, however, narrow options or drive a decision; its role is symbolic and thematic rather than causally active. Present across all three gates with thematic reprise and closure linkage, eligible for mid-6s; lyric resonance and specificity lift to 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Nomadic penumbra" is introduced early, described richly, and reprised at closure ("this nomadic penumbra"). It shapes tone and setting but does not change Mira's options or tactics; the phrase functions as atmospheric motif rather than causal force. The concept charges the final image through its thematic layering. Present in setup and closure with strong lyric reprise; the causal absence caps at ~6.3, but the abstract nature of the concept (a metaphor for Mira's positioning rather than a concrete stake) lowers to 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Benevolently ruthless" is named once in the text and illustrated by Mira's method of pressing survivors for painful details. It informs her approach but does not constrain an on-page choice or create visible cost in the present action. The trait is told and supported by summary backstory rather than tested in scene. Setup present, development implied via backstory, closure absent: cap at ~4.6; the label-only treatment and lack of present trade-off hold it at 4.7.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Unbind" appears as Mira's stated mission ("to unbind these small gestures from obscurity") and structures her walking ritual, but the action itself is not dramatized with visible resistance or cost. She walks, whispers names, and completes her circuit without friction. The verb frames intent but does not create a turn or redefine options. Present across beats thematically; the lack of on-page constraint or opposition lowers causal weight to 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The walking pattern that spells words is introduced early ("Seventeen steps north for M…"), used in the middle beat to spell names, and referenced at closure ("Her footsteps spelled REMEMBER"). It shapes Mira's method and charges the final image, though the mechanics remain largely described rather than tested under pressure. Present in all three gates with specific detail and closure reprise; the lack of constraint or complication caps higher scores, landing at 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The whispering gallery is anchored early, its acoustic properties motivate Mira's walking ritual, and it supplies the spatial constraint for her pattern-spelling. The setting recurs across beats (opening, middle circuit, final image) and the nomadic-penumbra light shift deepens atmosphere. The gallery's unique mechanics are essential to the method and shape the final image. All three gates met with strong causal and atmospheric pressure; irreplaceability and closure linkage push to 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The interregnum is named early, frames the context (old king dead, new one not yet crowned), and sets the temporal boundary for Mira's ritual. It provides thematic urgency—"words traveled strangely, freed from their usual paths"—but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock that alters Mira's choices. Present in setup and thematic development; the lack of tactical pressure and the closure's future-tense promise ("Tomorrow the new king would be crowned") weaken immediacy, capping at 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Mira's desire to become "the historian of small gestures" is stated early, illustrated through her walking ritual and her past of pressing survivors, and reaffirmed at closure. The motivation informs every beat but is never conflicted or tested by a competing want; she walks, completes the circuit, and promises to continue. Present in all three gates; the lack of on-page friction or cost in the present choice holds it at 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Luminous absence" appears late (final third) as a descriptor for the evening light and then charges the ending: "layers of luminous absence: light withdrawing but somehow leaving brightness behind, the way the dead leave silences that speak louder than presence." The tone is coherent and modulates with the interregnum's liminality, supporting the accumulative design. Late setup (−0.3) but strong closure linkage and thematic irreplaceability; the phrase reweights the memorial theme and earns 6.9.</comment>
