<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The oracle's interiority is concrete and distinct—her obsession with endings manifests through embodied action (handling the booklet carefully, watching the star's pulse). Her motivation to map darkness through absence is character-particular and internally consistent. The piece lacks a second on-page character for relationship pressure, but the solo focalization remains coherent. Minor deduction: the "mildly obsessed" framing feels slightly meta-observational rather than fully interior, though it doesn't break the texture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly within the opening. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure accumulates through density (three winters of dimming, soldiers' resigned silence, the star's pulse) and the final paragraph delivers Charged Poise—the oracle bent over her work as the star trembles, reweighting her project from documentation to testament with undeniable conceptual cost (witnessing becomes the only remaining agency). Cost is legible: "Not a guide to safety, but a testament." One meaningful deepening through the shift from mapmaking-as-navigation to mapmaking-as-witness satisfies the length requirement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ridge fort constrains choice (soldiers trapped, oracle isolated in the highest chamber) and the storm's assault modulates pressure throughout. The booklet functions as micro-setting, its flaking texture constraining her method and charging the final image ("careful, so careful"). Sensory detail is purposeful: wind screaming, shutters rattling, pages brittle as winter leaves. Spatial choreography remains clear (highest chamber, soldiers below, narrow window). The ancient stone's refusal to break mirrors the oracle's stance, charging the closure without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: to map the endless night before the last star fails. The piece tightens through accumulation—from three winters ago to "one star" to the star's final pulse—narrowing her window and reweighting her purpose from navigation to testament. The escalation is textural rather than causal, deepening through repeated silences and the revelation that her work proves witnessing itself. Cost is felt in her patience, her careful handling of disintegrating materials, and the acceptance that her map will not save but only testify. Agency manifests as endurance under constraint (Earned Stasis).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the oracle's tactile work: silence as substance, absence as geography, witnessing as purpose when action fails. The closing image—"the pebble-shore oracle breathed with the rhythm of deepening silence, and kept drawing"—offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. The piece resists false hope while honoring the human impulse to record. The booklet's flaking gold becomes a motif that constrains choice and charges closure. Subtext operates in the soldiers' stopped questions and the oracle's refusal to fight the dying light.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. The narrator's perceptual signature is selective and oracle-specific: she reads gaps, pauses, silences. Diction stays controlled—"ambered hush," "marbled hush," "palimpsest of brightness"—elevating without breaking the established register. Sentence rhythm modulates purposefully, slowing during reflection ("She had been a child...") and tightening at the star's pulse. No dialogue to evaluate. Minor slip: "mildly obsessed" reads slightly authorial rather than fully character-filtered, a fleeting register shift that doesn't materially harm voice coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere, character stance, or stakes. Rhythm varies naturally with purpose. Minor loop detected: "She did not fight the dying of the light. She simply tried to remember it" followed shortly by rephrased themes about non-resistance. The phrase "marbled hush" and "ambered hush" appear close together without clear differentiation, risking decorative texture. No major clarity breaks, but the accumulation of elevated descriptors ("constellation's worth," "palimpsest of brightness," "tide shaping shore") approaches density without full payoff in every instance. Apply −0.4 for minor loops and figurative proximity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise—oracle mapping a dying sky through flaking gold—offers a fresh angle on apocalypse narratives by focusing on witnessing rather than survival. The transformation of cartography into testament is specific and earned. The pebble-shore training (reading gaps between waves) provides character-particular grounding. Risk: the lyric-heavy style and static situation could flatten in lesser hands, but here the accumulation sustains pressure. Minor deduction: the "ancient stone refusing to break" metaphor and storm-as-chaos framing edge toward familiar apocalypse imagery without full transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The oracle is present throughout and her choices (turning pages carefully, beginning a new section, continuing to draw) drive the narrative's accumulative pressure. She appears early, her work shapes every beat, and her endurance charges the closure. Cost is visible in her meticulous care and acceptance that her map is testament, not guide. Slight cap: most moves are contemplative rather than sharply decisive; the story privileges witnessing over action, which fits the design but limits causal urgency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The booklet appears early, is handled in multiple beats (she turns pages, fills it with absence, uses flaking patterns as coordinates, shows it to soldiers, begins a new section), and its fragility constrains her method throughout. It returns with reweighted meaning in the final paragraph as the instrument of her testament. Cost is tied to its disintegration—every touch causes more flaking, yet she persists. Strong integration; approaches indispensable but stops short of full closure dependence since the mapping concept could theoretically survive without this exact object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Ambered hush" appears explicitly once and "marbled hush" once, both as atmospheric description rather than causal constraint. The concept of preserved, thickened silence shapes tone and the oracle's method (tracing variations in night's geography), but it does not narrow her options or alter her tactics on the page. The hush charges the final image subtly, elevating it from mid-band. Two-gate participation (setup via "ambered hush" phrase, payoff in closure atmosphere) with thematic but not causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Mildly obsessed" is declared early and manifests on-page through her repetitive, patient work and her focus on endings. It enables her endurance (she keeps drawing despite futility) and constrains her social engagement (soldiers stop asking). The trait is embodied in her meticulous page-turning and commitment to the impossible map. Cost is visible in her isolation and the acceptance of a project that will not save anyone. All three gates met; causal pressure moderate—the obsession explains her stance but does not create sharp turning choices.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Retell" appears once when soldiers climb to her chamber and she shows them the booklet; they begin to perceive shapes within absence. This beat demonstrates her method and its effect on others, adding depth to her role. However, the action does not create a major turn or redefine options—it illustrates rather than pivots. Setup and development present; closure linkage weak. Swappable with "share" or "reveal" without structural loss. Mid-band: functional but not essential.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The method is signaled early ("by summarizing silence, by distilling the quiet") and demonstrated repeatedly: she reads gaps between waves, traces variations in night's geography through flaking patterns, uses absence rather than ink. It shapes her attempts throughout and informs the closure image where she works "with the patience of tide shaping shore." The method is character-specific and constrains her approach (she cannot fight the dimming, only map it). Cost: the method requires fragile materials and yields only testament, not solution. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ridge fort is established early and provides spatial constraint (highest chamber, soldiers below) and atmospheric pressure (storm assault, ancient stone). It affects the oracle's isolation and shapes the soldiers' inability to leave. The fort's endurance mirrors her stance ("built by people who understood that some things must stand against chaos"). Present in setup and development; contributes to closure atmosphere but does not decisively alter the final image. Solid integration with thematic resonance; stops short of indispensable because the core mapmaking could survive relocation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The timeframe is signaled immediately ("three winters ago... Now") and the single remaining star creates urgent pressure throughout. The star's pulse is tracked repeatedly, tightening the oracle's window and reweighting her purpose from navigation to witness. Time constrains her choices (she begins "a new section" marking the final star's position) and charges the closure ("When the star finally went out—and it would"). The dimming progression (constellation → one star → imminent extinction) drives escalation. Cost is undeniable: her work must finish before darkness becomes total. All three gates strongly met.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation to map the endless night is declared early and dramatized through her patient work, her handling of the booklet, and her acceptance of futility with purpose. Friction appears in the gap between the soldiers' desire for answers and her refusal to provide comfort; her map is "not a guide to safety, but a testament." The motivation shapes every beat and charges the closure where she "kept drawing" despite the star's imminent failure. Cost is visible in her isolation, the booklet's disintegration, and the acceptance that her work will not save. Strong integration; slightly short of indispensable because the witnessing theme could theoretically operate without the exact cartographic frame.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tone is established early through "ambered hush" and "marbled hush," maintained through elevated, lyric diction, and modulated purposefully (the storm's violence against the oracle's patience). Coherent throughout with cadence shifts that mirror pressure—longer reflective passages during backstory, tighter phrases during the star's pulse. The tone charges the final image ("breathed with the rhythm of deepening silence") and supports the accumulative lens. Strong thematic fit; not quite indispensable because a slightly different tonal register (e.g., starker realism) could deliver similar thematic weight, though with loss of this specific resonance.</comment>
