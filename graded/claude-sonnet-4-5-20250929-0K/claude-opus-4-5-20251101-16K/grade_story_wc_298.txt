<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is embodied through concrete choices—pressing the card to bark, offering her future—with internal contradiction between guilt and agency. The "reckless idealist" frame grounds her actions consistently. Vesna remains somewhat thin, serving primarily as obstacle. The final transformation feels earned by prior setup, though Elias himself remains off-page, limiting relational crucible work.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: the burned card becoming whole with two figures walking together is a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the sacrifice premise with visible cost (Mira's future merged with Elias's consumed one). Drive lens reads as Causal with symbolic texture: descent → negotiation refusal → trade offer → transformation. Orientation anchors quickly (catacomb, Mira, lantern, three-year hunt). One meaningful tightening when Mira shifts from retrieval to fusion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vividly specific—tree swallowing sarcophagus, roots threading ribs—and directly enables the climactic choice (tree as witness/conduit for the trade). Sensory details (half-light, bone shadows, bark texture) filter through Mira's purposeful descent. The underground setting constrains the encounter spatially and thematically charges the exchange with death-as-witness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—reclaiming brother's destiny—signals early and tightens when Mira rejects simple retrieval for fusion. The agency shift from "I want his destiny back" to "I'm trading for it" narrows options with visible cost (her unlived future). Vesna's fear during the transformation adds pressure. The lack of on-page resistance or complication before acceptance keeps escalation modest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of sacrifice transmuted into shared purpose emerges through concrete particulars: the burned card's restoration, roots moving as witnesses, "purpose built from choosing each other." The final image—two figures at crossroads instead of one—answers the opening question without moralizing. "Patched together from sacrifice and stubbornness" integrates the motif of mending fate without abstraction. Minor slip: "reckless idealist" label edges toward prompt-echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited to Mira with consistent perceptual signature (half-light, careful noticing, three-year pattern-reading). Dialogue is sparse but functional; Vesna's lines carry goal and threat. "Fiercely gentle" and "dusky resolve" tilt toward elevated register but remain voice-coherent. Free indirect style is clean. One brief filter stack ("felt like mercy") in backstory doesn't harm momentum.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean with strong imagery (bark rippling around angels, bone shadows into lace). Rhythm varies appropriately. Minor template stems: "She had come" repeated in close succession creates slight echo. "Trammeled destinies with silver wire and starlight" ornaments without obscuring. Information density is high in the trade sequence. No loops or scaffolding that obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The bartered-destinies premise and catacomb marketplace are fresh inflections on fate-trading tropes. Mira's choice to forge a shared destiny rather than restore the original transforms the retrieval arc. The tree-as-witness detail and tarot-card-made-whole image feel specific. Vesna fleeing "somewhere during the transformation" is a convenient exit. The emotional calculus—choosing fusion over individual futures—offers non-obvious synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira as "reckless idealist" is signaled early, drives the descent and refusal to negotiate, and culminates in the trade offer that fuses futures—a choice with visible cost that alters the ending. Present across setup, middle negotiation, and climactic transformation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The burned tarot card appears in pocket early, is pressed to bark at the climax to initiate the trade, and returns whole in the final image with reweighted meaning (one figure becomes two). Three distinct beats with causal pressure and closure linkage; its transformation is the visual proof of success.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Bartered destinies frame the entire stake: Elias traded his, Vesna consumed it, Mira offers hers. The concept shapes negotiation tactics (can't be returned/can be reforged) and the transformation itself creates "something new" from the wreckage. Central to setup, conflict, and resolution.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Fiercely gentle" appears once as "fiercely gentle—the kind of gentleness that precedes necessary violence" but doesn't constrain a subsequent action with visible cost; the confrontation proceeds through trade logic rather than demonstrating this attribute in embodied choice. Mentioned, not dramatized under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Trammel" appears twice: Mira learned trader methods (how they trammel with silver wire/starlight) and Vesna warns "You can't trammel what's already been spent," to which Mira replies she's trading, not trammeling. The term signals the method and Mira's deviation from it, but the actual transformation bypasses trammeling—she trades instead. Shapes one beat but is then explicitly rejected.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Inlaying meaning everywhere" is described retrospectively as Mira's three-year hunt method ("reading significance in every chance encounter") but doesn't appear in on-page action or constrain present choices. Summary-only; no mechanics shown during the catacomb encounter.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Catacomb orchard is established early with vivid specificity (tree roots threading ribs, bark swallowing sarcophagus), directly enables the climactic trade (tree as conduit, roots moving as witnesses), and charges the final ascent. Setting pressure is undeniable: the place itself validates and enacts the exchange. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Half-lit corridors" establishes atmosphere but doesn't create time pressure or a ticking clock. The descent and encounter unfold without urgency or deadline; Mira has already spent three years. Present as sensory detail, not as temporal constraint on tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Patch holes in the soul" is stated explicitly mid-story and dramatized through Mira's guilt over watching Elias sacrifice brilliance and her final choice to fuse futures rather than restore his alone. The motivation drives the trade and its form (shared destiny as repair). Solid causal pressure across two beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Dusky resolve" appears once late ("her dusky resolve steady as the turning earth") and the tone overall balances determination with lyric melancholy. The opening's half-light imagery and the steady escalation reflect resolve under shadow. Coherent through turns; modulates at the dawn ending. Participates in closure image but isn't charged with additional cost there.</comment>
