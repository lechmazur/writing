**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural. Pressure builds through layered sensory detail, memory, and thematic recurrence (whispers vs. shouts, scent vs. sound) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where Maren's philosophy is validated.

**Closure Unit:** Father's return + vial cork dropping = RR (belief system confirmed, mother's artifact spent).

**Dominant Stake:** Finding the father / proving the whisper philosophy.

<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and the micro-choices (refusing binoculars, refusing the horn) are well-dramatized enactments of her philosophy. However, she has no genuine internal contradiction—she "had always been right" and the story confirms this without cost, struggle, or transformation. The father exists only as a silhouette raising one hand. The purification of intention (stripping desperation) is told more than dramatized through embodied resistance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Orientation is clean by sentence two. The before/after is legible (loud methods fail → quiet beckoning succeeds → father returns), but cost at closure is thin: the vial's expenditure is framed as "purpose fulfilled," not sacrifice. The magical mechanism (scent literally summoning a boat) occupies an uncommitted middle between coincidence and fantasy, weakening causal credibility. Heavy backstory (~35%) is anchored to present stimuli but doesn't reshape present tactics—she was always going to open the vial.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Multi-sensory work is the story's strongest asset—the scent description ("cool earth after rain, green growing things that knew how to wait in darkness") is specific and earned. The lighthouse beam's remnant warmth carrying the scent upward is a nice micro-setting detail that marginally enables the plot. "Cobalt" is decorative color mentioned twice without constraint. The heat wave breaking into rain is atmospherically effective but the setting ultimately serves mood over choice-pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake is signaled early, but present-scene escalation is negligible: Maren opens the vial, whispers, and the father appears with no complication, setback, or trade-off. The micro-choices (refusing loud methods) provide philosophical tension but no actual narrowing of options—the quiet method works immediately and completely. No live option is foreclosed with felt price; the resolution is frictionless.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The final paragraph explicitly states the thesis: "The quietest calls carry furthest, because they travel not through air, but through the space between souls where noise cannot reach." This is direct moralizing, not resonance. "She had been right. She had always been right" forecloses ambiguity. No counter-reading is available—the binary (whispers good, shouts bad) is never complicated. Applying −0.7 for final-paragraph thematic echo.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV is clean third-person limited with a sensory-oriented perceptual signature appropriate to Maren's character. The "not X, but Y" construction becomes a noticeable tic (used 4+ times), and the voice occasionally tips from lyrical into overwrought ("the screaming tenderness she had kept folded inside her chest"). Psychic distance is stable, and the two brief dialogue lines serve their purpose without strain.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Individual lines shine ("each step an ache she had learned to love"; "the sea, gray-gold in the early light, breathed slow and patient"), but paraphrase loops undermine density: the whisper/shout binary is restated four times, "not X, but Y" template runs throughout, and "She had seen it in the way... She had felt it in the way..." is mechanical parallelism. The final paragraph is a thesis statement, not prose. Applying −0.8 for pervasive patterned artifacts including closure contamination.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>The scent-as-beckoning mechanism is a specific and sensory-grounded approach to the "quiet power" premise, providing some freshness. However, the core plot—faith/love summons a lost person home—is a deeply familiar template, and the resolution is the most expected possible outcome. No surprise, subversion, or complication disturbs the fable-like arc. The story commits fully to its premise but never transforms the underlying template through specificity of consequence.</comment>
