<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's internal contradiction (perfectionist control versus fear of showing vulnerability) is embodied through her actions with the fragments and drives the final embrace. The renunciation of "balance" as rigid control is earned causally. Minor slip: Edris's interiority during his three-week absence remains opaque, making his return feel slightly convenient rather than fully motivated. The final choice to "find a new name" carries visible emotional cost but could have been deepened with more on-page resistance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly (foundry, Mira, dawn, post-search-party). The accumulative/textural lens holds: kintsugi creation deepens through night, Edris's arrival pivots the piece, and the lantern-gift closure reconfigures the mentor relationship with felt cost (admitting failure, embracing uncertainty). One causal convenience: Edris sees the light "from the pass" at the exact moment of completion, which risks coincidental resolution under a situational lens but reads acceptably under accumulative design where the lantern functions as召唤/beacon charged by Mira's work.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The foundry setting constrains choices throughout: dormant furnaces cue the hiatus, forge-work structures the night, rain intensifies as emotional pressure mounts, and the lantern's glow becomes the spatial homing beacon. Sensory detail (wet iron, coal-breath, golden rivers catching forge-light) is purposeful and filtered through Mira's professional lens. The recurring light/dark motif charges the final image when the lantern's fractured glow fills the space, making the micro-setting indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (repair the ruptured mentorship) is clear early. Pressure tightens through the night's alchemical work, and Mira's unsteady embrace forecloses her perfectionist stance with visible cost. The kintsugi lantern creation serves as the escalatory beat, narrowing options from criticism to acceptance. Minor deduction: Edris's choice to return is weakly motivated on-page; his survival and timing feel somewhat coincidental, reducing agency at the turn. The ending choice ("find a new name") reweights the relationship credibly under the accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme (names as imposed burdens versus chosen identities, repair over perfection) emerges organically from the kintsugi work and Mira's reflection on "assignments." The final image—lantern with golden seams, "exactly right" despite imprecision—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The piece resists binary resolution: "names can stretch" acknowledges complexity. Minor thematic echo: "balance meant knowing when to let things fall apart" borders on thesis statement but is anchored in the concrete act of creating the flawed lantern, keeping it above pure abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable in Mira's focalization; perceptual signature is profession-specific (measuring to the grain, forge-breath, volatile compounds). Distance modulates purposefully during the embrace. Dialogue is sparse, goal-driven, and carries subtext ("I don't know if I can be what that name means" reveals the weight without explaining). Minor register slip: "intentional scars" and "luminous regret" in the penultimate paragraph edge toward abstract poeticism that slightly loosens the grounded alchemist voice, though both phrases remain legible and voice-adjacent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well; information density is high. The opening lantern image and closing lantern gift create tight framing. Minor loop: "Names were assignments" / "told a person who they must become" and the final "names can stretch" / "break and mend like everything else" cover similar conceptual ground with slight paraphrase (−0.2). Figurative density in the penultimate paragraph ("luminous regret—beautiful because it acknowledged the breaking") approaches overwriting but remains coherent and purpose-driven. No major scaffold or template cadence; propulsion is clean through the alchemical sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The kintsugi-as-mentorship-repair premise is thoughtfully executed and specific to the alchemist setting. The twist—unintended lantern creation guiding Edris home—feels earned in hindsight by the "factually mystical" frame. Emotional specificity (Mira's fear coded as perfectionism) avoids generic templates. Minor deduction: the mentor-learns-to-accept-imperfection arc is familiar, and while the alchemical particulars distinguish it, the emotional architecture follows a well-worn path. The "light from the pass" coincidence at closure, while functionally mystical, slightly undermines the fresh synthesis by leaning on convenience.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's choices (gathering fragments, heating gold, whispering names, embracing Edris, offering the lantern) drive all key turns. Her decision to attempt kintsugi alchemy despite prior cowardice is the inciting action; the final gift and name-flexibility offer complete the arc. Balance as a trait (measuring to the grain, equilibrium or nothing) is demonstrated early and renounced with cost at closure ("let herself be unsteady"). Strong causal role and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The zodiac coin appears in beat one (retrieved from apron, backstory anchor), placed at the kintsugi center in beat two, and is implied melted into the lantern by closure (golden seams). The coin's Capricorn/climbing symbolism reweights at the end when Mira offers flexibility over imposed destiny. However, the coin does not constrain a middle choice or return as a distinct object; it is absorbed rather than reprised. Two-beat use with thematic charge, but not indispensable—setup and payoff present, middle development weak.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Kintsugi alchemy is the method, motive, and thematic spine. The concept shapes stakes (repair broken mentorship with golden seams), drives the night's work, and supplies the closure image (lantern with fracture-mapped gold). Mira's prior refusal to teach it and her choice to practice it now create the central tension. The lantern's "imperfect" beauty and the final line ("Imprecise. Imperfect. Exactly right.") make the concept inseparable from closure. All three gates strong; high causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Factually mystical" is demonstrated through the lantern's unintended form ("intention shaped outcomes in ways measurement could not predict") and Edris seeing the light from an impossible distance. The trait enables the closure (mystical beacon guides return) and justifies the alchemical transformation. It constrains Mira's choices by forcing her to accept outcomes beyond control. Present in setup (theory vs. practice), action (the mystical emergence), and payoff (the impossible light). Solid integration, though the mystical convenience at closure slightly weakens irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Redeem" is the explicit motive ("redeem that silence by exploring limits") that launches the kintsugi work. The redemption arc structures the entire night sequence and culminates in the embrace and lantern-gift, which redeem Mira's relentless corrections. The action is inseparable from escalation and closure: without the redemptive intent, the piece becomes mere craft demonstration. All three gates met with strong causal pressure; the final "exactly right" line completes the redemptive arc with visible cost (admitting failure, accepting imperfection).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Exploring limits" is signaled early ("exploring limits she had never dared approach") and enacted through the kintsugi attempt—heating gold, binding shards, creating the unintended lantern form. The method shapes the middle work sequence and enables the mystical outcome. Mira's willingness to push beyond safe instruction is the visible constraint that drives her night choices. Present in setup, development (the alchemical work), and payoff (the mystical lantern). Solid integration, though "limits" as abstract phrasing could be more concretely specified.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The rain-washed foundry is inseparable from every beat: dormant furnaces cue the mentor hiatus, forge-work structures the redemptive sequence, rain intensifies with emotional pressure, wet iron and cold cinders provide sensory anchors, and the foundry's light becomes the spatial beacon that guides Edris home. Mira's forty-year professional identity is embodied in the space. Without this exact setting, the alchemical work, the light-from-the-pass turn, and the thematic resonance (industrial repair, golden seams) collapse. All three gates strong; micro-setting constrains and charges closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The timeframe (post-search-party dawn to next dawn) brackets the story and provides urgency: the search has failed, Mira works through the night, and Edris returns at the new dawn. The night's duration gives the alchemical work credibility. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions mid-sequence—Mira is not racing a deadline—and Edris's timing at closure feels coincidentally aligned rather than shaped by the frame. Setup and payoff present; middle development weak. The frame is functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"To understand the weight of names" is dramatized throughout: Mira reflects on naming Edris ("something that climbs"), realizes names are "assignments," and whispers his names during the kintsugi work. The final dialogue ("I don't know if I can be what that name means" / "we'll find you a new one") is the on-page collision of want (understanding) and cost (admitting her imposition). The motivation drives setup (coin backstory), middle reflection, and closure choice with visible relational cost. Friction between imposed identity and chosen self is fully embodied. All three gates strong; high causal irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>"Luminous regret" is coherent from the opening (extinguished lanterns, rain, Mira's solitary vigil) through the kintsugi work (golden seams on broken things) to the closure image ("fractured light filling the foundry with luminous regret"). The tone modulates with pressure: somber in reflection, purposeful during the alchemical work, tender at the embrace, and charged-hopeful at the gift. The final paragraph crystallizes the tone without stating it, making regret beautiful through repair. The tone is indispensable to thematic resonance and charges every major beat.</comment>
