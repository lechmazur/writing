<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sora's interior life is concrete and embodied throughout—the plants' whispers ground her gift in sensory particulars, and her final choice to crack the amber feels earned by thirty years of insurgency and recent loss. The cortisol-breath detail and her dialogue with lichen avoid therapy-speak. Micro-choices (retrieving the kite, pressing the seal) reveal hierarchy of values with visible cost: she forecloses Temple control forever. Emi's late arrival feels more functional than pressure-tested, preventing full high-band entry.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Causal lens inferred: Sora's journey up the path → kite discovery → prophecy decoding → amber unsealing narrows options through because/therefore linkage. Orientation anchors (who, where, sacred springs context) land cleanly within the first 120 words. Closure is Decisive Change with Conceptual Repricing: the embryo dissolves into the soil, redistributing genetic memory and ending Temple monopoly. Cost is visible (hoarded destiny now belongs to earth/everyone) and the lens holds without contradiction. One persistent constraint—the Temple's historical control—shapes the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sulfur-stained path, terraced pools, torn prayer flags, and volcanic vent are vivid and selective. The warm water enables the amber's unsealing (mineral-rich properties matter), and the ferns/lichen contribute to spatial pressure by "speaking" Sora's gift into the climax. Sensory detail reflects her plant-speaker bias. The kite tangled in dead brush supplies the script that unlocks prophecy. Does not quite reach 8.5 because the springs function more as stage than active constraint at the peak choice—Sora would unseal regardless of exact location.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ending Temple monopoly on destiny/genetic memory) is signaled early and tightens once: the kite prophecy confirms conditions are met, then Sora's unsealing act forecloses the old control path with visible cost. Agency is decision (cracking the seal) that redistributes power. The plants' excited response and Emi's arrival show consequence. One meaningful tightening under the causal lens is sufficient at this length. The price—irrevocable loss of centralized heritage control—is legible on the page, but we do not see Sora wrestle with a competing option (e.g., keeping it sealed, selective release), which would elevate escalation further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (tradition as choice vs. cage, evolution with intent) emerges organically from the amber's dissolution and Sora's line "I gave you the past...what you build from it is your choice." The golden particles sinking into soil offer a resonant non-literal answer: hoarded memory becomes commons. The plant-speaker gift and Temple Keepers' historical control layer subtext without moralizing. Final image reweights prior material (the First Age embryo was never a single destiny) with quiet authority. Avoids thesis-speak and earns insight through concrete action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single tight third-person POV on Sora, distance stable and apt. Her perceptual signature—plants whispering moisture, minerals, cortisol—is character-specific and consistent. Dialogue with plants and Emi feels natural and advances plot ("You carry life that waits"). Diction stays within her insurgent-elder lexicon; no register drift. Brief compression under peak stress (unsealing) is acceptable and voice-motivated. Elision of Emi's approach until the final beat is purposeful (stakes stay on Sora's solitary choice). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks mar pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "The plants whispered to her as she walked" establishes gift, advances movement, primes closure). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Minor scaffold: "The amber rested against her chest" and later "The amber grew warm" repeat the noun without variation, a small textural slip. The kite prophecy's quatrain reads slightly elevated against the surrounding prose register but remains legible and voice-plausible for ancient temple script. Zero major artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—plant telepathy gained through trauma, prophecy hidden on a child's kite, genetic memory as commons vs. monopoly—feels specific and non-obvious. The turn (embryo as collective adaptation archive, not single fate) transforms the "chosen one" trope into a commentary on knowledge gatekeeping. The reconstruction timeframe and Sora's insurgent past anchor the premise in lived detail. Risk-taking (dissolution into soil rather than implantation) heightens stakes without gimmickry. However, the "elder cracks ancient seal during peace" frame echoes familiar post-war reconciliation templates; the plant-speaker twist and kite-script method provide freshness but do not fully escape the archetype.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sora drives every key turn: climbs the path, retrieves the kite, decodes the script, unseals the amber. Her insurgent history motivates the choice and her plant-speaker gift enables it. Removing her exact character (elder insurgent, accidental gift, lost daughter) would break the story's moral and causal logic. Present in setup (first paragraph), middle (kite discovery/prophecy), and closure (unsealing act). Visible cost tied to her choice: she irrevocably ends centralized control. High irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Amber appears in beat one (resting against chest), reappears when it grows warm in the water, and is cracked open in the climax. The embryo's dissolution into golden particles is the decisive action that redistributes genetic memory. Removing the amber would collapse closure entirely—no other object carries the fossilized heritage or Temple monopoly. Highly specific: mineral-rich water triggers the release, matching the prophecy's "when the waters run true." Cost is tied directly to its unsealing (path foreclosed). Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The concept shapes stakes throughout: Temple Keepers used "implanted destiny" to control the people for generations, and Sora's unsealing breaks that monopoly. The prophecy conditions ("when the keeper of green speaks") hinge on the concept. The embryo's true nature (genetic memory archive vs. single fate) redefines the premise at closure. Removing this concept would reduce the story to a simple rebellion tale. Present in setup, developed via kite script, and reweighted at closure when it dissolves into commons.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Plant telepathy is introduced with concrete cost (bombing, three days buried, daughter killed) and enables multiple beats: lichen dialogue (cortisol sensing), ferns' recognition of the embryo, and excited plant chatter at dissolution. The gift confirms prophecy conditions ("keeper of green speaks without voice"). However, the telepathy does not constrain a choice—Sora could decode the kite and unseal the amber without it. It enriches texture and theme but is not mechanically indispensable to the climax. Two gates (setup, closure participation) but middle development is weak.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Unsealing the amber is the story's climax and only major turn. Everything prior builds toward it (climb, prophecy, confirmation of conditions); everything after flows from it (particle release, plant response, Emi's arrival). The act forecloses Temple control and redistributes genetic memory. Swapping "unseal" for another action (burn, bury, shatter) would require rewriting the entire ending and thematic payoff. High causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability. Visible cost: irrevocable democratization of heritage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The kite-tail script appears late (roughly 40% mark) but drives the middle turn: Sora decodes the prophecy, confirms conditions are met, and proceeds to unseal. The method is specific (old temple script, forbidden to non-priests, painted on cloth strips) and could not be easily swapped. However, late introduction and the fact that the kite solves the problem it did not help create (prophecy appears exactly when needed) limits the score. Two gates (middle, closure framing) but no setup. Late penalty and convenience friction apply.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Hot springs provide the mineral-rich water that dissolves the embryo, a mechanical necessity for closure. The sulfur path and terraced pools ground the climb and frame Sora's interiority. The sacred history (prayer flags, old temple) contextualizes stakes. The setting constrains access (steep climb, remote location) and enables the unsealing chemistry. Removing the volcanic springs would break the dissolution logic. Three gates (setup, middle embodiment, closure participation). Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; specificity is high.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"During the reconstruction" anchors the timeframe early and provides thematic context (war over, rebuilding vs. destroying), shaping Sora's motivation ("war becomes memory"). The prophecy's conditions hinge on this moment. However, the reconstruction does not tighten tactics or create urgency—Sora's climb and unsealing unfold without time pressure. The timeframe frames theme but does not constrain choices. Two gates (setup, closure context) but no live clock in middle development. Functional but mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Sora's desire to "evolve tradition with intent, not violence" is dramatized through her choice to crack the seal and redistribute heritage as commons rather than destroy or hoard it. The motivation is stated ("This was why she had come") and enacted with visible cost (foreclosing centralized control). Her line to Emi—"I gave you the past, what you build from it is your choice"—crystallizes the intent. Friction between preserving vs. releasing heritage drives the climax. Three gates and strong closure linkage; causal pressure is clear.</comment>
