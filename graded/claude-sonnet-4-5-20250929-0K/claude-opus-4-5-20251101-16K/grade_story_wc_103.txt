<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and consistent—her desire to map time's texture drives all choices. Internal conflict is present but somewhat abstract: the photographs showing futures she won't live feel intellectually compelling yet lack embodied consequence in peak beats. The final choice to continue walking the paths reads as acceptance rather than a decision with visible tradeoff. Interiority occasionally tips toward diagnostic ("retrocognitively trapped") without grounding the experience in sensory particulars that would raise the stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly in the first paragraph (who, where, what). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through the photographs, the halo fragment, and the hyperbolic geometry discovery, culminating in a Charged Poise closure where Elara commits to the maze despite the cost. The final image—"worse eternities than understanding"—reweights the premise with felt consequence. One meaningful deepening occurs when she grasps the maze's secret and chooses to stay, forecloses the exit option with palpable risk.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is vividly rendered with purposeful detail: root-woven pathways, saddle-shaped hedges, moss bridges. The halo fragment functions as micro-setting, anchoring Elara during temporal seizures and charging the final choice. Hyperbolic geometry descriptions ("surfaces where parallel lines diverge endlessly") remain abstract but serve the conceptual stakes. The garden constrains her movement and mentally pressures her perception, though spatial choreography during the temporal fall could be sharper.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—charting time's topology—is signaled early and tightens when Elara discovers the maze grows hyperbolic surfaces that fold past into present. The photographs constitute one meaningful reversal: they reveal possible futures collapsing, raising the cost of staying. Her decision to walk the paths despite potential entrapment forecloses the exit option with visible consequence. Agency reads as endurance and acceptance rather than a high-cost choice between competing goods, which keeps it from the highest band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—time as texture, the cost of understanding—emerges through concrete images: photographs disintegrating, bridges trembling, hyperbolic paths diverging. The final line "There were worse eternities than understanding" offers a resonant answer without moralizing, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in the halo fragment as both anchor and symbol. One minor slip: "God help her, she had wanted to discover the texture of time" edges toward thematic echo but recovers through the textured sensory particulars (rough as burlap, smooth as glass) that follow.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds cleanly; no head-hopping. Narrative distance is controlled, though some diction ("retrocognitively trapped," "quaking reverie") elevates beyond strict POV plausibility for a maze designer. Perceptual signature is present: Elara notices hyperbolic planes and root-bridge mechanics in character-specific ways. Sentence rhythm varies and intensifies appropriately under pressure. A few passages ("stranded in simultaneity") lean abstract when concrete sensory anchors would sharpen the effect.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean with varied syntax and strong momentum. Opening and closing images anchor effectively. Minor scaffold appears: "She understood," "She had wanted," "She could" cluster in the final third, creating mild template cadence. One paraphrase loop: the paragraph explaining hyperbolic geometry and time distortion restates the concept across multiple sentences without adding pressure. Figurative density is high ("dying butterflies," "lighthouse beam," "sleeping giants") but remains coherent and voice-appropriate, avoiding muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of living architecture, hyperbolic geometry, and temporal collapse is specific and non-obvious; the halo fragment as Byzantine anchor adds historical texture. The photographs-as-collapsing-futures premise transforms familiar time-loop territory through geometric logic. Elara's occupation (maze designer) integrates tightly with the conceptual stakes. Risk-taking in the temporal seizure sequences and the quiet, acceptance-based ending heighten meaning without obscuring clarity. No close derivative echoes detected; the piece commits fully to its premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout. Setup: hired to design the unsolvable maze. Development: her sketches of hyperbolic planes cause the bridges to grow accordingly, and she discovers the temporal cost. Payoff: her final decision to walk the paths and complete the maze despite entrapment risk is the story's culminating choice. Causal pressure is strong; her professional skill (designing geometries) directly enables the crisis and shapes her final stance. Two beats: the initial discovery of what the bridges do, and the final commitment to stay. Cost is visible in the futures she chooses not to live.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The halo fragment appears in two beats: discovery "weeks ago" (backstory anchor) and present use during temporal seizures to pull her back. It enables her to survive the retrocognitive traps and remains in her hand at the maze's center, but its role in the final choice is passive—she presses it to her chest, considers leaving, then walks the paths anyway. Setup is clear, development functional, payoff present but not causally decisive. The ending would still cohere if she used another anchor object; the Byzantine detail adds texture without irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Fading photographs are introduced early and recur across multiple beats: first discovery, experiencing the temporal fall triggered by touching one, and their continued drift during the climax. They directly shape stakes—showing futures collapsing, past dissolving—and inform Elara's understanding of the maze's effect. The final image of a photograph showing her "older and luminous and alive" in this exact spot reweights her decision with charged cost. Causal pressure is undeniable; the photographs are the primary mechanism revealing the maze's temporal distortion. The concept is indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The attribute is signaled early ("retrocognitively trapped") and dramatized in the temporal seizure beat where Elara relives her mother's funeral, first commission, and childhood injury. It constrains her: she needs the halo fragment to anchor herself. Cost is visible—she experiences simultaneity and cannot easily escape the maze's pull. However, the trait's impact on the final choice is limited; she walks the paths despite the trap rather than because of a tradeoff it forces. Present in setup and development, contributes to payoff pressure but does not decisively shape the ending action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Disintegration appears in three beats: photographs crumbling to ash when touched, futures collapsing throughout, and the boundary between past and present dissolving as the maze's core effect. It defines the stakes—what stays versus what fades—and drives Elara's realization that hyperbolic surfaces fold time. The final image references photographs continuing to "fade and disintegrate, futures she was choosing not to live," directly charging her choice. Causal work is strong; the action is not easily swappable. It shapes the closure but does not solely constitute it, keeping it below the indispensable threshold.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry is signaled early: Elara sketches hyperbolic planes, the bridges grow accordingly, and she discovers the geometry exists partially outside spacetime. The method shapes her understanding and frames the maze's logic. Development beat: "hyperbolic surfaces…caused the boundary between past and present to disintegrate." Payoff: she walks "the hyperbolic paths" in the final paragraph. However, the mechanics remain abstract; how walking those paths will chart time is asserted rather than demonstrated with tactical specificity. Present across all three gates, essential to the conceptual frame, but the method's use feels more thematic than operational.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is anchored in the opening and provides the story's arena. Setup is vivid: root-woven pathways, chasms, Thessaly Gorge. Development: the bridges respond to intention, rearranging based on Elara's thoughts, which enables the hyperbolic growth. Payoff: the bridges "trembled with something like recognition" as she walks the final paths. The garden pressures her by enacting her designs with unintended temporal consequences. It constrains movement and thought throughout. Essential across beats, though the final image emphasizes her choice over the garden's specific features.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Motivation is stated early: Elara "had wanted to discover the texture of time." Dramatized in the temporal seizure where she feels time's texture ("rough as burlap in grief, smooth as glass in joy"). Her desire drives the initial commission acceptance and her final decision to stay despite entrapment risk. Friction is present: the cost is potential eternal trapping, and she acknowledges "There were worse eternities than understanding." The want is tested on the page, and she chooses it over safety. Strong setup and payoff, with one mid-story beat where the desire is embodied through sensory experience.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Tone is established early through diction: "living bridge garden grew itself," "sleeping giants," "impossible geometries." It modulates with pressure—lyric and meditative in the opening, denser and more urgent during the temporal seizure, contemplative again at the close. The phrase "quaking reverie" appears only in the final sentence, where it charges the ending image by naming the state Elara accepts. Coherence holds throughout; the trembling, uncertain quality ("trembled with something like recognition," "trembling warmth") threads the piece. The tone supports the accumulative lens and charges closure without a single static mood.</comment>
