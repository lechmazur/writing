**Inferred Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural. The story builds through layered images, memories, and thematic refrains toward a Conceptual Repricing (CR) at closure — "underachieving" is reweighted as sacred resistance.

**Closure Unit:** CR — the final image of Meris "underachieving and unstoppable, carrying nothing but intention" reweights the premise. Cost: the keystone is gone (absorbed), the empty pack is the material trace.

**Dominant Stake:** Preserving sacred simplicity against algorithmic efficiency.

<question>1</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Meris is a parable character — clear motivation but no internal contradiction or genuine struggle. She arrives certain, places the stone, and leaves validated. "Numb fingers" is the only embodied detail. No competing impulses act in scene; the grandmother's wisdom is received whole and never doubted. The "underachieving" label creates no visible friction that alters her tactics on-page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Clean orientation by ~60 words. Accumulative lens holds through closure. CR lands: the keystone absorbed, the empty pack marking cost. However, the plot is gossamer thin — climb, place stone, stone activates, descend. "Nothing happened. Then everything did." is the sole turn and entirely predictable. No obstacle, complication, or narrowing of options occurs during the ascent or placement. Cost is legible but passive (stone simply absorbed rather than requiring sacrifice).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Brilliant dimness, as if the sun and stars were both present and veiled" is the story's strongest image. The spire's cathedral of ice and the altar of frozen light are evocative. Setting constrains approach (mist walking required). However, much description is abstract rather than tactile — the sensory world thins past the initial climb. The processing centers below remain purely expository.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>Stakes are declared (sacred vs. automated) but never tested on-page. No obstacle complicates the climb, no risk threatens the placement, no antagonistic force intervenes. Under the accumulative lens, the stone's activation provides a cadence shift, but there's no dramatized resistance or cost in the moment — it simply works. The tightening that should foreclose a live option or force a trade-off is absent. The engines never actually threaten this particular action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from events (garden → keystone → luminance) but is then aggressively over-stated. The final third reads as sermon: "meaning made from the simple act of loving small things well," "Some light lingers because it was never meant for efficiency," "Some magic resists scaling because its power lies precisely in its smallness." Thematic Echo penalty applies heavily — the narrator articulates the thesis in prompt-like language across multiple final paragraphs. The resonance that should arrive through image arrives instead through declaration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Placing her feet on vapor and prayer" and "underachieving and unstoppable" show genuine voice craft. Stable third-person limited. However, the final third drifts from character-filtered perception into essayistic aphorism — the narrator's declarations ("The sacred was waiting in simple places") feel authorial rather than Meris's interiority. The lyrical register is consistent but begins to flatten into rhythmic sameness with the repeated short-paragraph fragments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Clean prose in early sections with good rhythmic variety. Significant redundancy: the engines-can't-do-this refrain appears three distinct times with near-identical structure; "underachieving" repeats without evolution; the template cadence "She had walked... She had carried... She had found..." triggers −0.5. Paraphrase loops in the final third — "the holiness of a grandmother's garden, the grace of simple things loved well" restates what was already dramatized. Information density drops sharply after the climactic activation as the same concept is restated in multiple formulations.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The garden folly as magical collector is a genuinely fresh concept — the idea that decorative arches absorb "lingering luminance" from decades of joy is specific and imaginative. "Mist walking" on vapor and prayer is evocative. However, the overarching framework (underdog proves value of old ways against soulless automation, grandmother's wisdom validated) is a well-worn template. The emotional arc and its resolution are predictable from the first paragraph. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies partially, lifted by the folly concept's specificity.</comment>
