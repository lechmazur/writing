<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's acoustically perceptive nature drives concrete choices—she follows "the sound of nothing," adjusts her playing to shipwreck resonance, and deliberately unbinds her violin strings. The grandmother's legacy creates internal tension between inherited storytelling and chosen music, resolved through synthesis. Interiority remains embodied: "water to her knees," "bowl hung from her pack." Minor slip: the epiphany "stories did not need endings" edges toward stated insight rather than fully dramatized realization, though the unbinding action partially earns it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accretes meaning through layered images (greenhouse, ships, bowl, violin) that converge in the unbinding sequence. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira's final stance—"silence she had finally learned to love"—crystallizes her acceptance of incompletion with visible cost (unstrung violin, bowl offered to water). Orientation anchors by ~100 words (Mira, post-burn harbor, greenhouse). One meaningful deepening: the transition from playing fragments to deliberately loosening strings reweights her relationship to both music and silence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sunken greenhouse with half-dead apple trees and encircling shipwrecks directly enables the closure: their "hollow bellies" return Mira's notes changed, teaching her that resonance persists in ruin. Water depth ("to her knees"), fractured glass roof, and barnacled hulls are integrated through action. The bowl floating among submerged branches charges the final image. Micro-setting (body, instrument, water) constrains each choice—she must wade, adjust bow technique to capture echoes, physically unbind strings.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: finding beauty/meaning in post-catastrophe silence, signaled early ("chronic hush...made silence unbearable"). One clear tightening: when sound "fell flat," Mira shifts from attempting completion to embracing fragments, unbinding her violin—a tactical reversal with visible cost (instrument rendered silent). The unbinding forecloses the path of traditional performance. Agency is deliberate renunciation; no antagonist required under the Accumulative lens. The greenhouse-as-instrument discovery deepens her method mid-scene.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—beauty in incompletion—emerges through concrete images: unfinished apple trees still reaching, shipwrecks holding "the shape of journeys never completed," unbound violin strings. The ending offers a non-literal answer via the drifting bowl and "silence she had finally learned to love" without moralizing. One slip: "This was enough. This was everything. The unfinished world held more beauty than any completed thing ever could" edges into direct thematic statement rather than letting the image speak, though the prior bowl/violin work partially earns it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout; perceptual signature is acoustically filtered ("sound of nothing," "faintest resonance"). Diction stays consistent with Mira's artistry: "ping of released tension," "echo-harbor violinist." The alternation between playing and speaking ("There was a fisherman who—" / bow sweep) feels purposeful and voice-motivated. Minor drift: "magnificence in fragments, simplicity in what remained unnamed" in the penultimate paragraph slightly elevates register beyond prior texture, though it recovers quickly in the final image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well; sentence structure modulates from short declaratives ("She waded into the greenhouse") to longer accumulative phrases ("their holds empty, their stories unfinished"). Information density is high in the unbinding sequence. Two minor loops: "unfinished" appears in close proximity across multiple beats without always adding new pressure; "chronic hush" recurs but each use advances meaning. The final paragraph's three-part construction ("This was enough. This was everything. The unfinished world...") risks summary but the subsequent image grounds it. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The sunken greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks as accidental acoustic chamber offers a fresh synthesis; unbinding violin strings as positive act (rather than destruction) transforms the trope. Post-apocalyptic silence treated as invitation rather than despair shows originality. The grandmother's bonfire tradition grafted onto water-and-ruins setting feels earned. Minor familiarity: the artist-finding-beauty-in-ruin frame is well-trodden; specificity (acoustic perception, mendicant's bowl, apple trees) elevates but does not fully escape the template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Echo-harbor violinist frames expectation early, drives the greenhouse exploration (following acoustic cues), adjusts playing technique to shipwreck resonance, and executes the unbinding—three distinct beats. The occupation is irreplaceable: only an acoustically trained musician would parse silence this way or unbind strings as compositional choice. Present in closure (unstrung violin "cradled like something precious"). Cost: she forecloses her prior performance mode.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Mendicant's bowl appears twice: carried in the pack (setup), then filled with greenhouse water and set afloat among apple branches (closure). The second use reweights it from inherited burden to offering. However, middle development is thin—it does not constrain a choice between first and final appearances. The closure participation is genuine but lyric rather than causal. Swappability is low (the beggar-storyteller lineage is specific), but beat involvement is limited.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Chronic hush" is named early, frames the entire premise (post-burn silence), and directly alters Mira's tactics: she cannot play completed songs, so she pivots to fragments and unbinding. It shapes the greenhouse discovery (she follows "the sound of nothing") and charges the ending ("silence she had finally learned to love"). The concept constrains every musical choice on the page. The hush is both antagonist and ultimate embrace, with cost: her former repertoire is useless.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Acoustically perceptive" is signaled early ("made silence unbearable"), enables the key turn (noticing shipwreck resonance when others might miss it), and drives the unbinding decision (she hears what remains after strings release). It appears in three beats: initial setup, resonance discovery, and echo persistence at closure. The trait constrains her prior life (silence is unbearable) and enables the solution (she alone perceives the returning echoes). Cost: hyper-sensitivity to loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Unbind" appears late (final third) but transforms all prior material: the incomplete songs, the family's unfinished stories, the shattered greenhouse all converge in the deliberate act of loosening violin strings. It is the story's decisive physical turn, irreplaceable—no other action carries the same symbolic and acoustic weight. The unbinding produces the closure image (unstrung violin as "precious and broken and true") and enacts the thematic answer. Cost is visible: the instrument falls silent yet echoes continue. Introduced ~70% through but redefines all prior stakes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The family bonfire storytelling tradition is seeded early (grandmother's bowl, "beggar-storyteller, keeper of a family tradition"), invoked in the middle (Mira begins telling story fragments between notes), and implicitly present at closure ("tell others about this place"). It enables the hybrid form (music + spoken fragments) and explains why she can synthesize when the violin alone fails. However, the bonfire itself is absent—"The bonfire was absent, but the bowl caught starlight"—so the method is adapted rather than directly used. Swappability is moderate; any oral tradition could serve. The storytelling does not constrain a hard choice.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks is introduced early, supplies the acoustic crucible (hollow hulls return sound), and charges every beat: Mira must wade (physical cost), the fractured glass roof admits starlight for the bowl, submerged apple branches hold the offering. The setting is irreplaceable—no other location combines water, resonance chambers, and living-yet-dying growth. It drives the resonance discovery, enables the unbinding experiment, and provides the closure image (bowl floating among branches). Three gates met; high specificity and causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"After the rainforest burned" anchors the premise and explains the chronic hush (no living soundscape). It shapes Mira's motivation (loss drives her search) and the greenhouse's state (ash-wind, half-dead trees). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—there is no clock pressure, no deadline. The post-burn world is static backdrop rather than escalating constraint. Present in setup and reflected at closure (mention of "burned world"), but does not alter tactics beat-to-beat. Functional but largely atmospheric.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To find beauty in the unfinished" is dramatized through Mira's recognition sequence ("trees that still tried to bloom...ships that held the shape of journeys never completed") and enacted in the unbinding—she makes incompletion her method. The motivation is seeded early (her music "felt inadequate"), tested in the middle (sound falls flat, forcing tactical shift), and fulfilled at closure (she accepts unstrung silence as "enough"). Friction: her training demands completion, yet survival requires embracing fragments. Cost: she abandons traditional craft standards. The final paragraph nearly over-articulates the motivation, but prior action earns it.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Magnificent simplicity" coheres through restrained diction (no purple excess), the spare greenhouse setting, and the elegantly minimal final image (bowl among branches, unstrung violin). Tone modulates appropriately: quiet opening, intensification during the resonance discovery, meditative calm at closure. The piece resists melodrama despite catastrophe; the chronic hush itself imposes tonal discipline. One slip: "This was enough. This was everything" risks grandiosity, but the subsequent grounded image (unstrung violin, drifting bowl) restores simplicity. The tone charges the final moment—understated acceptance feels earned and resonant.</comment>
