<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation to protect Elena and break the covenant is clear and embodied in the worry stone gesture. However, the piece is almost entirely reflective with no contradictory impulses acting in scene—she simply sits and remembers, already at peace with her choice. The final beat ("felt something like peace settle over her") reads as emotional summary rather than a choice under pressure. Internal conflict is recounted in backstory, not dramatized in the present.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with the worry stone dent deepening across the text. Closure attempts Earned Stasis (she will continue her exile) but the cost is asserted rather than shown—"felt something like peace" tells us her stance without forecloses options on the page. The orientation is delayed (who/where unclear until multiple paragraphs in) but eventually pays off in the magnetic nexus concept. The closure image reweights prior material but the felt cost remains abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus is vivid and functional, constraining tracking spells and forcing her rotation. The worry stone as micro-setting object recurs with textural deepening (dent worn by pressure) and charges the final image. Basalt, compass needles, and the valley provide concrete spatial grounding. The body and object constrain her choices across the exile, meeting the 9+ gate requirement, though the nexus itself could be more tactilely present in the final beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (survival in exile while honoring the covenant she broke) is clear, but all pressure is retrospective. The on-page action is minimal: she sits, traces the stone, and will leave tomorrow. No meaningful tightening occurs in the present window—the decision to break the covenant happened seven years ago. The stated time pressure ("before the next phase") never materializes as a present constraint that alters her tactics or options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme of truth versus silence, sacrifice for principle, and beauty in difficulty emerges organically from the chess metaphor and exile particulars. The worry stone dent deepening is a strong non-literal image that charges the ending. However, explicit moralizing undermines subtext: "the stubborn, precious hope of someone who had done the right thing" and "beauty carved from difficulty" state the theme rather than letting the particulars resonate. The final paragraph tilts toward summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature (chess architecture, silence as language, "melancholy and hopeful in equal measure"). Some register drift: "correlate the evidence by translating silence" reads elevated for the moment. Purposeful compression in "Silence spoke its own language" works, but filter verbs cluster without adding pressure ("wondered if," "had learned to see"). No dialogue present. Distance control is mostly clean with one voice throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops reduce density: "beauty in that difficulty, had cultivated it carefully" restates the same idea; "melancholy and hopeful" appears twice in quick succession. Template stems recur ("She had been," "She would"). The compass needles image is used twice without functional evolution. Stock metaphors ("memories grew teeth," "notes falling like scattered pawns") appear in high-pressure moments without fresh tenor. Momentum sags in the middle third with expository backstory that recounts rather than advances.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus and eclipsed covenant offer fresh angles on exile and oath-breaking. The chess tutor background integrates well with the sacrifice/pattern theme. However, the core emotional arc (principled exile finding peace) follows a familiar template, and the worry stone dent, while specific, functions conventionally as a physical anchor for internal state. The ending's "stubborn, precious hope" reads as safety-hedged nobility rather than morally ambiguous risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The exiled chess tutor is present throughout and her past choice (breaking the covenant to save Elena) frames the entire piece. However, on the page she makes no new decisions—only reflects on past choices and plans to leave "tomorrow." The chess tutor background shapes how she perceives (architecture of patience, sacrifice) but does not create a present turn. She observes and remembers; no tactical shift occurs in this window.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The worry stone appears in beats one (opening), middle (backstory anchor), and finale. Its dent deepens texturally across the piece, signaling wear from seven years of pressure. The object is handled physically ("thumb tracing") in multiple beats and charges the final image. The stone's transformation (black/sharp to smooth/fitted) mirrors her exile. Strong integration, though it does not force a present choice—it embodies rather than constrains.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The eclipsed covenant is established early, explains her exile, and frames the dominant stake (broken oath consequences). It shapes her tactics (rotation between nexuses to evade tracking spells) and her stance at closure (would break it again). Present in setup, development (explains movement patterns), and ending (thematic anchor). However, it does not force a present choice—all covenant-related action is retrospective.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Thoughtfully precise" appears as a label in the opening beat ("thoughtfully precise in her methods") and again in the nightbird moment ("thoughtfully precise in her attention"). It characterizes her teaching style and perception but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. The trait is consistent but remains descriptive rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Correlate" appears once in backstory: "she had tried, first, to correlate the evidence by translating silence." It describes past investigation but does not create a turn in the present window. The action is recounted, not dramatized, and could be replaced with "gather" or "interpret" without structural loss. No present beat hinges on correlation mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Translating silence" is signaled in the backstory beat (servants' averted eyes, quiet rooms, missing ledgers) and returns at closure ("silence was only one language among many"). The method shaped her past discovery and frames her final stance. However, it is not used tactically in the present scene—only reflected upon. Present in setup and payoff with thematic weight, but not developed through middle action.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus is established immediately, explains her sanctuary (confusion protects her from tracking spells), and anchors the entire scene. It constrains her movement (rotation between seven such places) and the compass needles provide a concrete physical correlate. The twilight timing adds urgency to her impending departure. The setting drives her exile tactics and charges the final image with the spinning needles. Strong causal and atmospheric integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Before the next phase of the moon" is stated early as a departure deadline and returns at closure ("She would leave before the next phase"). It frames the timeframe but does not tighten present decisions—she sits and reflects without the clock creating tactical pressure. The phase functions as a marker, not a live countdown that alters her moves in this window.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Beauty in the difficult" is dramatized in her teaching of Elena and explicitly named in the nightbird beat ("finding in that simple melody the same quality she had always sought: beauty carved from difficulty"). It drives her retrospective stance and final peace. However, it is articulated rather than tested in scene—no present choice demonstrates the friction between this desire and competing costs. Present in motivation and closure, but told more than shown.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Hopeful melancholy is sustained throughout: the exile is painful yet she finds peace; the nightbird's song is "notes falling like scattered pawns across a losing board" yet she feels hope. The tone modulates coherently from amber-violet twilight through retrospective pain to "melancholy and hopeful in equal measure, precisely as it should be." The final line embodies the dual tone without declaring it. Strong tonal coherence that charges the closure image.</comment>
