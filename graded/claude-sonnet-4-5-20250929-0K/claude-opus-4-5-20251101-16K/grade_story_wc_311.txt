<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The reaper's interiority is embodied through physical details (atlas page trembling, voice cracking on unused words) and her two-century arc is earned through concrete memory rather than summary. The choice to crystallize fears and speak to souls represents a meaningful shift grounded in Mira's last gift. Minor slip: the final epiphany about love and fear edges toward abstraction without full dramatization of the internal contradiction that makes the insight costly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the reaper accepts her broken heart will persist but commits to Mira's purpose, forecloses the silent-reaper path with visible cost ("her voice cracked on words she had never spoken"). Accumulative lens holds: the recording, crystals, and atlas page build pressure that culminates in tomorrow's named-fear mission. Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (reaper, observatory, dusk, three days post-discovery). One meaningful deepening when crystallized fears take visible form and reweight her role.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The observatory's frozen brass mechanisms and open dome create spatial coherence; the pedestal where Mira's telescope stood grounds the ritual. The atlas page and recording device are handled across multiple beats and the crystals' scattered light enables the key transformation. Does not reach 9-band: while the setting charges the final image emotionally, no environmental constraint materially alters a choice or tactic on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (how to honor Mira's legacy and transform reaping practice) is signaled early and tightens when crystallized fears take form, narrowing the reaper's path from silent collection to named understanding. The cost is legible: she must speak after two centuries of silence, breaking professional protocol. One clear deepening when the recording's meaning crystallizes, though the actual future application (tomorrow's soul) is framed rather than tested on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (naming fears transforms terror into something faceable) emerges from the atlas-page mapmakers, Mira's recordings, and the crystallization action without thesis statement. The final image—"love was just another name for a fear that had been faced"—reweights prior material through the particular (broken things can still function) and resists tidy resolution by keeping the heartbreak intact. The "echo versus presence" motif deepens rather than decorates.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with clear psychic distance; the reaper's perceptual signature (two-hundred-year memory,职业 silence, the way loss registers physically) is consistent. Diction stays character-particular: "hollow chest," "memorized her footsteps." The single line of quoted dialogue from the reaper ("I miss you") lands with earned weight after sustained silence. Mira's recorded voice carries distinct warmth and observational rhythm that contrasts with the reaper's more formal interior cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully (short "She had also been mortal" after longer setup; the litany structure in "this is loss. This is loneliness"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor density slip: "the terror of being forgotten, the dread of causing pain, the ache of leaving love behind" lists three similar abstract nouns in sequence during a high-pressure beat where one concrete image might sharpen more. Information density is high overall and propulsion holds through the ending.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise (immortal reaper learns to name fears from mortal astronomer wife) synthesizes familiar grief-and-purpose material through the specific atlas-page mapmakers' practice and the crystallization mechanism. The two-hundred-year gap and the choice to break职业 silence offer fresh angle. Does not reach higher band: the emotional arc (finding purpose in loss) follows a recognizable template and the core turn is foreseeable once the recording begins.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Heartbroken reaper present throughout; her grief drives the pilgrimage to the observatory, frames the memory work, and motivates the final commitment to speak and name fears. The heartbreak is embodied (hollow chest, voice cracking) and causally active: it persists at closure and becomes the condition under which she accepts Mira's legacy. Setup early, beats include handling the atlas page and watching crystallization, payoff is the acceptance that "her heart remained broken" yet functional.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Atlas page appears in beat one (withdrawn from robes), beat two (Mira's recorded discussion of mapmakers), and beat three (trembles in reaper's hands, placed beside device at closure). Its sea-monsters motif seeds the theme of naming fears. Does not reach 7+ band: while the object recurs and charges the theme, it does not materially constrain a choice or alter tactics—its role is symbolic resonance rather than causal lever.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Echo of sacrifice (Mira's final gift: "Promise me you'll name them") drives the reaper's acceptance of her new role and the decision to speak to souls. The concept is not merely thematic decoration—it changes the reaper's options by foreclosing silent reaping and installing a new practice. Present in setup (Mira's deathbed), middle reflection, and closure commitment. Does not reach higher band because the sacrifice itself is recounted rather than dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Echoes forgotten phrases: the reaper silently mouths Mira's words from the recording ("her lips moved silently, echoing the forgotten phrases"). This trait appears in one beat and demonstrates her memorial devotion but does not constrain a later choice or create visible cost. The action is described rather than leveraged; it colors her grief without altering tactics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Crystallize: the recording's sound waves catch in prism fragments and fears take visible form as crystalline structures. This action occurs at the story's hinge, transforms the abstract (Mira's voice, terror) into the concrete (shapes the reaper can gather and show), and directly enables the closure plan (tomorrow she will show crystals to a paralyzed soul). Setup in the device and light, beats include the transformation moment and the gathering, payoff is the named-fear mission. High specificity and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Through scattered light: crystals catch dying light (beat one), the recording's sound waves interact with prism fragments to crystallize fears (beat two), and dusk surrenders to starlight at closure. The method is signaled early, its mechanics matter (sound + light → visible form), and it shapes the central transformation. Does not reach higher band because the mechanics are asserted rather than tested or constrained—no failure mode or adjustment required.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Ancient observatory at dusk: location anchors all action, the frozen brass mechanisms and open dome establish Mira's absence, the pedestal provides ritual stage, and dusk-to-night progression paces the emotional arc. The setting supplies the tool (crystals, mechanisms) that enable crystallization and charges the final starlight image with continuity (same stars Mira studied). Does not break 8+ band: while emotionally resonant and spatially coherent, no environmental constraint forces a tactical choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>After finding the old recordings (three days ago): timeframe anchors the present action and explains the reaper's arrival now. The three sleepless nights of memorization demonstrate urgency and cost. Does not develop further—no live clock tightens decisions within the observatory scene, and the "tomorrow" future mission is framed rather than pressured by elapsed time on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>To give names to nameless fears: Mira's deathbed promise drives the reaper to the observatory, the crystallization discovery provides the method, and the closure commitment ("tomorrow, she would find a soul…") enacts the motivation with visible cost (breaking two centuries of silence). Desire is dramatized through the ritual, the trembling atlas page, and the voice crack. Friction between want (to honor Mira) and cost (abandoning silent protocol) is legible.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Distant intimacy: Mira's voice is "impossibly present" yet mediated through a recording, the reaper is alone yet saturated with memory, and the prose maintains formal reserve ("the reaper gathered") while delivering emotional specificity ("her voice cracked"). Tone is consistent across turns, modulates appropriately (cooler mechanical detail for the observatory, warmer cadence for Mira's recorded speech), and charges the final image where stars bridge impossible distances. Exemplary coherence under pressure.</comment>
