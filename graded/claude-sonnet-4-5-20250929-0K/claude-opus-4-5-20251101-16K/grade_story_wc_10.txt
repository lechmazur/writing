<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's interior motivation is clear and sustained—her shift from mourning loss to discovering a new form of expression. The embodied emotion works well in moments like pressing her palm to frosted glass or feeling thermal signatures, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. However, the piece leans heavily on reflective summary rather than micro-choices under immediate pressure; most decisions (bringing tuning forks here, deciding to translate silence) occur in backstory. The final smile feels earned but the path is more contemplative than conflicted in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of discovery through thermal mapping and builds density via repeated tuning-fork experiments that reweight the core stake. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Conceptual Repricing hybrid): Maren's smile and realization that "silence could sing" crystallize her acceptance with visible emotional cost (abandoning her old composer identity). Orientation is clean by the first paragraph. The weakness: no on-page reversal or tightening choice that narrows options mid-scene; the escalation is entirely internal and reflective, which under this lens is acceptable but limits dramatic urgency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory is vividly realized through frosted glass, ice-glazed panels, dormant winter roses, and amber sunset light. Spatial choreography is clear; Maren moves through the space, striking forks and pressing them to glass, wood, earth. The conservatory constrains her method (she needs this controlled environment for thermal observation) and charges the final image (the glass walls holding breath around her). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her new perceptual mode—temperature and vibration take priority over sound.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: to rectify what the ocean broke by translating silence into music. The piece deepens this through accumulating experiments that shift her stance from mourning to acceptance. However, there is no on-page reversal, tightening choice, or moment where options narrow under immediate pressure. The escalation is contemplative—each tuning fork trial adds texture but does not force a trade-off or impose visible cost until the reflective ending. For an Accumulative lens this is functional, but it hovers at the threshold of sufficient pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the thermal-mapping experiments: what silence reveals rather than what it takes. The "unshaken marvels" concept avoids label-speak by grounding in concrete observations (plants flushing with warmth, her chest warming at musical memory). The final image—"silence could sing"—reweights prior material without moralizing, offering a resonant answer to the central question. Subtext operates through the conservatory as both sanctuary and laboratory, grief and discovery held in productive tension. Minor weakness: the grandmother's tuning forks could be charged more specifically rather than serving primarily as inheritance symbol.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, tightly anchored to Maren's perceptual signature: thermal awareness, vibration, visual heat-maps. Diction remains within her voice—technical terms (A-440, infrared, gradient) feel character-earned given her composer background. No head-hopping. The prose modulates appropriately from grief ("familiar grief," "thick, impenetrable glass") to wonder ("bloom of infrared color"). Minor slip: "She'd almost thrown them into the sea" shifts register slightly toward summarized emotion rather than embodied memory, but it's brief and doesn't disrupt the dominant texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift. Information density is high—most lines advance understanding of her method or emotional state. Clarity is strong; no loops or paraphrase cycles detected. The piece avoids filter-verb stacks and maintains propulsion through the experiments. Weakness: some figurative language tilts toward stock metaphor ("silence had descended like a curtain," "silence was not emptiness") and the phrase "unshaken marvels" is named but not fully dramatized as a concept. No major artifacts touch the closure beat, keeping the score in the 7-range.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The synthesis of deafness recovery, thermal imaging, and plant response to vibration is specific and non-obvious. The piece transforms the "artist who loses their primary sense" trope through the heat-mapping method, grounding it in verifiable science (plants do respond to frequency). Maren's progression from grief to discovery feels earned rather than templated. Risk: the piece commits fully to its quiet, reflective mode without hedging. Weakness: the conservatory and tuning forks lean slightly on symbolic convenience (inheritance, sanctuary) without deep integration into causal pressure. Still, the emotional truth and freshness of the thermal-mapping angle elevate it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Capsize survivor is present throughout; the ferry accident frames the entire premise (hearing loss, life reorientation). It enables the core conflict (translating silence into music). However, most choices occur in reflection on that past event rather than in present-scene decisions driven by survivor status. The attribute shapes backstory and motivation but does not force a key turn on the page. Present by end of first third, contributes to closure thematically, but lacks middle development where survivor-specific pressure narrows a choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tuning fork case appears in four distinct moments: arrival at the conservatory, selection of A-440, the near-disposal memory, and the final lap-sitting image. It enables the experiments and reappears with reweighted meaning (from nearly discarded to instrument of discovery). The case itself is less active than the forks within it; the forks do the causal work while the case functions as container and inheritance symbol. Strong setup and closure linkage, modest middle development, good lyric reprise.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Unshaken marvels" is named on the page and thematically present—wonders constant after noise becomes impossible. It frames her discoveries (plants responding to frequency, warmth patterns). However, it functions more as a thematic label than a concept that changes tactics or narrows options. The phrase appears once as definition and then operates implicitly. Not introduced late, but ornamental rather than causal. Lyric resonance without direct causal pressure keeps it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Silently expressive applies to the plants throughout—they respond to vibration without sound. This trait enables Maren's experiments and validates her method. However, it is more attribute of setting than character constraint. The plants' silent expressiveness is observed and measured but does not impose a cost or trade-off on Maren's choices. Present early, functional across beats, but replaceable (any responsive medium would serve). Swappability and lack of direct cost on protagonist lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Rectify is the driving action: she is "determined to rectify what the ocean had broken." This frames her entire project and motivates the thermal-mapping experiments. The word itself appears once, but the action recurs—each tuning fork trial is an attempt to rectify. The final realization redefines what rectify means (not restoration but transformation). Strong setup, present across beats, shapes closure. Weakness: the action is more conceptual goal than distinct physical move; removing "rectify" and substituting "understand" or "transform" would require only minor edits to preserve the arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Heat-mapping emotions is introduced early (touching sister's hand, friend's wrist), demonstrated mechanically (thermal camera, infrared captures), and drives the middle experiments (watching branches flush with warmth). The method shapes every attempt and is essential to the closure realization (thermal signatures as silent music). Present in setup, development, and payoff; mechanics matter and enable the story's core discovery. High causal involvement and irreplaceability; only minor friction is that the method is slightly told in the early examples rather than shown in real-time resistance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory is introduced in the opening line, houses all action, provides the plants and controlled environment necessary for thermal observation, and charges the final image ("glass walls glazed with frost," "held its breath around her"). It constrains her method (she needs this space for the experiments) and supplies symbolic resonance (cathedral, frozen sanctuary). Setup, development, payoff all present; environment alters tactics and is indispensable to the story's logic and tone. Only minor swappability: a greenhouse would serve similar function, but "winterglass" specificity and the frost/coldness motif are meaningfully integrated.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The timeframe "after noise becomes impossible" is signaled immediately (six months post-capsize, irreversible nerve damage). It sets the permanent condition that drives the plot and closes off restoration as an option. However, time does not tighten decisions within the scene; there is no live clock or urgency. The "after" is a static state rather than a progressing constraint. Strong setup and thematic presence, but lacks development pressure where time narrows tactics. Lyric permanence rather than escalating deadline.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation to translate silence into music is explicit ("her motivation was madness, perhaps: to translate silence into music"), dramatized through repeated experiments, and tested against her grief (she "mourned what that silence had taken"). Desire and cost are both visible: she gave up her composer identity and is rebuilding through a new form. The friction between wanting restoration and accepting transformation is present. Setup, development, closure all engaged; the motivation drives choices and charges the final realization. Minor weakness: slightly told in the opening rather than discovered through failed attempts on the page.</comment>
