<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is vivid and technically grounded ("engineer, trained in mechanics and wave theory"), but her emotional arc relies heavily on unearned epiphany—"She had never believed...But she was also her grandmother's granddaughter" reads as convenient pivot rather than dramatized contradiction. The phrase "logically emotional" is deployed as label rather than shown through on-page choices where emotion and logic clash with cost. Micro-choices exist (running fingers along the key, climbing stairs) but fear and wonder are declared more than embodied in competing impulses that force tradeoffs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration: Maren becomes the key's "true keeper" through understanding vibrational matching, with the cost legible in her weeping and the relinquishment of pure engineering skepticism. The inferred lens is Causal-Accumulative Hybrid; the key's mechanics unfold through motivated discovery, and the lighthouse's response narrows Harvester options. Orientation anchors quickly (lighthouse base, marina, Maren). One meaningful tightening occurs when the Harvesters approach, forcing the climb and key-turn. The cost—grief released, identity shifted—is felt but somewhat abstract; the phrase "ordinary devotion" in retrospect adds conceptual weight without a sharp on-page forfeiture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is sensory and specific ("each sheet of frozen water singing its particular frequency," channels opening and closing), and the lighthouse mechanism is grounded in maintenance detail. The key constrains the climax choice—it must match the lighthouse housing—meeting the 9+ gate in principle. However, spatial choreography of the Harvesters' vessel and ice channels remains somewhat abstract; we see effect (vessel drifts away) but not the micro-geography that would make redirection visceral. The azure coat recurs but does not alter a choice, reading ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect the sacred artifact from Harvesters) is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening: the twenty-minute window and the climb force the key-turn decision. Agency is clear—Maren acts, the lighthouse responds, the Harvesters are defeated—but the escalation is compressed into a single pivot without a prior failed attempt or visible trade-off that narrows later options. The cost is the shift from skeptic to keeper, legible but more identity-reconfiguration than tactical forfeiture. Coincidence does not resolve; the key's properties were established.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—belief through understanding, the sacred in the ordinary—emerges from the key's mechanics and Maren's maintenance work rather than assertion. The final image (key humming gratitude, ancestors singing back) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. "Sonic absolution" reweights from superstition to physics with conceptual cost (Maren's prior worldview). Minor slip: "logically emotional" and "Feel everything, then think through the feeling" verge on thematic echo, but the lived detail (weeping, bone-hum) grounds it enough to avoid full penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (engineer's lens: "wave theory," "prisms," "frequency"). Diction is controlled and rhythmic, with purposeful modulation ("The key sings when it finds its match" shifts to technical realization). Minor register drift: "logically emotional" and "vibrational matching" in interiority feel slightly over-articulated for mid-crisis thought, bordering on expository self-awareness. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance tightens appropriately during the climb and key-turn.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative density is high but mostly coherent ("voices of the dying light," "flesh holding light, matter containing music"). Three prose artifacts lower the score: (1) paraphrase loop—"She had never believed" / "love had its own logic" restates the pivot without added pressure; (2) template cadence in the penultimate paragraph ("already planning...already listening"); (3) stock metaphor "the sun bled gold" in the opening. Information density is strong in the lighthouse mechanism; no causality breaks. The artifacts do not touch the closure beat directly but appear in the final third, triggering the 9+ disqualifier and capping high-band entries at 8.8 globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse-as-resonance-chamber and engineer-turned-believer is specific and earned in hindsight. However, the core premise—mystical artifact + skeptic protagonist + forced conversion under threat—maps closely to a standard template without a bold structural or moral transformation. The vibrational-matching mechanics add specificity, but the Harvesters remain abstract antagonists (dark-hulled, predatory) without distinct pressure. Risk-taking is moderate; the story commits to its premise but does not subvert or complicate the conversion arc in a non-obvious way.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren (azure-coat lighthouse engineer) is present throughout, drives the key-turn decision (setup, development, payoff), and her engineer identity shapes her realization of frequency mechanics. Her maintenance knowledge is causally active. However, "azure coat" is ornamental (appears twice, does not constrain choice), and her role could be filled by "skeptical technician" with minor edits. The coat and specific profession add texture but not irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The crypt keeper's key is handled in multiple beats (pressed to chest, fingers along teeth, slid into lighthouse), its microscopic ridges enable the climax, and it recurs in the ending with reweighted meaning (burden → partnership). Setup early, development through tactile discovery, payoff in the lighthouse song and final hum. Specificity high: the key's tuning is unique. Cost linkage moderate: Maren's shift is tied to understanding the key, but the key itself does not impose a visible price (e.g., exhaustion, pain) at the moment of use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Sonic absolution is named, explained ("release of grief through perfect harmonic convergence"), and demonstrated (Maren weeps, the lighthouse sings, ancestors respond). It shapes the climax tactic (key-turn) and charges the ending. However, it is more thematic frame than on-page constraint—Maren does not wrestle with competing absolution methods or pay a visible cost to invoke it. Present in setup and payoff, but middle development is thin; the concept could be swapped for "harmonic defense" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Logically emotional" is named twice ("logically emotional, as her grandmother had called it" and "Feel everything, then think through the feeling") but functions as label rather than trait with on-page friction. Maren's fear and wonder coexist, but no scene shows logic enabling emotion or emotion correcting logic with visible cost. The attribute is ornamental, illustrating theme rather than constraining a choice. Late signal (first appears mid-story), no middle development, and summary-only in the ending reflection.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Adapt" is signaled early ("She had to adapt"), drives the key realization and lighthouse activation (middle development), and the ice-channel redirection embodies adaptation at climax (payoff). However, the action is somewhat generic—Maren adapts *through understanding*, which is the story's method, not a distinct physical or tactical move. Swappable with "solve" or "respond" without major structural edits. Two gates (signal, payoff) plus modest causal role place it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Through vibrational matching" is signaled mid-story ("Not a metaphor...Frequency. Vibrational matching"), shapes the climax tactic (key's teeth resonate with lighthouse housing), and appears in the ending reflection ("adapted through vibrational matching"). Setup slightly late (~35% mark), but development is strong—the method enables the only successful tactic—and payoff is explicit. Specificity high: the ridges and frequencies are detailed. Cost linkage moderate: Maren's weeping and identity shift are tied to the harmonic effect, but no tactical price (e.g., vulnerability during the song) is shown.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is vivid (setup: "sheets of frozen water singing," channels, amber glow), and the ice's response to the lighthouse song alters Harvesters' tactics (development and payoff: channels close/open, vessel redirected). Specificity strong. However, the marina is more stage than constraint—Maren's climb and key-turn would work in any lighthouse setting; the ice's tactical role is summary ("The ice around them began to shift"). Lyric reprise (opening image → ending "marina settled into night") reweights meaning but does not narrow a protagonist choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The fleeting golden sunset is signaled early ("twenty minutes...of fleeting golden sunset before darkness"), creates urgency in the setup, and the story tracks the light's collapse ("golden light collapsed into purple dusk"). However, the twenty-minute clock is not re-checked during the climb or key-turn, and darkness does not alter Maren's tactics—she succeeds before it becomes a problem. Timeframe complicates but does not constrain. Two gates (setup, light-change at climax) but minimal causal pressure; swappable with "approaching storm" or "dwindling fuel."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The motivation to protect the sacred artifact is explicit ("the artifact that now called enemies across the frozen waters"), dramatized through the Harvesters' approach and Maren's choice to act, and sustained to closure (artifact safe, Maren becomes true keeper). Setup, development (climb and key-turn are protective acts), and payoff all present. Friction exists between Maren's skepticism and her love-driven duty, creating internal tension. However, the cost of protection (grief released, identity shift) is more gift than sacrifice; no on-page moment shows Maren choosing protection *over* a competing want with visible loss.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Fleshly ethereal" tone is coherent: physical detail (azure coat, leather cord, glass, spiral stairs) anchors mystical elements (ancestors' voices, harmonic convergence, bones humming). The tone modulates with pressure—technical in the setup, reverent at the key-turn, lyric in the ending ("flesh holding light, matter containing music"). However, the tone is static across turns; the Harvesters' threat does not roughen or quicken the prose. The final image charges well, but mid-story beats (climb, key discovery) maintain the same elevated lyricism without variation, trending toward decorative rather than pressure-responsive.</comment>
