<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's character is grounded in concrete abilities (ocean-spray archivist, reactively visionary) and her choices drive the arc—returning despite exile, working through pain, releasing findings strategically. Her motivations are clear and intensify under pressure, though the piece leans heavily on summarized progression ("week after week") rather than dramatizing a pivotal micro-choice in scene. The grandmother's trumpet valve anchors her personal stake, and the final stance at the harbor's edge earns its weight, but the middle stretch compresses agency into report rather than on-page friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is secure early (Ivory Harbor, Mira, archivist returning from exile). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: fragments accrue meaning through staggered contact until the mass-pardon revelation reweights the dominant stake. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration—Mira's final stance at the harbor acknowledges ongoing decay while affirming witness as purpose, a quiet Charged Poise that reconfigures her role from restorer to navigator of absences. Cost is conceptual and felt (incomplete archives, persistent decay), though the ending risks drifting into theme assertion rather than a single charged image. One meaningful deepening (pardon discovery) tightens stakes, but the summary-heavy middle blurs causal specificity.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Ivory Harbor is vividly anchored—pale stone, sea-stained walls, the trumpet valve on her desk—and the rain bookends (opening/closing) charge the final image with renewal and erasure. The archive's chaos (crates, fragments, ledgers) grounds her work spatially. Setting constrains choices (touch-rest cycles, sea's relentless work) and the harbor's edge at closure reconfigures the opening gangway moment, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Minor deduction: the middle workspaces remain generic beyond "desk" and "archive building."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—compiling fragments into meaning, restoring suppressed truth—is signaled early and coheres throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira discovers the mass pardon, raising emotional and social stakes. Her method (staggered intervals, touch-rest-vision) constrains her tactics visibly, and the final rain scene reconfigures her goal from restoration to navigation with felt cost (incompleteness remains). However, the middle progression is summarized ("week after week") rather than dramatized as a live reversal, and the "hearken" payoff (families' reactions) reads more as reported consequence than on-page pressure that forces a trade-off in Mira's choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—witness to erasure, meaning in absences—emerges organically through image (trumpet valve, water-washed stone, fragmented records) and action (touch-vision cycles, releasing findings in intervals). The ending offers a resonant answer: "even the erased leave traces, and even the lost deserve witness," which grows from concrete particulars rather than assertion. Subtext operates in the herald's silenced voice, the pardon's suppression, and Mira's own exile-and-return arc. Minor penalty: the penultimate paragraph edges toward stated moral ("meaning did not require wholeness"), though the rain image rescues closure by embodying rather than explaining the theme.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mira, with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature (archivist's eye, reactive visions, oceanic metaphors). Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("gleamed like bone," "ocean-spray archivist," "detritus of three overthrown governments"). No dialogue appears, so those bullets are waived. Filter verbs ("found," "watched") are functional and voice-appropriate. Minor slip: a few late sentences drift toward essayistic register ("Meaning did not require wholeness. Sometimes meaning was what grew in the spaces between.") that leans exposition over embodied perception, though the frame recovers with the rain image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is clean, rhythmically varied, and imagistically strong ("gleamed like bone," "the relentless breath of the sea," "a people without roots"). Information density is high in the opening and closing thirds. Sentence openings vary, and figurative language is purposeful. However, the middle section employs summary-heavy scaffolding ("Week after week, she compiled fragments into meaning") and near-paraphrase loops (the "staggered intervals" method is repeated descriptively without new pressure). Template cadence in the consequence cascade ("A schoolteacher brought…A young mother named…") creates a list rhythm that slightly dulls momentum. No filter-verb stacks or closure-touching artifacts, so 9+ remains globally eligible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of archivist-as-witness, reactive visions, and political erasure feels specific and non-obvious; the herald's trumpet valve and "navigated absences" frame avoid generic fantasy-of-competence. The mass-pardon twist and the final reconfiguration (restoration → navigation) arise from established particulars. Minor deduction: the arc's emotional beats (families weeping, shoulders straightening) lean toward familiar redemption-through-recovery territory, and the middle progression summarizes rather than dramatizing a bold risk. The piece transforms its materials but does not take structural or perspectival risks that heighten stakes beyond the premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira (ocean-spray archivist) drives all key turns: returns despite exile, chooses to work through visions' pain, discovers the pardon, releases findings strategically, and redefines her purpose at closure. Present in opening, middle discovery, and final stance. High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The trumpet valve appears in opening (pocket), middle (desk reminder), and closing (late-night echo beat). It anchors Mira's personal stake (grandmother's voice) and the theme of silenced witness. However, its charged reprise in the final paragraph ("hold it and feel the faintest echo") does not reappear in the closure image at the harbor; the rain and stone take that role. Lyric resonance present, but not indispensable to the ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Navigated absences" shapes the entire arc: touch-vision cycles, charting silences, mapping gaps, and the final reconfiguration ("navigation" not "restoration"). It constrains Mira's tactics (staggered intervals, reading what's missing) and charges the ending image. The concept is both method and theme, present in at least three beats and essential to closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Reactively visionary" enables her archive work (visions triggered by touch) and constrains her method (rest cycles, headaches). Signaled early, used across multiple work beats, and shapes her unique capability. However, the cost (headaches, slow pace) is stated more than dramatized in a pivotal choice; the trait reads more as tool than dilemma. Present in setup, middle, and implied at closure, but swappable with "psychometric" or similar without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Hearten" arrives late (middle-to-end) as consequence of Mira's work: families' shoulders straighten, fisherman weeps, teacher brings students, mother names daughter. It redefines the stakes from information recovery to emotional restoration and charges the thematic turn. However, the action is reported rather than dramatized as a live scene, and it does not appear in the final closure image at the harbor. Essential to the thematic payoff but not causally active in the ending beat itself.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Staggered intervals" is signaled early, repeated across work beats (touch, vision, rest, repeat), and constrains Mira's pace and method visibly. It shapes her tactics and mirrors the story's own structure (accumulative, patterned). Present in setup, middle, and implied by the ongoing work at closure. However, it reads more as constraint on method than driver of a key turn; removing "staggered" would not break the pardon discovery or final stance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Ivory Harbor appears in opening (gangway, pale stone), middle (archive building overlooking harbor), and closing (harbor's edge in rain). The rain bookend charges the final image (washing clean, preparing surface). Setting provides spatial coherence and thematic resonance (sea's patient work, decay). However, the harbor does not constrain a middle choice or alter tactics; it serves as backdrop and lyric frame rather than pressure. Strong closure participation lifts score into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After the exile ends" frames the entire arc (return, letter, seven years away) and signals the political shift that allows her work. Time anchors the opening beat and the anniversary reprise at closure. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions in scene; "week after week" compresses the middle without live clock pressure. Present in setup and closure but does not constrain tactics or narrow options in a dramatized beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"To compile fragments into meaning" is Mira's explicit goal, dramatized through touch-vision cycles, pardon discovery, and family revelations. It drives every major beat and undergoes transformation at closure (compilation → navigation, meaning in absences). The friction between desire (wholeness) and cost (incompleteness, ongoing decay) is felt and resolved. High causal pressure and closure linkage; indispensable to story logic.</comment>
