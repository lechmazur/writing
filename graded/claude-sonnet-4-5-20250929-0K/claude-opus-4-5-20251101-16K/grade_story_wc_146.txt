<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The bell tuner remains cryptic throughout, but her interiority is absent—we observe her actions without access to contradictory impulses or embodied emotion under pressure. The seventeen townsfolk exist as collective backdrop rather than individuated characters applying pressure. The mayor's brief confrontation offers a moment of stakes articulation, but the tuner's response ("Revivals must begin before the final breath") reads more as thematic statement than character-revealing choice under duress. No micro-choices with visible cost appear on the page; her three-year arc is summarized rather than dramatized through conflicted decisions.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation cleanly (town, archway, seventeen souls, dawn arrival) and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the tuner measures, rebuilds, teaches rhythm, rings bells, and the town repopulates. The closure image—"She taught us to tune ourselves"—offers Conceptual Repricing, reweighting the premise from external restoration to internalized capacity. However, the three-year span compresses all meaningful turns into summary ("In her second month, she began to rebuild"), and no single beat dramatizes a cost or constraint that narrows options. The ending articulates theme but does not charge prior material with a felt price; the concept is restated rather than reconfigured through image or action.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ancient archway, cobblestones, and bell tower are signaled early and recur with purpose; the archway frames arrivals and the cobblestones become an acoustic instrument that constrains the tuner's method (mapping via footsteps). Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered: "ebony tuning fork so dark it seemed to swallow light," "wild hush of early mornings." Spatial choreography remains clear across the three-year span. The setting actively enables the restoration method and charges the closure image ("footsteps on the cobblestones weaving their ancient rhythm"), satisfying the Q3 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—town survival versus extinction—is signaled early and remains coherent. The mayor's confrontation ("We're dying here") articulates urgency, and the tuner's explanation ("Revivals must begin before the final breath") clarifies the temporal constraint. However, escalation occurs off-page: the tuner's patient work unfolds in summary across months, and no on-page reversal or tightening dramatizes a narrowing of options. The resolution (town grows to forty-three souls) is reported rather than shown through a protagonist choice with visible cost. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen via density or cadence shift; instead, the arc is told in outline.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—restoration of shared balance, the town as instrument, the interplay of sound and silence—emerges through concrete particulars (bells, footsteps, frequencies) rather than assertion. The final exchange ("She taught us to tune ourselves") offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. However, the tuner's motivation is stated explicitly mid-story ("to restore shared balance—between sound and silence, between community and solitude") rather than discovered through conflict, and the clockmaker's widow delivers a thematic summary in the final beat. The piece invites reflection, but the ending leans toward explanation rather than charged image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with a slight omniscient ease (the tuner's thoughts are summarized, not accessed; townsfolk are observed collectively). Diction is controlled and consistent: "wild hush," "acoustic bones," "frequencies." Dialogue is sparse but purposeful, carrying subtext in the mayor's demand and the tuner's enigmatic replies. The child's question and the widow's answer provide thematic closure without voice rupture. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; the perceptual signature is coherent. The narrative distance broadens across three years without losing clarity, though it remains observational rather than intimate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally ("Tap-tap-tap. Pause. Tap-tap."), and opening lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high in the first half (seventeen souls, forty-two bells, thirty years of silence, cryptic tuner, ebony fork); the second half summarizes the arc with less propulsion. Two minor loops: "No one knew where she came from. She spoke little, answered questions with questions" is echoed in "cryptic woman" and later "departed as cryptically as she'd arrived." The phrase "ancient archway" recurs five times, functional as anchor but slightly overused. No grammar, tense, or pronoun errors; clarity is maintained throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—restoration specialist arrives before collapse—transforms the familiar dying-town trope through specificity: acoustic architecture, bells as frequencies, footsteps as tuning method. The tuner's patient, methodical approach and the town-as-instrument conceit feel fresh. However, the arc follows a predictable template: mysterious stranger arrives, heals the community through enigmatic knowledge, departs once transformation is complete. The emotional truth of collective renewal is authentic, but the narrative template is widely used. Transformation is present but not radical; the story executes its concept cleanly without bold structural risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The bell tuner is present from the opening line and drives the restoration arc across all three years, shaping every major turn (arrival, measurement, rebuild, teaching, bell-ringing, departure). However, her choices are summarized rather than dramatized—no on-page beat shows her deciding between competing options with visible cost. She appears in the closure frame indirectly (the widow's dialogue references her teaching), but her agency at that moment is retrospective. Present across beats and causally essential, but the lack of on-page decision pressure and the summary treatment of her three-year work limit integration. Two gates met (setup, payoff via retrospective mention), middle development is summarized; cap guidance ~4.6. Causal involvement is clear but not dramatized with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The ebony tuning fork is introduced in the opening paragraph with charged specificity ("so dark it seemed to swallow light") and reappears in two distinct beats: the mayor finds the tuner pressing it to the archway stone, and it is "tucked away" at her departure. The fork enables the tuning method (struck against bells, pressed to stone) and signals the tuner's expertise. However, its use is described rather than dramatized—no beat shows a choice constrained by the fork's properties or a cost tied to its use. Present in setup and closure frame, with middle touch; two-plus gates suggest eligibility near 6.0, but lack of causal pressure or cost connection and the static treatment lower the score. Lyric reprise is present but does not reweight meaning.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Ghost town revival is the story's engine: the town's decline (seventeen souls, young leaving, "collapses into nothing") frames the opening stakes, and the restoration arc (bells tuned, promenades taught, population grows to forty-three) drives every major beat. The tuner's motivation ("Revivals must begin before the final breath") articulates the concept explicitly, and her methods (acoustic mapping, bell tuning, rhythm teaching) are shaped by the revival goal. The closure image—the widow's confirmation that self-tuning has been learned—demonstrates that revival is complete and internalized. All three gates met with strong causal pressure and closure linkage; the concept is indispensable and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Infinite patience is signaled early ("infinitely patient") and demonstrated through the tuner's month-long walking ritual and three-year commitment. It enables her method (measuring via footsteps, working in "wild hush of early mornings") and contrasts with the town's urgency (mayor's "We're dying here"). The trait shapes her approach and implicitly costs her three years, but no on-page beat dramatizes a moment where impatience would have broken the work or where patience exacts a visible tradeoff. Present in setup and payoff, with middle demonstration; the trait is causally relevant and contributes to closure, but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page. Lyric consistency across the arc supports integration near the boundary of 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rebuild is the story's central action: the tuner "began to rebuild" frequencies in month two, climbs the tower to file bells and adjust clappers, and the restoration enables the solstice ringing that draws returnees. The action drives the middle arc and enables the closure effect (town repopulation, internalized rhythm). All three gates met: signaled early ("Not buildings—those still stood"), dramatized in the tower sequence, and its outcome (bells singing, people returning) shapes the ending. Swapping "rebuild" for "repair" or "restore" would not break the logic, limiting irreplaceability slightly. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage push this into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The rhythm of footsteps on cobblestones is introduced as the tuner's measurement method in the first third ("via the rhythm of footsteps on cobblestones, she was mapping the town's acoustic bones"), demonstrated in the promenade teaching ("evening promenades... the stones began to sing back"), and reprised in the closure image ("footsteps on the cobblestones weaving their ancient rhythm"). The method constrains her approach (requires walking, patience, communal participation) and enables the final effect (architecture remembers, town tunes itself). All three gates met with high specificity and irreplaceability; removing this exact method would collapse the story's logic. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and cost (three years, communal coordination required).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The ancient archway is present from the opening line ("came through the ancient archway at dawn"), reappears in the promenade sequence ("through the ancient archway"), and frames arrivals (tuner, returnees, the young couple). The tuner presses her fork to the archway stone, suggesting it is part of the acoustic architecture. It anchors spatial movement and recurs in the final third as returnees pass through it. All three gates met; the archway provides a spatial anchor and participates in the acoustic logic. However, it does not constrain a choice or force a cost—it functions as threshold and symbol rather than active pressure. Present across beats and in closure frame with purposeful recurrence, but causal role is ambient.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Before the collapse" is articulated by the tuner ("Revivals must begin before the final breath. A ghost town cannot be restored. Only a dying one") and frames the story's urgency: the town is at seventeen souls, "maybe two" years from collapse. The timeframe constrains the tuner's strategy (she must act now) and justifies her three-year commitment. The ending demonstrates success: population grows, collapse is averted. All three gates met with clear causal pressure. The time window is not tracked beat-by-beat, but its presence shapes the stakes and the closure effect. Specificity (not yet ghost, still dying) matters; removing this frame would weaken the logic.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>To restore shared balance is stated explicitly by the tuner mid-story ("her motivation, she explained, was to restore shared balance—between sound and silence, between community and solitude") and drives her actions (tuning bells, teaching rhythm, organizing promenades). The motivation is present at closure when the widow confirms self-tuning has been learned, demonstrating balance achieved. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized—no beat shows the tuner choosing balance over a competing goal or paying a cost to maintain it. Setup and payoff gates met, middle development is implied but not shown. Causal role is clear but lacks on-page friction or tradeoff; the motivation functions as thesis rather than lived choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Wild hush is introduced in the tuner's work ("the wild hush of early mornings") and recurs as tonal anchor: the town's silence, the "held breath" quality, the bells' eventual song emerging from quiet. The tone modulates from desolation (seventeen souls, empty buildings) through patient restoration to beauty and modest celebration. The closure image—bells singing, footsteps weaving rhythm—sustains the tone without rupture. Setup and closure gates met; the tone is coherent and charges the final effect. However, "wild hush" as phrase appears once and is not reprised at closure, limiting its direct integration. The tone is maintained through diction and pacing rather than explicit recurrence, supporting mid-6 integration.</comment>
