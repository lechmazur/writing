<question>1</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Marden's motivation is concrete and embodied through the leaf blower ritual, grounded in memory without sentiment. The interiority carries genuine contradiction—"mournfully eager"—and his actions show consistent character logic. The family members remain somewhat thin, serving primarily as reaction vessels, but their grief reads as credible. The final choice (releasing the pull cord, completing the haunting) feels earned by the prior causality and forecloses the path with visible cost.</comment>

<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: sound patterns build pressure, the wind softens calcified silence, and the closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the family speaks his name, the wife hums—Charged Poise where grief transforms into memory). Orientation anchors quickly (echo chamber tunnel, afterlife frame, family house). One meaningful deepening occurs when the lullabies thread through the mechanical roar and reach the daughters, reweighting the stake from abstract tending to concrete restoration. Cost is legible: Marden's presence dissolves ("just mourning, and then just memory, and then—"), and the tunnel grows quiet but full.</comment>

<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The echo chamber tunnel functions as micro-setting that shapes the protagonist's tactics: sounds "lived twice," the mechanical roar "magnified, transformed," and the wind finds "cracks in the world" to reach the family. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (plastic worn by grip, heating vents, window frames). The house setting supports the daughters' avoidance and the wife's stillness. The final quiet—"full instead of hollow"—charges the closure image, but the tunnel itself remains somewhat abstract and could be more physically constraining.</comment>

<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—restoring lost laughter—is signaled early and tightens through the accumulative textural method: Marden macerates silence, threads lullabies through wind, and the family begins to breathe again. One meaningful pressure point: the youngest daughter hears the tune and laughs, then the older daughter texts, then the wife hums. Agency is decision and endurance (conducting until "the work complete"), and the cost is his dissolution. No antagonist is required under this lens; the calcified silence provides coherent pressure that the protagonist transforms with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: "tending to the unspoken," the calcified silence, the gaps between "I love you" never said. The leaf blowers as instruments of restoration—ridiculous and sacred—avoid symbolic convenience because they're seeded in memory and return with mechanical purpose. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "a haunting...not the kind that terrorizes, but the kind that heals." One minor slip: "the kind that heals" edges toward direct statement, though the prior image ("a conductor took his bow") earns it. The conceptual repricing (haunting as restoration) reweights the premise without moralizing.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited holds cleanly to Marden's focalization with one purposeful structural expansion: brief omniscient glimpses into the family (daughters texting, wife at the window) that read as Marden perceiving through the membrane. Voice carries distinct texture ("sounds lived twice—once as utterance, once as ghost") and modulates under pressure. Diction occasionally elevates beyond the blue-collar dad register ("macerate," "permeable"), creating minor register drift. Dialogue is minimal but functional ("Remember how Dad used to do the leaf blower thing?" / "So stupid."). Psychic distance shifts are intentional and serve the hybrid POV frame.</comment>

<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "The plastic was worn where his living palm had gripped it a thousand times" = prop, memory, embodiment). Two distinct artifacts lower the score: (1) near-paraphrase loop in the opening ("Every autumn Saturday...A ridiculous tradition. A sacred one" restates without added pressure), and (2) slight overwriting in the closure sequence ("mournfully eager until the very end, and then just mourning, and then just memory, and then—" reads as synonym churn). Otherwise, no filter-verb stacks, clear propulsion, and the final image ("a conductor took his bow") lands cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>The synthesis—afterlife + leaf blower symphony + healing haunting—feels specific and non-obvious, avoiding the cliché "ghost solves family grief" template by grounding the method in a lived ritual. The tending-to-the-unspoken premise transforms a stock haunting through the mechanical/lyrical hybrid (wind + lullabies). Risk-taking (the echo chamber frame, the textural escalation method) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor deduction: the "half-sung lullabies" and "cracks in the world" gestures approach familiar metaphor territory, and the final moral frame ("the kind that heals") slightly reduces ambiguity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Marden ("leaf blower symphony conductor") drives all key turns: he grips the pull cord, conducts the symphony, threads the lullabies, and releases the cord when "the work complete." His choices alter tactics (from mechanical roar to humming) and enable the closure (family speaks his name, wife hums). Setup early, development across multiple beats, payoff at the ending. Strong causal pressure and irreplaceability; no other character could fulfill this role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The pull cord handle appears in two distinct beats: Marden grips it ("plastic was worn where his living palm had gripped it a thousand times"), pulls it to start the blowers, and releases it at the end ("Let it swing from the machine like a pendulum finally at rest"). Setup and payoff are clear; the handle recurs with reweighted meaning (pendulum = rest). Moderate causal pressure (enables the action) and closure linkage. Could score higher if the handle constrained a mid-scene choice rather than serving as instrumental object only.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>"Tending to the unspoken" is signaled early ("that was his purpose now") and shapes all tactics: Marden targets the "I love you" never said, the unresolved fight, the jokes that died. The concept changes options (he cannot speak directly, so he macerates silence via wind and lullabies). Payoff: the daughters speak his name aloud, the wife hums—making the unspoken audible again. Strong causal pressure, closure participation, and irreplaceability; the story's logic hinges on this exact concept.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>"Mournfully eager" is named once early ("Mournfully eager to return something he'd taken") and reprised late ("mournfully eager until the very end"). The attribute colors his stance but does not visibly constrain an on-page action with felt cost. It reads more as emotional coloring than a trait that alters a choice. Lyric reprise without middle development; reaches mid-band via early seed + final return that reweights tone, but lacks the causal pressure for higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>"Macerate" drives the key turn: "The competing winds of each blower began to macerate the silence...made it permeable." This action enables the lullabies to reach the family and triggers the daughters' laughter. Setup (blowers roar), development (maceration softens silence), payoff (family breathes again). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Could score higher if the action involved visible cost or constraint; as written, it succeeds without friction.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>"Via half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind" is signaled early (Marden hummed when daughters were small) and becomes the method in the middle beat: "Marden began to hum...his voice threaded through the mechanical howl." The method shapes tactics (lullabies + wind reach through cracks) and enables closure (youngest daughter hears the tune, family laughs). Setup, development, and payoff all present. Moderate irreplaceability; another childhood sound could substitute, but the lullaby fits the character.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>The "echo chamber tunnel" frames the entire story (setup early, present throughout, final image "a tunnel made of echoes"). It provides the mechanism (sounds "lived twice," "magnified, transformed") that enables Marden's work. The setting supplies resources (amplification, reach through cracks) but does not visibly constrain a choice or force a tradeoff. Strong setup and closure participation, but the tunnel remains somewhat abstract and does not pressure tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>"After the final grain slips through the hourglass" anchors the timeframe early (Marden is dead, family is grieving "for months"). The daughters avoid the study, the wife stares at cold coffee—time has calcified the silence. Payoff: "that night" the daughters speak his name. The timeframe provides context but does not tighten decisions; Marden's work unfolds without a live clock forcing urgency. Lyric reprise (hourglass → "pendulum finally at rest") reweights the image at closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>"To restore lost laughter to a household" is dramatized early (family moving "like they were afraid to disturb the grief") and drives all choices: Marden macerates silence, hums lullabies, conducts the blowers until the work is complete. The motivation faces friction (the silence has "grown thick as walls") and cost (Marden dissolves after success). Payoff: the daughters laugh, text each other, speak his name. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and visible cost tied to the desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>"True haunting" (tending rather than terrorizing) is taught early ("not the kind that terrorizes, but the kind that heals") and modulates with pressure: the mechanical roar, the wind threading through cracks, the family's gradual thawing. Tone remains coherent through turns (grief → lullabies → laughter → dissolution) and charges the final image ("a conductor took his bow"). The coherence is strong, though the explicit naming of the haunting type in the final third slightly reduces subtlety.</comment>
