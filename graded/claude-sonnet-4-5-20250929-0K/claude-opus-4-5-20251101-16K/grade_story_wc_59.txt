<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Aldric's obsession is embodied through concrete details (unwashed, alchemical stains, fungal cultivation) and his scientific method shapes choices. The final acceptance—"You're wrong and you're beautiful"—marks a shift earned by the flawed hatching. However, the interiority relies on stock phrasing ("trembled," "threatened to shatter") and the character's internal contradiction between perfectionism and acceptance arrives cleanly without messier struggle in the peak moment. The decision to sing lacks sufficient dramatic friction beforehand, reading as the correct hypothesis rather than a desperate gamble with visible psychological cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (palace, prince, laboratory), and the dominant stake—reviving extinct beauty—drives the single-scene arc clearly under a Causal lens. The escalation from assembly to singing to hatching shows because/therefore linkage. Closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: he accepts the flaw, refuses to show the bird yet) with visible cost: the bird is wrong, his triumph incomplete, his message deferred. The cost is felt but could be sharper; the final paragraph's declaration "He would show them" slightly dilutes the acceptance by promising future vindication, introducing a micro-hedge that weakens the renunciation's finality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The suspended palace, bioluminescent fungi, and crystalline spires establish vivid atmosphere with sensory specificity. The palace's groaning and swaying recur to underscore precarity, and the fungi provide working light that shapes the scene's hue. The setting pressures Aldric's isolation and the "threads" metaphor seeds the thematic stakes. The egg's physical handling (velvet cradle, turned beneath fungal light) grounds key moments. Strong work, but the setting doesn't constrain a tactical choice at closure—the bird's emergence and Aldric's reaction would play identically in any isolated lab.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—revive one voice of extinct beauty—is signaled early and pursued throughout. Assembly, hypothesis refinement, and the singing gamble create meaningful tightening under the Causal lens, narrowing options until only faith remains. The flawed hatching introduces a reversal (success but imperfect), and Aldric's acceptance/"perhaps that's enough" pays a visible price: his dream compromised, his proof ambiguous. However, the escalation lacks a mid-scene complication that forces him to abandon a tool or method; the apparatus works on first attempt, and singing succeeds without dramatized failure or adjustment, reducing the felt struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—beauty emerging imperfectly, flaw as preciousness—arises from concrete action (the three-winged bird, discordant song) rather than assertion. The closing image of "broken-perfect song" and the line "The flaw was what made it precious" integrate earned insight with sensory particulars. The mechanical-world contrast provides thematic pressure without didacticism. One slip: "perfection wasn't the point" in the antepenultimate paragraph edges toward moralizing, and "The ache was what made the sweetness matter" abstracts the lesson slightly. The piece resists full tidiness by keeping the bird wrong and the prince's mission incomplete, which strengthens resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, and the prince's perceptual filter (scientific terminology, hypothesis-driven observation) distinguishes his voice. Psychic distance modulates appropriately during the egg's glow and crack. However, several lines drift into elevated register inconsistent with his bedraggled, obsessed state: "ironic, using the enemy's tools," "What transforms stillness into life?" reads writerly rather than spontaneous thought under pressure. The final paragraph's tidy declarations ("He would remind them…") flatten urgency. Diction such as "quaking reverie" and "bitterly sweet" feel imposed rather than organically emerging from his vocabulary during crisis.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and clarity is high; no pronoun confusion or tense breaks. Information density is solid in the assembly sequence. Weaknesses: paraphrase loop in "threatened to shatter. Fear moved through him like an earthquake" restates emotional state. Stock metaphors cluster: "threads," "ship at sea," "earthquake through stone." The opening's "groaning," "creaked like a ship" recur without evolution. Template cadence appears in "He placed…He connected…" and "trembled…threatened…moved." Figurative density in high-pressure beats (hatching sequence) includes "colors that had no names," "bitterly sweet," "broken-perfect," layering metaphor without clear propulsion. Apply −0.6 for loops and stock metaphor, −0.3 for template stems, total −0.9 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The flawed-genesis angle and suspended-palace setting offer fresh visual particulars, and the mechanical-world backstory provides thematic contrast. The three-winged, asymmetric bird with discordant song is a specific, non-generic image. However, the core arc—obsessed scientist revives extinct species, result is imperfect, learns to value flaw—closely follows a familiar template (Frankenstein/hubris-to-acceptance) without a sharp moral or causal surprise. The ending's insight ("flaw is precious") is earned but familiar. The piece executes its premise competently but does not transform the template through an unexpected complication or a counter-intuitive choice that redefines the stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The bedraggled prince is introduced early with vivid physical markers (unwashed, tatters, matted hair) that establish his obsession. He makes key choices: assembling the apparatus, hypothesizing, singing, and accepting the flawed bird. His decision to defer showing the bird ("But not yet") is a renunciation that alters tactics and charges the closure. The "bedraggled" state recurs in the final image ("matted hair") to reinforce cost. The element is present in setup, middle assembly, and closure acceptance, fulfilling all three gates. However, the "bedraggled" attribute itself doesn't mechanically constrain a choice—he could be clean and the arc would play identically—so it functions more as characterization than irreplaceable causal lever.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The extinct bird's egg is introduced early in velvet cradle, handled in the assembly beat ("lifted," "turning it beneath the fungal light"), placed in the central chamber at the climax, and cracks to produce the closure image (flawed bird). It appears in at least three distinct beats, drives the primary causal sequence (no egg = no bird = no thematic payoff), and its transformation (dormant → cracked → hatched creature) delivers the story's decisive change. The egg's "hairline fractures" and "ivory" color provide specificity. The element is indispensable: remove it and the plot, stakes, and closure collapse. Strong causal pressure, early signal, closure linkage, and irreplaceability justify high score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Flawed genesis is signaled early ("If the feathers are memory…"), frames Aldric's scientific inquiry, and shapes the climactic turn when the bird emerges "wrong"—three wings, asymmetric eyes, discordant song. The concept drives the thematic resolution: Aldric's acceptance that imperfection is the point. It appears in setup (hypothesis about genesis mechanisms), middle (assembly as genesis attempt), and closure (flawed result reweights his goal). The flaw constrains his next choice—he cannot parade a perfect resurrection, must accept ambiguity—and the final image of "broken-perfect song" is the concept made sensory. High causal and thematic integration, present across all three gates, shapes both middle action and closure stance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Bitterly sweet is introduced via the bird's song at the climax: "achingly beautiful but touched with discord, like a perfect melody played on an instrument slightly out of tune." The trait constrains Aldric's reaction—he cannot claim pure triumph—and charges the closure by embodying the story's thesis (flaw as preciousness). It recurs in "broken-perfect song" and thematically in "songs that broke and healed his heart in equal measure." The attribute is specific (auditory discord within beauty) and irreplaceable to the ending's resonance. However, it arrives late (final third) and does not shape a middle choice or tactic, missing the development gate. Strong closure linkage and thematic cost, but late arrival and single-beat presence limit score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Assemble is signaled early ("began to assemble the apparatus he'd spent seven years designing") and占s a full beat with concrete steps: crystal resonators, copper wires, distilled moonlight, mechanical heartbeat. The action frames the middle escalation—hypothesizing what more is needed—and sets up the climactic turn when assembly alone fails, forcing the singing gamble. It appears in setup (seven-year design) and middle (on-page assembly), and its insufficiency creates the closure pressure (science + song = flawed genesis). The assembly's products (apparatus, chamber) house the egg and enable the hatching, making the action causally indispensable. Strong beat involvement, causal pressure, and setup/development/closure presence across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Hypothesizing about everything is introduced early as Aldric's method ("This was his method: hypothesizing about everything") and recurs in dialogue: "If the feathers are memory…then the bones must be intention," "Hypothesize…What makes genesis work?" It frames his approach and justifies the experimental leap to singing. However, the method is more characterization than a mechanical constraint—it doesn't fail, require adjustment, or force a costly trade-off on the page. The hypothesis "something more was needed" leads directly to singing without false starts or competing theories tested and discarded. Present in setup and middle but passive in closure; the final acceptance doesn't reference the method. Lyric reprise potential unrealized; mid-band for presence without strong causal grip.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Suspended palace anchored to giant stalactites is introduced in the opening line and recurs twice: "the suspended palace anchored to giant stalactites creaked like a ship at sea" and "in a palace suspended from stalactites in eternal night." The setting establishes atmosphere (precarity, isolation) and thematically mirrors "everything here hung by threads—including hope." However, it does not constrain a choice, supply a resource, or alter tactics. The laboratory work and hatching would function identically in any isolated space. The stalactites are vivid but ornamental; the micro-setting (egg, apparatus, fungi for light) does more causal work. Present in setup and closure image but passive in development. Atmospheric contribution without mechanical pressure caps score below 7.0 per rubric guidance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Through the discovery is fulfilled—the story moves from obsessive preparation through assembly to singing to hatching to acceptance—but the timeframe is vague. "Seven years designing" anchors backstory, and "weeks" and "months" of neglect establish duration of obsession, but the on-page action (assembly, singing, hatching, acceptance) unfolds in an unspecified span with no clock pressure. The piece does not use time scarcity to tighten decisions; Aldric faces no deadline, and the hatching's timing is instant rather than suspenseful. The element is present structurally (discovery arc) but does not function as a constraint. Setup present (years of prep), development generic (no mid-scene time crunch), closure untimed. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>To reawaken beauty in a mechanical world is introduced early ("Above, in the world of gears and steam-powered hearts, they'd stopped asking questions") and motivates the entire arc: extinct bird revival, acceptance of flawed result, and the closing vow "He would remind them what they'd surrendered." The motivation is dramatized through choices—assembling apparatus, singing, accepting the imperfect bird—and creates friction when the result is wrong, forcing Aldric to reconcile his goal with reality. It appears in setup (mechanical plague backstory, flight to sanctuary), middle (apparatus using "the enemy's tools"), and closure (decision to eventually return but not yet). The motivation constrains his final choice: he cannot fake success, must live with ambiguity. Strong causal and thematic integration across all gates.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Quaking reverie is signaled early ("the reverie that had sustained him") and recurs in the closure line: "trembling in quaking reverie." The tone of dreamlike obsession, fragility, and emotional intensity is sustained through diction ("groaning," "eternal darkness," "old dreams," "trembled") and the prince's isolation. Tone modulates with pressure—tentative hypothesis, fear during assembly, weeping at hatching—and charges the final image of listening to impossible song. However, "quaking" appears only twice, and "reverie" is told rather than demonstrated through sensory or syntactic choices that enact the trembling quality. The piece feels more melancholic-hopeful than quaking-uncertain in its final beat. Coherent tonal arc with lyric reprise, but the specific trait (quaking) is under-embodied in prose rhythm and not mechanically tied to a constrained choice.</comment>
