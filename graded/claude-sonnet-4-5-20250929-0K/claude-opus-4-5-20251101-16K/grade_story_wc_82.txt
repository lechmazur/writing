<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's grief-driven actions show clear motivation—polishing gems, folding cranes, stealing dreams—but the interiority leans heavily on metaphorical abstraction ("luminous torment," "beauty and anguish inseparable") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation ("would not trade it for all the peace") reads as a stance crystallization, yet the decision feels declared rather than earned through a visible on-page cost that forecloses a live option. Embodied emotion appears intermittently ("fingers knew the work intimately," "knees aching") but competes with label-heavy phrasing ("grief struck as it always did").</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mira's refusal to surrender grief is crystallized in the final paragraph with conceptual cost ("the luminous torment was hers alone"). Orientation anchors appear early (floating isle, tea garden, basilica), and the accumulative/textural lens holds—each polished gem, folded crane, and archive trip deepens the dominant stake (preserving Lia through dream-light). One meaningful tightening occurs when "detachment hour" arrives and Mira begins her ascent, narrowing options toward the night's archive raid. However, the closure's cost remains more conceptual than viscerally felt on the page; the final image asserts rather than dramatizes the trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating isle, tea garden, basilica spires, and gem polishing kit anchor setting with vivid, selective detail ("silver-leafed tea plants," "crystal walls," "substrata of memory"). The paradox of ascending/descending provides a conceptual constraint that shapes Mira's journey and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (garden → basilica path), and the "detachment hour" when shadow separates from basilica adds atmospheric pressure. The lantern at her hip and circling origami cranes supply micro-setting that recurs with reweighted meaning at closure, though the tea garden itself remains more backdrop than active constraint on her choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving Lia through collected dreams—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through polishing, lighting the lantern, folding cranes, and the approach of detachment hour, which triggers Mira's nightly ascent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the shadow detaches and she must act, narrowing her window to raid the archives. The cost is conceptual (enduring "luminous torment" rather than peace) and felt in her repeated rituals, but no on-page reversal forces a trade-off between competing goods; the escalation reads as deepening rather than a live choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—grief as both preservation and torment—emerges organically through the polished gems, dream-light projections, and origami cranes without overt statement. The final image ("in the torment, Lia still lived") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether love justifies perpetual suffering, reweighting prior material. Subtext operates in the priest "who looked the other way" and the illegal dream-recording, implying a shared economy of grief. The ascending/descending paradox and the cranes "carrying a gram of grief she could almost bear to surrender" layer complexity without resolution, though the piece occasionally edges toward articulating its own thesis ("that was a kind of ascending that mattered more than gravity").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with distinct perceptual texture ("crafty in all senses," "substrata of memory") and selective focus on Mira's ritual tools and motions. Diction is controlled and purposeful, modulating between concrete detail ("buffing each facet") and lyric elevation ("frozen prayer," "luminous torment"). Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the gem-polishing beat and the final ascent. However, elevated register occasionally drifts beyond what a grieving lantern-maker would plausibly narrate in the moment ("communion death permitted," "kind of ascending that mattered more than gravity"), and some phrasing reads more poetic than character-bound.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies effectively, and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("tea garden like a frozen prayer," "shadow detaches"). However, several beats suffer from paraphrase loops and template cadence: "She polished… She had gathered… She set… She reached" creates a repetitive stem pattern across critical action. The phrase "luminous torment" appears three times, once in the final beat, functioning as thematic anchor but edging toward overuse. Minor register drift ("liturgy," "communion death permitted") intrudes in peak emotional moments. Information density is high overall, though some metaphorical constructions ("beauty and anguish inseparable as the shadow from the basilica before detachment hour") require re-reading for clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of dream-recording, gem-polishing, floating-isle physics, and grief-as-origami offers a non-obvious combination that feels purposeful rather than checklist-driven. The ascending/descending paradox and the detaching shadow provide fresh angles on mourning narratives. However, the core emotional arc—a bereaved parent preserving a dead child through forbidden rituals—echoes familiar grief-fantasy templates; the story transforms this through specific world logic (dream-light in polished sapphires, the basilica's shadow as threshold) and the lantern-maker vocation, but the underlying structure (ritual preservation, refusal to let go) remains recognizable. The final stance is earned and specific, elevating the premise into the mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira's choices—polishing the final gem, lighting the lantern, folding cranes, beginning her ascent—drive each beat and the closure stance. Her decision to continue the illegal dream-harvesting and her final refusal to trade torment for peace create key turns. Present in setup, middle choices (lighting lantern, folding cranes), and ending (ascent crystallization). Causal pressure is moderate; her occupation enables the dream-work, but "lantern maker" itself is less active than "dream thief." Scores in mid-6s for solid beat involvement and closure linkage, though the craft skill could be more causally specific.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The glass basilica appears in opening image, anchors the detachment-hour timeframe, houses the dream archives Mira raids, and frames the final ascent. Its shadow detaching is a recurring beat marker that triggers her nightly ritual. The spires catch the circling cranes in the ending image, recharging prior material. Appears in setup, middle (shadow detachment), and ending (ascent toward archives). Strong causal role (contains dreams, priests) and closure participation (destination of ascent, thematic pole of "ascending"), earning high-7s. Not fully indispensable—story could function with another archive structure—but deeply integrated.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dream recording is the illegal act that defines Mira's nightly work, shapes the dominant stake (preserving Lia), and determines her tactics (polishing gems to capture dream-light, raiding archives). Present in setup (introduced as "true work"), drives middle beats (lighting lantern projects Lia's dream), and motivates the ending (tonight's archive raid). Causal pressure is strong; without this exact mechanic, the story's logic collapses. The cost (illegality, priest's complicity, grief perpetuation) is tied directly to the act. Scores low-8s for indispensability and multi-beat causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Descends while ascending" is introduced early as the isle's physics ("the higher one climbed… the deeper one sank into the substrata of memory") and bookends the ending ("She climbed higher. She sank deeper"). However, it functions primarily as metaphor and thematic motif rather than constraining a tactical choice or enabling a specific action with cost. The paradox enriches tone and supports closure resonance (lyric reprise) but does not alter what Mira can or cannot do on the page. Scores mid-5s for purposeful early-to-final integration without direct causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Transform" appears explicitly in folding grief into origami cranes ("to transform anguish into something with wings") and implicitly in polishing raw sapphires into dream-holders. The cranes released earlier circle the spires at closure, and the transformation supplies a visible coping tactic. Present in middle (crane-folding beat) and ending (cranes in sky). However, the transformation is one ritual among several (polishing, lighting, ascending) and could be replaced with another grief-displacement act without breaking story logic. Scores mid-6s for beat involvement and closure presence but moderate replaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Gem polishing is introduced early with the tools laid out, executed in detail ("buffing each facet until the stone could hold a sleeper's vision"), and the polished gem becomes the lantern's heart that projects Lia's dream. The mechanics matter: precise angles capture dream-light, transforming clouded stone into something that "pulsed with interior dawn." Present in setup (tools), middle (polishing beat, lighting lantern), and closure motivation (more gems wait in archives). Strong causal role; without gem polishing, no dream-light lantern and no visual communion with Lia. Scores mid-7s for multi-beat specificity and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The floating island tea garden is the spatial stage for Mira's nightly ritual, provides silver-leafed plants as setting detail, and the garden path supplies the route for her ascent. Present in setup, middle (kneeling among plants, path), and ending (garden holds "last warmth of an extinct sun" as she ascends). However, the tea garden itself does not pressure a specific choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it functions more as atmospheric backdrop than active constraint. The isle's ascending/descending paradox does more thematic work. Scores low-6s for coherent presence and ending mention without tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"After the shadow detaches" frames the nightly window when Mira's illegal dream-work becomes possible. Detachment hour is introduced early, arrives on-page in the middle ("Detachment hour had come"), and triggers her ascent to the archives. The timeframe creates a recurring gate that defines when she can act, adding urgency and ritual structure. However, no live countdown or visible race against a closing window tightens the final beats; the hour marks permission rather than a shrinking deadline. Scores low-7s for clear signal, beat involvement, and closure motivation without moment-to-moment pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Folding grief into origami cranes is dramatized on the page ("The first crane she folded was clumsy, grief making her fingers thick and stupid") and tied to Mira's coping tactic: releasing cranes to carry sorrow skyward. The motivation braids with dream-recording—both are attempts to survive Lia's loss. Present in setup (implied in "crafty" work), middle (crane-folding beat, released cranes), and ending (cranes circle spires, reweighted as partial surrender). Friction between holding Lia close (dreams) and releasing grief (cranes) creates visible cost. Scores low-7s for dramatized conflict and closure linkage, though crane-folding is one thread among several.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Luminous torment" appears as a phrase three times, framing grief as both radiant and agonizing. Tone is coherent across beats—beauty and pain intertwined in every ritual act (polishing reveals "interior dawn," grief strikes "luminous, tormenting"). Modulates appropriately: clinical detail during polishing, lyric elevation at lantern-lighting, crystallized refusal at closure ("the luminous torment was hers alone"). The oxymoron charges the final image and encapsulates Mira's stance. However, the phrase's repetition in the ending paragraph edges toward over-reliance. Scores mid-7s for strong tonal coherence, purposeful modulation, and closure charge with minor over-articulation.</comment>
