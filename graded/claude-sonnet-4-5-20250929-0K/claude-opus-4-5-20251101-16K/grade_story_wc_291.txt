<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elena's face blindness shapes perception ("she painted the quarry's shadows...Maya would emerge from what she was not") and her decision to paint from outside in is consistent with her established perceptual signature. The motivation to "awaken dormant empathy" is embodied through her work method rather than stated insight. Minor weakness: Claire's grief is told through posture ("angle of loss in her spine") rather than shown through a choice or reaction, and Elena's internal contradiction between recognizing essence while unable to see faces could be tested more sharply under pressure. The portrait completion feels inevitable but the stakes for Elena personally remain abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the piece builds through layered reflection on Elena's method, the ribbon fragment, and Maya's essence, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the portrait "would speak" and "lance open" calcified grief with visible cost to Claire. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph (quarry, Elena, cold case work). The closure unit crystallizes options—Maya will be remembered "not as a file number"—with undeniable emotional cost signaled. One constraint: the middle third is heavily reflective without an on-page micro-choice that alters Elena's present tactics; the cost at closure is felt but projected onto Claire rather than shown.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The quarry's granite walls, mist, and water constrain Elena's workspace and charge the atmosphere ("the quarry walls seemed to lean closer, witnesses"). The ribbon fragment is handled physically ("lay on a stone beside her palette") and its texture informs her understanding. Spatial choreography is clear throughout (switchback path, easel placement, water forty feet below). The micro-setting—the stone, palette, and ribbon's proximity—shapes her concentration. The mist lifting at the end marks temporal passage and reweights the scene's tone, moving from witness-silence to "the water kept its secrets" in contrast to the speaking portrait.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: to make Maya remembered through awakened empathy, countering the calcified forgetting. Pressure accumulates through Elena's methodical painting process and the weight of nine years' silence. The "lance that calcification" metaphor establishes the challenge, and the final image—"the portrait, at least, would speak"—crystallizes the achievement with projected cost to Claire. However, escalation is textural rather than event-driven; no on-page reversal tests Elena's commitment or method. The cost is described ("would hurt") but not dramatized, and Elena's personal stake remains at a distance—her motivation is abstract principle rather than conflicted need.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Elena's practice: presence through absence, remembering against forgetting, feeling against numbness. The portrait-as-answer motif is purposeful without being stated as thesis. "Maya Chen would be remembered...As someone who had existed, fully and completely, until someone decided she shouldn't anymore" offers a resonant reconfiguration of the cold-case premise without moralizing. The unifying-opposites method (light/dark, presence/absence) charges multiple beats and the closure image. Minor limit: "Empathy always did [hurt]" edges toward thematic summary, and the final paragraph's "the water kept its secrets. But the portrait, at least, would speak" risks gentle obviousness rather than oblique depth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; Elena's perceptual signature—seeing essence rather than features, understanding "by unifying opposites"—is consistent and character-specific. Diction is controlled and literary without register breaks ("furrowed hush," "calcified that loss into something"). Distance modulates appropriately: close during painting, wider for backstory anchors. The passive "was meant to lance" and "would witness" constructions fit the reflective, anticipatory tone. Minor slip: "She couldn't recognize faces—not her own mother's, not her own in mirrors—but she painted portraits that made detectives weep" front-loads exposition efficiently but edges toward helpful-narrator summary rather than discovery through scene pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled; sentence variety supports the contemplative pace. Information density is high in the painting-process beats: "She painted the quarry's shadows, the way light failed against the rock face. Maya would emerge from what she was not." Clarity is strong throughout. Two patterns reduce momentum: (1) Reflective summary dominates the middle third without on-page micro-actions to interleave ("This was how Elena had learned to see..."), creating a brief density plateau. (2) "The mist began lifting" / "Elena packed her supplies" / "Tomorrow, she would deliver" shifts to future-facing synopsis rather than live closure image. No loops or scaffold, and the figurative language ("cathedral buttresses," "lance that calcification") is coherent and purposeful.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The face-blind portrait artist is a strong conceptual hook, and the method of painting from negative space outward is specific and fresh. The accumulative structure—reflection interwoven with setting and object—fits the contemplative premise. However, the cold-case frame and the "awakening empathy to counter forgetting" motivation trend toward familiar therapeutic-recovery templates. The piece does not take bold structural risks; it delivers a thoughtful, well-executed portrait of portraiture but without a non-obvious turn or friction that would distinguish it from competent genre exercises. The ending's "the portrait, at least, would speak" is earned but expected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elena's face blindness is signaled early and shapes her method (painting from absence, recognizing Claire by posture). However, her choices are largely methodical execution rather than pressured decisions that alter tactics. The trait enables observation but does not constrain a key on-page choice with visible cost. Two beats: Claire meetings (past) and painting process (present). Closure participation: implied but not causally active in the final image. Swappability: a generic empathetic artist could execute similar beats with minor edits. Present in setup, development (via method), and thematically at closure, but causal pressure is low.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ribbon fragment appears in three beats: pocket mention (setup), study session ("felt its weave, understanding the machine that made it, the hands that tied it"), and reprise on the stone beside her palette. It reweights meaning—someone kept the mask—but does not constrain Elena's painting choices or alter her tactics. The object charges atmosphere and links to Maya's disappearance, but its physical properties do not enable or block an action. Closure participation: returns to pocket at the end, closing the frame, but is not causally active in the final image. Strong setup and thematic presence; moderate beat involvement; low causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Cold cases frame the premise (Elena's specialty, Maya's file-number fate) and establish the dominant stake (remembering the forgotten). The concept shapes Elena's motivation and the portrait's purpose ("to awaken dormant empathy" after evidence scatters). However, the case itself—investigative tactics, detective engagement, evidence handling—does not constrain on-page choices; Elena paints in solitude. The concept is thematic scaffolding rather than live pressure. Present in setup (specialty), echoed in reflection (unfelt loss), and restated at closure (Maya as file number vs. person). Functional but replaceable with a generic memorial-art frame.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Very methodical" is signaled early ("methodical footsteps counting each stone") and demonstrated throughout: "She worked very methodically. First, the space around the subject..." and "packed her supplies with the same methodical precision." The trait shapes her painting process (outside-in, shadows first) and sustains focus under reflective pressure. However, it does not create visible friction or cost; methodical execution is portrayed as strength without trade-off (e.g., no missed spontaneity or emotional detachment penalty). Two beats: path descent and painting process. Closure: packing precision echoes the trait but does not charge the final image. Consistent, functional, but lacks constraining cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Lance" appears twice with reweighted meaning: first as intention ("This portrait was meant to lance that calcification") establishing stakes, then at closure via projected outcome ("would watch a mother's calcified grief lance open"). The action is metaphorical rather than physical, but it defines the dominant stake and Elena's method (piercing numbness). The verb is specific and cannot be swapped for generic "heal" or "awaken" without losing the sharp, surgical precision. Present in setup (intention), absent in middle development as live action, and returns charged at closure. Strong thematic integration but not a turning-point action on the page. Causal pressure is moderate; closure linkage is high.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Unifying opposites" is signaled early ("This was how Elena had learned to see: by unifying opposites") and demonstrated in her painting method (light/dark, presence/absence, vulnerable/fierce). The method shapes her approach and is visible in the portrait construction: "She painted her as both vulnerable and fierce, young and ancient with knowing." However, the mechanics remain abstract; we do not see the method tested or chosen over an alternative under pressure. Present in setup (learning origin), development (painting execution), and implicit at closure (Maya unified as symbol and person). Functional and thematic, but the method does not constrain a choice with visible cost. Swappable with "seeing essence" or similar artist-vision phrases.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The quarry is present throughout: switchback path, granite walls "like cathedral buttresses," mist on water forty feet below, and the mist lifting at the end. Setting provides atmosphere ("furrowed hush," "witnesses who had held their silence") and spatial anchors. The quarry's isolation enables Elena's concentration, and the mist's clearing marks temporal passage. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics; Elena could paint this portrait in a studio with minor edits. Strong setup and atmospheric presence; the "shadowed" and "mist" elements charge tone. Closure participation: "the water kept its secrets" counterpoints the speaking portrait. Lyric reprise reweights meaning; moderate integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the evidence disappears" is stated in the opening context (Elena's specialty, Maya's case timeline) but does not function as live pressure. The nine-year gap is backstory; the on-page time is a single painting session with vague duration ("afternoon sun penetrated"). No clock tightens decisions; Elena works without interruption or deadline. The timeframe establishes the cold-case premise but is not dramatized as a constraint. Present in setup (cold-case framing), absent in middle development (no ticking urgency), and thematically restated at closure (moving on too easily). Functional as context but replaceable with any post-trauma interval. Low causal pressure; no tactical impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To awaken dormant empathy" is stated explicitly ("Elena's motivation had never been justice...She worked to awaken dormant empathy") and demonstrated through the portrait's intended effect on Claire. The desire shapes Elena's method (painting essence, not just features) and the dominant stake (making Maya remembered). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices; Elena faces no friction between empathy-work and personal cost. Present in setup (her specialty rationale), development (painting to pierce numbness), and closure (Claire will feel again). The motivation is consistent and thematic but lacks visible trade-off or on-page test. Functional but not deeply pressured.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Furrowed hush" appears once as a descriptor of Elena's concentration. The tone is coherent throughout: contemplative, shadowed, elegiac, with quiet intensity rather than overt drama. Diction supports it: "cathedral buttresses," "calcified," "lance," "witness," "furrowed." The mist and quarry's silence reinforce the hush. Tone modulates slightly: opening solemnity, middle reflection, closing with "terrible, necessary awakening" and the final image's restrained closure. The tone charges the final image by sustaining pressure without crescendo. However, "furrowed hush" itself is a single phrase rather than a recurring beat or pattern; the tone is executed more than the exact phrase is integrated. Strong atmospheric coherence; moderate phrase-specific integration.</comment>
