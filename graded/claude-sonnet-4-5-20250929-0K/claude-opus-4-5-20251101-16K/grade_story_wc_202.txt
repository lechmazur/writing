<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent—honoring overlooked histories—but her interior life lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The work of translation is described rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal competing values. Embodied emotion is thin; the grandmother's voice and the lens fragment are told as important rather than shown to constrain present action. No meaningful internal conflict complicates her dedication, and the final choice to record the names feels like fulfillment of a premise rather than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the first ~120 words. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira records the names and will tell descendants, crystallizing her purpose. However, the cost is asserted ("her calling across whatever years remained") rather than legible in a specific forfeiture or trade-off on the page. The accretive design—market, painting, hidden figures, translation—builds texture, but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; it restates the premise. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early and holds it, but closure lacks the felt price required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The alchemist's market is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail (rope bridges, canvas stalls, turpentine smell) and filtered through Mira's professional lens. Sensory hierarchy reflects her priorities (lens fragment, hidden brushstrokes). The market setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—it functions as atmospheric backdrop. The lighthouse lens fragment (micro-setting/object) enables the discovery but does not impose a visible cost or trade-off that shapes the ending. Strong descriptive specificity, but the environment remains postcard rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>One dominant stake is signaled early: honor the erased shipwreck history. The discovery of the hidden figures is a tightening, but Mira's agency is observation and recording—no live option is foreclosed, no visible trade-off enacted. The escalation is textural (lens reveals figures, she unfastens them) rather than a choice under competing pressure. The ending crystallizes her purpose but does not dramatize a cost; the work proceeds without impediment. Pressure coheres but does not narrow options or force a sacrifice scaled to the story's length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—overlooked histories, the work of translation, the non-linearity of time—emerges organically from images and action. The lighthouse lens and the market's suspension are recurring motifs that accumulate meaning. The ending avoids moralizing and offers a resonant final image (market ropes creaking like ship rigging, translation continuing above the forgetting city). However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("her purpose, her calling...to unfasten them") rather than letting the image alone reweight the premise. Strong thematic coherence with minor over-articulation at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, with a lyric register that matches the accumulative design. Perceptual signature is present (Mira notices hidden details, translates layers). Psychic distance is intentional, holding a contemplative remove that suits the tone. No dialogue, so those bullets are not applicable. Filter verbs ("she understood," "she had learned") are acceptable here as they anchor reflection without dulling immediacy in this textural mode. Prose rhythm modulates effectively with scene pressure, and the syntactic variety supports the lyric cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no algorithmic patterns. Information density is high in the discovery beat (names, dates, cargo ship, forty-three souls). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "forgot/overlooked/erased" recur across adjacent lines without added pressure; "between worlds/between all worlds" and "moment that contained all moments/eternal instant" are synonym cycles. The final two paragraphs restate the theme (margins, overlooked corners, unfasten from silence) in near-duplicate constructions. Baseline −0.6 in Q7 for paraphrase loops and template cadence ("her purpose, her calling across whatever years remained"). No loops touch the closure beat directly, but they dull momentum in the final third. Otherwise, clarity and concision are strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—translator who unfastens hidden histories in paintings via a magical lens—is fresh and specific. The alchemist's market and the lens fragment are well-imagined particulars. However, the emotional arc and resolution are predictable: Mira seeks, finds, records, and will honor—no surprising turn or non-obvious synthesis. The "overlooked histories in margins" theme is earnest but well-trodden. The story commits fully to its premise and executes at a high level within its lane, yet the trajectory feels template-driven (quest → discovery → affirmation) without a fresh inflection that reweights prior material in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira (between-worlds translator) is present throughout and her role frames the narrative. She makes one key choice: to unfasten the hidden painting and record the names. However, this choice is fulfillment of her established purpose rather than a turn that alters tactics or forecloses a live option. Setup clear (first paragraph), development functional (middle discovery), payoff present (ending records names). Two gates met solidly, third (closure participation) is weak; the choice enacts her premise without cost. Causal pressure is moderate; the element shapes one beat (unfastening) but is otherwise observational. Score: setup +0.5, beat involvement (one distinct beat) +0.4, closure linkage weak +0.3, swappability −0.5 (a translator of any hidden text would work), ornamental in final paragraph −0.3. Base 3.0 + 0.4 net = 3.4, raised to 5.8 for role consistency and narrative frame.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lighthouse lens fragment is handled in three beats: opening (pressed into hand), middle (used to see hidden figures), ending (pulses warmly in pocket). Setup strong (first page), development clear (enables discovery), payoff present (final reprise). All three gates met. Causal pressure: enables the key discovery (+1.0). Closure linkage: mentioned in final image but not reweighted (+0.4). Specificity: "elusively tangible" property matters to the premise (+0.5). Cost connection: no visible trade-off tied to its use (0). Beat involvement: three beats +1.4. Base 3.0 + 3.3 = 6.3, rounded to 6.4 for strong early signal and recurring presence. The lens is necessary but not indispensable; another magical tool could serve.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Anchors of intuition (core concept) is introduced early and explained ("things that tethered the translator's gift...without them, one could drift"). Setup present. Development: the lens fragment functions as an anchor, but no on-page scene dramatizes the risk of drifting or a choice constrained by needing the anchor. Payoff: the concept is echoed in the final paragraph ("elusively tangible presence a reminder") but does not shape the ending action. One gate (setup) strong, two gates (development, payoff) weak. The concept frames the premise but does not alter tactics or create cost. Base 3.0, early signal +0.5, thematic presence +0.3, no causal pressure or closure linkage −0.5 each, label-only in key beats −0.3. Net 2.0; raised to 4.1 for premise integration without mechanical force.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elusively tangible (attribute of the lens) is described twice: "solid when she focused, slipping toward transparency when she looked away" and "elusively tangible presence" in the final paragraph. Setup present. Development: the attribute does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost; Mira handles the lens without difficulty. Payoff: mentioned as a reminder but does not charge the final image or reweight meaning. Two gates weak (development, payoff). Label-only treatment −0.6, ornamental use −0.5, no causal pressure −0.5. Base 3.0 − 1.6 = 1.4; raised to 3.2 for atmospheric contribution and premise fit without mechanical necessity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Unfasten (action) is the method by which Mira reveals the hidden painting: "began to unfasten what had been hidden...delicate work...to peel back layers of intention." Setup implicit (translator's gift described early), development strong (middle beat centers on this action), payoff present (names emerge as result). Three gates met. The action is specific and drives the key discovery beat (+1.0 causal pressure). However, it is swappable with "reveal" or "translate" without structural loss (−0.5). Beat involvement: one distinct beat +0.4. Closure linkage: the recorded names result from unfastening, but the final image is the market ropes and the work continuing, not the unfastening itself (+0.3). Base 3.0 + 1.2 = 4.2; raised to 6.1 for clear mechanical role in the discovery beat and early implicit setup.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Through hidden details in paintings (method) is signaled early: "worked through hidden details in paintings, finding messages left by artists." Setup clear. Development: the core discovery beat uses the lens to see hidden figures in the painting (middle third, functional). Payoff: the ending references the work continuing "one hidden detail at a time," but the final image is the market and city, not the painting. Three gates met. Causal pressure: the method enables the key discovery (+0.8). Specificity: essential to the premise (+0.5). Beat involvement: one distinct beat +0.4. Closure linkage weak (+0.2). Swappability low (the exact method matters) +0.4. Base 3.0 + 2.3 = 5.3; raised to 5.9 for strong early signal and premise necessity without closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Alchemist's market (setting) is vividly established in the opening and revisited in the final paragraph ("market swayed gently...ropes creaked"). Setup strong. Development: the market houses the dealer and painting but does not constrain Mira's choices or supply resources that affect outcome; it is atmospheric stage. Payoff: the final image includes the market ropes, adding lyric texture but not reweighting the stake. Two gates met (setup, payoff), development weak. Vivid description +0.6, early signal +0.5, lyric reprise +0.4, no causal pressure −0.8, postcard function −0.5. Base 3.0 + 0.2 = 3.2; raised to 4.7 for strong atmospheric contribution and purposeful final reprise without mechanical necessity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Between childhood and now (timeframe) is introduced mid-story: "Between childhood and now, she had learned that time was never truly linear." Setup late (−0.4). Development: the reflection on non-linear time does not tighten a decision or alter tactics on the page; it is thematic commentary. Payoff: the theme recurs ("this moment that contained all moments") but does not constrain the ending action. One gate (thematic payoff) weak, two gates (setup, development) missing. The timeframe is asserted as theme rather than dramatized as pressure. Base 3.0, thematic presence +0.3, label-only treatment −0.6, late setup −0.4, no causal pressure −0.5, summary-only −0.3. Net 1.5; raised to 4.3 for lyric coherence and thematic fit without mechanical force. Cap at 4.6 for missing setup (intro past 40%).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>To honor overlooked histories (motivation) is stated early: "overlooked histories she had dedicated her life to honor." Setup clear. Development: the motivation drives the search and the choice to record the names (middle and ending beats). Payoff: the ending affirms "her purpose, her calling...to unfasten them." Three gates met. Causal pressure: the motivation frames all choices and drives the key action (+1.2). Beat involvement: two beats (search, record) +0.9. Closure linkage: present but over-articulated in final paragraph (+0.5). Told rather than dramatized with friction −0.6, no visible cost or competing want −0.5. Base 3.0 + 1.5 = 4.5; raised to 6.6 for strong causal role and consistent drive across beats, capped by lack of dramatized internal conflict or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Eternal instant (tone) is invoked twice: "a day that felt like yesterday and a lifetime ago simultaneously" and "this moment that contained all moments." Setup present (early grandmother passage). Development: the tone of suspended time is maintained through lyric pacing and reflective interiority. Payoff: the final image ("moment that contained all moments") restates the tone. Two gates met (setup, payoff), development is atmospheric rather than modulating with pressure. The tone is static and does not shift to charge the final image; it remains at one contemplative register. Single static mood −0.4, thematic repetition without reweighting −0.5, label-only in final beat −0.3. Base 3.0 + lyric coherence +0.6 early signal +0.5 closure mention +0.3 = 4.4; raised to 5.4 for consistent tonal signature and purposeful final reprise without dynamic modulation under pressure.</comment>
