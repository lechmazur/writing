<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elena's choices are mostly observation-driven rather than forcing the breakthrough; her decision to carry the curl and wait for the right moment shows professional restraint. Marcus's breakthrough feels earned by the accumulated pressure of silence, the eclipse, and the physical keepsake rather than therapeutic intervention. The embodied moment—"he crouched down, touched one with his finger"—grounds the shift. Minor slip: Elena's interior leans slightly toward professional self-awareness ("not healed, she wasn't naive enough to believe in instant cures") that edges toward diagnostic distance at a peak beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Marcus's question "Can we come back here?" crystallizes a door now ajar with Elena's promise anchoring future cost. The eclipse functions as situational pressure that enables rather than causes the breakthrough. Causality is clean—grandmother's keepsake, 91 days of silence, the cosmic event converge without forcing. Orientation anchors early (music therapist, trail, eclipse timing). One meaningful deepening: the curl shifts from carried object to charged link.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sage Ridge is purposefully chosen and detailed (silvery-green sage, crescent shadows, temperature drop), and the eclipse's sensory markers (birds quieting, crickets' confusion, corona blaze) constrain the moment's timing and atmosphere. The curl—micro-object-as-setting—charges the final image when held against the corona. Spatial choreography is clean (summit, flat rock, descent). Does not quite reach 9+ because while the setting enables, it doesn't force a tactical choice with visible cost; it provides the stage rather than altering Marcus's agency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Marcus's silence and Elena's professional mission to create space for reconnection. The eclipse provides situational pressure and one meaningful tightening: totality forces the moment where silence might break. Marcus's agency drives the turn ("My mom would have wanted to see this"), and Elena's prepared response (the curl) deepens it. Cost is visible in Marcus's ongoing grief and Elena's "cautious exuberance...tempered by experience." No multiple reversals required at this length; the single deepening narrows options (the door is now cracked, not sealed).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of presence, wonder, and grief emerges through particulars: the eclipse, the curl, 91 days counted, crescent shadows as "offerings." Elena's final reflection—"creating space where it might naturally link two souls through something as ordinary and extraordinary as shadow, light, and time"—lands close to thematic statement but is earned by prior images and her professional restraint. The curl held against the corona offers a resonant non-literal answer. Minor dock: "ordinary magic" and "lifelong wonder" edge toward prompt-label vocabulary in the final paragraphs rather than letting the image speak alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds cleanly to Elena's perceptual signature: professional calm, "the way she'd learned to be," imagining oak roots "dreaming in their slow wooden way." Marcus's interior remains opaque until his speech, appropriate to his silence. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated. Dialogue is spare and natural ("Glasses," "Can we come back here?"). Minor slip: "cautious exuberance rise within her, hope tempered by experience, joy balanced by awareness" in the penultimate paragraph stacks abstract emotional calibration rather than showing the contradictory impulses through gesture or micro-choice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well, strong opening anchor, sensory detail is selective. Information density is high in the eclipse description. Two friction points lower the score: The phrase "not quite golden, not quite gray" and "Not a song, exactly. Just sound meeting moment" are near-poetic elisions that work but edge toward self-conscious lyricism. The penultimate paragraph's "cautious exuberance...hope tempered by experience, joy balanced by awareness" is a three-part emotional equation that paraphrases the same state. No loops elsewhere; propulsion is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The eclipse as catalyst for a child's first words post-trauma is a familiar therapeutic-breakthrough template. Transformation occurs through specific lived detail: the 91-day count, the grandmother's keepsake, crescent shadows, the kalimba, the physical curl held against the corona. These particulars elevate the premise above generic execution. The ending resists tidy resolution and commits to the long walk ahead. Does not reach higher bands because the core arc—silent child finds voice during cosmic event with gentle therapist—follows a recognizable pattern despite strong specificity in execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elena present throughout, frames expectation early, and her decision to wait and then offer the curl shapes two key beats (carrying it, presenting it). Her "mellow" and "softly adaptive" traits enable her professional patience. Does not drive the breakthrough—Marcus's agency does—so she functions more as facilitator than protagonist. Scores mid-band for steady presence and one causal choice (the curl's timing) but lacks a second high-pressure decision that narrows her own options with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The curl is seeded early ("wrapped in tissue paper...in her pocket"), handled at midpoint ("She'd been carrying it for weeks"), and charged at closure ("He held it up against the corona-lit sky"). Three distinct beats: carrying, unwrapping, holding against light. The final image—"pressing it against his chest"—links past and present with felt cost. Reaches essential status; removing it would collapse the ending's specificity. Does not hit 8.5+ because its middle presence is summary ("carrying it for weeks") rather than a second on-page constraint or choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Ordinary magic" is named explicitly ("He needed ordinary magic, the kind that happens when the world offers its quiet gifts") and governs Elena's approach—waiting for natural wonder rather than forcing technique. The eclipse as cosmic event and the crescent shadows ("tiny eclipses scattered across the ground like offerings") embody the concept. It shapes tactics (choosing the ridge, timing the walk) and the stakes (wonder as healing force). Does not reach 7+ because the phrase itself appears as thematic label rather than being entirely inferred from action; it modulates tactics but does not constrain a single beat with visible friction.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Softly adaptive" is shown early ("learned to move with the rhythm of others," "her approach softly adaptive to whatever frequency her patients needed") and demonstrated through pacing Marcus, not forcing conversation, and waiting for the eclipse's natural pressure. It enables her professional patience—a visible tradeoff (weeks of carrying the curl, choosing outdoor space over office). Constrains one major choice: to create space rather than intervene. Does not reach essential because the trait could be replaced with "patient" or "observant" without major structural loss; it enriches rather than uniquely drives.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Link" appears explicitly in the final paragraph ("link two souls") and structures the ending: the curl as "thread linking him to a time before loss," the shared eclipse moment. The action is thematic and present in closure image but does not redefine earlier beats—most linking happens in the final third. Setup is late (concept articulated only at end); middle beats do not dramatize "linking" attempts with failure/success rhythm. Scores solidly for closure participation and thematic charge but misses higher bands due to late first explicit use and lack of mid-story causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The eclipse is signaled in the opening paragraph ("solar eclipse would reach totality in forty minutes"), its mechanics shape every beat (the climb, the timing, the sensory changes, totality as the pressure point for Marcus's speech), and it charges the final image (curl held against corona). Three gates satisfied with strong causal pressure: removes the element and the story has no dramatic clock, no cosmic witness, no visual anchor for the keepsake's meaning. Reaches essential; the exact timing and visual spectacle are irreplaceable and drive both the breakthrough and the ending's resonance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sage Ridge is chosen purposefully (overlooks valley, silvery-green sage, flat rock), seeded early, and provides the stage for the eclipse viewing. The ridge's sensory details (sage scent, crescent shadows, temperature drop) enrich atmosphere and the climb demonstrates Marcus's "careful but curious" engagement. The setting enables rather than constrains—it does not force a tactical choice with visible friction, though its specific features (shadows, elevation) charge the moment. Two beats (ascent, summit) plus closure participation. Does not reach 8.5+ because a different elevated viewpoint would serve similarly; specificity is high but replaceability is partial.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Beneath the hush of dreaming roots" appears once as a lyric image ("Beneath the hush of dreaming roots, time moved differently") but does not function as a timeframe that tightens decisions. The eclipse's 40-minute countdown provides the actual clock. The phrase recurs in the title context but does not constrain tactics or alter the pacing of choices. Present as atmospheric metaphor; does not pass the middle-development gate (no choice shaped by this specific temporal lens). Scores low-functional: adds texture but is replaceable with "during the eclipse" or "in that suspended moment" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To nurture lifelong wonder" is stated explicitly in the final paragraphs ("Her motivation had always been simple: to nurture lifelong wonder") and demonstrated through Elena's choice of the eclipse over office sessions and her delivery of the curl. The motivation shapes one key choice (the ridge, the timing) and frames the ending's meaning. Does not reach 7+ because it is told more than dramatized in friction—no on-page moment where wonder competes with another professional obligation or doubt that would show cost. The motivation is consistent and closure-linked but lacks visible tradeoff in a high-pressure beat.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Cautious exuberance" is explicitly named ("that cautious exuberance rise within her, hope tempered by experience, joy balanced by awareness") and modulates across the piece: professional patience early, quiet kalimba playing, restrained response to Marcus's speech, then guarded hope at the end. The tone is coherent and supports the stakes—breakthrough without naivety. It charges the final exchange ("As many times as you need") with realistic restraint. Does not reach 8+ because the phrase is stated rather than inferred and the tonal modulation is steady rather than creating a decisive shift; it colors rather than structurally transforms the ending.</comment>
