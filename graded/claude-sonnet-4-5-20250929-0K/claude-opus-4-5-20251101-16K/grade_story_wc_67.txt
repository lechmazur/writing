<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority shows strong embodied emotion through concrete actions—grinding charcoal, gathering ash—and her micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values (preserving grandmother's laugh vs. accepting transformation). Internal conflict between grief and professional duty operates simultaneously in scene rather than alternating. Minor deduction: the mirage-of-safety reflection could feel slightly more integrated into her present choices, though it does tilt her stance toward acceptance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds throughout. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mira accepts transformation over preservation, sitting in the rocking chair with ash on her palms—visible cost is release of wholeness, felt in "not quite gone, not quite present." Orientation anchors early (gallery, Mira, tonight). The single meaningful deepening occurs when burning grandmother's portrait becomes acceptance of accumulation over preservation, reweighting the dominant stake with undeniable pressure in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The gallery's impossible architecture (corridors narrowing, vanishing point retreating) constrains movement and charges the final image. The rocking chair's lingering warmth and body impression provide micro-setting that bridges past presence to present acceptance. Porcelain mask fragments reweight perception across beats. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: ash texture, heat of flame, cool porcelain against skin all anchor choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve vs. transform Vera's memory—signaled early and coheres under Accumulative lens. One meaningful deepening: the act of burning the portrait tightens into acceptance that "nothing stayed whole, but nothing truly vanished." Agency manifests as endurance and renunciation (burning rather than preserving) with visible cost: the laugh dissolves but becomes "part of everything." No multi-reversal required; the single turn forecloses preservation with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—transformation as necessary loss and distributed presence—emerges from concrete particulars: ash coating walls, fractured mask vision, dissolving charcoal laugh. The final image (Mira in chair, ash on palms, echo "not quite gone") offers non-literal answer to preservation-impossibility without stating a moral. "Mirage of safety" shapes visitor interactions and Mira's half-truths, becoming method rather than merely theme. Subtext operates in silences and gestures; no diagnostic label-speak touches closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: Mira notices through artist's eye (charcoal dust "fine as cremation," mask creating "tessellated" reality). Narrative distance stable; filter verbs ("felt," "watched") are voice-motivated and fit reflective register. Diction remains within character's lexicon—art-school vocabulary (vanishing point, graphite) mixed with ritual precision. Rhythmic control modulates from measured reflection to compressed action at burning, then expands to quiet resonance in final paragraph.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings diverse. Information density high: most lines advance character state, atmosphere, or thematic pressure simultaneously. Minor deduction for slight overwriting in opening paragraph—"fine as cremation dust" after "grinding charcoal" already establishes the death parallel; "shadows pooled like dark water" adds texture but slows momentum slightly. No loops, scaffolding, or template cadence. Figurative language coherent and purposeful throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Premise—gallery where portraits burn to become architectural presence—offers fresh synthesis of preservation-impossibility. The porcelain-shard mask (teacups, figurines, urns as face) is specific and irreplaceable, enabling fractured vision that transforms perception. "Mirage of safety through incomplete information" reframes conventional memorial practice with moral complexity. Risk: the Accumulative mode and quiet closure could flatten in lesser hands, but here the final image's charged specificity (ash-darkened palms, echo, rocking chair warmth) earns resonance.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira as ash scatterer drives all beats: grinding charcoal, wearing mask, burning portrait, scattering ash, sitting in chair. Her decisions—to complete the commission, to accept transformation over preservation—create the story's only turn. Present in setup, middle choices, and closure image with ash on palms.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mask handled in three distinct beats: lifted from case, secured over face to see portrait differently, lowered after burning to feel tears. Its fractured vision enables the burning choice ("see emotions rather than faces") and returns at closure when Mira plans to wear it for visitors. Irreplaceable: grandmother's creation from specific shards charges inheritance and perception.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mirage of safety shapes Mira's method (half-truths to visitors) and explains why people return, but doesn't constrain on-page choices as strongly as it thematizes them. Present early, colors middle exposition about visitor beliefs, and recurs in final paragraph when Mira commits to "speaking in careful half-truths." More thematic than tactical, though it does enable her professional stance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Weaves truth carefully" appears as inherited method and shows in mask's fractured vision ("seeing it in pieces"), but the specific tradeoff—truth in fragments vs. dangerous wholeness—is explained more than dramatized. The attribute enables the half-truth stance toward visitors and justifies the burning practice, but the cost of careful weaving isn't tested on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Powder" opens the story (grinding charcoal "until it became powder, fine as cremation dust") and frames the burning process. The reduction to powder/ash is the story's central action, enabling scattering and accumulation. Ash gathered in palms at closure charges final image. Irreplaceable: the specific transformation from portrait to dust to distributed presence couldn't occur through another medium.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Incomplete information signaled early ("Through incomplete information, Mira maintained the mirage") and its mechanics matter: visitors believe portraits are preserved, not burned. The gap between public belief and private practice generates Mira's professional method and shapes her planned visitor interactions. Present in setup and closure commitment, though the withholding isn't tested by an on-page visitor.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vanishing point gallery essential across all beats. Its impossible architecture (retreating convergence point) provides destination for ash scattering and spatial metaphor for transformation. Grandmother's studio doorway frames inciting loss; central corridor enables ritual; accumulated ash on walls/frames embodies theme. The setting's infinite depths and "impossible embrace" charge the final image. Removal would collapse both logistics and meaning.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Rocking chair's stopped motion frames the inciting loss ("finally slowed to a stop") and its lingering warmth/impression shows recent absence. Returns at closure when Mira sits and begins rocking, accepting continuity. The timeframe signals completion of one cycle and beginning of Mira's inheritance, though it doesn't create live deadline pressure or narrow tactical options during the burning sequence itself.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Crystallizing fleeting emotion is Mira's defining artistic goal, dramatized in the captured laugh "three days ago when her grandmother had laughed at something private." This desire drives the portrait creation and makes the burning choice costly—she must release the crystallized moment. The friction between wanting to hold the laugh and accepting its transformation into distributed ash generates the story's central pressure and shapes closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Somber marvel sustained throughout: reverent diction ("accumulated presence," "impossible embrace") balanced with concrete ritual detail creates consistent tone. Modulates appropriately—quiet reflection, compressed action at burning, expansive resonance at close. The oxymoron charges the final image where loss and wonder coexist: "not quite gone, not quite present." Tone choice indispensable to the story's register and thematic effect.</comment>
