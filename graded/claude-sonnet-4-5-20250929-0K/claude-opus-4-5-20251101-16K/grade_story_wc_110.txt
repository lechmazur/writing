<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maeve's choice to let Elena believe the worst rather than fight shows embodied renunciation with clear cost ("I let you be wrong to stop being at war"). Her interiority around the lens and childhood cipher is specific and avoids diagnostic labels. The reconciliation feels earned through concrete micro-choices (hearing Elena through the window, sending the doodle, revealing the truth). Elena's arc is thinner—her shift happens mostly off-page—but her on-page gesture with the second ticket shows agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) at closure. Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly within the first paragraph. The eavesdropped revelation provides causal motivation for the meeting; the lens exchange and dual tickets create a charged final image that reweights the three-year silence with felt cost (loss of time, endured isolation). One meaningful deepening—Maeve's confession that she chose surrender over truth—tightens the reconciliation and forecloses the old defensive posture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt is vivid and purposeful: water pooling in hollows mirrors emotional accumulation, and the wet tiles charge the final sun-scatter image. The lens as micro-setting object constrains Maeve's explanation ("seeing isn't the same as understanding") and returns at closure with reweighted meaning. Sensory detail—rain-slicked tiles, murmuring channels—stays selective and reflects the "resonant hush" without becoming a catalog. Spatial choreography (Elena's approach, footsteps sending ripples) remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—repairing the sisters' bond—is signaled early and tightens through Maeve's public truth-telling, which forecloses her three-year defensive posture. The overheard conversation provides escalation by forcing Maeve to act rather than hide. Cost is visible: Maeve admits she chose "surrender" and endured loneliness, Elena arrives with her own apology-sketch. The reconciliation is earned by protagonist agency (Maeve initiates contact, confesses), though the final handclasp feels slightly soft as a peak image—more symbolic resolution than a choice with immediate friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—truth as liberation versus protective silence—emerges through concrete action: Maeve's refusal to defend herself, the eavesdropped reversal, the lens metaphor ("seeing isn't the same as understanding"), and the dual concert-ticket cipher. The final image (lens scattering light across stones) offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext operates well in the sisters' cryptic doodles and in Maeve's line "I let you be wrong to stop being at war," which reframes passivity as strategic choice. The story resists tidy binaries: Maeve's silence was both self-protective and costly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV stays cleanly inside Maeve's perceptual signature: worn glass, the archive's "pale ink," her economical night-shift diction. Distance modulates purposefully—tighter during the confession, slightly wider in the framing paragraphs. Dialogue feels natural and subtext-rich ("So you know I know" / "Yes"). Elena's voice is distinct in her cramped illustrations and phone-conversation cadence. No filter-verb stacks or head-hopping; the prose rhythms support pressure without opacity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>句rhythm varies well; sentence openings shift. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs detected. Minor overwriting in "soft mathematics of light" and "drop by drop, in this space where silence held more meaning"—elevated diction slightly exceeds the established register during peak beats (−0.3). The final paragraph's "cryptic doodles, eavesdropped on truths… thawing now, drop by drop" recaps themes rather than trusting the image, dulling momentum slightly (−0.2 scaffold).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The estrangement-by-silence premise and reconciliation-through-overheard-truth arc follow familiar templates. Transformation comes through specific details: the projector lens as inheritance artifact, the childhood concert-ticket cipher, the crystal forecourt's water imagery. The "I let you be wrong to stop being at war" line offers a fresh inflection on silence-as-strategy. Risk-taking is moderate—quiet, lyric ending with charged objects—but the emotional arc (misunderstanding resolved by shared honesty) remains close to the safety middle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maeve (quiet night registrar) drives two key beats: overhearing Elena and initiating the forecourt meeting. Her occupation flavors her voice (economical speech, "pale ink" ledgers) but does not constrain the reconciliation itself. The registrar role primes her habitual silence and the liminal hour, supporting setup and tone. Her agency at closure—confessing and taking Elena's hand—alters the relationship's state with visible cost (three years of endured isolation). Swappable with "archivist" or similar with minor edits, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The projector lens appears in three beats: Maeve's pocket-turning (paragraph 2), her explanation to Elena ("seeing isn't the same as understanding"), and the final sun-scatter across stones. It carries thematic weight (perception vs. understanding, inheritance artifact) and charges the closure image. Cost connection: Maeve kept it as a reminder of her father's deception and her own choice not to fight. High causal pressure and closure linkage; slight reduction because the lens explains rather than constrains a tactical choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Core concept "freed by honesty" shapes the dominant stake: Maeve's confession ("I've missed you every day") and Elena's document discovery converge to thaw mistrust. The concept drives the meeting and enables the reconciliation. Cost: Maeve admits her "surrender" was itself a lie, forfeiting the peace she thought she'd won. The concept is enacted on the page rather than merely thematic. Slight reduction: the final paragraph's direct articulation ("freed by honesty") states rather than dramatizes the concept, weakening closure specificity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Ambiguously clear" is attributed to the lens ("shapes rendered precise yet stripped of their usual meaning") in paragraph 2. It does not constrain an on-page choice; the lens functions symbolically rather than enabling or blocking action. The attribute colors Maeve's reflective mode but remains label-level decoration. No visible tradeoff tied to ambiguity itself—Maeve's confession is straightforward, not ambiguous.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Eavesdropping (hearing Elena through the window) is the inciting beat that motivates Maeve's message and the forecourt meeting. Without it, Maeve would lack the knowledge that Elena now knows the truth, and the urgency to confess would vanish. The action redefines options: Maeve shifts from passive hiding to active transparency. It drives setup and escalation, though the reconciliation itself proceeds through dialogue rather than further eavesdropping. Strong causal role; closure participation is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Cryptic doodles on concert tickets appear in three beats: Maeve's sent message (two birds, half-sun), Elena's arrival holding the stub, and Elena's reciprocal sketch (house, bridge, "stay"). The method is signaled early, tied to childhood trauma ("when their parents' fighting made speech feel dangerous"), and shapes the sisters' reconciliation tactics—they communicate through their private cipher before speaking. Causal pressure: the method enables contact after three years of silence. Slight reduction: mechanics (what the doodles mean) are told rather than shown in action.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt appears throughout: opening framing (water pooling), spatial anchors (Elena's approach sending ripples), and the final sun-scatter image. Rain-slicked tiles and murmuring channels create the "resonant hush" tone. The setting charges the closure image (lens scattering light across wet stones) and mirrors the thawing theme. It does not constrain a choice or supply a tactical resource; its role is atmospheric and symbolic. Strong closure participation and early setup; mid-band due to postcard-description risk and lack of micro-setting constraint on tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Timeframe "after words become unnecessary" describes the story's emotional destination and frames the final paragraph ("words had become unnecessary"). It does not tighten decisions or create a live clock; the reconciliation proceeds at conversational pace without time pressure. The phrase is thematic rather than causal. It appears late (final third) and functions as label rather than constraint. No visible cost tied to timing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maeve's motivation—to thaw mistrust with transparency—is dramatized through her choice to send the doodle, meet Elena, and confess ("I've missed you every day"). The desire conflicts with her prior strategy (letting Elena believe the worst to avoid combat), creating friction. Cost: admitting the "peace" she chose was itself surrender. The motivation drives two beats (initiation, confession) and shapes the ending. Slight reduction: the final paragraph's direct articulation ("thaw mistrust with transparency") tells rather than trusts the enacted scene.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tone—resonant hush—is established early (forecourt's "soft percussion," Maeve's night-shift economy with words) and sustained through the sisters' spare dialogue and the water imagery. It modulates under pressure: tighter during Maeve's confession, breathier in the final image. The tone charges the ending: handclasp and scattered light replace explicit resolution. Coherent through turns; strong closure contribution. Slight reduction: the final paragraph's meta-commentary ("silence held more meaning than years of argument") states the tone rather than embodying it.</comment>
