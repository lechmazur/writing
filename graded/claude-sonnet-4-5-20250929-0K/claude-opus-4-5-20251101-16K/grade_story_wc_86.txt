**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural. The narrative accretes reflective weight through layered backstory, symbolic objects, and atmospheric density, reaching closure through pattern break (empty pocket) and earned stasis.

**Closure Unit:** Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). Elena gives away the drawer pull, accepts her habitation of the space between apology and forgiveness, and descends. Visible cost: emptied pocket, relinquished talisman.

<question>1</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is specific (hidden letters, grandmother's desk, 23-year-old guilt) and her evolved stance (no longer seeking redemption) is clearly articulated. However, contradictory impulses are mostly summarized rather than dramatized in real-time; the line "she worked to recycle mistakes into wisdom" reads as diagnostic self-awareness rather than embodied struggle. The final micro-choice (giving the drawer pull) carries visible cost but arrives without complication or genuine internal resistance on the page. Vasili and the courier are functional but thin.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Orientation is clean by ~60 words. The single-scene structure with embedded reflection (~30%) is anchored to present stimuli (touching the pull, moon, footsteps). Closure lands: empty pocket is legible cost, the stasis is earned. However, the exchange proceeds without complication — Vasili's "Why?" creates a micro-tension instantly sidestepped, and no obstacle tests Elena's intention. The accumulative lens holds, but the middle section's heavy reflection defers dramatic pressure, making the closure feel slightly predetermined rather than discovered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The parapet is specific and tactile: grooves worn by negotiators, eastern stair, three centuries of storms. Mist and wind are integrated into action ("the wind pulled at her coat"). The drawer pull as micro-setting satisfies the 9+ gate test (constrains the final image via empty pocket). Weaknesses: "mist clung to its stones like a grieving thing" is a decorative simile that doesn't earn its pathetic fallacy, and the moon-phase system, while inventive, functions as exposition rather than environmental pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (guilt transformation) is signaled early but never genuinely tested. Under the accumulative lens, density increases toward the exchange, but no obstacle, risk, or competing pressure complicates the handoff. Elena requests a specific prisoner, gets him, gives the talisman, leaves. The "Why?" from Vasili is the closest to a tightening but deflates immediately. The cost (empty pocket) is visible but not hard-won — there's no moment where the exchange might fail or where Elena faces a genuine trade-off between competing goods.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The drawer pull's symbolic trajectory (grandmother's desk → hidden letters → talisman → given away → empty pocket) is genuinely effective and earns its resonance through particulars. However, the final paragraphs commit the thematic echo violation directly: "neutral territory existed not only between warring nations, but within a single human heart" and "The space between apology and forgiveness could be inhabited, could even become home" state the thesis in near-prompt language. This moralizing replaces what the image work had nearly earned on its own (−0.7 for final-paragraph explicit statement).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited is stable and distance-appropriate throughout. The contemplative register fits the character and situation. Dialogue is spare and functional — Vasili lacks a distinct voice, but the exchange is brief enough that this doesn't seriously harm. Weakness: the narrative voice sometimes drifts into literary-essay mode ("She existed in that strange territory between apology and forgiveness, a purgatory of her own making") that reads more as authorial framing than as Elena's specific perceptual signature under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"A furrowed hush fell between them, the kind of silence that held weight" — the first phrase is a strained mixed metaphor and the second is stock. "The weight of everything she had learned from loss" is abstract summary at a moment that wants concrete image. Near-paraphrase loop: "She no longer sought redemption" is restated across three sentences with slight variation. The closing paragraphs carry redundancy between the empty-pocket image and the explicit thematic statements. Prose is competent overall but lacks the propulsion and density that would elevate it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The moon-phase synchronization system and the ritualized parapet exchange are inventive world-building details. However, the core emotional arc (guilt-haunted professional performs symbolic act of release) is well-trodden literary territory, and the story doesn't significantly transform it. The transformation test applies: swap the profession and setting, and the emotional arc functions identically. The symbolic handoff of a talisman to a kindred spirit is a recognizable literary move executed competently but without surprise.</comment>
