<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Orin's motivation to preserve wonder is established and their seasonal muteness is seeded early, but the interior life remains somewhat abstract—more philosophical stance than embodied contradiction. The grandmother's trembling hands offer one concrete anchor, yet Orin's own choices feel more like careful adjustments than decisions under competing pressures. The final smile and trembling hands echo the grandmother but lack a dramatized cost that forecloses a live option on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean: Orin, Whispering Bluff, post-speech world anchored by ~80 words. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the sculpture's tuning and the dispersed wonder constitute a pattern-based deepening rather than a causal chain. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Orin's smile and trembling await the next wind, crystallizing endurance with felt cost (seasonal muteness, isolation, the ongoing labor). The iceberg hum's dissonance→harmony tightening provides one meaningful escalation that reweights the stake, satisfying the length's requirement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The Whispering Bluff's mist and thin mountain light anchor space; the iceberg fragment's ancient density and subsonic hum constrain Orin's tuning choices (copper chime adjustment, tension rebalancing). The sculpture's physical mechanics—bells, prisms, iron frame—ground the action in tactile detail. The fragment's glistening and the scattered rainbows charge the final image when wonder's color is felt below, meeting the 9+ gate's requirement that environment or object constrain choice and appear in closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving wonder—is signaled early. One on-page tightening occurs when Orin detects dissonance and rebalances the sculpture, a micro-decision that narrows immediate options and demonstrates craft under pressure. The stake deepens when the villages pause and "remembered what it meant to not understand," showing consequence. However, no live tradeoff or visible price is dramatized; Orin's seasonal muteness is mentioned but does not force a sacrifice on the page, keeping escalation in the solid mid-7s rather than entering 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—wonder versus efficiency, meaning beyond syllables—emerges organically from the sculpture, the villagers' thought-light, and Orin's seasonal affliction. The grandmother's trembling hands and the iceberg's "earth's first morning" voice root abstraction in particulars. The ending image (pale blue ancient ice, bells singing, Orin's trembling hands) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Minor deduction: "Wonder. That was what Orin labored to preserve" edges toward direct statement, though the surrounding images recover specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; Orin's perceptual signature—sound as speech, trembling creation, the body listening—is consistent and voice-motivated. Diction is controlled: "perpetual mist," "kinetic sculpture," "subsonic tone felt more than heard." No head-hopping. Minor penalty: some passages ("efficiency had swallowed astonishment," "people communicated in pure information") drift toward elevated register that borders on exposition rather than Orin's immediate texture, and one phrase ("whatever remained universal in the human heart") feels slightly generic under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high in the sculpture's mechanics and the iceberg's history. Clarity is strong except for two paraphrase loops: "meaning lived not in syllables but in resonance" is restated as "Truth needed no words, only the willingness to listen" in the final paragraph (−0.2 per the loop check), and "wonder itself. The color of it, the texture" adjacent to "For a moment, wonder had a color again" creates synonym churn (−0.2). The "trembling hands" motif recurs three times without adding pressure beyond the first, bordering on template cadence. No filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphors; proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—kinetic sculpture preserving wonder in a post-speech world—offers a fresh synthesis of sensory art and speculative silence. The ancient iceberg fragment as tuning heart is specific and non-obvious. However, the "villagers evolved past speech" setup and the guardian-artist role trend toward familiar SFF archetypes without sharp transformation; Orin's isolation and seasonal muteness add texture but do not fundamentally alter the familiar arc of solitary creator sustaining forgotten value. The emotional core (trembling toward the unreachable) is authentic, but the closing image (awaiting the next wind) feels expected rather than surprising.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Orin is on the page throughout; adjusts chimes, detects dissonance, rebalances the sculpture (two functional beats), and waits at closure. The tuning decision narrows immediate options (setup + development + payoff gates met). However, the choices feel technical rather than high-stakes; no cost tied to "harmonious bell tuner" as identity is dramatized—Orin's role could be "sculptor" or "sound artist" with minor edits. Causal pressure is present but modest; closure linkage is clean (Orin's hands tremble, awaiting the next wind). Score reflects solid beat involvement and closure presence but limited irreplaceability and no visible personal cost tied to the tuner identity itself.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Iceberg fragment introduced early (~10% mark); its ancient density makes it "sing differently" and hum subsonically. Used in two beats: Orin tunes it initially, then its hum signals dissonance mid-scene. At closure, it catches morning light and throws pale blue wonder down to the villages, charging the final image. The fragment's specific properties (ten-thousand-year-old ice, impossible coldness, subsonic tone) are irreplaceable and constrain Orin's tuning work. Minor friction: the fragment's mechanics are described more than handled on the page in the middle beat; the dissonance is attributed to a copper chime, not the ice itself, slightly reducing the fragment's causal centrality in that turn.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Concept signaled early ("symphonies of truth, compositions that required no translation") and restated at closure ("Truth needed no words"). The sculptures do speak truth through resonance, and this shapes Orin's labor on the page. However, "symphonies of truth" itself is treated more as thematic claim than a stake that alters tactics—Orin could equally be preserving "wonder" or "meaning" with near-identical actions. The phrase is ornamental label rather than a constraint that forces different choices; swappable with "music of meaning" or similar abstractions. Present in setup and payoff, absent from middle development as a distinct driver.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Seasonal muteness introduced early (grandmother paragraph, ~15%) and mentioned at closure ("Soon the winter silence would come"). It reframes Orin's isolation and makes the sculptures' permanence poignant. However, no on-page action is constrained or enabled by the trait within this single day's scene—Orin's voice is not tested, and the muteness does not force a visible tradeoff or alter a tactic. The trait enriches backstory and primes the ending's emotional charge but remains label-only in present action. Setup and payoff gates met; middle development gate missed. Cap at 4.6 per missing-middle rule, adjusted slightly upward for closure resonance to 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Glisten" appears prominently: iceberg "began to glisten, throwing scattered rainbows" (first occurrence), and at closure "bells and ice and light, glistening, singing" charges the final image. The glistening triggers the wonder-recognition in the villages below, a key turn. However, the action could be replaced with "shimmer," "gleam," or "refract" without structural loss; the iceberg's light-play is essential, but "glisten" as exact verb is swappable. Present in setup (early mention) and payoff (closure line), with implied middle development (light persists through the scene). Two-gate minimum met; causal role in one turn lifts score to mid-6s, but replaceability and lack of distinct cost tied to "glisten" cap it below 7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Kinetic sculpture is the method throughout: Orin adjusts chimes, the wind drives the mechanism, bells cascade, the sculpture translates wind into meaning. Mechanics matter on the page—copper chime axis shift, tension adjustments, weights and counterweights. The sculpture is causally active in two beats (tuning, rebalancing) and shapes the ending (sculptures speak for Orin, "keeping wonder alive"). Setup, development, and payoff gates all met. The method is specific and irreplaceable; removing "kinetic" and substituting "painting" or "song" would require total rewrite. Minor friction: the sculpture's exact workings are somewhat abstractly described ("delicate balance of weights and counterweights") rather than fully embodied, keeping score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Whispering Bluff anchored early: "world's edge frayed into perpetual mist," "high wind," "thin mountain light," "above the clouds." The height and wind directly enable the sculpture's function (wind-driven bells), and the mist carries vibrations to villages below, affecting outcome (villagers pause and remember wonder). The setting supplies the essential resource (wind) and transmits the effect (sound through mountain's bones). Setup, development (wind shifts, sculpture responds), and payoff (mist carries the effect down) gates met. The bluff's elevation and atmospheric conditions constrain Orin's medium and amplify the closure image. Solid integration across all three gates with causal pressure and closure linkage earns mid-to-upper 6s; irreplaceability slightly reduced because "mountaintop" could substitute with edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Timeframe "after words become unnecessary" established in opening paragraph ("villagers below had evolved past speech three generations ago") and colors the entire world logic. It shapes the central conflict (Orin's sculptures preserve what the efficiency-era lost) and primes the thematic stakes. However, the timeframe is static backdrop rather than a ticking clock; no decisions are tightened by temporal pressure within this single-day scene. The phrase "season was changing" introduces cyclical time but does not alter tactics on the page. Setup gate met strongly, payoff gate met (closure resonates with the post-speech context), middle development gate weak (time does not narrow options mid-scene). Lyric resonance lifts score into mid-5s per the allowance, but lack of live clock caps it below 6.5.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Motivation "to preserve the color of wonder" is dramatized: Orin labors on the sculpture, detects dissonance, rebalances it, and the result is that villagers "remembered what it meant to not understand." The desire drives on-page choices (tuning, adjustment) and the ending (sculptures will speak when Orin cannot). Friction between want (preserve wonder) and cost (isolation, seasonal muteness, ongoing labor) is implied but not sharply dramatized as a pivot—Orin does not face a moment where preserving wonder requires sacrificing something else on the page. Setup and payoff strong; middle development present but low-friction. The motivation is specific and shapes tactics, eligible for mid-to-upper 6s, but the lack of visible tradeoff in a high-pressure choice keeps it below 7.5.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tone "muted vigor" is coherent: restrained energy in "adjusted the final chime," "patient and tireless," "waited for the next wind"; vigor in the sculpture's cascading bells, subsonic hum, and Orin's "practiced certainty." The tone modulates subtly—calm tuning gives way to the "dissonance" alarm, then resolves to harmony and the final smile. The ending's quiet persistence ("trembling with the effort of creation") charges the final image without breaking into overt drama. Tone supports the concept (understated defiance against efficiency) and remains stable through the turn. Present across all beats; no jarring register breaks. Solid execution in all three gates and clear closure modulation earns low-7s.</comment>
