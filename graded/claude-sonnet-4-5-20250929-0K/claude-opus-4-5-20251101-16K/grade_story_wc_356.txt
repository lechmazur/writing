<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's drive to obtain the seed is clear and consistent, but her internal transformation from "ambition that burned steadily" to serenity feels more asserted than earned through dramatized contradiction. The moment she "finally understanding[s]" the undercurrent arrives via dialogue explanation rather than through on-page struggle between competing impulses. Embodied emotion is present in sensory details (inhaling, nose detecting scents) but the peak realization lacks the friction of simultaneous contradictory wants acting in scene. The final stillness beside the corpse flower demonstrates endurance with cost, but the path there compresses insight into a single reflective turn rather than building through micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening paragraph. The story follows a clear causal-accumulative hybrid lens: Mira's journey → conversation with Thessaly → seed acquisition → bloom → medicine harvest. One meaningful deepening occurs when Thessaly challenges Mira's approach and she begins to internalize the lesson. The closure—Mira sitting in stillness while others flee—demonstrates Earned Stasis with visible cost (enduring overwhelming stench) and forecloses the path of ambition-as-wildfire. The cost is legible on the page ("its stench drove everyone away" yet she remains), satisfying the closure requirement under the hybrid lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The treetop village is vividly rendered with rope bridges, swaying platforms, and cedar bark that Mira touches and inhales. Sensory hierarchy filters through her olfactory gift: she categorizes Thessaly's hanging herbs (lavender, rosemary, "something darker") in character-specific ways. The swaying bridges constrain movement and become a physical metaphor that charges the final choice—Mira "no longer fought the motion" on her return. The corpse flower's stench in the garden is the pivotal environmental pressure that tests her stillness, directly shaping the closure image. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the climb, village visit, and return.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—obtaining the corpse flower seed to heal sick children—is signaled immediately and drives all movement. Thessaly's challenge ("can you cultivate serenity within motion?") introduces a secondary pressure that braids with the primary goal. One clear tightening occurs when Thessaly reveals the seed but warns that the bloom's overwhelming smell will test Mira's stillness, narrowing her options to endurance or failure. The resolution is earned by Mira's alteration (learning to find stillness in motion) with visible cost: she must sit beside a flower whose stench drives everyone else away. Agency is demonstrated through endurance that forecloses the path of reactive ambition.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The theme of wisdom as an undercurrent—"not about acquiring knowledge" but "becoming quiet enough to hear what has always been there"—emerges through concrete particulars: the swaying bridges, Mira's nose sorting overwhelming scents, her grandmother's doodles on wrapping paper. The corpse flower's paradox (foulest stench produces healing medicine) embodies the insight that "healing often wears an ugly face" without abstract philosophizing. The final image—Mira in stillness beside the monstrous bloom, journalizing while medicine drips—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. The wrapping-paper custom grounds the theme: wisdom hides "in overlooked spaces, that the truest serenity is found not by escaping motion but by becoming its patient, breathing center." Minor slip: "finally understanding" in Thessaly's scene slightly over-articulates the realization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, filtering all perception through Mira's olfactory gift and herbalist expertise. Perceptual signature is distinct: she "instinctively categoriz[es]" scents, detects "the subtle sweetness of a ripe herb from a hundred paces," and reads the seed's "particular signature—the promise of decay, of transformation." Dialogue between Mira and Thessaly feels natural, carries subtext (Thessaly already knows what Mira seeks), and advances plot without exposition dumps. Psychic distance modulates appropriately: close during sensory moments, pulling back slightly for broader scene choreography. Diction remains consistent with Mira's character (herbalist, seeker) without register slips. Free indirect style is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with strong imagery ("mottled seed the color of bruised plums," "dawn light filtered through the canopy"). Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in key beats. Minor scaffolding appears in the reflection on bridges: "She thought of the bridges...She thought of her nose" uses identical stems without pattern-teaching payoff, creating mild template cadence (−0.3). The phrase "journalize" recurs as a verb where "record" or "write" might feel more natural, though it's voice-consistent. No paraphrase loops or figurative muddle in peak beats. The final paragraph compresses the bloom moment efficiently but could dramatize the stench's overwhelming quality more concretely rather than summarizing "its stench drove everyone away."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The combination of olfactory sensitivity, treetop village, and corpse flower creates a distinctive synthesis. The wrapping-paper journaling custom is specific and memorable, grounding the wisdom theme in tactile particulars. The core insight—serenity within motion rather than escape from it—transforms the familiar mentor-seeker trope through the physical metaphor of swaying bridges. However, the journey structure (seeker climbs to wise elder, receives object and lesson, returns transformed) follows a recognizable template. The emotional arc gains freshness from the sensory focus and the paradox of the corpse flower, but the beats themselves (arrival, conversation, departure, final test) are conventional. The specificity of execution elevates familiar material without fully transcending it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's ambition drives the three-day climb, her choices shape the conversation with Thessaly (producing the journal when asked), and her decision to internalize the lesson about serenity alters her tactics on the return journey and during the bloom. Present in setup (opening paragraph identifies her as herbalist seeking the seed), development (she chooses to record and reflect rather than grasp), and payoff (she chooses stillness over flight at the bloom). Causal pressure is clear: her herbalist expertise and olfactory gift enable the seed quest, and her transformation enables the final harvest.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The seed appears in three distinct beats: Thessaly produces it mid-story with its "mottled...bruised plums" description and olfactory signature, Mira secures it "against her heart" on departure, and its bloom creates the final test. Its properties (foulest stench, yet produces healing medicine) are specific and irreplaceable—the paradox charges the theme. The seed's presence shapes two key choices: Mira's acceptance of Thessaly's lesson (required to use it successfully) and her endurance beside the bloom (demonstrating mastery). It appears in and decisively shapes the closure image. Strong integration but not indispensable—a different rare medicinal plant could serve similar plot function with edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The concept is explicitly named and discussed in Thessaly's dialogue ("There is an undercurrent in that practice—do you understand?"), then Mira articulates it: "It's not about acquiring knowledge...It is about becoming quiet enough to hear what has always been there." The final paragraph returns to it: "wisdom hides in overlooked spaces." It shapes Mira's realization and her ability to sit in stillness at the end, altering her tactics from grasping ambition to patient endurance. However, much of its work is thematic resonance rather than on-page constraint of choices. Present in all three gates (introduced early, discussed at midpoint, echoed at closure) with moderate causal pressure on the final choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira's olfactory sensitivity is established in paragraph one and used in multiple beats: she detects the seed's signature even sealed in clay, categorizes Thessaly's hanging herbs by scent, reads "the complex air—cedar, mist, the distant sweetness of wildflowers." The trait enables her quest (finding and validating rare specimens) and creates a specific vulnerability that charges the closure—the corpse flower's stench is especially overwhelming to her, making her stillness more costly. The attribute constrains her final choice with visible tradeoff: her gift makes the test harder, yet she endures. Specific, irreplaceable, and causally active across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Journalizing appears in four beats: Thessaly recognizes it as "your family's way," Mira withdraws the journal and its wrapping-paper pages are described, she "doodled a small spiral" during the lesson, and she sits "journalizing on her wrapping paper pages" during the bloom harvest. The action embodies the family custom and connects to the wisdom theme (recording vs. acquiring), but the major turns (journey, conversation, bloom endurance) would function with minor edits if she simply "recorded" or "observed" instead. It shapes the ending image but doesn't define options at prior pressure points. Present in all three gates with moderate causal involvement.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The custom is introduced early (end of first third) when Mira withdraws the journal: "its pages crafted from the reverse sides of wrapping paper...Her grandmother had begun the custom, doodling remedies and observations on paper that once held gifts." Thessaly comments on it, Mira sketches the spiral and seed, and the final image includes her "journalizing on her wrapping paper pages." The method provides sensory texture ("margins...bloomed with sketched leaves") and thematic resonance (wisdom in "spaces between celebration and discarding"), but its mechanics don't constrain choices—any journal would serve the plot function. Lyric reprise from early mention to final image with thematic weight but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Velmara is introduced immediately ("treetop village...suspended among ancient cedars by rope bridges and woven platforms") and its environmental features pressure Mira's understanding: the swaying bridges require "constant adjustment," which becomes the physical lesson about serenity within motion. Spatial details are specific (platforms, doorways, hanging herb bundles) and the setting supplies the key constraint—Mira watches villagers move fluidly on swaying bridges and learns from their example. The village's inaccessibility (three-day climb) raises stakes. Present in setup, drives the middle lesson, and its principle shapes the closure choice. The treetop mechanics are causally essential to the serenity-in-motion insight.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The phrase "at the turning of the tide's thought" appears once in Mira's reflection as "the moment between knowing and understanding," a metaphor her grandmother used. It arrives late (second half) and does not function as a literal timeframe or deadline that tightens decisions. The story's temporal structure is sequential (three-day climb, single conversation, return journey, eventual bloom) but the tide metaphor itself is ornamental—it names the moment of insight but doesn't create urgency or alter tactics. Missing setup as a pressuring element and absent from closure mechanics. Conceptual presence without functional time pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's desire to cultivate serenity is introduced through Thessaly's challenge ("can you cultivate serenity within motion?") and tested across the story. Her starting state—"ambition that burned steadily"—creates friction with the required serenity. The bridges demonstration shows her "no longer fought the motion," and the final test (sitting beside the overwhelming stench) proves she has internalized the lesson. The motivation shifts from acquiring the seed through driven ambition to obtaining it through patient endurance, altering her tactics with visible cost. Present in development and payoff; the friction between wants (urgent healing) and required means (stillness) is dramatized at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The tone is established early through sensory restraint and quietness: "dawn light filtered through the canopy," "inhaling deeply," "small dwelling with layers of scent." Diction remains calm and observational even during the high-stakes bloom ("she sat beside it in perfect stillness"). The tone coheres across turns without melodrama and modulates subtly—slightly more urgent during the climb and conversation, deeply still at the closure. The "wildflower hush" quality (gentle, natural, patient) permeates the prose and charges the final image where stillness becomes active power. However, the tone is somewhat static—it doesn't sharpen or breathe with scene pressure as much as maintain one register. Coherent and purposeful but lacking dynamic range.</comment>
