<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's dual allegiance creates genuine internal conflict embodied through concrete choices—translating for the Council while encoding resistance in murals. Her interiority is specific and contradictory: "Dual allegiance was a splinter in her heart, but she'd learned to work around pain" shows lived-in tension. The foundation stone chip functions as both tactile anchor and value marker, grounding her motives in generational memory. Minor slip: "orderly intuitive nature" reads as tell-only label without on-page demonstration of how orderliness enables her encoding work.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Causal lens holds: Mira's choices flow from established loyalties, the Council's accelerated timeline tightens pressure, and her mural triggers community mobilization. Closure achieves Charged Poise—"They would not go quietly. They would not go at all"—crystallizing stance with felt cost (ongoing duplicity, personal risk). Orientation anchors quickly (Drift carnival, Mira's translator role, Development Council threat by paragraph 5). One meaningful tightening occurs when the timeline accelerates, forcing Mira from passive encoding to urgent action, and the ending reconfigures her stone chip from memory-object to rallying symbol.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The perpetual carnival on rafts constrains choices throughout—constant motion as survival strategy, platform sway affecting Mira's brushwork, outer rafts vs. central district as spatial stakes. Micro-setting details serve pressure: observation platform above Ferris wheel provides tactical vantage, neon veins as communication network, foundation stone chip as portable anchor. The closing line "painting the carnival in colors no developer could privatize" charges the final image by wedding setting to resistance. Sensory selection stays purposeful—calliope waltz, carnival lights, platform sway—filtered through Mira's tactical awareness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve Drift autonomy against privatization) is signaled early and tightens when the Council accelerates anchoring plans. Mira's agency is visible: she chooses to encode warnings, climbs to paint under time pressure, and the mural triggers coordinated community response. One meaningful escalation occurs when "worse than usual" news forces shift from passive translation to urgent mobilization. Cost is legible—her ongoing deception, personal risk, the "splinter in her heart"—though the ending's collective mobilization slightly diffuses individual price at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of resistance through cultural preservation emerges from concrete particulars—knot-tying, foundation stones, graffiti as encoded memory. The piece avoids thesis statements; instead "fragments could rebuild" and "together was everything" grow organically from the raft city's structure. Subtext operates in Mira's dual performance, the Council's avoidance of "privatization," and the carnival's "oblivious and defiant" persistence. The final image—carnival colors no developer can privatize—offers resonant answer to the central question without moralizing. Minor slip: "desperation learned to dance with hope" edges toward abstraction in the final line.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Mira; perceptual signature is selective—she notices platform sway, reads carnival semiotics, tracks Council euphemisms. Diction stays character-consistent with slight elevation for tactical intelligence ("culture shock absorber," "corporate poetry"). Dialogue with Tomás is spare and purposeful, carrying subtext in "Rocks don't remember" / "Neither do corporations." Minor slip: "aggressive joy of carnival life" and "neon veins" lean slightly toward writerly register rather than Mira's working vocabulary under pressure, though the latter phrase functions well as repeated spatial anchor.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—most lines advance character, world, or pressure. Two minor artifacts: "The Drift had always moved—that was its nature, its survival strategy" is near-paraphrase within the same sentence. "Dual allegiance was a splinter in her heart, but she'd learned to work around pain" uses metaphor that slightly contradicts itself (working around a splinter vs. with it). Overwriting appears briefly in figurative clusters: "eternal celebration, oblivious and defiant" / "desperation learned to dance with hope" stack poetic constructions in quick succession at the ending without full grounding in action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of carnival setting + graffiti resistance + dual-agent role is non-obvious and well-integrated. Transformation of gentrification-threat premise through floating city specifics (property lines require anchoring, platform reorganization as tactic) avoids template execution. Mira's encoded-art method and the foundation stone as memory-chip offer fresh inflections. Risk-taking in the perpetual-motion setting and cultural-encoding frame heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor limitation: the broader gentrification-resistance arc remains recognizable from similar narratives; the piece earns its score through specific execution rather than radical premise novelty.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Culture shock absorber present early (paragraph 3), constrains Mira's access and tactical position throughout (translating for Council while encoding for Drift), and shapes the closure choice (weaponizing her translator role). Her decisions—attending Council meetings, painting murals, organizing community response—create all key turns. The role is causally indispensable; removing it breaks the dual-allegiance engine and her tactical reach.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Foundation stone chip appears in three beats: opening (tactile anchor with generational memory), midpoint conversation with Tomás (prompts reflection on institutional vs. material memory), and closing (warm from body heat, "remembering"). The object reweights at closure—shifts from passive heirloom to active talisman of resistance. However, it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic; its function remains primarily symbolic and reflective rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dual allegiance framed immediately (translator for Council, secret muralist for Drift), shapes every major choice—which intel to encode, how to balance performances, when to escalate—and charges the ending ("carry her dual allegiance like the stone chip"). The concept is not merely thematic echo; it alters tactics on the page (softening proposals vs. painting coordinates) and creates the story's core pressure. Removing it collapses both the internal conflict and the plot mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Orderly intuitive" appears once as label ("the Council trusted her orderly intuitive nature"), but the trait never constrains or enables a visible action. The painting is described as "orderly despite the platform's sway," yet no cost or tradeoff is shown—e.g., her orderliness slowing urgent encoding, or intuition creating pattern-recognition risk. The attribute remains functional exposition rather than dramatized constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Reorganize" appears in three causal beats: Council's plan to "reorganize the whole grid system," Mira's counter-tactic ("reorganize into cooperative ownership"), and the ending mobilization ("they reorganized ownership structures"). The action drives the central conflict and Mira's encoded instructions. However, the verb could be swapped for "reclaim," "restructure," or "reformat" with minimal edit; it is essential to the conflict but not irreplaceable in its exact form.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Graffiti-art encoding introduced early (paragraph 8), mechanics detailed (fish scales = date, dancer ribbons = coordinates, kite = agreement), and method shapes Mira's nightly work and the community's coordinated response. The specificity matters—visual semiotics vs. verbal messages exploits carnival's aesthetic cover and Drift literacy. Removing this exact method breaks both Mira's tactical advantage and the cultural-preservation theme. The means is indispensable and drives closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Perpetual carnival on rafts anchors orientation, supplies resources (observation platform, neon network, outer vs. central zones as spatial stakes), and charges the final image ("colors no developer could privatize"). The setting's motion and connectivity enable Mira's encoding network; platform sway affects her brushwork; the carnival's "eternal celebration" contrasts and embodies resistance. The environment constrains Council plans (anchoring = property lines) and Mira's tactics (outer rafts for secret murals). Fully integrated across setup, development, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Before privatization" frames the entire conflict—Council proposals to anchor and impose property lines threaten the Drift's survival strategy. The timeframe tightens when the Council accelerates to "within the month," forcing Mira's urgent mural and the community's preparation. However, the live clock after that announcement is not tracked beat-by-beat; the story compresses "tonight" and "tomorrow" without minute-by-minute pressure. Essential to stakes but not micro-tracked in final execution.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Navigate gentrification is the dominant stake from paragraph 5 onward, dramatized through Mira's choices (translating vs. encoding, risking exposure, organizing resistance) and conflicted in her "splinter in her heart" dual loyalty. The motivation shapes all tactics and forecloses easy outs—she cannot simply quit or openly oppose. Visible costs include ongoing deception, personal risk, and the community's precarious position. The desire drives closure when collective action begins, though individual price at the ending is slightly diffused by the shift to plural "they."</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Hopeful desperation is coherent throughout—carnival's "aggressive joy" and "oblivious defiance," Mira's splinter-pain paired with action, "desperate hope" that built the Drift, and the closing line "desperation learned to dance with hope." Tone modulates under pressure: initial exposition is measured, accelerates when Council news arrives, and the ending layers defiance ("They would not go at all") with fragile resolve. The final image charges this duality—spinning carnival and mobilizing resistance—without resolving the tension, making the tone indispensable to closure effect.</comment>
