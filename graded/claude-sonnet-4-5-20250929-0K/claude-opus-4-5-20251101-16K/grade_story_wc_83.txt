<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Nadia's motivation is coherent—survivor guilt channeled into scientific obsession—and embodied through concrete action (turning the geode, positioning sensors). Internal contradiction appears in "becoming hollow" versus hunting meaning, though the contradiction could deepen further through on-page micro-choices under pressure. The therapeutic self-awareness ("bleak exhilaration her therapist named") verges on diagnostic label-speak but remains brief. The change at closure is renunciation/endurance (she commits to the hunt despite devastating knowledge) with visible cost, though the cost could be more viscerally felt.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through scientific readings, memory fragments, and the geode's recurring presence, culminating in a cadence shift where Nadia restarts her work with charged resolve. Orientation anchors (floating observatory, three years post-wedding, quantum potential pooling) arrive early. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image crystallizes her stance—she will hunt truth through every equation because she survived and refuses to waste that accident on forgetting—with conceptual cost (the terrible joy of seeing clearly). One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes unused potential is real and devastating, reweighting her entire hunt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The floating observatory at forty thousand feet provides atmospheric pressure and constrains her work to cooling cycles, which tightens the timeframe. The geode functions as micro-setting: positioned at the sensor array's focal point, it filters quantum fluctuations and sharpens readings, directly enabling her discoveries. Sensory detail is selective (cold viewport, dim emergency lights, crystal teeth catching light like frozen screams) and filtered through Nadia's scientific-poetic perception. The observatory's drift and the pools forming over Lagos, Sudan, Yemen anchor the global scale without losing spatial coherence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: proving unused potential is real and mapping its pools. The tightening occurs when her latest readings confirm massive pools forming—"the world was filling with unused potential"—forcing her to confront what happens at critical mass. Agency is endurance and attention: she chooses to continue the hunt despite the devastating answer. The cost is legible in "the terrible joy of seeing clearly," though the price could be more viscerally dramatized. No antagonist required; pressure accumulates through the accumulative lens as readings sharpen and pools grow.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the geode (pressure creating hollow beauty), the pools of unused potential, and Nadia's dual transformation into both scientist and hollow survivor. The wedding-drone strike anchors moral weight without sermonizing. The final image—"the geode glowing faintly in her peripheral vision" as she types—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: she maps loss to honor what was stolen, using her accidental survival as both tool and burden. Subtext operates in "the universe kept receipts" and "ghost math, forever almost." One minor slip: "unfiltered awakening" is stated rather than fully dramatized, though the context salvages it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with strong perceptual signature: Nadia's scientific precision bleeds into poetic metaphor ("ghost math," "frozen screams"). Distance modulates purposefully—closer during memory beats, wider during technical exposition. Free indirect style is clean. One brief register slip: "intangibly tangible" reads slightly thesis-like in "they were intangibly tangible," though it coheres with her research frame. Rhythm varies across beats (short urgent clauses during discovery, longer reflective syntax during memory). No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies (staccato circuit-breaker beats, flowing memory passages). Minor loop: "unused potential" appears seven times, creating slight redundancy though thematically justified. One metaphor strain: "crystal teeth...like frozen screams" reads vivid but borders on over-figuration. Filter verbs ("she wondered," "she was beginning to understand") cluster in reflective beats but remain voice-motivated. No major scaffold or template cadence. Propulsion is steady; the piece breathes appropriately for accumulative design.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of quantum perturbation theory with survivor trauma and ethical mapping of "unused futures" is specific and non-obvious. The floating observatory, geode-as-sensor-filter, and pools of potential forming over tragedy sites offer fresh particulars. Risk: centering on scientific abstraction in a grief narrative without melodrama. One friction: the premise echoes "mapping invisible scars" templates, but the quantum-potential mechanism and the devastating yes-answer transform it. The emotional calculus (hunting truth as both honor and self-punishment) avoids safety middle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Nadia's survivor status shapes her entire motivation and scientific mission; her brother Karim's death in the drone strike seeds the geode motif and drives the hunt. Present in setup (wedding memory), middle (therapist mention, "she survived when forty-three others didn't"), and closure (the refusal to waste survival on forgetting). The choice to resume calculations and continue the hunt emerges from this identity. Strong causal role across all three beats, though the final turn could more sharply hinge on a survivor-specific decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The geode appears in at least four beats: brother's gift (setup), workstation handling (early middle), sensor focal point (technical middle), glowing in peripheral vision (closure). It evolves from memorial object to scientific tool to charged symbol of hollow beauty. Positioned at the sensor array, it enables the sharpened Lagos/Sudan/Yemen readings. The "pressure and time creating hollow beauty" motif returns implicitly in Nadia's self-question and the final glow. Strong integration, though the mechanical use (filtering quantum fluctuations via crystalline geometry) could be more causally decisive.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Unfiltered awakening" appears explicitly once ("This was her unfiltered awakening—seeing the wound without bandages") and implicitly structures her choice to map loss clearly rather than forget. It reweights the middle beat (realizing unused potential is real and devastating) and charges the closure stance (mapping truth through every equation). The concept shapes her refusal of therapeutic sessions and the "terrible joy of seeing clearly." Present across setup (stopping belief in futures), middle (the devastating yes), and closure (carrying her higher into the dark where readings are clearest). Slightly tell-heavy in the explicit statement, but the dramatic beats support it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Intangibly tangible" describes the pools of unused potential: "registering on her sensors as definite readings while remaining impossible to capture, collect, or contain." This paradox enables the plot (she can detect but not interact) and constrains her method to mapping rather than intervention. Present in middle exposition and implicit in closure's limitation (she tracks storms but cannot pay the universe's debt). The trait shapes her scientific approach but does not force a visible on-page tradeoff or decision beat; it remains more conceptual frame than active constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The hunt structures the entire narrative: she "started hunting for them" (futures) in the opening, tracks pools "the way meteorologists tracked storms," and commits at closure to "hunt that truth through every perturbation equation." The action defines her post-wedding trajectory, drives the sensor work, and frames the final choice to continue despite devastating knowledge. Present in setup, multiple middle beats (Lagos, Sudan, Yemen readings), and closure image. Swapping "hunt" for "search" or "track" would weaken the predatory, obsessive tone but not break the plot; the specificity of hunting (versus passive observation) is thematically essential but mechanically near-replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Perturbation theory is named in setup ("Through perturbation theory, she had learned to detect the ripples") and middle ("The perturbation equations sprawled across her screens"). It provides the scientific method but does not shape on-page tactics or choices; the cooling-cycle pause and geode repositioning are the active beats, not the equations themselves. The theory appears as backdrop rather than constraining mechanics. Present in setup and middle exposition but absent from the closure beat, and its specific mechanics (how perturbations differ from other quantum methods) never matter to a decision.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The floating observatory anchors the entire piece: positioned at forty thousand feet to minimize interference, it isolates Nadia and enables the delicate sensor work. It supplies the cooling-cycle constraint (eighteen minutes, seven minutes remaining) that paces the middle beats. The altitude and drift appear in setup and closing image ("carried her higher into the dark"). The setting enables but does not pressure a specific choice; Nadia's decision to continue is internal, not forced by observatory conditions. Strong atmospheric and enabling role; would score higher if a setting constraint (e.g., failing life support, descent mandate) forced the final choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The circuit-breaker cooling cycle is stated early ("eighteen minutes," "Seven minutes remaining," "The circuit breakers clicked") and paces the middle reflection beats. It provides a local ticking clock that structures the scene but does not tighten the final decision; Nadia resumes work when systems hum back online, as planned. The timeframe constrains the middle pause but does not alter tactics or force a trade-off at closure. Present in setup and middle; implicit in closure's restart but not causally decisive there.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Nadia's desire to find where unused potential pools is stated in setup, dramatized in the sensor work (Lagos, Sudan, Yemen signatures), and drives the closure choice to continue the hunt. The motivation is conflicted: she needs to know if stolen futures exist in the quantum substrate, yet the answer is "devastating." Friction appears between the compulsion to see clearly and the terrible joy it brings. The want (proof) conflicts with the emotional cost (mapping loss forever). Present across all three gates with visible emotional cost in "bleak exhilaration" and the refusal to waste survival on forgetting.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Bleak exhilaration" is named explicitly once ("the familiar rush, the bleak exhilaration her therapist named") and sustained through "terrible joy of seeing clearly," "devastation," and the final image of rising "into the dark where the readings are clearest." The tone modulates: grief-heavy in the wedding memory, clinically precise during sensor work, charged at closure where devastation and commitment fuse. The paradox (joy in mapping loss) is embodied rather than merely declared. Coherent through turns and charges the final image, though the explicit naming by the therapist slightly undercuts the tonal work.</comment>
