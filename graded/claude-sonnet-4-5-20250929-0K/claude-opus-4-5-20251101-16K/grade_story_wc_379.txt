<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's core trait—"leads through following"—is asserted but never dramatized in a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The courtyard residents accumulate story fragments, yet Maren herself never selects what to hear or withhold under pressure; she passively receives and then orchestrates the collective action. The final beat (returning to Finch & Found with the brass key) reads as retrospective summary rather than embodied decision. Mrs. Delgado drives the climactic choice to open the mailbox; Maren nods assent but does not wrestle with competing goods or bear a personal price on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation cleanly (Maren, courtyard, dawn gatherings) and builds through an accumulative lens: story fragments about Vasquez sediment into collective understanding, then the demolition notice forces the mailbox opening. The closure unit—mailing the letters and the brass key keepsake—registers as Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost (the courtyard will vanish, but witness completes the story). However, the final image lacks the charged specificity that would make the cost undeniable; the Oaxaca payoff is narrated in future tense rather than dramatized, and the brass key feels asserted rather than earned from prior constraint. One meaningful tightening (the demolition deadline) drives the turn, satisfying the lens, but the ending drifts into theme summary ("That was enough") instead of a concrete image that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The courtyard is vividly anchored (terra-cotta pots, climbing jasmine, dawn light painting gold) and recurs across beats, establishing spatial coherence. The mailbox—brass mouth, padlock, accumulating letters—is handled on the page and its opening becomes the story's hinge. The thrift store and Oaxaca are named but not grounded in sensory or spatial detail, remaining abstract destinations. The courtyard does not constrain a choice or charge the final image in a way that would foreclose alternatives; it serves as backdrop rather than pressure-applying environment, capping the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving that listening heals—is declared early and remains abstract; no on-page choice tests Maren's commitment with visible cost. The demolition notice arrives as an external event that triggers the mailbox opening, but Maren does not wrestle with competing goods (privacy vs. closure, individual vs. collective agency) in a beat that narrows her options. The collective action (residents persuading the building manager, mailing the letters) distributes agency across the ensemble, diffusing protagonist pressure. One tightening occurs (the 60-day deadline), but the escalation is situational rather than choice-driven, and the cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme—healing through witness, the power of listening—emerges from events but is overtly stated in the final two paragraphs ("healing was not about preservation. It was about witness"). The locket and letters function as motifs, but their recurrence does not deepen meaning through contradiction or surprise; they illustrate the theme rather than complicate it. The ending offers a resonant image (Lucia receiving the package) but delivers it in summary future tense, losing the particularity that would let the reader feel rather than be told the thematic claim. The phrase "That was enough. That had always been enough" exemplifies Thematic Echo, restating the story's thesis in prompt-like language at closure (−0.6).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV centers on Maren with stable distance and perceptual filtering (e.g., "sandstorm calm—that particular stillness"). Dialogue is minimal but purposeful ("Someone should do something," "We need to open it"); voices are not tested for distinctness across stress. The prose carries a contemplative, slightly elevated register ("stories accumulated like sediment," "the machinery of progress grinding forward") that remains consistent and voice-motivated. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks mar clarity. The final-paragraph summary mode ("somewhere in Oaxaca, a woman would soon open") shifts into distant narration, softening immediacy without breaking POV coherence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Syntax varies purposefully, rhythm modulates with scene needs, and no paraphrase loops obscure clarity. Figurative language is controlled (e.g., "locked mailbox of his own making—the heart that couldn't unstick its clasp") without mixed metaphors or register drift. Information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or plot. The final two paragraphs lean into summary and theme statement, reducing propulsion, but do not create loops or scaffold that would trigger heavier penalties. Grammar, tense, and spatial choreography remain clean throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The locked-mailbox mystery and the courtyard storytelling circle offer a fresh synthesis, grounding the abstract "listening heals" premise in concrete objects and ritual. However, the story hews closely to a recognizable template: ensemble discovers hidden letters, collective action completes a dead man's unfinished business, demolition threatens the gathering space. The transformation test exposes limited originality—swap names and locale, and the emotional arc and plot beats remain unchanged. The ending avoids bold risk; it opts for affirming uplift rather than complicating the theme with moral ambiguity or cost that would challenge the premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Maren is present in setup (opening paragraph) and ending (brass key keepsake), but her curatorial discernment does not drive a middle choice with cost. She observes, nods assent, and reflects; Mrs. Delgado and the collective residents initiate the mailbox opening. The character is functionally present across beats but swappable with any facilitator role; the story would hold if the building manager or another resident led through following.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The locket appears in setup (Mrs. Delgado's mention), is discovered mid-beat (inside the mailbox), and is mailed at closure, fulfilling all three gates. It carries specific properties (tarnished silver, hairline crack, photograph of two children, faded script) that distinguish it from a generic keepsake. However, it does not constrain a choice or impose a cost; it is discovered and forwarded without friction. The locket reprises with reweighted meaning (symbol of the rift), but that reweighting is told rather than dramatized through a character's decision under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The locked mailbox mystery is signaled in the second paragraph, shapes the middle beats (residents share fragments about Vasquez's relationship to the mailbox), and is resolved at closure (opening reveals unsent letters). The mystery drives the ensemble's collective stake and the final mailing action. Removing the mailbox would break the story's central image and plot hinge. The element is causally indispensable but belongs to the ensemble rather than Maren's individual arc, slightly reducing its integration with the protagonist's choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Leads through following" is asserted in the opening paragraph and illustrated through courtyard sessions ("asking questions, leaning into pauses"), but the trait never constrains an on-page choice with visible cost. Maren does not face a beat where following prevents a more directive intervention, nor does the trait create friction that she must navigate. The attribute is present in setup and thematically consistent but remains label-only, not dramatized through a decision that forecloses an alternative path.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Hear" is thematically central—courtyard residents hear story fragments, Lucia will finally hear her brother's voice—and appears across beats (neighbors recount overheard conversations, the mailing enables Lucia to hear). The action shapes the story's method and resonates in the final image. However, no major turn traces directly to an act of hearing that changes options on the page; the residents accumulate knowledge passively, then act collectively to mail the letters. The action is pervasive but does not force a choice with felt cost, capping the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Neighborhood storytelling is signaled early (courtyard gatherings, fragments of memory shared across three years) and used throughout the middle beats (Mrs. Delgado mentions the locket, Terrence recalls letters, details accumulate like sediment). The method enables the collective discovery of Vasquez's story and motivates the mailbox opening. However, the mechanics are not tested under pressure; no storytelling attempt fails or incurs a cost that alters tactics. The method is functionally present and causally relevant but could be replaced with a found journal or overheard confession without structural loss, keeping it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The courtyard is established early (terra-cotta pots, climbing jasmine, dawn light) and recurs across beats, grounding the ensemble gatherings. The demolition notice creates urgency tied to the setting's impending loss, and the final paragraph acknowledges that "the courtyard would soon be concrete." The setting frames the story and its thematic claim (witness over preservation) but does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. It functions as coherent backdrop rather than micro-setting that pressures tactics, meeting two gates (setup, closure thematic charge) but missing middle development.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The timeframe—"when the outside world intrudes"—is dramatized through the demolition notice arriving with a 60-day countdown. The intrusion tightens the deadline and motivates the mailbox opening, satisfying setup and middle development. However, the 60 days do not function as a live ticking clock; no beat shows urgency dictated by elapsed time, and the resolution (mailing the letters) does not hinge on racing the demolition. The timeframe is signaled and causally relevant but does not alter tactics within the story's present window, keeping it in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Maren's motivation—"to prove that listening heals"—is stated early ("her true work unfolded" in the courtyard) and reprised at closure ("why the listening mattered"). The motivation frames her participation but is never dramatized through a conflicted choice with visible cost. She does not face a beat where proving the efficacy of listening requires a sacrifice or forecloses an alternative path. The motivation is present and thematically consistent but remains told rather than tested, satisfying setup and closure thematic linkage without middle friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Sandstorm calm—that particular stillness that settles when catastrophe is both certain and distant" is explicitly named when the demolition notice arrives and is sustained through the courtyard gathering and mailbox opening. The tone modulates subtly (contemplative in the opening, elegiac at closure) without breaking coherence. It charges the final image by reinforcing the theme of quiet witness over reactive urgency. The tone is consistent through turns and purposefully evoked at a key beat, but it does not create friction or constrain a choice, placing it in the upper mid-band without reaching indispensability.</comment>
