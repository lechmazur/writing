<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vera's guilt-driven motivation is embodied through the perfume bottle on her nightstand and her hands' tremor, avoiding label-only interiority. The apology beat is earned by prior causality, and Eleanor's metaphor-driven speech creates a distinct voice. Minor deduction: Vera's fifteen-year career and twelve-year spirit practice are told rather than shown through micro-choices, and the daughter Margot remains off-page, reducing relational pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Vera accepts the imperfect forgiveness and commits to writing the truth, forecloses her gossip-column path with visible cost. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The lens reads as Causal with accumulative texture: the séance enables the apology, Eleanor's metaphor narrows options, and the ending reweights the scandal. One tightening—Eleanor's directive—shifts Vera's stance decisively.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The archive's sheet music boxes and jasmine scent anchor setting and constrain the séance choice. The orchard timeframe charges urgency but remains external description rather than on-page pressure. Copper wire and generator are handled in scene, grounding the ritual. Sensory detail (jasmine, dust, cold air) filters through Vera's guilt-laden perception, supporting tone without becoming a checklist.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—delivering the overdue apology—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens when Eleanor responds. The confession beat narrows options (Vera can write the truth or remain silent), and Eleanor's metaphor-driven advice forecloses the gossip-column path with felt cost. Agency is clear: Vera's choice to contact her editor and sit among the compositions enacts the resolution. One meaningful tightening drives the ending under the Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme of imperfect miracles emerges through the séance's limitations (Eleanor's form flickers, forgiveness arrives "imperfectly") and the orchard metaphor ("some things die so other things can grow"). The ending offers a resonant answer without moralizing: imperfect forgiveness reweights the scandal's cost. The perfume bottle's jasmine ghost and Eleanor's out-of-sync voice embody the concept through concrete particulars. Minor slip: "imperfect was enough" risks summary, but the prior image work earns it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vera's perceptual signature is consistent: guilt colors her sensory intake (jasmine "accuses," light arrives "dirty"), and her gossip-columnist voice sharpens descriptions. Eleanor's dialogue carries distinct rhythm and metaphor-driven indirection. Psychic distance remains stable in close third. Minor deduction: Eleanor's "river doesn't apologize" metaphor, while character-appropriate, edges toward thematic speechifying; the voice briefly prioritizes concept over scene pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm modulates well: short beats during the confession, longer syntactic arcs during Eleanor's appearance. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. Minor deduction: "something like electricity, something like forgiveness, something like the imperfect miracle" stacks three metaphors in one breath, risking overwriting in a peak beat, though the pattern reads intentional and the closure remains clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The gossip-columnist-turned-medium synthesis offers a fresh angle, and the copper-wire séance grounds the supernatural in tactile ritual. Eleanor's metaphor-constrained speech and the orchard timeframe avoid stock ghost-story beats. Deduction: the premise—guilt over a damaging article, posthumous reconciliation—echoes familiar redemption templates without a bold structural or moral transformation. The execution elevates the material, but the core arc remains recognizable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vera's dual role frames the premise in paragraph one, drives the séance setup, and shapes her final choice to write the truth. Her gossip-column guilt and exorcist skills interweave causally: the column created the wound, the séance enables the apology. Present in setup, middle ritual, and ending resolution with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The perfume bottle anchors the séance (paragraph four), glows as Eleanor materializes, and empties of its jasmine ghost at closure, reweighting Vera's nightly guilt into a completed ritual. Handled in three beats with escalating function: guilt token, spirit anchor, closure marker. Its unique properties (Eleanor's scent, crystal vessel) make it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Imperfect miracles shape stakes throughout: the séance yields fragmentary contact, Eleanor's forgiveness arrives "imperfectly," and the ending explicitly names the concept while delivering on it through the incomplete resolution. The concept constrains tactics (Vera accepts partial forgiveness) and charges the final image. Present in setup expectation, middle execution, and thematic closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Eleanor's metaphor speech (river/stone, orchard/growth) appears mid-scene and enables Vera's tactical shift, but the trait arrives only after materialization. It constrains Eleanor's communication style and forces Vera to interpret, creating one beat of visible friction. Missing early signal and limited to one middle turn; closure participation is indirect (Vera recalls the advice).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Reconnection is the story's engine: Vera's goal from line one, the séance ritual in the middle third, Eleanor's materialization and directive, and the ending commitment to reconnect Margot with her mother's truth. Every major turn traces to this action. The verb "reconnect" recurs with reweighted meaning (ghost contact → mother-daughter bridge), making it indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Induced currents are signaled in paragraph five, the hand-cranked generator hums as Vera turns it, and the copper coils create the field Eleanor inhabits. The method shapes the séance attempt and provides tactile ritual detail. Present in setup and middle execution, but does not return or constrain the ending; the mechanics matter once, then fade.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The archive houses Eleanor's forgotten compositions and provides spatial grounding for the ritual. Vera's final choice to sit among the compositions links setting to closure, and the dusty boxes embody the scandal's erasure. Present in setup and ending, but does not pressure middle choices; the archive is backdrop more than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The orchard's impending destruction is introduced in paragraph two and bookends the story (Eleanor's metaphor, "the orchard waited"), creating thematic resonance. The timeframe establishes urgency but does not tighten on-page tactics; Vera's séance timing is internally motivated by guilt, not the external deadline. Lyric reprise with thematic weight but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The apology is Vera's stated goal from the opening, dramatized in the confession beat ("I lied about you"), and tested when Eleanor offers imperfect forgiveness. Friction arises between Vera's desire for absolution and the cost of accepting partial grace. The motivation drives setup, middle confrontation, and ending commitment, with visible emotional cost throughout.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Ethereal grit coheres through jasmine and dust, light "like dawn through dirty windows," and Eleanor's flickering form. Tone modulates under pressure: precise description during setup, cold sweetness at materialization, ragged breath at closure. The oxymoron is embodied in sensory particulars (dirty light, imperfect miracles) and charges the final image, though one slip toward abstraction ("ethereal grit of that waiting hour") risks naming the effect.</comment>
