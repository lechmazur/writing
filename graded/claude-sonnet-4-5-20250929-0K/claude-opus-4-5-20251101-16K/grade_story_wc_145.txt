<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is concrete and her dry wit is embodied through action ("editing your obituary"). Interiority is specific—thirty years of atlas editing creates a credible knowledge base and perceptual filter. The final choice to walk forward is earned by the condensation revelation, though the cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt. Minor slip: "subtly confident certainty that unsettled her colleagues" leans toward telling rather than showing the trait through a specific on-page choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Conceptual Repricing closure. Orientation anchors are clear by line three (outpost, falcon, Maren). The condensation pattern creates a meaningful deepening that reweights the theoretical stake into a navigable destination, and Maren's decision to walk forward forecloses the option of waiting for more proof. Cost is conceptual—she stakes her life on ephemeral evidence—legible in "the rusted outpost groaned once, like a warning" and her stepping into "worrying quiet." One persistent constraint (the phrasebook's dead linguist, the falcon's limits) shapes tactics throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The rusted outpost, frozen lake, and condensation on glass are vivid and purposeful. The condensation image directly constrains Maren's final choice, charging the closure. Sensory detail is selective: frost, rust, steam, silence. Minor slip: "sky the color of old pewter" is solid but not distinctive enough to elevate past competent description. The phrasebook's dog-ear and the falcon's embodied presence add texture that serves the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>One dominant stake (finding the singular convergence) is signaled early and remains coherent. The condensation revelation creates a meaningful tightening: theory becomes coordinates, forcing immediate action. The choice to pack and depart narrows options (waiting vs. acting now) with legible cost—she walks into "worrying quiet" on ephemeral proof. Agency is present in the decision to trust the pattern. The falcon scout and phrasebook translation build credible constraints. No reversals beyond the micro turn (condensation appears), but the accumulative lens does not require multiple plot reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—the tension between cartographic certainty and unmappable truth—emerges through concrete particulars: thirty years of corrections, a phrasebook from a dead seeker, water "remembering" its origin. The condensation image offers a resonant, non-literal answer to "where do rivers begin?" without moralizing. Maren's dry editorial voice ("Even the water wants editorial control") keeps the metaphysical grounded. The final image reweights prior atlas work as "cartographic trivia," making the conceptual cost undeniable. Subtext operates cleanly in silence, frost reclaiming glass, and the outpost's groan as warning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Single POV, consistent third-limited with close psychic distance. Perceptual signature is distinct: Maren notices through an editor's lens ("corrected cartographic errors," "capture geography in an instant"). Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("Typical"). Dialogue with the falcon is dry-witted and purposeful. Free indirect style is clean. Minor slip: "subtly confident" appears as authorial summary rather than emerging fully through Maren's choices. Rhythm modulates appropriately—crisp packing beats after the contemplative condensation moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no template cadence. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Clarity is strong with no loops or paraphrase chains. Figurative language is controlled: "wings cutting through the grey air like a rumor through silence" is fresh, "sky the color of old pewter" is competent but stock. Filter verbs ("watched," "knew") are minimal and voice-motivated. Opening and closing lines anchor effectively. One minor slip: "the tranquility here was absolute—no wind, no animals, no distant engines. Just ice and silence" lists absence rather than embodying it through sensory detail.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The condensation-as-map conceit is a specific, non-obvious synthesis that transforms the atlas-editor premise. Maren's dry editorial voice distinguishes her from generic seekers. The phrasebook from a dead linguist adds earned pathos without sentimentality. Risk: trusting ephemeral evidence for a life-or-death trek. Minor derivative pressure: lone researcher at remote outpost echoes familiar isolation tropes, though the cartographic angle and the condensation method freshen it. The ending commits fully to its premise without hedging.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's editorial background frames her perception throughout (atlas knowledge, error correction, "capture geography in an instant"). Her dry wit shapes two dialogue beats (falcon, water's editorial control). The choice to walk forward at closure is hers, altering tactics from theory to action. Present in setup, middle (translation, packing), and ending (stepping out). Causal pressure: her skill enables the condensation reading. Cost: stakes her life on pattern recognition. Swappability test: "meteorologist" or "linguist" could function with edits, but "atlas editor" specifically motivates the convergence obsession and the instant-memorization skill.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The phrasebook appears in setup (gift from dead linguist), middle (translation beat with dog-ear detail), and ending (pressed against chest). The dog-ear marks directional vocabulary, enabling the Evenki translation. Reprise at closure ("pressed against her chest") reweights it as talisman and link to prior failure. Two distinct beats: translation, departure. Causal: without it, the falcon message is unreadable. Swappability: "any reference book" could function; the polyglot's death and the specific dog-ear add charge but the object itself is not irreplaceable. Cost is inherited (dead linguist) rather than created by Maren's use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The singular convergence is Maren's motivating obsession, stated early and driving all choices. It shapes stakes (theory vs. place), alters tactics (waiting vs. immediate departure when condensation reveals coordinates), and charges the final image ("convergence that every river knew but no cartographer had ever shown"). Present in setup (theory explanation), middle (condensation validates it), and ending (she walks toward it). Causal pressure: the concept narrows her life to this single quest. Cost: isolation, colleague ridicule, staking her life on ephemeral proof. Irreplaceable: "hidden source" or "origin point" would dilute the all-waters-converge specificity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Subtly confident" appears as authorial summary ("she knew with a subtly confident certainty") rather than constraining a specific on-page action. It colors her dismissal of colleagues and her immediate trust of the condensation pattern, but the trait itself is told rather than shown through a visible tradeoff. No distinct middle beat where confidence enables one choice and costs her another. Present in setup (theory conviction) and ending (walks forward "anyway"), but the attribute never generates friction or visible price. Swappable with "determined" or "obsessive" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Herald" appears only in the final third as Maren's internal future plan ("ready to herald the discovery"). No middle beat where the act of heralding shapes a present choice or creates friction. It does not constrain tactics, generate cost, or alter the closure image—she walks toward the convergence, but the heralding itself is off-page aspiration. Late arrival (final third) and summary-only use. Swappable with "prove," "announce," or "document" without loss. Cap: late introduction (4.6), summary-only (−0.8), ornamental (−0.5) → 3.3, but acknowledge it colors her goal framing → 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Condensation on glass appears in setup (steam gathering), climax (droplets trace river tributaries), and ending (frost reclaims glass). The pattern's mechanics—moisture remembering origin—drive the major turn: theory becomes coordinates, forcing immediate action. Causal pressure: without it, Maren has no destination. Cost: ephemeral evidence she must memorize before it dissolves. Specificity: "water remembering where it came from" is irreplaceable for the convergence theme. Two beats: formation, dissolution. Closure linkage: her departure is triggered by this revelation. Cap waived; reaches mid-7s on causal + closure work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The rusted outpost and frozen lake are present throughout: setup (window, rail, walls), middle (stove, packing), ending (lake ice she'll walk on, outpost groans warning). Setting enables tactics (falcon scouts, ice holds weight, isolation allows focus) and charges the final image (stepping into crystalline silence, ice stretching toward convergence). Rust and cold create atmosphere that supports "worrying tranquility." Spatial choreography is clear. Three gates met. Causal: outpost isolation is necessary condition for the work, lake ice is the path forward. Swappability: "remote cabin by tundra" would function with edits, but the rust/frozen/isolated trinity is tightly integrated.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the falcon returns" anchors the opening beat but does not create urgency beyond Maren's relief ("Another hour and I'd have started editing your obituary"). The three-day trek is projected future, not a live countdown shaping present choices. No middle beat where time pressure forces a tactical compromise. Ending: she departs immediately after the condensation revelation, but the trigger is the pattern, not a ticking clock. Functional framing but swappable with "at dusk" or "when the message arrives." Two gates (setup, ending) but no development beat where time constrains choice. Cap: missing middle development (3.4 max), but setup + ending reach upper functional → 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Maren's desire to find the rivers' origin is established early, dramatized in her decade-long obsession, colleague friction, and the choice to walk into danger on ephemeral proof. Setup: theory explanation and motivation. Middle: condensation validates the quest, triggering packing. Ending: she walks forward despite "worrying quiet," forgoing safety. Cost: isolation, ridicule, life at stake. Friction: colleagues unsettled, dead linguist's failure looms, convenient theory vs. concrete risk. Causal: this want drives every beat. Irreplaceable: "to map uncharted territory" would weaken the all-waters-converge specificity. Three gates, two beats, closure active.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Worrying tranquility" is coherent throughout: "absolute" calm, silence "like the world holding its breath," "too still, as if creation was waiting," "crystalline silence," "the ice stretched toward a convergence." Tone modulates subtly—relief at falcon's return, excitement at condensation, then walking into dread-charged stillness. The final image charges prior calm with ominous cost. Setup and ending strong; middle beats (translation, packing) maintain the mood without deepening it. Purposeful match to accumulative lens. Swappability: "eerie calm" or "ominous peace" could substitute with minor edits. Three gates met, closure linkage present, specificity solid but not irreplaceable.</comment>
