<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's gondola operator expertise is established through her method of reading passengers, but her interior life remains largely instrumental—she exists to deliver therapeutic insight rather than struggling with her own contradictions. The passenger's grief is embodied through "noise levels" and storm glass reactions, yet his interiority stays abstract: "corrosive frequency" and "unprocessed" hum are diagnostic labels rather than lived experience. The wife's absence is mentioned but never becomes a tangible pressure that forces messy, irrational choices. The final exchange feels like a philosophical Q&A rather than a moment where competing desires collide with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (gondola operator, drifting prism terrace, storm glass vial). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: sensory density and the passenger's gradual shift from "clouded" to "crystalline and clear" glass mark the arc. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the man carries "the first quiet he had known in months"), but the cost is asserted rather than shown—no visible forfeiture or choice that forecloses a path. The storm glass does the emotional heavy lifting, leaving the man's agency passive. The piece teaches its pattern early and holds it, but the ending reconfigures through告 tell rather than image or action that makes the price undeniable on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace is vividly rendered with specific, POV-filtered details: "prismatic wind," "cathedral door" prism, "light pooled like liquid metal." The storm glass vial functions as micro-setting, constraining Mira's diagnostic method and charging the final exchange. Spatial choreography is clean across the drifting platforms. The terrace itself pressures the passenger's journey—its "in-between" quality mirrors the therapeutic transit—and the final anchoring point becomes the threshold where he steps into "the waiting world," a purposeful environmental beat that shapes closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—teaching the passenger to accept silence—is signaled early but unfolds through exposition rather than escalating pressure. The man's "noise levels" shift from "interference" to "crystals...clear," yet this tightening occurs via Mira's monologues and the storm glass's reactions, not through the man's contested choices. There is one meaningful deepening (his admission "I still can't manage it"), but it arrives as confession rather than a decision that narrows options or forecloses a path. The "quiet after the echo" reweights the concept at closure, but the passenger remains largely passive, carried by Mira's wisdom rather than his own agency under fire.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme—silence as invitation rather than abandonment—emerges organically from the prism terrace, storm glass, and the train whistle echo. However, Mira's speeches veer into thesis statement territory: "Teaching silence how to comfort," "Listening is making yourself available to what arrives." The final exchange ("When the noise stops arguing with the silence") explicitly articulates the thematic answer rather than letting the image do the work. The storm glass's shift from "clouded" to "crystalline and clear" offers a visual corollary, but the surrounding dialogue over-explains what the image already conveys, reducing resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Mira with clean focalization and no head-hopping. Her perceptual signature—"frequencies beneath speech," "difference between productive thought and corrosive rumination"—is distinct and consistent. Dialogue pursues therapeutic goals but skews toward lecture: Mira's lines are polished aphorisms ("Silence becomes hostile when we fill it with our own accusations") rather than speech under pressure. The passenger's sparse replies feel more like prompted responses than autonomous voice. Diction is controlled and literary throughout, fitting the vaulting tone, though emotional peaks do not compress or fracture syntax as stress might demand.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished with strong sensory specificity ("light fractured into ribbons," "prismatic shadows that painted the man's face in shifting blues and golds") and no grammar or punctuation errors. However, the piece carries scaffold and overwriting: "that peculiar hollowness that drove most travelers to seek passage across the terrace in the first place" is explanatory padding; "fluidly logical in the way she had trained it to be, each word placed with the precision of a mathematician solving for peace" stacks modifiers without adding new information. Figurative density is high in expository beats ("silence pooled like water," "storm glass...mapping the interior landscapes") but remains coherent. The closure beat is clean, though "the long education of silence" in the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace and storm glass vial as diagnostic tool offer fresh specificity, and the "noise levels" metaphor is inventive. Yet the core arc—therapeutic guide helps grieving passenger find peace through insight—is a familiar template, and Mira functions as wise facilitator rather than a character with her own stakes or blind spots. The transformation hinges on delivered wisdom rather than hard-won realization, and the passenger's arc follows a predictable grief-to-acceptance path. The prism setting distinguishes the piece aesthetically, but the emotional and thematic territory remains well-trodden, with no unexpected turn or moral complexity that resists easy resolution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mira frames the journey and delivers therapeutic insight at two beats (mid-journey speech, final exchange), shaping the passenger's arc. Her choices—when to speak, which metaphors to offer—guide the narrative, but her own interior stakes never surface. She observes, diagnoses, and instructs without facing a dilemma or cost tied to her role. The closure belongs to the passenger; Mira's contribution is instrumental and consistent across beats, not transformative for her character.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The storm glass vial appears in four beats: initial clouding, mid-journey feathered shift, late peaceful formations, and final "crystalline and clear" reading. Its changing state tracks the passenger's emotional arc and provides a visual corollary to his progress. However, the glass is passive indicator rather than active tool—Mira observes it but does not manipulate or rely on it for a tactical choice. It charges the final exchange by confirming the man's readiness, yet its role is confirmatory rather than causal. The vial is present across beats and contributes to closure, but removing it would only require Mira to read the man's demeanor directly—swappable with moderate edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"In transit" shapes every beat: the drifting terrace, the gondola passage, Mira's framing ("the transit itself was the destination"), and the passenger's journey from clouded grief to carried quiet. The concept pressures the man's choices—he must endure the liminal crossing to reach the "far anchoring point"—and reweights at closure when he "walked into the waiting world." The stakes are entirely transit-bound: the terrace's "in-between" quality mirrors his emotional state, and the ending hinges on his stepping from drift to solid ground. The concept is not merely thematic but structural, constraining the narrative arc and tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Mira's "fluidly logical" speech is mentioned once in exposition ("her voice measured, fluidly logical in the way she had trained it to be") and demonstrated in her careful, aphoristic dialogue. The trait colors her method but does not enable or constrain a specific choice with visible cost. Her logic guides the passenger, yet no beat shows her logic failing under pressure or forcing a tradeoff. The attribute is label-plus-demonstration, functional but replaceable—if her speech were "gently intuitive" or "patiently precise," the arc would proceed unchanged with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Catalyze" is named once as Mira's work ("My work isn't to extract your story. It's to catalyze something simpler") and demonstrated when her speeches prompt the man's slight hand unclenching and final admission. The action shapes two beats and aligns with closure (the man "ready" after catalysis completes), but the mechanics are abstract—Mira's words trigger shifts in the storm glass and the man's posture, yet no specific catalytic choice or tool is deployed that could not be replaced by "guide," "facilitate," or "teach." The action is present across beats but swappable without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Monitoring noise levels" is introduced early as Mira's method ("frequencies beneath speech, the static that accumulated") and applied in three beats: initial assessment ("His noise levels registered like interference"), mid-journey observation ("noise levels spiked"), and final confirmation ("When the noise stops arguing with the silence"). The method provides her diagnostic framework and shapes when she speaks, but it is passive observation—no beat shows her adjusting course based on a noise-level reading that alters tactics under pressure. The method is present across beats and contributes to closure framing, yet removing it would only require Mira to read body language or the storm glass alone—swappable with moderate edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace provides spatial constraint (floating platforms, rotating prisms) and sensory pressure (refracted light, prismatic wind) across every beat. It shapes Mira's route choices ("guided the gondola around a slowly rotating prism"), mirrors the passenger's emotional drift, and charges the closure with its "far anchoring point" threshold. The setting is not merely backdrop: the terrace's liminal, in-transit quality pressures the man's journey and makes the final step onto "solid ground" a decisive spatial and emotional crossing. Removing the terrace would collapse the transit metaphor and the physical stakes; no generic "river" or "path" could replace its specific drifting, prismatic constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The train whistle echo appears twice (opening and closing) as a sonic motif that frames the quiet-after-sound theme. Mira's line "Do you hear what comes after?" ties the whistle to her teaching, and the final beat ("she listened for the echo's end") reprises it. However, the whistle does not tighten decisions or impose a clock—the passage unfolds in undifferentiated "tonight" with no urgency or deadline. The timeframe is atmospheric reprise, not causal pressure. It seeds and returns with thematic resonance, reaching ~6.3 lyric range, but late first mention (after the man boards) and lack of middle involvement lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Mira's motivation "to teach silence how to comfort" is named once and demonstrated across three beats: her initial speech about presence versus absence, the mid-journey metaphor about silence having "no opinion," and the final exchange confirming the man's learning. The motivation drives her choices (when to speak, which lessons to offer) and shapes closure (the man leaves with "the first quiet"). However, the motivation faces no friction—Mira never doubts her method, encounters resistance that forces her to adapt, or pays a cost for her teaching. The desire is clear and dramatized through action, but without conflicting wants or visible tradeoff it trends functional rather than indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Vaulting hush" appears once as phrase ("The vaulting hush of the terrace wrapped around them") and is sustained through diction across every beat: "silence pooled like water," "whisper of prismatic wind," "quiet after the echo." The tone modulates subtly—from the man's initial tight silence to the "expansive and permissive" hush mid-journey to the final "perfect moment when space opened." The tone charges the closure by making the quiet itself the earned gift. However, the tone remains largely static in register (literary, contemplative) without sharp contrast or pressure-driven shift. It is coherent and purposeful, shaping the final image, but lacks the tonal pivot or dissonance that would push it higher.</comment>
