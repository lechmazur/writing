<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's interior life is mostly embodied through gesture and perception (watching hands, translating movement), with clear contradictory impulses—loss versus discovery, isolation versus connection. The final choice to share her method with the child is motivated by prior causality and carries visible cost (exposure of her private practice, end of solitary mapping). Minor deduction: "joyful sorrow" appears as a label in peak beats without always being dramatized through contradictory action. The mother and child are present but function primarily as recipients; Mira's agency drives the closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: Mira's solitary method is established, then disrupted by the encounter, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (she shares her private translation and finds connection). The closure lands on the page with felt cost—her private practice is no longer hers alone, and the final image (hands dancing, symphony only the deaf can hear) reweights the earlier isolation with undeniable emotional pressure. One tightening: the encounter narrows her solitude and forces her method outward, ending her hermetic mapping.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The harbor is anchored early with silver moonlight, swaying boats, and dock, filtered through Mira's deaf POV (she watches gesture and movement). The setting constrains her method—she comes here specifically to map silence through visual rhythm. The empty camera, moon, and water recur and charge the final image. Minor gap: the harbor itself does not impose a tactical choice or resource pressure beyond being the stage for the encounter; it remains largely atmospheric rather than causal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Mira seeks to translate silence into music (signaled early). The encounter with the mother and child tightens pressure by offering a live test of her method and forcing her out of solitary observation into shared communication. Agency is clear: Mira approaches, signs, then improvises her hand-dance for the girl, a decision that forecloses her private method and opens connection. The cost is visible—her isolation ends, her technique is no longer secret—and the final image reweights the stake by showing the child learning, making Mira's loss/transformation tangible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme (silence as fullness, not absence; communication beyond sound) emerges from concrete particulars: the empty camera, the fisherman's hands, the sign-language exchange, the improvised gesture-dance. The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"a symphony played that only the deaf could hear"—that reweights prior material without moralizing. The child learning to see music in movement crystallizes the theme with earned specificity. Minor slip: "joyful sorrow" is named twice rather than solely embodied, though the scene does dramatize both joy (connection, teaching) and sorrow (loss, forgetting).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtered through Mira's deaf perception (visual focus, gesture-reading, remembered sound). Perceptual signature is distinct: she notices hand patterns, boat sway, moon texture. Distance is controlled; no head-hopping. The prose modulates appropriately—lyric during mapping, warmer during the encounter. Dialogue (signed) is minimal but purposeful, advancing the meeting and the theme. Minor deduction: a few filter verbs ("she had discovered," "she felt") slightly dull immediacy in non-peak beats, and "joyful sorrow" is asserted rather than solely shown through perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, sentence openings shift, information density is generally high. Clear propulsion through most beats. Figurative language (tide pulling, door opening, symphony in silence) is coherent and voice-motivated. Issues: "The language of hands at work, speaking stories to no one" and "the unheard symphonies of a world that kept dancing" edge toward overwriting in the same paragraph. "Joyful sorrow" appears three times, twice as a label. The phrase "Beautiful, invisible, alive" is a stock triad. Template cadence in one passage: "She raised… She had devoted… She had discovered…" Apply −0.6 for pattern density and label recurrence in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—deaf advisor translating silence into movement via an empty camera—is specific and non-obvious. The encounter with the deaf child transforms the concept from solitary practice to shared pedagogy in a way that feels earned. The lyric frame and gesture-dance innovation lift the piece above template. Risk: the extended metaphor (silence as music) and the moonlit-harbor lyricism approach familiar territory; the execution is strong but not radically fresh. The closure's inevitability in hindsight and the specificity of the empty camera and sign-language bridge justify solid but not exceptional originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mira (whispering advisor) is the protagonist. Her past role as advisor is backstory; on the page she observes and then chooses to approach and teach the child, a decision that alters the outcome. She is present across all three beats (setup, middle encounter, closure gesture-dance) and her choice drives the ending. However, the "whispering advisor" identity is mostly told in backstory rather than enacted on the page; her current action is solitary mapping and then teaching, not advising composers. The element is functional but the specific "whispering advisor" past does not constrain her present choices—she could have had any musical past. Cap at 4.6 for limited causal necessity of the exact past role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The vintage camera with no film is introduced early, used twice on the page (framing the fisherman, framing the woman and child), and clicked empty at the very end to underscore that "some music exists only in the moment of its making." It is clearly not a functional camera but a framing device, and the story explains this ("merely a frame now"). The final click charges the closure by reinforcing the theme of ephemeral beauty. The camera's specific emptiness (no film) matters thematically but does not constrain a choice or tactic under pressure—Mira uses it the same way throughout. Present in setup, middle, and payoff; shapes one key thematic beat (the final click). Score in the 6-band for thematic reprise without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sign language is introduced when Mira watches the mother signing, then used on the page when Mira signs a greeting and conversation, and finally improvised beyond formal signs into gesture-dance for the child. It directly enables the encounter and the teaching moment, shaping the middle and ending beats. The story differentiates formal sign language from Mira's invented movement-translation, and the child's learning to "see music" through gesture is the closure payoff. The concept is present in setup (watching), development (signing), and payoff (gesture-dance teaching), and it constrains Mira's method of connection. Strong integration with visible cost (she must share her private language).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Quietly charismatic" is mentioned once in backstory ("the quietly charismatic presence who could hear what others couldn't") but never enacted on the page. Mira's present actions—solitary observation, tentative signing, kneeling to teach—do not dramatize charisma or its cost. The attribute is told, not shown, and does not constrain or enable an on-page choice. Present only as a label in backstory; no middle or closure participation. Ornamental use, swappable with other past traits. Cap at 3.4 for missing middle development.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Disrupt" is thematized on the page: "This was the disruption Mira had been seeking without knowing it. Not a destruction but an interruption—of isolation, of forgetting, of the lie that silence meant absence." The action (approaching and teaching the child) disrupts Mira's solitary method and ends her isolation, driving the closure. However, "disrupt" is more a conceptual frame than a distinct physical action; the actual moves are approach, sign, teach. The word is explicitly invoked at the turn, shaping interpretation, but the mechanics are standard (conversation, demonstration). Present in middle and payoff; redefines Mira's method. Causal but somewhat abstract; score mid-6s for thematic necessity without unique tactical mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Mapping silence" is introduced early as Mira's method ("This was her method: mapping silence"), demonstrated when she frames the fisherman's net-mending and the woman's signing, and then transformed in the climax when she improvises gesture for the child. The method shapes her tactics throughout (why she uses the empty camera, why she approaches the signers) and is explicitly shown on the page. It is present in setup, development (framing), and payoff (teaching via gesture), and it drives the closure by becoming a bridge. The method is specific and irreplaceable; removing it would break the story's logic. Strong integration with visible cost (the method must be shared to complete its purpose).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The harbor is anchored early ("harbor gleamed silver under the moon") and sustained throughout (dock, fishing boats, water, moonlight). It provides the stage for Mira's mapping practice and the encounter. The "luminous harbor by moonlight" recurs in the final image ("The moon continued its watch. The harbor glowed"). However, the harbor is primarily atmospheric; it does not impose a tactical constraint or supply a resource that alters Mira's choices—she could map silence in many locations. The moonlight contributes to the lyric tone and the visual focus fitting a deaf POV. Present in setup, middle description, and payoff reprise; shapes mood and theme but not tactics. Score in low 6s for thematic resonance without causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"When no one remembers you" is introduced in the opening line and mentioned once more in backstory ("the world went silent and then forgot her entirely"). It motivates Mira's solitude but does not impose a time constraint or tighten her decisions on the page. The encounter with the mother and child does not hinge on the timeframe of being forgotten; Mira's current isolation is the functional stake, and the forgetting is context. The element is present in setup as mood but absent from middle development and does not return at closure. Told rather than dramatized; no clock or deadline. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle and closure participation; deduct further for summary-only use to 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to translate silence into music" is signaled early ("She had devoted herself to translating silence into music") and dramatized on the page: Mira watches gestures as music, raises her camera to section off "symphonies," and finally teaches the child to see rhythm in movement. The desire is tested when she must share her private method (friction between solitary practice and connection), and the closure shows the cost—her translation is no longer hers alone. Present in setup (stated and shown via camera use), development (watching and framing), and payoff (teaching the child, final "symphony" image). The motivation drives choices and carries visible cost. Strong integration; one small deduction for the motivation being somewhat told ("she had devoted") rather than entirely inferred from action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Joyful sorrow is named twice ("the same joyful sorrow," "the joyful sorrow of her life") but also enacted throughout: loss (deafness, forgetting, isolation) layered with discovery (mapping, beauty in silence, connection with the child). The tone modulates with pressure—lonelier during solitary mapping, warmer during the teaching moment—and charges the final image where "a symphony played that only the deaf could hear" synthesizes both joy (the child learning, connection) and sorrow (the cost of loss, the exclusivity of this beauty). The tone is coherent across beats and integral to theme. Minor deduction for labeling the tone twice rather than solely embodying it, but the execution is strong and the closure image delivers the tonal synthesis without restatement.</comment>
