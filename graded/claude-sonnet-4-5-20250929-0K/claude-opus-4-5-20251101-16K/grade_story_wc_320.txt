<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and her choice to "discard assumptions" shows agency, but her internal arc feels too smooth—she reaches the core insight without meaningful resistance or cost. The grandmother's philosophy and the decision to use Clara Vance's fragment are established, but the emotional stakes remain abstract; we never see Mira risk or forfeit something personal. Embodied emotion is present in "her fillings ache" and the laugh, yet the climactic understanding arrives as revelation rather than struggle. The final choice to wake the towers feels inevitable without visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers celestial interpreter lore, the abandoned city, lunar perigee, and the star fragment to a density shift when Mira applies the fragment and hears the silence-as-signal. Closure is Conceptual Repricing—the city was never abandoned, only waiting—and the final image of waking towers reweights the premise with conceptual cost (transcendence into silence). Orientation anchors who/where/when early. One meaningful deepening occurs when the static resolves into "shard of hush" and the silence speaks. The cost is conceptual (the interpreters became the signal) rather than viscerally felt on Mira's body or choices, keeping this out of the high band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The suspended radio tower city over Corinth Gorge is vivid and specific, anchored early with "cables thick as ancient oaks" and "swaying imperceptibly." The transmission arrays "pointed at angles that made no geometric sense" and the gorge filling with light "that seemed to rise rather than fall" charge the final image. The moon pressing close and the serenely electric air constrain Mira's timing and atmospheric stakes. Spatial choreography (tower platform, seven arrays, the gorge below) remains clear. The micro-setting of tools and the receiver built from cathedral bells adds tactile specificity without slowing momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Mira seeks to capture "a shard of hush" to reawaken Vespera's signals. Pressure accumulates through the lunar perigee window, the serenely electric charge, and the tuning sequence. One meaningful tightening occurs when she presses the star fragment to the receiver and the noise falls away, forcing her to hear the silence-as-signal. The turn is driven by her choice to "discard every certainty," satisfying the Accumulative lens. Cost is conceptual (understanding transcendence) rather than a visible forfeiture; Mira does not lose, renounce, or visibly alter her own status, keeping escalation legible but not viscerally charged.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—beginnings and endings as the same point on an infinite circle—emerges from the abandoned city, Clara Vance's fame-and-forgetting, and the interpreters' transcendence into silence. The final image of Vespera "ending its long silence" / "just beginning" reweights the premise without a stated moral. Subtext operates in "the moon never lied, but it rarely spoke plainly" and the silence-as-signal insight. The shard of hush and the tuning action anchor theme in concrete particulars. No overt moralizing. The closing symmetry ("ending...beginning") risks being too tidy, but the conceptual repricing of the interpreters' fate keeps it from becoming mechanical.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and anchored in Mira's perceptual signature: "a compass that pointed to yesterday," "the memory of a sound, or the promise of one." Diction is controlled and consistent, with purposeful compression ("frequencies that bypassed her ears entirely"). Psychic distance modulates intentionally when the silence speaks. Register remains within the character's lexicon. The prose feels slightly over-decorated in high-pressure beats—"layer by layer, like veils dropping from a widow's face"—where simpler syntax might sharpen urgency. The brief dialogue ("We didn't leave...We went deeper" / "Show me") feels more symbolic than natural speech, and the laugh "a sound that felt foreign after so much listening" is apt but slightly told.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in most beats. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Minor scaffold appears: "The moon could lie after all. / The static was not random. / The silence was not empty" lists negations in sequence without syntactic variety. "Not a sound, exactly. / More like the memory of a sound, or the promise of one" is a functional hedge but still loops. Figurative density in the tuning sequence ("veils dropping from a widow's face," "serenely electric...like the eye of a storm that had forgotten how to rage") clusters without clear pattern-teaching, risking overwriting. No paraphrase loops touch closure. Propulsion is solid; the piece advances without stalling.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of celestial interpreter, abandoned city, Hollywood star fragment, and silence-as-signal is specific and non-obvious. The transcendence twist—interpreters becoming the signal—feels earned in hindsight by the "echoes could be retuned" setup and the star fragment's fame-and-forgetting logic. The suspended city and lunar perigee add fresh spatial and temporal constraints. The piece commits fully to its premise without retreat. Risk is present in the lyric compression and the quiet, conceptual closure. However, the "finding the beginning in every ending" frame and the circular final image risk being familiar philosophical territory; the story's freshness comes more from execution and setting detail than from a transformative angle on the transcendence concept.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira the celestial signal interpreter is introduced early, frames the tuning action across multiple beats (climbing, setting up equipment, tuning the array, pressing the fragment, waking the towers), and her decision to "discard assumptions" drives the key turn. Her choice to tune each dish one by one at dawn cements the closure. The role is irreplaceable; the story would collapse without her occupational expertise and agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The Hollywood star fragment appears early (first third), is used in the climactic beat (pressed against the receiver's core), and is pocketed at the end with "it had earned its rest." It appears in three distinct beats. The fragment's fame-and-forgetting property is necessary for capturing the shard of hush per the "old texts." However, its mechanics feel slightly ornamental; the story does not show us *why* brass and terrazzo matter, only that they do. The cost (two months' wages, a favor) is told rather than shown affecting Mira's present choices. The reprise at closure is affectionate but not causally charged.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"A shard of hush" is the dominant stake, named early, drives the tuning action, and is the object Mira seeks and achieves. The concept shapes her method (tuning for silence rather than noise) and redefines the climax: the silence is solid, a presence, and speaks. The final image of the city humming with "voices thought lost forever" directly pays off the shard. The concept is irreplaceable and structures the entire escalation. Closure participation is strong; the shard is what Mira captures and what the city becomes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Serenely electric" appears once as atmospheric description ("the air around her felt serenely electric, charged with potential...yet somehow calm") in the setup. It establishes tone and reflects the paradox of the silence-as-signal, but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with cost. It is not revisited at closure. The trait is apt and voice-consistent but functions more as texture than tactical pressure. It touches one beat (the tuning setup) but does not narrow options or recur with reweighted meaning.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Tuning is the core action: Mira tunes the primary array, applies the star fragment to the receiver, hears the silence, and then tunes each silent dish one by one to wake the city. It drives at least three beats (initial tuning, fragment application, dawn sequence) and defines the closure. The action is irreplaceable; swapping "tune" for another technical verb would break the celestial-interpreter logic. The method (discarding assumptions, listening for silence) is embedded in the tuning. The final image of the city humming hinges on this action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Discarding assumptions" is signaled early ("Mira forced herself to discard that assumption, along with every other certainty") and directly enables the key turn: she stops treating silence as emptiness and hears the signal. It shapes her interpretive method at the climax. The method is not sustained across multiple beats—it appears as a single pivot—but it is causal and irreplaceable for the breakthrough. It does not appear in the closure image itself, only its consequence (the waking towers). Two gates (setup, middle choice); strong causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The abandoned radio tower city suspended over Corinth Gorge is introduced early, frames every beat (climbing, platform view of seven arrays, the gorge below filling with light), and supplies the closure image: Vespera waking. The setting is irreplaceable; the story's logic and stakes depend on this exact location. The suspension over the gorge and the spatial layout (central tower, seven dishes) shape Mira's tactics (climbing, tuning each dish). The gorge's light "that seemed to rise rather than fall" charges the final image. The setting is essential across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Lunar perigee is signaled early ("Tonight marked lunar perigee, and the moon pressed so close"), frames the timing ("the moon retreating" at dawn), and creates atmospheric pressure. It does not tighten a tactical clock or force a trade-off; Mira completes her work before dawn with no visible cost from the time constraint. The timeframe is present in setup and closure but does not drive a middle choice. It is appropriate and coherent but more thematic (moon as witness) than tactically urgent. Two gates, moderate causal work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To find the beginning in every ending" is stated early as Mira's philosophy ("not just philosophy...it was survival") and her grandmother's teaching. The motivation drives her return to Vespera and is paid off in the final image: "Vespera was ending its long silence. Which meant...it was also just beginning." The desire is told rather than dramatized in conflicted choices; Mira does not face a moment where seeking beginnings costs her something concrete. It shapes three beats (return, insight, closure) and is irreplaceable for thematic coherence, but the friction between want and cost is conceptual rather than viscerally enacted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Fantasy practicality" is coherent throughout: Mira's tool belt with "instruments that had no names in any earthly language," the crystal tuning forks, the compass pointing to yesterday, and the receiver from cathedral bells mix the mystical with the technical. The tone modulates from the calm setup to the serenely electric charge to the climactic expansion of the hush, then breathes at the quiet ending. The tone charges the final image of the city humming at dawn. It is voice-consistent, present across all beats, and supports the closure's conceptual repricing without becoming whimsical or overly expository.</comment>
