<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is specific and embodied—following the lightness, chipping away carefully—with her motivation (finding deleted memories) driving concrete choices. The mother's condition and the journal discovery create real emotional weight. However, the final choice lacks visible internal conflict; Mira's decision to return and read aloud feels resolved rather than forecloses a path with on-page struggle. Minor: "breathed the salt air deep" edges toward generic closure gesture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure operates as Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image reweights the lanterns, harbor, and gravity as carriers of preserved memory rather than mere setting, with conceptual cost (her mother may never recognize these recovered moments). The causal chain is clean—whale beaches, gravity fluctuates, Mira follows coffee-ground divination to exhume the journal. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: layered imagery (salt, crystals, lanterns) accumulates meaning and the cadence shift at "And remembered" charges the ending. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph without penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The salt crystal chamber constrains Mira's search—she follows lightness, chips carefully at specific formations—and the space charges the closure by housing the literal preservation of memories. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "taste of ancient ocean and patience," crystals "climbing the walls in geometric cathedrals." The lanterns bookend the piece, shifting from routine labor to "small defiance against forgetting." Spatial choreography (docks → chamber → return) remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding where deleted memories go) is signaled early and tightens when Mira descends into the chamber, follows gravitational lightness, and discovers the journal. The discovery itself is a meaningful deepening that reweights her understanding—memories become dense, sinkable objects rather than lost abstractions. However, escalation reads as revelation rather than a choice under pressure; Mira encounters no live obstacle or trade-off in the chamber. The cost (speaking to a mother who may never recognize) is felt but deferred beyond the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (nothing truly disappears; memory has weight and finds preservation) emerges organically from concrete particulars—the whale, gravity pockets, salt crystals—without thesis statements. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: the harbor "held its gleaming silence. / And remembered," reweighting all prior lantern-lighting as acts of preservation. Wildflowers and coffee grounds accrue symbolic weight through use rather than decoration. The phrase "each flame a small defiance against forgetting" risks proximity to abstraction but is grounded in Mira's thirty-year labor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Mira notices gravity shifts, crystal geometries, and the exact placement of pressed flowers. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tighter in the chamber, wider in the framing harbor walks. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("gleaming silence," "chambers beneath the lighthouse"). Minor slip: "gravity itself seemed to fluctuate mysteriously" and later "gravity fluctuated mysteriously" echo the prompt's "Attribute: fluctuates mysteriously" nearly verbatim, reading slightly imposed rather than organically filtered through Mira's perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with strong rhythm and purposeful compression. Information density is high: sentences layer character history, world rules, and present action efficiently. However, "fluctuates mysteriously" appears three times with minimal variation, and "gleaming silence" recurs as both descriptor and closure beat without reweighting between uses—reads as motif planted for harvest rather than evolving. The phrase "carried the weight of everything the world had tried to forget" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward abstraction where a concrete image would sharpen. No major loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of whale-beaching folklore, gravitational anomaly as metaphor for memory's weight, and salt-crystal preservation offers a coherent non-obvious premise. The divination-via-coffee-grounds and literal exhumation of a journal transform familiar "lost memory" tropes into specific, embodied ritual. However, the core emotional arc (daughter recovers mother's lost memories) follows a well-worn template, and the whales-carry-memories motif echoes existing maritime folklore without sharp deviation. Execution is competent but the final image does not surprise in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mira is established early (first paragraph) as the lantern lighter with thirty years of history. She makes the key choice to descend, follow lightness, exhume the journal, and commits to returning. Her occupation frames the opening and closing, with lanterns reweighted as preservation rather than routine. However, her decision to read aloud to her mother is declared rather than dramatized as a turn with visible cost in the moment. Two gates solid (setup, closure reprise); middle development is observation-driven.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Wildflowers anchor the mother's memory practice in the opening, reappear preserved in the exhumed journal, and inform Mira's closing vow to "press each recovered wildflower between the pages of the present." The object is handled across three beats and its meaning evolves from past ritual to recovered artifact to future action. Strong causal linkage and closure presence. Specificity is high—leather journal, pressed flowers, exact memories—though the flowers themselves remain somewhat generic ("wildflowers" without species).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Gravity pockets shape Mira's search tactic: she follows lightness to find the hollow space in the crystal wall. The concept is integrated thematically (memory has weight, sinks through reality) and drives the story's premise. Present in setup, middle navigation, and implicit in the ending's "invisible currents." However, the mechanics remain abstract—how exactly gravity marks memory locations is asserted rather than demonstrated with visible cost. The concept enables the plot but could be swapped for another metaphysical trace (e.g., temperature, light) with moderate edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Fluctuates mysteriously" is stated three times but functions primarily as atmosphere; it does not constrain or enable a specific choice with cost. Mira follows lightness versus heaviness, which is tactically useful, but the mystery itself (why it fluctuates) remains unexplored and does not create friction. The attribute is present throughout but reads more as setting flavor than a trait that generates visible trade-offs. Setup and closure participation weak; middle use is functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Exhumation is the story's hinge: Mira chips away the crystal cavity to retrieve the journal, and this discovery redefines her understanding of where memories go. The act is prepared by the coffee-ground divination, executed on the page with embodied detail ("chipped away carefully, her hands steady"), and directly enables the closure vow. The story cannot reach its ending without this exact action. Strong presence across all three gates and high irreplaceability. Cost is implied (labor, revelation) but not deeply felt in the moment.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Coffee-ground reading is signaled early as "her method" and generates the directive "Exhume," which guides the descent. The ritual is specific (tin cup, morning dregs, ceramic plate, shapes against white) and taught as Mira's inherited practice. However, the mechanics remain gestural—how grounds reveal "paths that eyes alone could not follow" is asserted rather than demonstrated. The method enables one key turn but could be swapped for another divination form (e.g., tide patterns, crystal formations) without major restructuring. Setup and middle use present; closure participation indirect.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The chamber is introduced at the one-third mark and becomes the story's spatial crucible: Mira's movement is guided by gravitational variation, and the old crystal formations house the hollow that preserves the journal. The setting supplies the logic for memory preservation (salt, pressure, patience) and alters her search tactics. Embodied and specific: "crystals climbing the walls in geometric cathedrals," "worn ceramic plate," "chipped away carefully." Present in middle escalation and implicit in the ending's "chambers like this one." Minor: late entry reduces setup credit.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The whale's beaching is the inciting event that multiplies gravity pockets and marks the intersection point beneath the lighthouse. It frames the story's present and provides the conceptual trigger. However, "after" functions as backstory anchor rather than live ticking clock; Mira's choices are not time-pressured, and the whale itself remains off-page throughout the core action. Present in setup and thematic closure ("the whale had known") but does not tighten decisions in the middle. Functional but replaceable with another maritime event.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mira's desire to find where deleted memories go is stated early, rooted in her mother's condition, and drives every beat: years of searching, descent into the chamber, following lightness, exhuming the journal, vowing to return. The motivation is embodied in action and carries emotional cost (her mother may never recognize). However, internal conflict is minimal—Mira's commitment never wavers on the page. Strong setup, middle pursuit, and closure participation; friction between want and obstacle is light.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Gleaming silence" recurs four times, modulating from the crystal chamber's literal glow to the harbor's final resonance. The tone is coherent and purposeful, supporting the story's meditative, elegiac register without flattening under pressure. The phrase charges the ending by reweighting silence as active preservation rather than absence. However, the repetition reads slightly mechanical—planted early for lyric harvest—and the exact phrase "fluctuated mysteriously" appears unchanged across beats, reducing tonal modulation. Setup, middle echo, and closure reprise all present.</comment>
