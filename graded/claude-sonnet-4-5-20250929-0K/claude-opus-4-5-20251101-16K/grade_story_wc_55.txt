<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is coherent and her interior journey is specific: seventeen years of avoidance, a buried composition, and the pivot from "what use was sound" to composing in touch. The weeping and physical engagement with the crystals embody contradictory impulses—grief and discovery acting simultaneously. The final choice (to write music between the hours) feels earned by the on-page experience. Minor deduction: the backstory occupies a substantial block without always tilting present micro-choices in the opening third, though it does anchor the closure transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the rain activates the crystals, Mira's arrival reweights seventeen years of avoidance, and the final image reconfigures her dream from sound to touch—a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (RR) with cost (the original dream remains dead; only its form changes). Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph. The deepening is meaningful: she moves from spectator to participant to composer-in-touch, and the cost is felt (petrichor nostalgia, weeping, acknowledging failure). One small slip: the mechanics of how crystal vibration becomes tactile music could be sharper to fully anchor the transformation's plausibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The glacier, monastery architecture, crystal forecourt, and rain-soaked quartz are vivid and purposeful. The wet crystals constrain Mira's steps ("excruciatingly gentle") and charge the closure image (pattern through touch replaces sound). Sensory hierarchy is strong: she sees vibrations, feels pulse and rhythm through her palms. Minor gap: the transition from narrow window to forecourt entrance lacks a spatial anchor (distance, interior path), briefly floating the reader before the courtyard grounds her.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—making peace with the abandoned dream—is signaled early and tightens when Mira kneels at the spiral's center. The reversal (from bearing failure's weight to discovering a new musical language) is earned by her agency: she presses palms, traces water, begins to compose. Cost is visible: the old dream does not resurrect; she weeps for what is lost even as transformation begins. The piece does not require multiple reversals at this length, but the turn could be slightly sharper—her decision to "compose again" arrives quickly after the pulse, compressing the struggle that would elevate stakes further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: sound lost, silence as presence, music reborn in touch and pattern. The crystals offer "architecture of music without its voice," a resonant non-literal answer to the central question (what use is a deaf composer?). Petrichor nostalgia—longing for what might have been—charges the final act without statement. The closing image (music written between the hours) reweights prior material: time-recording becomes co-extensive with creation. No thematic echo or sermonizing; the transformation feels specific to Mira's lived experience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with strong perceptual signature: "she could see them—tiny vibrations in the water droplets, trembling patterns that suggested speech, suggested music." Diction matches Mira's contemplative, injury-shaped register. Slight filter-verb density in the opening third ("had spent," "had dreamed," "had imagined," "had failed," "had come") accumulates without voice payoff, though it contextualizes rather than obscures. The closure beats are clean and immediate. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close at the kneeling, pulling back slightly for the final ledger anchor.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive. Strong lines: "dreams require voices," "silence was not an absence but a presence," "the abandoned dream waited for her at the forecourt's center." Minor scaffold: "the glacial hush that permeated these halls had become her second skin—cold, still, complete" restates "glacial hush" and "soundless" without added pressure. The opening paragraph's consecutive past-perfect constructions create slight syntactic monotony. No loops in the closure beat; the final two paragraphs carry high information density and rhythmic control.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—deaf composer discovers tactile music through crystal vibrations after rain—offers a specific, non-obvious synthesis. The transformation of sound into touch architecture is more fresh than the monastery-as-refuge frame, which leans template. Petrichor nostalgia and "Forecourt of Remembered Voices" add texture, though "whispering crystals" nods toward familiar mystical-object territory. The piece commits fully to its logic and follows through without hedging. The risk (accumulative rather than confrontational escalation) works, but the emotional arc's median choices (weeping, kneeling, rising with renewed purpose) trend safe within the chosen frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira is signaled early (clock scribe, seventeen years at the monastery, deaf at sixteen). She makes two key decisions: to enter the forecourt (overcoming avoidance) and to begin composing again in a new form. These choices drive the turn and closure. The second decision could be more conflicted on the page—she moves quickly from weeping to tracing to composing without visible hesitation or cost in the moment of choice itself.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt appears in setup (paragraph four), is used physically in the middle beat (Mira steps, kneels, presses palms, traces water), and charges the closure (the crystals' tactile patterns enable her new composition method). It constrains her movement (excruciatingly gentle steps) and provides the means for transformation. The specificity—quartz shards, water droplets, vibration patterns—makes it irreplaceable. Strong integration across all three gates with clear causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Glacial hush is signaled early ("soundless sanctuary," "glacial hush … her second skin") and shapes the monastery's culture (time in written numerals, silence as presence). It pressures Mira's choice by making sound-based composition impossible and frames the final transformation (music for a soundless world). The hush remains unbroken at closure, underscoring that her solution accepts rather than overcomes it. It constrains tactics and charges the ending image, though it operates more as atmospheric pressure than an object Mira must handle or resist in a discrete beat.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Excruciatingly gentle" appears twice on the page: in her footsteps across wet crystals and in her hand movements while tracing water. Both instances constrain action—she avoids disturbing what she cannot perceive—and embody her reverence and fear. The attribute does not create a visible tradeoff (she never fails to be gentle or pays a cost for the gentleness itself), but it characterizes her approach and charges the tactile discovery. Present in setup (implied by her scribe role) and middle, less visible at closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Bear" is signaled in the action statement ("bear the weight of her failure one final time") and dramatized when Mira kneels and weeps. The forecourt visit is framed as bearing witness to the abandoned dream. The verb turns at closure: she no longer bears failure but carries forward a transformed dream. The action is essential to the emotional arc and motivates the trip to the forecourt. Strong thematic and causal integration, though the physical act of bearing is brief and mostly metaphorical rather than a sustained on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>N/A</grade><comment>Required element is "None."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The soundless sanctuary is established early (monastery perched on glacier, silence as presence, no rustle or whisper) and pressures the central conflict: Mira's deafness fits here, isolating her from a world of sound. The forecourt within the sanctuary provides the spatial resource (crystals, water, vibration) that enables the climactic discovery. The setting recurs in the final beat (ledgers waiting, music between the hours) and charges the closure by making her new composition possible only in this specific environment. Strong causal role and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Hidden sunrise" is present in setup ("hush of a hidden sunrise") and actively shapes the middle beat: sunrise paints the wet crystals, making vibrations visible, and the scene closes when "the sunrise finished its hidden emergence" and water evaporates. The timeframe tightens the window for Mira's discovery (rain-activated crystals are temporary). However, there is no moment where the approaching evaporation forces a faster decision or alters her tactics on the page—it marks duration rather than imposing deadline pressure. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation—to make peace with the abandoned dream—is signaled early (the dream "waited for her at the forecourt's center," she "had come here to bear the weight of her failure one final time") and drives every beat: avoidance for seventeen years, the decision to enter, kneeling at the spiral, weeping, and the pivot to composing in a new form. The friction between wanting closure on the old dream and discovering a new path is dramatized with visible cost (tears, acknowledgment that the composer's dream "would never resurrect"). The motivation shapes the arc and is resolved with a clear transformation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Petrichor nostalgia—longing for rain on old stone, ache for what might have been—is introduced explicitly in the middle beat and charges the weeping moment. The tone (wistful, elegiac, tactile) is coherent and modulates from stillness to emotional peak to quiet resolution. The rain imagery (first in three years) embodies the tone, and the scent/memory association is purposeful. It does not appear in the final paragraph's ledger image, slightly weakening its closure charge, but the overall atmosphere supports the emotional arc without static repetition.</comment>
