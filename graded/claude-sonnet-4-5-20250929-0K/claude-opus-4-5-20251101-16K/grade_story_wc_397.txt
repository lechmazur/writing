<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and contradictory—"violently alive that her skin hurts" versus "certain she is already dead"—and embodied throughout. Her motivation to seek ending shifts through volunteering micro-choices (sorting donations, learning from Kristof) that tilt her stance without explicit epiphany. The final ambivalence ("does not know what she will say") earns the renunciation-as-pause through prior pressure. Minor slip: "grips reality loosely" recurs as a label without always showing the perceptual distortion it claims.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the call to the clinic is pending, the aurora and parasol tip reconfigure her stance from "tourist of ending" to patient listener, and the cost is visible in the forfeited certainty she came to find. Lens is Accumulative/Textural, held cleanly; the cadence shift from arrival-as-ending-seeker to present-as-listener reweights the dominant stake. Orientation anchors by ~100 words (marina, three weeks, intake consultation). One minor strain: "tomorrow she will call" defers the decisive act slightly, though the stance crystallization is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is visceral and recurring: ice groans against pylons, wind carries solace, aurora ripples like lace. The parasol tip constrains Maren's choice architecture (connection to lineage versus forward motion) and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("wind carries something she almost recognizes"). Spatial choreography is clear across dock, relief station, and implied clinic. Does not quite reach 8.5+ because the clinic itself remains abstract (no tactile detail of the intake room or journey south).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: whether to proceed with the appointment. The tightening occurs through volunteering—each encounter (Kristof's net-mending, the child's mitten) narrows her certainty about endings and forecloses the "tourist of ending" path. The final beat reconfigures the choice with visible cost: she loses the script she came with. Escalation is driven by protagonist attention and micro-renunciations (staying at the marina, touching the ferrule) rather than external antagonist. One micro-turn (waking changed) sets up the shift; no second reversal needed at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—patience, continuation despite endings—emerges from particulars: ice that moves "slow, then fast, then not at all," the mitten without its partner, the parasol tip as lineage proof. The final image (aurora like lace, "stopped running toward or away") reweights the premise without stating a moral. Subtext operates in Kristof's teaching and Maren's silence about her decision. The piece resists tidy closure while landing resonance. No thematic echo or prompt-language intrusion in the ending paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close in the final paragraph, slightly distant in exposition). Perceptual signature is consistent: Maren notices weight, texture, cold, sound—filtered through her preoccupation with endings. Diction matches her educated, introspective voice. Kristof's single line of dialogue feels natural and advances the ice-as-patience motif. Minor slip: "She thought death would have a particular frequency" edges toward expository interiority, though it anchors her motivation. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high—most lines do double duty (e.g., parasol tip establishes lineage and present anchor). Opening and closing images are strong. However, "grips reality loosely" and "fold in patience" recur as thematic labels without fresh syntactic variation, creating minor conceptual loops. "She grips reality loosely because reality keeps shifting" is near-paraphrase. One stock metaphor: "aurora ripples like lace" is lovely but predictable given the parasol motif. Proximity to template phrasing ("she does not know what she will say") slightly lowers propulsion at closure. No grammar errors, no simultaneity slips.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of euthanasia tourism, Arctic setting, and disaster-relief volunteering is fresh and non-obvious; the parasol tip as continuity-object is specific. The "sound of approaching endings" frame offers a novel angle on suicidal ideation. However, the arc—volunteer work teaching someone to choose life—is a recognizable template; transformation is partial. The "woke changed" beat arrives unexplained, adding a touch of risk, but the final stance (patient listening, undecided call) hedges slightly rather than committing to a bold choice. Emotional specificity (ice language, windborne solace) elevates without full ingenuity at closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Euthanasia tourist frames the story and drives the dominant stake (whether to proceed with the appointment). Present in setup (intake consultation), middle (volunteering shifts her stance), and ending (pending call). Her choices—to volunteer, to listen to Kristof, to touch the ferrule—alter tactics. Cost is visible: she loses the certainty she came for. Does not reach ≥7.0 because the "tourist" label is told more than dramatized; we do not see her research, travel decisions, or intake dialogue in scene.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Parasol tip appears in three beats: pocket touch mid-story, held as question, pressed against thigh at closure. It constrains choice (lineage as anchor versus forward motion) and charges the final image (connection across generations as she watches aurora "like lace"). Specific irreplaceable detail (tatted threads, grandmother through two wars). Reaches 7+ through setup, development, and closure linkage with causal pressure. Does not reach 8.5+ because the tip's role is symbolic rather than enabling a physical tactic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"A fold in patience" is named once and illustrated through Kristof's ice metaphor ("slow, then fast, then not at all") and Maren's "pause where the ice stops moving." It reweights the stake at closure (endings as pauses, not finalities) but does not constrain a discrete on-page choice. Present in setup (implicitly via "patience folds upon itself"), absent in middle pressure, returns in ending reflection. Lyric resonance qualifies for mid-band, but the concept remains thematic echo rather than tactical driver.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Grips reality loosely" is named twice and illustrated with "some mornings certain she is already dead, other mornings violently alive." It colors her perception but does not demonstrably enable or constrain a choice with visible cost. Present in setup and ending but absent as a felt constraint in the middle beats (volunteering, net-mending). Mostly label-only; the perceptual distortion it promises is told more than shown. Swappable with "uncertain" or "disoriented."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Trawl" appears twice: sorting supplies, finding the mitten. The mitten beat delivers the insight ("endings not always final") that shifts her stance toward the pending call. Present in setup (relief station work), middle (box sorting), and ending (the mitten insight directly informs closure). Reaches 6+ through setup-to-payoff linkage and causal pressure on the dominant stake. Does not reach 7+ because "trawl" itself is generic—"sort" or "search" would function identically; the mechanics of trawling do not matter.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Disaster relief volunteering is signaled early (relief station, sorting supplies) and recurs in the middle (Kristof encounter, net-mending). It enables the key shift: encountering survivors who "wake each morning to sort through wreckage" reweights her motivation. Present in setup, drives middle encounter, implicit in ending reflection on "patience" learned from the work. Mechanics are light (box sorting, net repair) but sufficient. Reaches 6+ through setup, middle development, and closure participation (the stance she crystallizes is learned through this work).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina is established early and recurs throughout: ice groans, pylons, frozen dock, twilight aurora. It supplies the "sound of approaching endings" Maren seeks and the patience lesson via ice movement. Setting pressures her choice (cold, isolation, proximity to survivors) and charges the final image (aurora, wind). Present in setup, middle beats (Kristof on dock), and ending (standing on dock at twilight). Reaches 7+ through multi-beat involvement, causal pressure (the setting teaches her to listen differently), and closure linkage. Does not reach 8.5+ because the marina could be swapped for another remote, cold relief site with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After waking changed" anchors the inciting shift (morning after intake) and frames the three-week present. The pending appointment (next month) creates a loose clock. However, the timeframe does not tighten tactics—Maren's volunteering unfolds at an untracked pace, and "tomorrow she will call" is the first concrete deadline. Present in setup, absent as pressure in middle beats, returns at ending. Functional but does not constrain choices; the "changed" state is more important than the time since waking.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Motivation to learn the sound of approaching endings is signaled early ("she came as tourist of ending," "wanted to learn the sound") and drives every beat: volunteering to hear survivors, listening to ice, touching the ferrule. It is dramatized through her attention and micro-choices, not just told. The ending reweights it ("the sound is quieter, and kinder") with visible cost (she loses the script). Present in setup, develops through middle encounters, and is repriced at closure. Reaches 7+ through multi-beat causal pressure and closure transformation. Does not reach 8.5+ because the friction (wanting endings versus finding continuation) is resolved through reflection more than hard choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Windborne solace" is named once and illustrated through "wind carries something she almost recognizes" and the final aurora watch. Tone is coherent—quiet, contemplative, cold-as-comfort—and modulates with pressure (from arrival certainty to ending ambiguity). It charges the final image (wind, aurora, patience). Present implicitly in setup (marina atmosphere), named mid-story, returns at closure. Reaches 6+ through tonal consistency and closure linkage. Does not reach 7+ because the tone is atmospheric rather than a constraint; it colors but does not drive tactics.</comment>
