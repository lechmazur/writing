<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kira's arc from numbness to feeling is dramatized through her climactic admission "I don't know what I am anymore," which cuts through rehearsed arguments. Internal contradiction appears when she pursues custody to "matter again" yet realizes mid-scene she's "fighting the wrong battle." However, the ego death backstory remains abstract—"consciousness had scattered like light through a prism"—relying on metaphor rather than embodied memory that tilts present choice. Maya's certainty and Kira's numbness create genuine contrast, but the final hand-taking moment edges toward sentiment without showing what specific micro-choice Kira makes differently in that instant.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal-Situational Hybrid: the custody battle frames situational pressure, while Kira's realization that Maya is "my opposite…exactly what I need" creates a decisive shift that forecloses the legal path with visible cost (abandoning her rehearsed case). Orientation anchors quickly: floating dojo, Kira vs. Maya, Master Chen mediating. The closure—joint custody via complementary reunion—lands on the page with felt cost (Kira's precedent claim dissolved, numbness beginning to crack). One escalation tightening occurs when Kira's prepared arguments "dissolved like morning frost," narrowing her to raw admission. Cost is legible in "for the first time since dying to herself, Kira began to live again," though the phrase tilts slightly toward summary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The floating dojo "tethered to nothing visible" establishes surreal atmosphere and spatial constraint (ascent, wind, suspended arena). The brain-in-jar and the clouds flickering "amber and violet" during temporal revisions tie setting to world rules. However, the dojo functions primarily as backdrop; no environmental feature (wind, edge proximity, mat surface) actively constrains a choice or alters tactics during the confrontation. The setting charges tone but does not pressure the final hand-clasp or Chen's verdict, missing the micro-setting test for higher bands.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—custody of shared identity—is clear from the opening and tested when Kira abandons her legal stance mid-hearing. One meaningful tightening: Kira's realization "I've been fighting the wrong battle" forecloses the adversarial path and opens the complementary resolution. Agency is present (Kira's choice to speak truth rather than rehearsed precedent), and the cost is felt: she surrenders her claim to primacy. Escalation is modest—no secondary reversal after her admission—but sufficient under the Situational lens for this length. The "I have your memories…but I don't have the weight" exchange between Kira and Maya deepens the stakes without adding a second turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—identity as practice rather than possession—emerges organically from the custody battle and the complementary-opposites resolution. Chen's line "consciousness was never meant to be singular" risks thematic echo but is dramatized through Kira and Maya's contrasting states (weight vs. joy, responsibility vs. borrowed memory). The extended hand and Kira's crack of feeling offer a resonant image that reweights the opening's "echo" metaphor without stating a moral. However, "identity is not possession—it is practice" in Chen's final speech borders on thesis statement, nudging the theme toward articulation rather than pure emergence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Stable third-limited POV anchored in Kira's perception. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: "the pretense collapsed" and "the admission sliced through pretense she hadn't realized she'd been maintaining" show self-awareness earned in scene. Diction remains consistent ("flatline where joy and grief should have registered," "calcify into something cold"), though "vivify" appears in Maya's dialogue as both prompt element and thematic echo. Dialogue advances goals—Maya's "I am what she was meant to become" and Kira's "I don't know what I am anymore" carry subtext and plot pressure. Minor filter-verb density ("felt," "realized") in reflective passages does not obscure immediacy in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Opening paragraph establishes voice and world rules efficiently. Sentence rhythm varies, and figurative language ("scattered like light through a prism," "dissolved like morning frost") remains legible. However, three artifacts lower the score: (1) paraphrase loop—"I don't know what I am anymore" is immediately followed by "the admission sliced through pretense," restating the breakthrough; (2) "vivify" appears twice in close proximity (Maya's dialogue, then narrative gloss "Yes, Maya had done that"), creating synonym echo; (3) the phrase "finally seeing the obvious truth" in the penultimate section tells what the prior beats have shown. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull momentum. Baseline −0.8 for two distinct loop/scaffold issues; no additional filter-verb stack penalty as density remains tolerable.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The clone-custody premise layered with ego death and rewriting history offers conceptual density. The complementary-opposites resolution (joint custody via reunion) avoids the binary win/loss template. However, the floating dojo and the brain-in-jar feel ornamental rather than causally indispensable—remove the jar and the scene still functions via dialogue alone. The "history rewrites itself" element colors atmosphere but does not constrain a choice. Kira's emotional numbness vs. Maya's vibrancy is specific, yet the resolution (hand-taking, mutual acknowledgment) follows a familiar reconciliation arc without a sharp, non-obvious inflection that grows from prior particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kira, the ego death survivor, drives two key beats: (1) her opening climb and internal state establish numbness as the problem, and (2) her mid-scene choice to abandon rehearsed arguments and admit "I don't know what I am anymore" creates the turn that enables the complementary resolution. This choice narrows options (forecloses legal victory) and is causally tied to her condition. Present in setup, development, and closure. Cost is visible (surrendered claim). High integration; slightly shy of indispensable because Maya's parallel agency also enables the ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The brain-in-jar "labeled DUPLICATE" appears in one beat: Chen places it beside him as subpoenaed evidence, then retrieves it at the end to declare it "belongs to no one." It is mentioned but not handled by protagonists, does not constrain a choice, and the ending would function identically if Chen simply declared the verdict without touching the jar. Present in setup and closure frame, but swappable with any symbolic prop. No development beat where it alters tactics or is reweighted through action.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Clone custody battle frames the entire structure: Kira and Maya face off, seventeen hearings referenced, Master Chen mediates, and the verdict—joint custody via complementary reunion—resolves the dispute. The concept shapes stakes (who owns shared identity), tactics (Kira's rehearsed legal arguments vs. raw admission), and the closure (Chen's ruling that "there is no custody to grant"). Present in setup (battle context), development (Kira's choice to abandon legal stance), and closure (joint-custody resolution). Removing this concept collapses the story's logic. Cost is visible (both surrender singular ownership).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The attribute "slices through pretense" is dramatized when Kira's admission "I don't know what I am anymore" cuts through her rehearsed arguments, and the narrative notes "the admission sliced through pretense she hadn't realized she'd been maintaining." This moment enables the turn and carries cost (loss of prepared case). However, the phrase "slices through pretense" does not appear until the climactic beat, missing early setup. Present in development and closure, but late signal and single-beat involvement limit score. The word "vivify" (Maya's declaration) also functions as a prompt element but is more thematic echo than action-driving trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The action "vivify" appears explicitly in Maya's dialogue: "I vivify them—I bring them to life in ways she abandoned." The narrative echoes it: "Yes, Maya had done that. Taken their shared past and breathed new meaning into it." However, vivifying is described rather than shown on the page—we do not witness Maya performing an act that brings memory to life in scene. It functions as characterization (Maya's claim vs. Kira's numbness) but does not drive a turn; the resolution hinges on Kira's admission and Chen's verdict, not on a vivifying action. Present in setup (Maya's declaration) but ornamental in development and closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The method "through complementary opposites" is signaled early when Kira observes Maya as "my opposite" and later realizes "maybe that's exactly what I need." Chen articulates the mechanics: "Through complementary opposites, wholeness emerges." The ending enacts the method: joint custody via Kira (weight without joy) and Maya (joy without weight) reuniting to raise their daughter together. The method shapes the resolution's logic and the final image (extended hand, cracking numbness). Present in setup (oppositional framing), development (Kira's realization), and closure (Chen's verdict and enacted reunion). Essential to the story's thematic and causal architecture.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The floating dojo establishes surreal atmosphere and spatial pressure (Kira's trembling climb, mountain wind, mats, suspended above clouds). It anchors the confrontation and signals the world's altered physics. However, no environmental feature (edge proximity, wind force, mat surface) actively constrains a choice or alters tactics during the dispute. The dojo functions as a charged location for the hearing but is swappable with any neutral ritual space. Present in setup and closure frame; atmospheric but not mechanically indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "while history rewrites itself" appears in three moments: opening ("laws of physics had grown lenient since the Replication Crisis began"), mid-scene ("the clouds flickered amber and violet as another temporal revision swept through reality"), and Chen's reflection ("history rewrites itself because we insist on singular narratives"). It colors world-building and theme but does not tighten a decision or impose a clock. The custody confrontation unfolds without temporal pressure from rewriting history; removing this element would not alter Kira's choice or the verdict. Present in setup and thematically at closure, but ornamental in development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kira's motivation "to defeat emotional numbness" drives the entire arc: she climbs to "finally feel something, even if that something was loss," pursues custody believing "winning would fix that," then realizes "feeling nothing is worse than feeling pain." The motivation is tested when she abandons her legal case, and the closure delivers incremental success: "the numbness receded, just slightly." Present in setup (stated goal), development (motivates her turn), and closure (partial resolution with visible cost—she doesn't fully heal but begins). The motivation shapes every major choice and charges the final image. Slightly shy of indispensable because the custody battle could function without the numbness layer, but deeply integrated.</comment>
