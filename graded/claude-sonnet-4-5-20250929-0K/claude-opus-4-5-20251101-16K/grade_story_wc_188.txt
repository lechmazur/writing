<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is concrete and embodied throughout—grief transformed into action through fireworks, Sava's physical kerosene knot against her heart. Internal conflict operates clearly: the pull between hopelessness and Sava's directive to "make light anyway." The final choice to build rockets repeatedly feels earned by the mosaic's message and her processing of loss, though the turn from grief to defiant creation could face one more micro-obstacle to deepen the cost. Interiority remains specific ("Understanding had never been Mira's strength") and avoids therapy-speak labels.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis meets Charged Poise): Mira's repeated rocket-building is a stance crystallization with visible cost—using Sava's kerosene knot completes its purpose, burning the last physical link. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through sensory layering, chanting fragments, the mosaic discovery, culminating in the cadence shift of repeated launches that reweight the dominant stake (defying hopelessness). Orientation is clean by paragraph two (who, where, dusk/night). One meaningful tightening occurs when the mosaic message clarifies Sava's instruction and narrows Mira's options to this specific act of light-making. The cost is felt: she consumes the kerosene knot, foreclosing preservation of that relic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The blooming fortress functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges: wisteria-covered arrow slits and roses on siege towers embody the story's premise (war surrendered to life), the mosaic fountain provides the hidden message that changes Mira's understanding, and the starless night sky creates urgency for artificial light. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mira's craft vocabulary (strontium/barium/copper for color, kerosene scent). The fortress's transformation from defensive structure to bloom-filled ruin mirrors and amplifies Mira's internal arc. Spatial choreography remains clear across courtyard, fountain, and launch site.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—defying hopelessness through light-making—signals early and tightens through the mosaic discovery that reframes Sava's death as directive rather than loss. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds through sensory density (jasmine, dripping water, the match strike) and the pattern break when Mira moves from chanting formulas to chanting Sava's name. Agency is clear: she chooses to use the irreplaceable kerosene knot, forecloses preservation, and commits to repeated launches. The cost is visible (burning Sava's last tool) and the escalation is protagonist-driven. One credible tightening occurs when the mosaic narrows her options to this specific defiant act.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars without statement: the fortress that transforms siege towers into rose beds, the mosaic hidden in negative space, Sava's "serious playfulness" embedding hope in jokes. "Make light anyway" functions as discovered instruction rather than moral declaration, and Mira's final act—building rockets until dawn—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how to carry grief. The closing image (flowers catching sparks as witnesses, battles won through "stubborn, beautiful refusal") reweights all prior material without explaining. Subtext operates in the kerosene knot "still carrying the shape of Sava's hands," making loss tactile. The ending avoids sermon; Mira's smile as the spark takes hold is earned stance, not epiphany.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and close, filtering everything through Mira's fireworks-maker vocabulary (fuses, casings, tessera, chemical formulas). Perceptual signature is distinct: she processes the world through creation and chanting, "filter the world through ambient awareness." Psychic distance tightens appropriately at emotional peaks (the mosaic discovery, lighting the first rocket). Diction stays consistent—technical but not clinical, lyric without purple excess. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats. One small slip: "serious playfulness had been Sava's way" edges toward summary rather than showing the trait through recalled action, though the mosaic's hidden message demonstrates it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean with strong information density and varied rhythm: "The Blooming Fortress rose before her at dusk, its ancient walls softened by decades of neglect and nature's stubborn reclamation." Sentence structure varies purposefully, accelerating at the rocket launch and breathing during reflection. No paraphrase loops, minimal scaffold. Figurative language is controlled and coherent (wisteria as purple waterfalls, silence as weight to carry). Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line ("She struck another match and smiled as the spark took hold") recharges the fire motif with earned resonance. Minor: "tephra" is absent but "tessera" (mosaic tiles) demonstrates technical precision. Zero template cadence or synonym churn detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The premise—grief transformed through pyrotechnics in a fortress where war became garden—feels specific and earned rather than formulaic. The mosaic note twist avoids contrivance because it's anchored in Sava's established "serious playfulness" and the story seeds it early (the final instruction scrawled fever-damp). Emotional truth outweighs novelty: the ache of carrying a dead partner's tool, the impulse to make beauty as defiance. The synthesis of fireworks craft, hidden messages, and blooming ruins feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking is moderate but coherent: the accumulative structure and quiet ending (no confrontation, just repeated launches) trust the reader to feel the stakes. Transformation test passes: plot and arc depend on these exact details.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's role as wandering fireworks designer drives every key turn: her chemical knowledge enables the rockets, her trade justifies carrying the materials, her "creating" strength contrasts with Sava's "understanding." The climax—building and launching rockets—directly stems from her identity. Early signal (opening paragraph). Present in three beats: unpacking materials, lighting the first rocket, building the next. Causal pressure: her craft provides the means to answer the mosaic's directive. Closure linkage: the final action is rocket construction. Irreplaceable: swap "fireworks designer" for any other craft and the story's logic breaks. Minor: her wandering nature is stated but not tested on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The kerosene rag knot appears in three beats: introduced as carried "against her heart" with tactile history (paragraph 3), used to light the first rocket's fuse (paragraph 16), and implicitly consumed in repeated launches. Its mechanics matter: "Sava's tool finally completing its purpose." Causal pressure: provides the spark and symbolizes using up the last physical link to Sava, making the cost visible. Closure linkage: burning it forecloses preservation and charges the final image. Irreplaceable: no generic fire-starter could carry the same relational and thematic weight. Specificity: "still faintly redolent of kerosene, still carrying the shape of Sava's hands."</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The note in mosaic (paragraph 13) is the story's hinge: it reframes Sava's death from loss to instruction, narrows Mira's options to this specific act, and provides the thematic payload ("Make light anyway") discovered through action rather than told. Early signal via Sava's letter (paragraph 5). Development: finding it changes Mira's understanding and stance. Closure: the mosaic's message—hidden in negative space between dancers—becomes the enacted answer through repeated rocket launches. Causal pressure: without the mosaic, Mira has no clear directive. Cost connection: understanding it requires patience (matching Mira's growth). Irreplaceable mechanics: the message hidden in mosaic negative space embodies "serious playfulness."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Chanting appears in three beats: opening (counting, formulas, grandmother's songs), middle (ambient awareness replaces chanting as method), and ending (chanting Sava's name during launches). It provides characterization (how Mira processes grief, her fireworks vocabulary) and brackets the arc, shifting from formula recitation to relational invocation. However, it does not constrain a choice with visible cost—she can stop or start without consequence. Present and thematically coherent but functionally ornamental to plot turns. The shift to chanting Sava's name colors the ending but does not drive it; she'd launch rockets either way.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Filter" as action appears once (paragraph 10): "filter the world through ambient awareness" enables Mira to locate the fountain by following dripping water. Setup exists (Sava taught the technique). Development: it works in one beat to advance the search. But it does not shape the climax—finding the mosaic message and launching rockets would occur through alternate means (visual search, luck). Swappable with minor edits: "listen carefully" or "wait and observe" would function identically. No closure linkage. Modest causal role in one middle beat, but the ending does not depend on this exact method.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Ambient awareness as method (paragraph 10) is signaled, taught ("let her senses gather information rather than hunting"), and used: Mira stands motionless, hears the dripping pattern, follows it to the fountain. It enables one key discovery (the mosaic) but does not constrain later choices or return at closure. The technique reflects character (patience Mira must learn vs. her impulse to create) and provides thematic color (receptivity vs. action). However, it's functionally replaceable—visual search or luck could locate the mosaic. Present in two beats (taught, used once) but absent from the ending, where her fireworks-maker identity dominates.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The blooming fortress at dusk provides essential structure: the mosaic fountain (cannot exist elsewhere), the siege-tower-to-garden transformation (embodies theme), the courtyard as launch site, and the dusk-to-night transition that creates the starless sky. Early signal (paragraph 2). Development: wisteria and roses demonstrate war's surrender to life, priming Mira's arc. Closure: flowers catch falling sparks as witnesses, charging the final image. Causal pressure: the fortress's specific features (mosaic, open courtyard) enable the resolution. Irreplaceable: no generic ruin could provide the mosaic or thematic resonance. The setting does more work than any other element, constraining choices and charging meaning.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The starless night appears as present condition (paragraph 8) and directly motivates Mira's act: "When the rocket climbed and burst into cascading gold against that absolute darkness" gains meaning from the sky's emptiness—artificial light becomes necessary rather than ornamental. The hush and compressed intimacy create tonal pressure. However, time is not a ticking constraint that alters tactics beat-by-beat; Mira works "until dawn if necessary" but the pace is self-determined. Present in two beats (arrival, launch) and charges the final image (making light where universe provides none). The contrast (no stars / fireworks) is thematically load-bearing but does not tighten decisions within the window.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Defying hopelessness is dramatized through action: Mira arrives pulled by grief's "gravity" (paragraph 6), the mosaic reframes the pull as something to resist (paragraph 14), and the ending enacts defiance through repeated rocket-building. Friction exists: using Sava's knot costs the last physical link, and continuing "until dawn" requires sustained effort. The motivation shapes three beats (arrival state, mosaic discovery, launch sequence) and drives the closure. Cost is visible: burning irreplaceable material, exhausting herself. The want (create light) conflicts with the obstacle (hopelessness as weight, starless sky) and the price (consuming Sava's tool). Irreplaceable: swap "defy hopelessness" for another motive and the mosaic message loses meaning.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Serious playfulness is present throughout: Sava's "hiding profound truths inside jokes" (paragraph 14), the mosaic message tucked in negative space, Mira's laugh "caught between grief and recognition," and the final smile as she strikes a match. The tone modulates coherently—grief is real (fever-damp instructions, three years gone) but never maudlin, lightness never trivializes. At the climax, chanting Sava's name "like a prayer, like a defiance, like a note" blends reverence and rebellion. The tone charges the final image: Mira smiling while building rockets against absolute darkness enacts the directive without irony or sentimentality. Present in four beats, shapes the mosaic discovery turn, and saturates the ending's emotional texture.</comment>
