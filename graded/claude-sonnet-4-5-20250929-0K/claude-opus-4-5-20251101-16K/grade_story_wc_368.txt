<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Yuki's internal journey from "watchful by trade" to "watchful in a different way" shows character evolution, but motivations remain abstract—the magnetism phenomenon is told rather than tested on the page through difficult micro-choices. The morpho wing and Kenji's heart provide embodied contradiction (her chest "tightened—his chest, her chest, theirs"), yet the decisive shift at closure feels epiphanic rather than earned by prior contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The proprietor serves as oracle more than pressure source, and Yuki's final resolve ("she would begin to tell her own") remains a declaration without visible cost forecloses a live path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Conceptual Repricing at closure. Orientation anchors cleanly (Yuki, floating tea house, three months post-transplant). The wing-as-prism beat reweights Kenji's story-magnetism and Yuki's dye practice through a structural-color metaphor, delivering a resonant reconfiguration that shifts her stance from "fixing color permanently" to embracing motion and borrowed time. Cost is conceptual and felt (acceptance of impermanence, inheritance of silence) but not vividly dramatized as a trade-off that narrows options on the page—more realization than renunciation. The single meaningful deepening (light-trail moment) functions cleanly under the accumulative lens, though the causal chain from question to answer is reflective rather than choice-driven.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house—massive stone, ancient chains, mist curling between gaps—constrains the encounter spatially and charges the closure image (circular window, embedded crystal, light projections mapped across stone walls). The morpho wing's structural-color properties (scales bending light, no pigment) function as micro-setting that enables the illumination beat and directly shapes Yuki's final realization. Sensory hierarchy is strong: the valley mist, swaying ladder, amber tea, and iridescent blue all filter through Yuki's dye-master attention to how "color shifts with light." The tea house's defiance of gravity mirrors the theme of suspension and borrowed time, earning solid integration.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: understanding why stories magnetize to her (and to Kenji). The tea-house visit and wing-illumination beat provide one meaningful deepening—shifting her from passive reception to active inheritance—but pressure remains contemplative rather than agonistic. The proprietor's explanation ("he listened so deeply that others poured themselves in") resolves the magnetism question through exposition, not a choice that narrows options or forecloses a path with visible cost. Yuki's final commitment ("she would carry his stories forward, and finally—she would begin to tell her own") reads as vow rather than sacrifice; we don't see what she gives up or risks to make that turn real.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the morpho wing's structural color: beauty as motion, caution and allure intertwined, meaning created by light bending through fragile architecture rather than fixed pigment. The parallel to Yuki's borrowed heart and Kenji's unlived dreams is deft, and the final image—"some beauty existed only in motion, in the bending of light through fragile structures, in the borrowed time of hearts that kept beating in new chests"—reweights the premise without moralizing. The "iridescent caution" concept recurs with purpose. Minor slip: "quietly explosive" and "the almost-becoming" edge toward abstraction when they could be dramatized through a micro-choice that embodies the pressure others sense.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice is poised and image-driven, filtered through Yuki's dye-master lens ("Iridescent caution, she thought"). POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. Dialogue feels natural and indirect ("You're here to ask about Kenji"—not a question). The proprietor's speech carries distinct idiom ("quietly explosive… in presence") and subtext (she names what Yuki has not yet articulated). Minor slip: "His chest, her chest, theirs" reads slightly over-articulated for the emotional beat, a helpful clarification rather than embodied confusion. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority to wider reflection at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies cleanly; figurative language is controlled and coherent (mist as memory, moths against window, rivers/tributaries of radiance). Information density is high: the wing's structural color, the sun-trail method, and Kenji's silence all do multiple jobs. Two friction points: "When you're ready, use this to illuminate what you cannot see alone" reads as convenient dying-man poetry that primes the closure too neatly, and "recognition without memory / love without origin" pairs into poetic abstraction rather than concrete image. No loops or scaffolding artifacts; sentence openings vary. Propulsion is smooth but occasionally pauses for reflective exposition ("Some people become quietly explosive…") that could be compressed.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The donor-heart frame combined with structural color (light through microscopic scales, not pigment) offers a fresh synthesis that avoids transplant-identity clichés by grounding the magnetism in physics and craft. The floating tea house and sun-trail method feel specific rather than generic mysticism. Risk: the piece leans into lyric accumulation and resists overt conflict, which pays off in thematic coherence but sacrifices narrative surprise. The final turn—from fixing color to embracing motion—is earned in hindsight but arrives through realization rather than a choice with stakes. Transformation test: the core emotional arc (inheriting silence, learning to speak) could transplant to other frames, suggesting the synthesis is strong but not yet indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Yuki's dye-master observation shapes her perception (color shifts, structural vs. pigment) and primes the wing-illumination beat, but her watchfulness does not drive a key turn through decision. She receives explanation from the proprietor and then resolves to act ("she would create colors that shifted"), placing the trait in service of theme rather than conflict. Present across beats but more interpretive lens than causal lever.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The morpho wing appears in the opening third (gift from Kenji's family), is studied for weeks (bridging past and present), and is physically used in the tea-house beat to project light patterns that reveal Kenji's unlived dreams—three distinct beats. Its structural-color property (scales bending light) is irreplaceable: swapping for any other object would collapse the closure metaphor. The wing charges the final image ("returned to its simple, impossible blue") and Yuki's craft resolve. Strong causal role and closure linkage; only light friction is that the wing's use is instructed by Kenji's letter rather than discovered through Yuki's struggle.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Iridescent caution" is named early, tied to the wing's predator-warning beauty, and returns in Yuki's realization ("colors that shifted and warned and drew closer all at once"). It shapes her understanding of the magnetism and her final craft choice, functioning as thematic spine. However, it does not constrain an on-page choice or alter tactics under pressure—it remains interpretive rather than stake-altering. Lyric reprise with thematic weight but no causal friction.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Quietly explosive" is named by the proprietor to explain Kenji's magnetism ("not in violence—in presence… the almost-becoming") and implicitly transferred to Yuki. It deepens the mystery but does not enable or constrain an on-page action with cost. Label-only attribution without visible tradeoff or tactical consequence; functional for theme, replaceable for plot.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Illuminate" anchors Kenji's dying instruction, Yuki's study of the wing, and the tea-house climax where she holds the wing in the light beam to project Kenji's story. The action redefines her understanding and directly enables the closure metaphor (light through structure vs. fixed pigment). Swapping "illuminate" for "discover" or "reveal" would weaken the structural-color logic. Strong causal and closure linkage; only minor cap from the letter's convenient instruction rather than earned discovery.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Tracking sun trails" is introduced by the proprietor (Kenji's method), demonstrated via the circular window and embedded crystal, and enacted when Yuki lifts the wing into the beam. The method's mechanics (light angle, crystal, wing scales) matter and shape the revelation beat. Signaled early enough and integrated into closure, but the proprietor's explanation does front-load the method rather than letting Yuki puzzle it out, capping mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating rock tea house supplies the circular window, embedded crystal, and spatial constraint (ladder climb, suspension above valley) that make the sun-trail method possible. Its defiance of gravity ("massive stone hung suspended") mirrors theme and charges atmosphere. The setting enables the climax and contributes to closure resonance (light mapped across stone walls). Micro-setting (body on swaying ladder, hand pressed to chest) adds embodied pressure. Strong integration; only light friction is that the tea house functions more as stage than obstacle.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Three months after receiving the donor heart" frames the present and explains the magnetism Yuki now experiences, but elapsed time does not tighten decisions or create urgency on the page. The timeframe contextualizes rather than pressures; Yuki's tea-house visit could occur at any post-surgery interval without altering stakes. Functional setup, but the clock does not run or constrain choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Yuki's desire "to learn why some people magnetize stories" drives the tea-house visit and is answered through the proprietor's explanation and the wing-illumination beat. The motivation is clear and shapes the middle turn, but it is pursued through inquiry rather than conflicted choice—Yuki asks, listens, and then understands. No visible friction between wanting to know and the cost of knowing; the revelation arrives as gift rather than sacrifice. One key turn, moderate causal role, but low dramatized conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Valley-mist wonder" pervades: mist curling like memory, the floating tea house, light bending through scales into impossible blue. Tone modulates subtly from quiet unease (strangers speaking secrets, children staring) to lyric revelation (color projections as cartographer's dream, rivers of radiance) and settles into elegiac resolve. The tone charges the final image ("borrowed time of hearts that kept beating in new chests") without flattening into single-note mysticism. Coherent through turns and integral to closure effect.</comment>
