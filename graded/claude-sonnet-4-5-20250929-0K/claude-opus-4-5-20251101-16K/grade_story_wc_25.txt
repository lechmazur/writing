<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vera is drawn with precise, specific competence: folded maps, catalogued walks, acoustic knowledge. Her interior voice—"faith made people predictable"—is assured without smugness. The trait of identifying walks (Martinez recognized by "drag on the left heel") is embodied in action, not merely labeled. The ending forecloses a path with visible cost (she returns alone to the shadows while refolding maps), though the emotional price feels muted rather than wrenching.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with situational pressure (geomagnetic storm; deadline at midnight). Orientation anchors cleanly within ~100 words. The escalation follows because/therefore logic: Martinez briefs → coin clue → map consultation → acoustic search → whispered exchange → guided exit. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Vera returns to the maze, refolding maps, already planning routes—endurance that forecloses recognition with quiet cost legible in "barely heard" and "returned to the shadows." The storm-surge deadline tightens tactics but is resolved offstage; midnight never visibly arrives, softening urgency slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is vivid and functional: "stacked steel boxes breathed with the tides," corrugated acoustics guide the search, the aurora provides eerie light. Spatial choreography is clear (corridor seven, four-way crossing, stacked ridges). The key probe and whisper-through-gap are tactile micro-settings that constrain and enable Vera's method. The environment charges the final image: storm surge lapping at containers as she emerges. One minor note: the port city remains generic beyond "port city"; no idiom or locale signature beyond steel and salt.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: find Elena before midnight storm surge. The search tightens through clue accumulation (candy wrapper, hollow echo, voice response) and the whisper tactic narrows options (only Vera can execute it). Agency is clear: Vera's method and map-reading drive each turn. The midnight deadline creates urgency but is not enforced on-page—we exit before the surge truly threatens, softening the felt cost. One meaningful pressure arc (deeper into maze, acoustic gamble, successful contact) is sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: expertise without recognition, tools finding purpose, faith versus method. The zodiac coin motif ("Scorpios trust too much in fate... fate needs help") offers a coherent anchor without hammering the moral. The key-without-a-lock recurs purposefully, charged at the end with "still without a lock, still essential." The final image—Vera returning to shadows, refolding maps—resonates as earned renunciation. One slip: "whispers travel farther than shouts" is stated as thesis rather than left implicit, and the phrase "challenge the impossible" from Martinez feels prompt-adjacent. Still, the ending avoids sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>POV distance is stable and apt: close third with Vera's perceptual signature ("identified people's walks the way others recognized faces," "the labyrinth taught her early"). Diction is controlled and voice-specific: "calculated spontaneity," "accordion-pleated," "the labyrinth whispered its secrets." Dialogue is sparse, goal-driven, and carries subtext ("Your luck didn't leave you. It just called for backup"). No head-hopping or filter-verb clutter in peak beats. One note: the geomagnetic-storm setup leans slightly expository in tone (functional but tells more than shows), and "spontaneity that looked like instinct but was anything but" edge toward thesis articulation rather than dramatized perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies cleanly; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high: most lines do double duty (acoustic knowledge, map annotations, storm effects). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Figurative language is purposeful: "containers breathed with the tides," "sound... could slip through gaps and ride the corrugated surfaces." One deduction: minor scaffold in "She was already refolding her maps, penciling in the new gaps she'd discovered, the acoustic channels, the hiding spots"—the list itemizes rather than charging the image. The phrase "challenge the impossible" (Martinez) and "whispers travel farther than shouts" (thesis statement) edge toward stock phrasing, but do not pervade.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The container labyrinth during a geomagnetic storm is a fresh synthesis; the acoustic-whisper method and folded-map logic are specific and non-obvious. Vera's renunciation (returning to shadows, no recognition) avoids the heroic-rescue template. The zodiac-coin luck-versus-method angle transforms a familiar search-and-rescue frame. One friction: the key-without-a-lock, while poetic, feels slightly ornamental—its "probe" use is functional but the metaphor's payoff ("some tools didn't need obvious purposes") tilts toward assertion rather than inevitability. Risk-taking is present (quiet ending, competence without flaw-driven mistake) but not bold enough to warrant bonus adjustment.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Vera's occupation is signaled early ("worked the container labyrinth for eleven years"), drives every beat (map consultation, acoustic knowledge, key probe, whispered search), and is indispensable to closure (returns to maze, refolding maps). Her expertise shapes tactics and the final image. Causal pressure, beat involvement (setup, multiple middle beats, closure), and irreplaceability are all strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The zodiac coin appears in three beats: Martinez hands it over (setup), Vera uses it as conversational bait ("I found your coin. Scorpio, right?"), and she returns it at the exit ("held out the zodiac coin"). It enables one key turn (Elena's response) and carries thematic weight (luck versus method). However, the coin could be replaced with any personal token (photo, bracelet) with minor edits; its zodiac specificity does not constrain the search mechanics. Strong setup and middle use; functional but not fully indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Folded maps are signaled early ("accordion-pleated and annotated in pencil"), consulted at every junction ("unfolded... tracing pathways," "refolding along a different crease"), and return in the closing image ("already refolding her maps, penciling in the new gaps"). The maps constrain Vera's method (no GPS in the storm) and embody her expertise. They are irreplaceable to the story's logic and tone. Strong causal pressure, beat involvement, and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The walk-identification trait is used once on-page: Vera recognizes Martinez by footsteps ("a slight drag on the left heel, an overcompensation in the right stride"). It establishes her sensory expertise but does not recur or constrain a later choice. The trait is specific and voice-consistent but remains functional for one beat only. Setup present, no middle or closure development; replaceable with another observational skill.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Challenge" appears once in Martinez's brief ("challenge the impossible and find her before the storm surge hits"). It frames the task but is not dramatized as a distinct action Vera performs; instead, the search unfolds via map-reading, acoustic method, and whispered exchange. The word itself is Martinez's rhetoric rather than Vera's tactic. Present in setup; no middle beat or closure payoff. Functional but swappable with "attempt," "rescue," or similar phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The key is introduced mid-story ("ornate brass thing... found it years ago"), used as a probe to test gaps ("slipped it into the spaces... to test for hollow sounds"), and returns in the closing image ("pocketed the key again—still without a lock, still essential"). It enables one key beat (the hollow echo that leads to Elena) and carries thematic weight (tools without obvious purposes). However, a coin edge or any thin metal tool could perform the same function with minor edits. Good beat involvement and closure reprise; moderate causal pressure but high swappability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is signaled early ("stacked steel boxes"), pressures every choice (maze navigation, dead ends, acoustic channels, hiding spots, storm surge rising), and is indispensable to the story's logic and closure (Vera returns to the maze). The setting's properties—corrugated acoustics, ridges for climbing, shifting layout—constrain Vera's tactics and shape the final image. Strong causal pressure, beat involvement, and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The geomagnetic storm is introduced early (sky painted green/violet, radios and GPS fail), tightens urgency ("before the storm surge hits at midnight"), and the surge begins lapping at containers as they emerge. However, the midnight deadline is declared but not enforced on-page; we do not see the clock approach or the final minutes tick away. The storm provides atmospheric constraint (no GPS, shifting maze) but does not drive a visible time-pressure choice at closure. Setup and middle complication present; closure participation weak. Functional but could be replaced with fog or power outage with moderate edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The whisper-versus-shout principle is stated explicitly ("whispers travel farther than shouts") and dramatized once: Vera whispers into gaps and Elena responds from "impossible distances." It constrains her method and is thematically coherent (quiet expertise versus loud heroics). However, the motivation is told rather than conflicted; Vera does not struggle with the choice or pay a cost for using whispers. Present in one middle beat and closure rhetoric ("the labyrinth had whispered its secrets"); no setup friction or visible tradeoff. Functional but replaceable with any acoustic tactic.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Calculated spontaneity" is articulated in the final line ("planning tomorrow's routes with spontaneity that looked like instinct but was anything but") and embodied throughout: Vera's method appears improvisational ("appearing to wander while following an internal logic") yet relies on folded maps and catalogued knowledge. The tone modulates coherently from assured setup through focused search to quiet renunciation at closure. One friction: the phrase is stated as thesis in the final line rather than left implicit. Strong coherence and modulation; good closure charge but slightly over-articulated.</comment>
