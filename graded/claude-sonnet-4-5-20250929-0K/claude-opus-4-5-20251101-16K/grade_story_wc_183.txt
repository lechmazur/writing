<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivations are clear and sustained—seeking acknowledgment for her absorbed twin drives her through the ship's archives to the wall of names. Her final choice to paint "Sera" emerges from accumulative pressure rather than abrupt epiphany, and the three-day vigil reading names aloud carries embodied cost. The interiority leans toward abstract phrasing in places ("unkindled solace," "blissfully aberrant freedom") that dilutes specificity, and the grief-without-sorrow formulation in the final beats risks resolving complex emotion too tidily. Minor deductions for register drift in reflective passages, but the core choice-chain holds.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Mira works through narrative threads, each adding texture, until the wall of names reweights the dominant stake. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (painting "Sera" forecloses her prior solitary grief and reconfigures her identity as "carrier of multitudes"). The cost is legible—she remains on the drifting ship for three days, embodying the shift—and the fishing-boat rescue anchors the before/after. Orientation is swift (who, where, what by the opening paragraphs), and the single-scene window with brief epilogue fits scope. One meaningful deepening (finding the wall, naming the twin) satisfies the 600–800 word escalation standard under this lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The carnival ship, fog, and below-deck carousel machinery are vividly anchored and return at closure (the wall behind the carousel). Sensory details—rust, brine, clouded mirrors, deflated balloon animals—filter through Mira's grief-driven attention and supply the micro-setting that charges the final act. The emerald swatch card functions as a recurring object that constrains her search and reappears when she paints. Spatial choreography (prow → logbooks → belly → carousel machinery → wall) tracks cleanly. Minor gap: the fishing boat's arrival feels convenient rather than causally seeded, a small weakening of environmental pressure at the exit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—giving her twin an identity—is signaled early and drives each beat. Pressure tightens as Mira descends through the ship's archives and machinery, narrowing to the wall of names. The act of painting "Sera" is protagonist-driven agency with visible cost (three days on the drifting vessel, public emergence as "chimera twin discoverer"). The piece delivers one meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens; no reversal is required. The cost is legible on the page in her choice to stay and read names aloud, foreclosing her prior isolation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—acknowledgment and memory without grief—emerges through the wall of names, the emerald swatch, and Mira's final act of naming. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "unkindled solace finally catching flame" reweights prior material without moralizing. The concept of carrying multitudes and the metaphor of a garden made of paint rather than earth deepen specificity. Minor slip: "warmth that didn't burn but simply, gently, held" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward sentimental abstraction, though it stays within voice. The thematic echo of "blissfully aberrant freedom" and "freedom in a cage" lands purposefully.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and the narrative distance modulates appropriately (closer during the naming, wider for the epilogue). The prose carries a distinct, lyric texture in diction ("unkindled solace," "chimera twin discoverer") that fits the mythic-realist register. Minor penalty: some elevated phrasing ("blissfully aberrant," "halved world") feels writerly rather than character-organic, creating slight register drift in high-pressure beats. The final image—fog lifting as the boat departs—lands cleanly. No dialogue; the choice to address the absent twin without quotation marks works within the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Line-level craft is competent with purposeful rhythm in the opening and closing beats. Information density is high in the archive-search sequence. However, several passages exhibit mild scaffold and synonym churn: "freedom on a drifting vessel was freedom in a cage of fog" and "unkindled solace she'd carried—that cold, waiting comfort that had never caught fire—finally began to warm" are paraphrase loops. Template cadence appears in the list-like tour of the ship's holds (deflated balloon animals, mildewed teddy bears). The metaphor of "unkindled" to "catching flame" recurs across three beats without fresh variation, reducing propulsion. These artifacts lower momentum in the middle third; apply −0.8 in Q7 for paraphrase loops and template runs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—chimera twin discoverer seeking a wall of forgotten names on an abandoned carnival ship—synthesizes familiar grief-quest and found-family tropes into a specific, grounded combination. The emerald swatch card as clue and the paint-as-garden metaphor add freshness. The final image of staying to read names aloud feels earned and particular. However, the core emotional arc (seeking closure for a lost sibling, finding communal memory) follows a recognizable template without a sharp conceptual inversion. The "drifting freedom/trapped" paradox is thematically legible but not deeply interrogated. Solid synthesis with room for bolder risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira (chimera twin discoverer) frames the premise, pursues the archives, descends to the carousel, and makes the decisive choice to paint "Sera." Her discovery and naming drive all major beats and the closure. Early signal, middle development (chasing narrative threads), and payoff (painting the name, staying three days). Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; her choices narrow options and foreclose her prior solitary stance. Cost is visible: remaining on the ship, emerging as a changed person.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The emerald swatch card appears in the opening (in her pocket, with the inscription), returns when she studies it by lantern light, and is present when she paints. Early signal and closure linkage are solid. However, its middle development is thin—it functions as static talisman rather than enabling or constraining a mid-beat choice. The card's color (green for growth) charges the final image but does not alter tactics. Two touches, closure participation, but modest causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Unkindled solace" is named early, recurs in the climax ("finally began to warm"), and reappears in the penultimate paragraph ("catching flame"). The concept shapes the dominant stake (seeking comfort that has not yet ignited) and pays off when Mira's act of naming transforms cold waiting into warmth. Closure linkage is clear. However, the concept functions more as thematic refrain than on-page constraint; it does not alter her tactics or present a friction she must work around. Lyric reprise with thematic resonance but limited causal grip.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Blissfully aberrant" is labeled ("the ship offered her a blissfully aberrant freedom") and mentioned once in a reflective passage. It does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost; Mira's strangeness is asserted rather than dramatized through choice under pressure. The trait is ornamental, swappable with "unconventional" or "liberated" without structural loss. Present in setup, absent from middle and closure beats.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Recapture" drives the premise (she came to recapture knowledge of her twin) and the final act (painting "Sera" enacts recovery). Early signal and closure participation are strong. However, "recapture" as action is abstract; the physical work—descending, searching archives, painting—could be framed as "discover" or "honor" with minor edits. The action shapes the quest but does not impose unique friction or a visible cost distinct from the character's motivation. Functional integration with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Through narrative threads" is explicitly named ("She worked through narrative threads—logbooks, letters, programs") and governs her middle-beat investigation. The method supplies clues that lead to "the garden's below the carousel," enabling her descent. Early signal, middle development (reading and synthesizing clues), and payoff (the threads converge at the wall). The method constrains her approach (she cannot simply search randomly) and shapes her tactics. Strong integration across beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival ship in foggy bay frames every beat: the drifting state traps Mira, the fog isolates her, the carnival's history supplies the logbooks and wall of names, and the ship's lowest deck houses the carousel machinery and the wall. The setting pressures her descent (she can "go nowhere except deeper") and provides the micro-environment (paint cans, debris) that enables the final act. Early signal, middle constraint (spatial progression through decks), and closure (the wall behind the carousel). The fishing boat's arrival at the end feels slightly convenient but does not undercut prior integration. High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"As memories alter" appears in one reflective passage ("As memories alter, so does truth") but does not constrain Mira's tactics or create a live clock. Time is vague (seven years of drift, "months chasing," three days reading names) without pressure or tightening. The phrase gestures thematically toward instability but does not alter on-page choices or the closure effect. Late thematic mention, no middle development, no payoff. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the garden of forgotten names" is dramatized early (the emerald swatch inscription, months of archival chase) and drives every beat: decoding clues, descending through the ship, finding the wall, painting "Sera." The desire is conflicted (she constructs meaning from coincidence, questions her mother's intent) and tested by the isolation and difficulty of the search. Visible cost: remaining on the drifting ship, emerging changed. Strong causal pressure, early signal, middle friction, and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Trapped freedom" is named explicitly ("blissfully aberrant freedom" / "freedom on a drifting vessel was freedom in a cage") and modulates across beats: the ship offers liberation from social expectation, then confines her to descending into its belly, then releases her via the fishing boat. The tone charges the final image (fog lifting as she departs, the ship "waiting for the next soul"). Early signal, middle development (the paradox tightens as she descends), and closure participation. However, the tone is stated more than embodied in syntax and rhythm; the prose does not consistently trap or release the reader through cadence shifts. Solid thematic coherence with moderate tonal control.</comment>
