<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera's motivation is established early and embodied through concrete actions—winding chronometers, cataloging the capsule, embedding messages—but her internal contradiction remains abstract. The "borrowed-time" premise is told rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure; we learn she exists past natural termination but never see her struggle with a specific cost or limitation. The shift to message-embedding feels motivated by theme more than character need, and the final stance (witnessing rather than measuring) arrives as insight without visible renunciation or trade-off that forecloses a prior path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors are present early (emerald silo, Vera as keeper, "seven cycles"). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through the capsule discovery, message-embedding practice, and network formation, culminating in a Conceptual Repricing where Vera reframes her role from measurement to witnessing. The cost is conceptual—she accepts that her borrowed days are a letter still being written—and the final image reweights the premise with undeniable pressure. One weakness: the cremation fragment's arrival and Vera's response feel like parallel meditations rather than a causal chain that tightens options, keeping this shy of high-band closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The emerald silo is vividly rendered with "green-glass gleam" and "temporal residue," and it anchors every scene. The chronometers, workbench, and shelf are handled on the page, and the silo's "pooling" time reading charges the final image with significance. The prairie setting provides contrast but remains largely atmospheric. The cremation fragment as micro-object constrains Vera's reflection and recurs with reweighted meaning at closure, satisfying the 9+ gate. Minor slip: the "farmer unearthing" and "quarterly exchange networks" are mentioned without spatial grounding, creating brief white-room moments.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding time's texture—is signaled early and pursued through cataloging, message-embedding, and receiving responses. The capsule discovery provides one meaningful deepening (someone else preserved meaning across time), and the network formation adds a second layer. However, no on-page choice forces Vera to trade one value for another; the escalation reads as accumulation of insight rather than narrowing options. The "borrowed days" premise is declared but never tested with a visible cost (e.g., depleting temporal stores, a choice that shortens her existence). Pressure coheres but does not tighten into a trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the cremation fragment, message-embedding, and final witnessing stance: meaning persists through attention and care. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"time passed through me, and it felt like this"—without moralizing. Subtext operates in the urn's partial words and the "significance" reading from pooling time. One slip: "What she witnessed, she would preserve. What she preserved, someone would rediscover" feels like thematic echo in the final third, articulating the thesis rather than letting the image carry it. Still, the particulars (emerald light, chronometers, descriptions) ground the abstraction enough to avoid drift.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Vera notices temporal density, texture, and "significance" rather than conventional details. Diction remains consistent ("borrowed-time," "texture of time," "pooling like honey") and voice-motivated. The embedded item descriptions demonstrate voice control through subtext ("slowness teaches patience"). Minor slips: "the simple human need to say: I was here" in the final paragraph edges toward helpful-narrator summary, and "anticipated" as a repeated term (mysteries, network) feels slightly externalized rather than filtered through Vera's idiom under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally, sentences advance momentum, and figurative language ("pooling like honey," "green-glass gleam") is purposeful. Information density is high in the middle third (capsule contents, message method, network formation). Two artifacts lower the score: paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines ("What she witnessed, she would preserve. What she preserved, someone would rediscover. And what they rediscovered..."), and the final paragraph stacks three "what she [verb]" structures in sequence, creating template cadence. These patterns appear in the closure beat, triggering the −0.3 to −0.5 deduction and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise—timekeeper embedding philosophy in garage-sale descriptions—is fresh and specific, and the cremation fragment twist (time capsule delivering meaning to the right recipient) reframes the setup with earned irony. However, the core emotional arc (lonely expert finds connection through hidden messages) follows a recognizable template. The "borrowed-time" and "numbers change meaning" elements add texture but remain largely ornamental; removing them would not break the story's causal spine. Risk-taking is modest: the piece stays within a reflective, lyric register without testing Vera's stance through on-page friction or forcing a renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Vera is present throughout, cataloging the capsule, embedding messages, and reframing her role at closure. Setup and payoff gates are met. Her "borrowed-time" status is mentioned early and the instruments suggest "significance" in the final third, but the trait does not constrain a middle choice or force a visible trade-off. She decides to embed messages and accept her role as witness, but these feel like realizations rather than decisions that alter tactics under pressure. Development gate is weak: no moment where limited time forces her to choose one action over another.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The urn fragment appears in the capsule discovery, Vera examines it ("—loved her—"), places it on her shelf where it catches light, and it recurs in the final third as no longer "damaged or tragic." Three distinct beats with evolving meaning; setup, development, and payoff gates are all met. It enables the realization that the capsule succeeded despite cracking, which feeds her acceptance at closure. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Shy of 8.5+ because the fragment does not constrain a choice—it prompts reflection but Vera's message-embedding begins independently of it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The damaged capsule arrives early, its cracked seal creates "unpredictably aged or preserved" contents, and the final third reprises it ("meant to preserve a moment, and despite its cracks, it had succeeded"). Setup and payoff are clear, but the capsule does not constrain Vera's middle tactics; she catalogs it and reflects, but her message-embedding method is independent. The concept shapes theme more than on-page choices. Development gate is weak: the capsule does not alter her options or force a cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The child's drawing is "rendered suddenly timeless by exposure" to temporal radiation. This single mention in the capsule inventory demonstrates the attribute but does not recur or constrain any choice. Setup gate only; no development or payoff. The attribute could be removed or transferred to another object (the newspapers, the urn) without structural change. Ornamental use trends the score low despite thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vera rediscovers the urn fragment's story, which prompts her to begin embedding messages; she later rediscovers responses from others, forming a network; and the final paragraph frames all of keeping time as rediscovery. Three beats tied to this action, with setup and payoff clear. The action drives the turn from solitary cataloging to networked witnessing. Development is present but mild: the responses validate rather than complicate her method. Strong closure linkage ("what they rediscovered would become suddenly timeless") and causal pressure earn the score, though the action could be swapped for "interpreted" or "uncovered" with minimal edits, capping it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The method is introduced ("embedding messages in garage sale item descriptions") with two examples ("Vintage chronometer," "Brass temporal gauge"), and responses arrive embedded in descriptions sent her way. Setup and payoff gates are met; the method enables the network and shapes the closure theme. Development is weak: we do not see Vera struggle with the method's limits, risk exposure, or adjust tactics when responses arrive. The mechanics matter thematically but do not constrain a middle choice with cost. Swappable with "embedding messages in library book margins" or similar without breaking causality.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The emerald silo frames every scene, its "temporal residue" gives the green-glass gleam, and the "pooling" time reading in the final third signals significance. The silo's chronometers and workbench are handled on the page, and the "temporal stores" are mentioned as eventually depleting, creating a vague constraint. Setup and payoff are strong; development is present but mild—the silo provides atmosphere and tools but does not force Vera to choose one path over another (e.g., ration temporal stores, leave the silo). The setting charges the final image and is irreplaceable in tone, earning 7+ despite modest causal pressure in the middle.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Numbers changed their meaning" and "measurement became more poetry than precision" are established early, and "seven cycles—or what used to be called years" signals the timeframe. The altered numbers recur when Vera's instruments measure "density and texture" rather than seconds, and "after any shift in time or place" the timeframe remains consistent. Setup and thematic payoff are present, but the timeframe does not tighten a decision or create urgency. Vera's "borrowed days" continue without a visible countdown or choice shaped by running out of time. The timeframe is more atmospheric than tactical, trending mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vera's desire "to understand what time felt like" is signaled in paragraph four and pursued through cataloging, message-embedding, and the final witnessing stance. Setup and payoff gates are met. The motivation drives her to embed philosophy in descriptions and accept responses, creating a network. Development is present: the urn fragment's story deepens her understanding, prompting the shift from measurement to witnessing. Mild friction: the motivation is never tested against a competing want (e.g., efficiency, solitude), so the cost remains conceptual. Strong closure linkage ("it felt like this") and causal involvement across beats earn 7+.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tone of "anticipated mysteries" is established early ("not answers but connections") and sustained through the capsule discovery, message-embedding, and network formation. The tone modulates with pressure: the urn fragment shifts from "damaged or tragic" to a successful delivery, and the final image charges the anticipation ("threads between moments, between souls"). The tone is coherent through turns and integral to the accumulative design. Payoff is strong: the mysteries remain open yet resonant, and the anticipation reweights the premise without resolving into answers. Tone shapes the final image and could not be swapped for "melancholy reflection" or "quiet resignation" without breaking the thematic effect.</comment>
