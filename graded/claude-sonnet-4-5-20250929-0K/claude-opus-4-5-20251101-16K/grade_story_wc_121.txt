<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is highly abstract and concept-driven rather than embodied; "periodically eternal" remains largely label-speak without visceral tradeoffs shown in scene. The final choice—leaping upward—lacks grounded motivation traceable to contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Micro-choices (following younger self, kneeling beside fallen self) advance observation but not a hierarchy of competing values with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when adequately early; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with lyric patterning. Closure attempts a Conceptual Repricing (becoming "complete" beyond fractured iterations), but the cost remains asserted rather than dramatically legible—"complete" is told, not shown through a concrete forfeiture or reweighted image. The leap upward functions more as metaphor than causal consequence of prior beats, weakening the on-page proof of cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The glowing viaduct, rain, puddles, and fractured sky are vivid and recur with purpose; the viaduct's glow modulates (silver/amber/darkening) to mark timeline shifts. The setting constrains Mira's choices (gravity-defying stance, the abyss below) and charges the final leap image. Spatial choreography remains clear across shifts, though the viaduct's physical rules (why she defies gravity) are asserted rather than shown through world logic.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—conquering the labyrinth of self—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through procedurally generated paths and confrontations with past/future selves, but escalation relies on told realization ("understood now") rather than a choice that narrows options with visible cost. The leap at closure feels thematically inevitable but lacks a concrete tradeoff (what she loses by leaping) legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—self-integration through acceptance rather than conquest—emerges organically from recurring images (tablet, viaduct, drop/ripple) and the cycle structure. The final image (leaping upward, becoming "complete") offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Minor deduction: "The labyrinth of self wasn't meant to be conquered through victory or force" edges toward explicit articulation rather than pure dramatization, though it stops short of sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable; perceptual signature (suspension between drop/ripple, procedural rune shifts) is distinct and maintained. Diction remains consistent with a detached, philosophical narrator observing Mira's cycles. Minor register drift: "darkening brightness that preceded either revelation or oblivion" and "periodically eternal meant periodically mortal too" read slightly more authorial than character-bound, but the effect serves the lyric mode without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative language (elastic time, motes of light, eternity breathed) charges key beats without overwhelming them. Minor loop: "The tablet shifted again, runes scrambling into new configurations. A new path generated" and "The timeframe compressed further" are near-paraphrases that restate procedural generation without advancing cause/effect. Stock metaphor "mirror reflecting" appears twice (puddles, fractured timelines as mirrors) without transformation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of fractured timelines, procedural generation, and the labyrinth-of-self conceit is thoughtfully integrated and feels inevitable in hindsight. The "periodically eternal" frame and the drop/ripple suspension offer fresh angles. Risk-taking (upward leap, converging selves) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor deduction: the procedural-generation concept reads more as stated premise than lived-in world logic—runes "shift" and "generate" without mechanical cost or constraint visible on the page.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's choices (following younger self, kneeling beside fallen self, leaping upward) structure three beats and drive the closure. Setup is immediate; development involves observation and realization; the leap participates in closure. Swappability penalty: "gravity defier" functions more as atmospheric trait than a constraint that alters tactics—anyone could observe past selves and leap without this exact attribute.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The tablet appears in four beats: holding it at opening, watching runes shift (×2), finding it in dead fingers, and dissolving at closure. It enables timeline navigation and signals procedural generation, shaping each major turn. Cost linkage: dissolving the tablet is part of the leap's consequence. Minor swappability: any ancient relic could serve similar function with edits, but the rune-shifting mechanic is specific enough to matter.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Fractured timelines frame the premise, enable encounters with past/future selves, and explain the cycle structure. The concept shapes two middle beats (amber timeline with younger Mira, darker timeline with fallen Mira) and closure (converging pieces). Setup is immediate; closure hinges on convergence across timelines. Moderate swappability: "parallel realities" or "branching paths" could replace fractured timelines with minor wording changes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Periodically eternal" is stated early, returned to mid-piece ("periodically mortal too"), and referenced at closure ("finally became something else entirely—not immortal, not mortal"). It explains the cycle and licenses multiple self-encounters. Friction: the trait is told and summarized rather than shown with on-page cost—no scene demonstrates dying/returning with visible consequence that alters tactics. Label-only execution lowers score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Retrace" appears in the title and recurs across beats: Mira retraces through timelines, the tablet message says "keep retracing," and the final configuration offers "a way to retrace not just her steps, but her very essence." The action drives at least three beats and shapes closure. Moderate swappability: "revisit" or "navigate" could substitute with edits, though "retrace" carries connotations of precision and iteration that serve the procedural-generation frame.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Procedural generation" is named early ("runes shifted—they always did—rearranging through procedural generation") and returned to at closure ("through algorithms older than memory"). It explains why paths vary, but the mechanic remains abstract—no on-page moment shows cost, constraint, or tactical choice tied to procedural versus manual generation. Summary-only use and late-closure reprise without middle development lower score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The viaduct anchors all action, supplies the abyss that pressures Mira's stance, and provides the railing from which she leaps. Its glow modulates (silver/amber/extinguished) to mark timeline shifts. The setting participates in closure (leaping from the railing, viaduct standing empty). Minor friction: "glowing viaduct after rain" specifies post-storm state, but rain's role is atmospheric rather than causal—the glow and structure do the functional work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Between the drop and the ripple" is introduced early as the suspension moment when the tablet works, recurs at two middle transitions, and frames the final leap ("that infinite instant"). The timeframe tightens Mira's window for action and charges the closure image. Friction: the drop/ripple cycle is poetic rather than a live clock that alters tactics under pressure—Mira controls when to act, so urgency is conceptual rather than immediate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation to conquer the labyrinth of self is stated early ("That was why she kept returning") and drives the realization mid-piece ("meant to be conquered through acceptance"). Closure hinges on finding the path through herself. Friction: the desire is told and then resolved through epiphany ("Mira understood now") rather than dramatized through conflicting wants tested by on-page cost. Told-only trends lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Darkening brightness" is introduced mid-piece ("that strange quality of darkening brightness that preceded either revelation or oblivion") and modulates coherently: silver glow early, amber glow in past timeline, near-extinguished in future timeline, intensified at closure ("silver light threading through gathering shadows"). The tone charges the final image and supports the paradoxical convergence. Setup delay (not present in first third) and one-beat introduction lower ceiling slightly.</comment>
