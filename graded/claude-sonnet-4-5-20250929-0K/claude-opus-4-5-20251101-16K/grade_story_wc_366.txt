<question>1</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maren's characterization is strong: seventeen years of reticent observation, embodied through her hands knowing when to row toward the lighthouse. Her decision to continue the stone messages shows earned commitment with visible cost—choosing solitary vigil over closure. Interior contradiction appears in her claim of not asking questions while compulsively noticing everything. Minor deduction: Thorvald remains more observed than enacted, though his trembling hands and stone-arranging provide concrete texture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Maren commits to monthly returns, forecloses the path of leaving, with the cost visible in her solitary future vigil. The accumulative lens holds throughout—stone language, keeper history, and the final fractured rainbows build density that reweights the premise. Orientation anchors clearly by the opening paragraph (Maren, Gull Point Light, seventeen years of deliveries). One meaningful deepening occurs when she discovers Thorvald's body and chooses continuation over abandonment, narrowing her options with felt weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse setting constrains Maren's final choice—she cannot leave Thorvald's message unfinished, and the decommissioning makes her vigil solitary. The sea glass, Fresnel lens, and eastern ledge function as micro-settings that charge the closure: "one final luminous ache, a ghost-lamp burning bright." Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: salt-crusted glass, moon ghost-light, kelp-green sea glass. The lantern room's cold and the keeper's body position create spatial pressure that drives her stone-stacking decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (continuation of the anonymous letter chain vs. abandonment to decommissioning) is signaled early and tightens when Maren finds Thorvald dead. The escalation is driven by her agency: she builds the final message herself, then commits to monthly returns. Visible cost: she trades potential closure for perpetual solitary vigil, knowing "no keeper would come to read" it. The pressure operates through accumulation—decades of keeper messages, Thorvald's death, the lamp's final flicker—culminating in her decision to "stand watch" against "vast indifference."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through stone-language particulars: anonymous care across time, the need to be found in darkness, mattering despite futility. The sea glass becomes non-literal answer—Thorvald's attempt to say what the old language lacked, Maren's continuation of that reach. "Not the light itself, but the feeling of being found" articulates the thematic question without moralizing. The Fresnel lens's "thousand fractured rainbows" at dawn offers resonant closure that reweights all prior keeper vigils. No explicit thesis; complexity preserved in Maren's choice to continue a chain no one will read.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization remains stable and voice-distinct: "She was not the sort who asked questions" establishes reticent register that holds through "her hands always knew." Perceptual signature is selective and character-specific—she notices trembling hands and stone patterns, files observations "like sea charts." Diction stays within Maren's lexicon; elevated phrases ("luminescent ache," "ghost-lamp") read as intentional lyricism, not register drift. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during Thorvald's discovery, wider during historical reflection. No dialogue to judge; interior rhythm tightens under pressure without opacity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Line-level control is strong with purposeful rhythm variation and high information density. "The anonymous letter chain began, she later understood, decades before her time" compresses backstory efficiently while anchoring present stakes. Minimal loops; one near-paraphrase in paragraph 2 ("Keepers came and went... some driven mad... others simply swallowed") creates intentional accumulation rather than artifact. Figurative language is controlled: "hungry sea," "drowned men found new names," "ghost-lamp burning bright" all advance atmosphere and theme. No template cadence or filter-verb stacks. Final image propels without overwriting: "one final luminous ache" charges without explaining.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The premise (lighthouse keeper's anonymous stone messages across generations) transforms a familiar isolation-and-legacy trope through the specific stone grammar and Maren's vocational reticence. The sea glass addition—"a color the stones had never held"—provides fresh inflection. Risk-taking in quiet closure pays off: Maren's monthly vigil for unread messages feels earned rather than sentimental. Mild deduction: the "haunted lantern room" and keeper-succession frame edge toward template gothic-maritime territory, though specificity (Fresnel lens rainbows, kelp-green glass) elevates execution. The emotional truth of needing to matter despite futility anchors originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Maren (reticent supply skipper) drives two key turns: rowing to the lighthouse without summons, then deciding to continue the stone chain monthly. Her reticence constrains communication but enables observation ("filed these observations away like sea charts"), creating the lived expertise that makes her final commitment credible. Present in opening, middle choice (building Thorvald's message), and closure decision. Visible cost: she foreclosed leaving, accepting perpetual solitary vigil.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sea glass appears in three beats: clutched in Thorvald's fingers, held to window for light-filtering examination, and balanced atop the stone message. Each use advances understanding—from discovery to interpretation ("a color the stones had never held") to integration into the message. It enables Maren's realization that Thorvald sought to transcend the old language. Charges the closure by representing individual voice within anonymous system. Specific cost: warm in her pocket, it becomes her inheritance of unfinished expression.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Anonymous letter chain is the core concept that shapes all stakes: it frames Maren's discovery of the stone language, Thorvald's attempt to extend it with sea glass, and her decision to continue despite decommissioning. Present in paragraph two's exposition, drives the climactic message-building, and defines her future monthly visits. Changes options: she cannot simply mourn and leave; the chain's existence obligates continuation. The concept's anonymity (cross-time protection of strangers) makes her choice to persist for unreadable messages both costly and thematically essential.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Warmly observant" enables Maren's seventeen years of noticing Thorvald's patterns without intrusion, establishing the expertise that lets her decode the stone language and understand his final sea-glass addition. Constrains: her warmth is expressed through action (building his message, continuing the vigil) rather than speech. Cost appears in her solitary commitment—observation without conversation becomes permanent stance. Label appears early ("warmly observant of a man who spoke as little as she did") and manifests in specific beats (noticing trembling hands, stone arrangements). Could be more explicitly tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Protect" action drives Thorvald's forty-year vigil, the historical keeper chain's purpose ("warnings, confessions, small kindnesses"), and Maren's closure choice to "stand watch" and let "any soul who stumbled here understand that someone had stood watch." Shapes tactics throughout: stone stacking as protection-across-time, her building of warnings and loneliness markers, her decision to return monthly. Visible cost: protection requires perpetual presence despite futility. Could score higher if Maren's protective choice faced a stronger on-page counter-pressure (e.g., another obligation she must sacrifice).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Stone-stacking method is taught early (paragraph two: "vertical stack meant peace. Horizontal meant beware. Three stones descending westward: I am lonely tonight"), enables Maren's message construction in paragraph six ("Three stones descending... horizontal warning... sea glass balanced at apex"), and charges closure by making her monthly continuation concrete. The grammar's limits (Thorvald needs sea glass to say what it lacks) create the story's central tension. Mechanics matter: specific arrangements carry meaning, and Maren's fluency makes her inheritance credible. Indispensable—without this exact symbolic system, the anonymous chain collapses.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Haunted lantern room supplies the ghost-pressure that legitimizes Maren's vigil: "all those anonymous souls who had stacked their hearts into stone" crowd the darkness, and she wants to "let the ghosts in the lantern room know they were not forgotten." The Fresnel lens delivers the final image (fractured rainbows). Setting enables her decision by making the place charged with keeper presences. Mild deduction: "They said the lantern room was haunted" reads slightly told rather than fully embodied; the cold and Thorvald's position do more concrete work than the ghost claim. Still, the room's decommissioning creates the story's time pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"After the lamp flickers out" timeframe establishes the inciting incident (Thorvald's death, lamp failure) and the decommissioning inevitability that makes Maren's choice urgent—no future keeper will come. Present in title ("the night the lamp flickered out") and drives her rowing without summons. Tightens tactics: she must act now to complete his message and decide continuation. Deduction: the timeframe itself doesn't evolve or create escalating pressure beyond the initial fact; elapsed time from night to dawn is noted but doesn't constrain choices within the vigil. Functional but not indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"To bottle the feeling of safety" motivation is dramatized through Maren's reflection on fishermen finding the beam and her decision to continue the protective vigil. Conflicted: she knows no one will read the messages, yet she commits to monthly visits because the *feeling* of being watched-over matters more than utility. Cost visible: she trades rational closure for emotional fidelity to that feeling. The desire shapes her final stance ("Let any soul who stumbled here understand") and charges the sea glass's meaning (Thorvald's attempt to bottle what words lack). Could be stronger if the friction between futility and desire played out in more on-page doubt or counter-choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Luminescent ache" tone is coherent throughout—elegiac yet warm, mixing loss with beauty. Modulates with pressure: opens with reticent calm ("She was not the sort who asked questions"), tightens through discovery ("The lantern room was cold"), and charges at closure ("one final luminous ache, a ghost-lamp burning bright"). Diction choices (ghost-light, kelp forests, drowned men, fractured rainbows) sustain the tone without flatness. The ache is present in Thorvald's loneliness markers, Maren's inheritance of his unfinished expression, and her choice to continue despite futility. Final image directly embodies the tone, making it indispensable to the story's emotional register.</comment>
