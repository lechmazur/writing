<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior journey from bitter isolation to tentative reconnection is earned through embodied micro-choices (studying Sera's face, tracing her own handwriting, tying the ribbon). The "deciduous" metaphor for emotional cycles is slightly over-articulated in reflection but doesn't flatten the present stakes. Sera's feistiness is demonstrated through action and dialogue with genuine friction. The final teaching moment carries visible cost—Mira commits to what she "should have taught"—though the granddaughter reveal lands cleanly enough to avoid contrivance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid). Orientation anchors quickly (Mira, workbench, cathedral orchard, post-breach). The ribbon's return at midpoint reweights the estrangement stakes, and the closure—"trust the quartz to tell you where it needs healing"—reconfigures the teaching vow with felt cost (Mira's pride yielding, the imagined wait for Calla's words). One meaningful deepening through the daughter's proxy suffices at this length. Causality holds; no convenience rescues.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard hybrid is vivid and purposeful: apple branches through rafters, baptismal font below, fruit as seasonal metaphor. Spatial choreography of the thirty-foot perch is clear. The workbench and quartz lenses anchor micro-setting choices. The ribbon as recurring object charges the closure beat. However, the orchard functions more as atmospheric backdrop than active constraint—it doesn't narrow Mira's tactical options on the page, keeping this shy of the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake: bridging the generational rift through teaching. The ribbon revelation tightens pressure at midpoint, forcing Mira's shift from dismissal to commitment. Sera's persistent returns and the journal evidence deepen the estrangement's weight. The teaching choice at closure forecloses Mira's defensive isolation with visible cost ("what I should have taught your mother"). One meaningful turn driven by protagonist agency under the Accumulative lens, with cost legible in the vow and the imagined reconciliation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—cycles of rupture and renewal, vows that "shed and renew"—emerges organically from the deciduous orchard, the ribbon, and the teaching act without overt moralizing. The "leaves grow back" realization and the final "trust the quartz" instruction offer a resonant answer to the central question of whether wisdom can survive pride. The accidental-wisdom tone (Calla's grudging proxy gesture) charges the reconciliation with complexity. Minor slip: "deciduous didn't mean dead. It meant cycles" veers toward explanation, but the image work carries the weight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-close on Mira. Perceptual signature is consistent: guild betrayal bitterness, the maternal recognition beats, craft-specific noticing. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven—Sera's challenges and Mira's deflections carry subtext. The "bridge generational wisdom" echo is slightly on-the-nose as thematic articulation, and "deciduous vows" as a phrase feels authorial rather than character-organic. Distance control is clean; no head-hopping. Rhythm modulates well under emotional pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Propulsion is strong; most lines advance character or atmosphere. "Deciduous vows" and "accidental wisdom" recur with minor synonym churn ("seasonal commitments," "shed and renew"). The metaphor density in the final third—blossoms like snow, "deciduous in her own heart"—borders on overwriting but remains legible. One template cadence run: "She'd lived here… after the breach… after the Opticians' Guild…" Clarity and momentum hold; no loops that obscure closure. Information density is high.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard fusion and quartz-eye mending offer fresh specificity. The granddaughter-as-bridge conceit transforms the estrangement trope through the forgotten-bag journals and the ribbon's return. The "deciduous vows" frame is conceptually apt but leans toward prompt-template phrasing. Risk-taking is moderate: the teaching reconciliation is heartfelt but follows a familiar arc. Transformation test: the emotional core would survive setting swaps, signaling good but not exceptional originality. No close echoes of famous work.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's choices—studying Sera's face, tracing the journals, tying the ribbon, committing to teach—drive the key turns at midpoint and closure. Setup early, beats in the middle recognition and final teaching moment, closure participation through the "trust the quartz" instruction. Causal pressure and cost are clear.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The ribbon appears at midpoint as the recognition trigger, is tied around Mira's wrist as a vow, and charges the final paragraph's promise. Three distinct beats with escalating meaning. Setup is late (midpoint) but the reprise reweights prior material with felt cost. Strong closure linkage and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "deciduous vows" concept frames the estrangement and teaching reconciliation: promises that fall and return like leaves. Present early ("seasonal commitments"), developed in the midpoint realization ("leaves grow back"), and invoked at closure ("shed and renew but never fully fall"). The concept shapes Mira's emotional arc but doesn't constrain on-page tactical choices. Lyric resonance with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Endearingly feisty" is demonstrated through Sera's challenges ("You're still doing it wrong"), her irreverent perch above the thirty-foot drop, and her persistent returns despite dismissals. The trait enables the teaching relationship and the granddaughter revelation. Setup, development, and closure presence are solid, but the trait itself is slightly label-forward rather than deeply embodied in contradictory impulses.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Persist" drives the structure: Sera's repeated returns, Mira's eventual yielding, and the final teaching commitment. The action appears early, recurs across beats, and defines the closure moment ("Again… this time, trust the quartz"). Causal pressure is strong; the reconciliation would fail without Sera's persistence. High integration with cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The forgotten bag (journals, lenses, unsent letters) is signaled midpoint, spread across the workbench, and provides proof of Mira's stolen innovations. The contents enable the teaching request and reweight the breach-of-contract backstory. Setup is late but the mechanics matter: the journals justify Sera's knowledge and Mira's shift. Two beats with closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The orchard-cathedral setting is vivid and omnipresent: workbench in apple branches, thirty-foot drop, baptismal font, fruit and blossoms as seasonal metaphor. It anchors the "deciduous" theme and charges the final teaching image. However, it doesn't constrain Mira's tactical choices—she could teach anywhere. Strong atmospheric integration but limited causal pressure on decisions.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"After the breach of contract" frames Mira's bitterness and the guild betrayal that motivates her isolation. The timeframe is signaled early and shapes her resistance to Sera. However, it doesn't create urgent pressure or tighten decisions within the present scene. The breach is backstory context rather than a live clock. Solid setup and thematic linkage, moderate causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Bridge generational wisdom" is articulated by Sera, echoes Mira's own words to Calla, and drives the teaching reconciliation at closure. The motivation is dramatized through Sera's persistent returns, the ribbon reveal, and Mira's final commitment. Friction between Mira's pride and the cost of teaching what she "should have taught" is legible. Strong causal pressure and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>"Accidental wisdom" tone—Calla's grudging proxy gesture, the orchard's "ancient agreement," Mira's wry acknowledgment—modulates through the reconciliation and charges the final teaching moment. The tone is coherent, shifts with emotional beats, and enriches the closure image without forced cleverness. Strong integration across setup, development, and ending.</comment>
