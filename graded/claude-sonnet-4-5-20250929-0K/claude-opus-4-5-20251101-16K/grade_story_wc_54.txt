<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's curiosity and engineering mindset drive the narrative forward, though her interiority relies on abstractions like "quiet recognition" rather than contradictory impulses under pressure. The discovery of Chen's work motivates her alternative proposal, but the forty-hour mapping sequence is summarized rather than dramatized with micro-choices that reveal competing values. The final stance—choosing forward—feels earned by the causal chain, though the cost (professional risk, committee rejection) remains implicit rather than embodied on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean: who/where/when established within the opening paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative lens: discovery of the sextant → immersion in Chen's design → alternative proposal submission. The closure lands as Charged Poise: Maya's choice to submit the alternative reconfigures her stance from surveyor-as-demolisher to navigator-as-restorer, with the sextant as talisman charging the final image. The cost—professional vulnerability and the terminal's permanent limitation—is felt rather than paid on the page, meeting the RR standard at this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned terminal is vividly rendered with selective detail: "ghost-glow of emergency strips," "frozen mid-countdown" gate display, intersecting expansion projects creating architectural chaos. The duraglass window, maintenance corridor, and Chen's water system constrain Maya's tactical choices and charge the closure image. The desert's "endless and indifferent" presence and the steadying emergency lights bracket the arc with purposeful contrast. Micro-setting (the sextant, the defunct climate regulator) functions as anchor and catalyst.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—demolition versus partial revival—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Maya's discovery of Chen's system tightens the conflict by offering a third path between total loss and impossible restoration. The forty-hour mapping deepens her commitment, though it occurs off-page. The final choice to submit the alternative proposal narrows options (professional risk, committee rejection) with a cost that is felt in the "heavy" sextant and the terminal's acknowledged limitation. One meaningful tightening suffices at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the sextant's coordinates, Chen's forgotten elegance, and Maya's recognition that "navigation wasn't about reaching a predetermined destination." The piece resists moralizing: the terminal "would never be what it was" but "could become what it needed to be" reweights the premise without stating a thesis. The final image—choosing forward with brass and starlight—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of hope amid ruin. The "mathematics of realistic dreams" avoids platitude by rooting abstraction in concrete engineering choices.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's perceptual signature is consistent: engineering precision ("fractures and stress points") layered with poetic observation ("cathedral built for departures"). The narrative distance is stable, third-person limited with controlled access. Diction remains within her plausible lexicon; phrases like "maze of intentions" and "puzzle out new equations" reflect her engineering mindset without slipping into thesis-speak. The prose modulates appropriately: compressed during discovery, reflective at closure. No dialogue is present; voice is carried entirely through narration and interiority.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; opening lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high in most beats, though "quiet recognition" and "questions that wouldn't rest" lean toward abstract summary. The forty-hour mapping sequence compresses transit efficiently. Minor scaffold appears in "She chose forward"—a declarative that tells the choice rather than showing its embodied cost. No loops or template cadence detected. Figurative language ("ghost-glow," "abstract art" schematics) is purposeful and coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The combination of abandoned infrastructure, historical engineering artifact, and restoration-via-redirection offers a fresh angle on post-collapse narratives. Chen Wei-Lin's water system and the sextant's coordinates root the premise in specific, verifiable detail rather than generic ruin aesthetics. The "mathematics of realistic dreams" risks abstraction but is anchored by the hydro-turbine plan. The piece commits fully to its premise without hedging. Risk-taking is moderate: the structure is linear, the tone controlled, the closure quiet but earned.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's curiosity drives the discovery beat (finding the sextant) and the mapping sequence. Her decision to submit the alternative proposal alters tactics (professional risk versus compliance) and shapes the closure. She is present in every beat and her trait (curious, engineer) enables the core action. Early signal, two distinct beats (discovery, proposal submission), causal pressure present, closure linkage strong. Minor friction: the mapping sequence is summarized rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The sextant appears in three beats: discovery (wrapped in oil-stained cloth), identification (Chen's name and coordinates), and closure (heavy in pocket, talisman). Its weight and coordinates charge Maya's final choice, reweighting the navigation metaphor. Early signal, multiple beats, closure linkage strong, specificity high. Slight swappability friction: another navigational artifact could substitute with minor edits, though the sextant's historical precision fits the engineer POV.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Maze of intentions" is signaled early in the architectural description ("multiple expansion projects had intersected, each team pursuing different visions") and shapes Maya's understanding of the terminal's chaos. It informs her tactical choice to follow Chen's original flow rather than untangle all contradictions. Present in middle beats (blueprint analysis) and implicit at closure (choosing forward through complexity). Causal pressure moderate; primarily operates as thematic frame rather than on-page constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Functionally creative" is dramatized once: Chen's design using "natural pressure differentials and gravity wells to move water...without pumps." This enables Maya's hydro-turbine solution. The trait is shown through Chen's legacy and Maya's recognition, but Maya's own functional creativity is summarized ("forty hours mapping") rather than enacted in a specific on-page choice with visible tradeoff. One beat involvement, causal linkage moderate, cost indirect.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Resurrect" drives the central conflict and closure: Maya's alternative proposal to "resurrect one section of the terminal" defines the stakes and final choice. The action is signaled mid-story, structures the climactic decision (submit versus recommend demolition), and shapes the ending image ("emergency lights had steadied"). Two beats (proposal formation, submission), causal pressure high, closure linkage strong, irreplaceable. The action redefines options from binary (demolish/abandon) to ternary (partial revival).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Redirected flows" is signaled in the water system analysis and executed in the hydro-turbine plan ("rerouting the surviving water system to power a small hydro-turbine"). The method shapes Maya's tactical choice and distinguishes her solution from generic restoration. Present in two beats (discovery of Chen's system, proposal formulation), causal pressure moderate, closure linkage present. Mechanics are summarized rather than shown in granular detail, limiting felt specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The terminal is established in the opening line ("carnival's lights had dimmed three days ago") and anchors every beat: the duraglass window, Maintenance Corridor 17-C, Gate Seven's frozen countdown, Chen's water system, the eastern wing. It supplies the core problem (structural damage, demolition recommendation) and the tactical resource (surviving water circulation). Early signal, multiple beats, causal pressure high, closure linkage strong (emergency lights steadying). The setting's "maze of intentions" constrains and enables Maya's choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After the carnival leaves town" frames the opening ("three days ago") and establishes the abandonment context. The timeframe creates the survey assignment but does not tighten on-page decisions—Maya's forty-hour mapping and proposal submission lack deadline pressure. Present in setup, absent in middle escalation, no closure pressure. Functional but replaceable; the story could unfold identically if the carnival had left weeks earlier.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The desire to "puzzle out new equations for hope" is dramatized in Maya's recognition of Chen's system, her forty-hour mapping driven by "questions that wouldn't rest," and her formulation of the alternative proposal. The motivation is conflicted (demolition committee expectations versus restorative impulse) and shapes the closure choice. Early signal, two beats, causal pressure strong, closure linkage high. Friction: "mathematics of realistic dreams" risks abstraction, though it is anchored by the hydro-turbine specifics.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Stoic wonder" coheres throughout: restrained observation of the terminal's ruin ("ghost-glow," "cathedral built for departures"), quiet recognition at Chen's ingenuity, and the measured final stance ("She chose forward"). The tone modulates appropriately—compressed during discovery, reflective at closure—without sentimentality or deflation. It charges the final image: the sextant's weight, the desert's indifference, the emergency lights' "almost...warmth." Present in every beat, coherent through turns, purposeful at closure.</comment>
