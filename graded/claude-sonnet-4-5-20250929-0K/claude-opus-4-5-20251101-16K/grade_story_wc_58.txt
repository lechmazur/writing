<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and her craft well-detailed, but she remains observational rather than decisively tested. The piece offers embodied moments (winding the thread, desk on knees) and her vocation shapes perception, yet no internal contradiction or micro-choice under genuine pressure emerges on the page. Isaveth's confession provides content for Maren's work but does not challenge Maren's stance or force a renunciation with visible cost. The final commitment to stay through winter reads as continuation rather than a choice that forecloses a live path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (garden, autumn, Maren, desk) within the first paragraph. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: layers of reflection, motif (thread, garden decay, presence/absence), and atmosphere deepen until the final image of writing through winter. Closure lands as Charged Poise—Maren crystallizes her seasonal witness, reconfiguring the garden's decay as a template for Isaveth's life—with conceptual cost (no ships return; isolation is the price). One persistent weakness: the stakes remain abstract and told rather than tested by an on-page reversal or tightening choice that narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Garden setting is vivid and purposeful: rust/amber palette, crumbled palace, ivy, owl call, woodsmoke scent. Spatial choreography is clear (bench, cottage at edge). The setting mirrors theme (decay with dignity, wildflowers in cracked marble) and the weft thread is handled twice, charging the closure image. Micro-setting (body, desk, thread) functions as constraint and motif anchor, satisfying the 9+ gate requirement that environment or object shape the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—completing Isaveth's living obituary—is signaled early and pursued throughout. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure accrues through reflection and atmosphere rather than reversal. No meaningful tightening or on-page choice narrows options; Maren's afternoon listening and evening writing proceed without complication or cost that alters tactics. The decision to stay through winter is declared, not dramatized as a trade-off or renunciation that forecloses another path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of healing-through-mapping and presence-via-absence emerges organically from concrete particulars (thread, garden, obituary craft). The final image of writing while "autumn whispered its own quiet obituary" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. One slip: "explaining nothing yet somehow making the approaching darkness bearable" edges toward stating the theme rather than trusting the image. The garden-as-ruins metaphor is sustained and purposeful, though it risks stock symbolic convenience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and apt. Perceptual signature is consistent (traveler-scribe lens: textures, light, cataloging absences). Diction remains controlled and voice-specific ("lonesome splendor," "geography of healing"). Isaveth's single quoted line carries subtext and advances the obituary content. Minor register drift: "projecting presence onto the page" and "geography of healing" lean toward abstract craft-speak that sits slightly outside embodied narration, though they remain legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sentences open distinctly; information density is generally high. Two prose artifacts lower the score: "shadows pooling beneath the hedges like dark water rising" mixes metaphor illogically (pools don't rise), and the final paragraph contains a paraphrase loop—"Maren would stay…bearing witness, tending to this sacred work" restates the same commitment in adjacent clauses without adding pressure. Template cadence appears in the reflection-heavy middle third ("She had spent…What emerged…Each absence"), where parallelism flattens propulsion slightly. No artifacts touch the closure beat itself.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—writing obituaries for the living—is fresh and the synthesis with "explained absences" and the garden setting feels organic. Execution is thoughtful but leans on stock symbolic moves: decay-as-beauty, wildflowers-in-ruins, autumn-as-metaphor-for-endings. The emotional arc and thematic resolution are sincere yet predictable; the transformation test suggests the plot and arc could transfer to another profession (biographer, portrait artist) with minor edits. No close echo of famous work, but the piece stays safely within literary-realism middle ground without bold risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Maren's occupation frames the premise and she performs her work (listening, writing), but her choices do not create key turns. She observes, records, and decides to stay—all continuation moves rather than decisions that alter tactics or stakes under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The weft thread appears in three beats: Isaveth's gift (backstory), Maren turning it mid-story, and winding it at closure while contemplating its "stubborn persistence." The reprise reweights meaning (countless small things woven together → Isaveth's life as tapestry), charging the final image. It does not constrain a choice or enable an action with cost, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Explained absences" shapes the obituary's content (Isaveth's marriage, return to capital) and the thematic question throughout. It appears early, develops in the middle (listening scene), and the closure image ("absences were not failures but deliberate choices") directly articulates it. It does not, however, create tactical pressure or alter Maren's on-page options; it remains thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Vividly descriptive" is demonstrated in prose texture (sensory detail, specific nouns) but does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost. It flavors voice and atmosphere without shaping stakes or tactics. The attribute is present and functional but replaceable with "careful" or "precise" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Intimate" is articulated explicitly ("This was the intimate act at the heart of her craft") and shown in the listening scene with Isaveth. It frames Maren's vocation and thematic stance. The action does not, however, drive a key turn or decision; the afternoon listening proceeds without complication. Swappable with "empathetic" or "close" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Projecting presence" is named twice (mid-story and near the end: "projecting the woman's presence back to her like lamplight") but the mechanics are not shown or tested. The method appears as authorial concept rather than dramatized technique that shapes Maren's attempts or choices. Late signal and summary-only use cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The shadowed autumn garden anchors every beat, provides sensory pressure (decaying leaves, owl call, darkening), and its decay-with-dignity directly mirrors the thematic answer at closure ("growing through ruins"). The setting constrains Maren's timeline (ships departed, winter coming) and its lonesome splendor charges the final image of writing through cold months. High irreplaceability and closure linkage elevate the score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"After the last ship sails" is signaled in the opening line and returns at closure ("ships would not return until spring"), framing Maren's isolation and the cost of staying. The timeframe tightens the decision to remain but does not create live tactical pressure during the story's present action; it sets a boundary rather than a clock that alters moves beat-to-beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Maren's motivation "to understand the geography of healing" is stated explicitly in the second paragraph and her vocation embodies it throughout. The desire is not, however, dramatized in conflicted choices or tested by friction between want and cost on the page. It remains a told frame rather than a pressure that forces trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" is named once but coherently sustained in diction, imagery (crumbled palace, shadows, owl, amber light), and rhythm throughout. Tone modulates subtly with pressure (afternoon brightness → evening pooling dark → quiet resolve) and charges the final image of solitary witness through winter. The phrase itself and its atmospheric execution are essential to closure's emotional weight.</comment>
