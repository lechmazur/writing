<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's baseline competence and choice to withhold reporting the lantern create some tension, and her final decision to call Internal Affairs demonstrates agency. However, the middle passage relies heavily on therapeutic meta-language ("fortified vulnerability," "witness without being consumed") that reads as diagnostic label-speak rather than embodied experience under pressure. The workers' deaths are told rather than shown through Maya's investigative process, and her supervisor's villainy arrives as exposition rather than through dramatized friction. Internal contradiction is present (she reaches for the lantern despite knowing she should call it in) but the climactic choice feels somewhat inevitable rather than torn.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when adequately in the opening and builds to an on-page closure (Maya calls Internal Affairs) with felt cost—she now carries the weight of these memories and must confront her supervisor. The causal lens holds: drought ends → tunnel floods → lantern revealed → Maya touches it → memories flood her → she understands the pattern → she acts. One meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes her supervisor sent her deliberately. Minor issue: the supervisor's complicity and the connection to prior deaths are told in large reflective blocks rather than discovered through scene pressure, which slightly dilutes the escalation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The subway tunnel setting is established early and returns at closure ("the tunnel hummed"). The lantern's physical details (rusted tin, cracked glass, candle stub) are specific and historically grounded. The flooded crawlspace enables the discovery and the rain bookends the piece with thematic resonance. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The setting does not, however, actively constrain Maya's choices in the middle—she could have this realization anywhere the lantern appears—so it falls short of the 9+ gate requiring environment to shape tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding preventable deaths and breaking free from her supervisor's control—is signaled early. Maya's choice to touch the lantern despite her racing heart provides one tightening, and her decision to call Internal Affairs at closure forecloses the path of complicity. However, the escalation relies on exposition about the supervisor's interference rather than on-page pressure; we're told he "sent her here knowing what would happen" but never see him apply pressure or obstruct her in scene. The workers' confusion and deaths are recounted rather than dramatized as obstacles Maya must overcome. Cost is present but muted—calling Internal Affairs feels more like vindication than sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The theme of buried history seeking recognition emerges through the lantern and the entangled memories of freedom seekers and dead workers. The final image—Maya on the phone with rain falling, carrying memories as evidence—offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. The piece earns points for specificity (Underground Railroad context, investigative framework) and avoids the explain-everything ending. However, "fortified vulnerability" and the therapist's voice intrude as thematic shortcuts, and the supervisor's villainy tips toward binary moral framing rather than complex ambiguity. The lantern as memory-absorbing object edges toward symbolic convenience but is integrated enough to avoid major penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third throughout with no head-hopping. Voice carries professional idiom ("preventable," "empirical observation") that fits Maya's investigative role. However, the therapeutic meta-commentary ("fortified vulnerability," "witness without being consumed") represents register drift—phrases a therapist might use about Maya rather than Maya's own perceptual signature under stress. The transition into the memory sequence is handled cleanly ("The tunnel fell away"), and the return to present is legible. Psychic distance modulates purposefully in the vision, but the concluding paragraphs flatten into summary rather than staying rooted in Maya's sensory present.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies adequately and information density is generally good. The opening hook is strong ("she had never seen anything like what the rains had uncovered") and the final image lands cleanly. However, the piece carries paraphrase loops: "Management called them accidents. The families called them negligence. Maya called them what they were: preventable" is template-parallel phrasing, and "witness without being consumed" / "remain open while staying grounded" restate the same concept. The phrase "fortified vulnerability" arrives as therapeutic jargon rather than concrete action. Stock metaphor: "washing the streets clean" after rain. These artifacts cluster but do not fully obscure the closure, so penalty remains in Q7 per routing rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The combination of preventable-death investigator, Underground Railroad lantern, and memory-entanglement offers a specific synthesis that avoids pure template plotting. The investigative frame and historical layer create earned freshness, and Maya's final choice grows from established causality. However, the memory-object trope (touching an artifact triggers visions) is familiar from genre fiction, and the evil-supervisor-covering-up-deaths element is a stock conflict in procedural narratives. The piece does not transform these tropes enough to reach high originality; the supervisor remains one-note and the lantern's mechanism (absorbing memories) is asserted rather than explored through world logic or cost. Emotional specificity in the vision sequence elevates somewhat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's role as preventable-death investigator frames her initial arrival and justifies her focus on pattern recognition. Her choice to touch the lantern despite protocol and her decision to call Internal Affairs at closure are key turns driven by this professional identity. The attribute appears early, shapes middle action (she kneels and reaches), and participates in closure (she documents, then calls IA). Cost is present: carrying the memories as evidence. However, much of her investigative work is told in summary ("she had noticed a pattern") rather than shown through on-page observation, which limits causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The lantern is introduced early with specific physical detail (rusted tin, cracked glass, candle stub), handled in a pivotal beat (Maya touches it and experiences the memory flood), and its meaning is reweighted at closure (memories become evidence). It drives two major beats: the discovery and the vision sequence. Its historical specificity (Underground Railroad signal lantern) makes it irreplaceable, and the cost tied to it—Maya's decision to carry the memories—is legible. However, the lantern's mechanism (absorbing memories) is told rather than discovered through tactile interaction or world logic, slightly reducing its causal density.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Entangled memories structure the vision sequence and explain the workers' deaths. The concept appears early (implied by "expressions of profound confusion"), is actualized when Maya touches the lantern, and shapes her understanding of the pattern. It enables her final choice by providing evidence of the supervisor's cover-up. However, the mechanics remain abstract—memories "wanted to be carried" is asserted rather than dramatized through cost or constraint. The concept is thematic and explanatory but does not create on-page tactical friction; Maya's ability to "hold steady" bypasses struggle.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Watchfully calm despite her racing heart" appears in the moment she reaches for the lantern and is later reinforced by "fortified vulnerability" and her ability to "hold steady" in the memory flood. The trait enables her survival where the workers panicked and died, so it carries causal weight. However, it is mostly told through label and therapeutic framing rather than shown through specific gestures, breathing patterns, or micro-choices under pressure. The cost—remaining open to traumatic memory—is present but diffuse. The attribute shapes the middle turn but does not appear in or decisively charge the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Reverberate" appears explicitly in the memory sequence ("to reverberate through time") and again in the final paragraph ("the sound reverberating through layers of history"). The action frames the lantern's function and the thematic question of buried histories seeking recognition. It is present in the closure image, reweighting the tunnels as a space of historical echo. However, the action is more metaphorical than physical—nothing on the page literally reverberates in a way that alters Maya's tactics. The concept is integrated across setup, middle, and ending but functions more as motif than as a decision-altering force.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Empirical observation" is mentioned early ("Through empirical observation, she had noticed a pattern") and frames Maya's investigative stance. It justifies her approach to the lantern and her documentation at the end (photographing, documenting everything). However, the method is told in summary rather than shown through specific acts of measurement, comparison, or hypothesis-testing. The piece does not dramatize Maya gathering data or ruling out alternative explanations. The method is signaled and bookends the action but does not shape middle attempts or create friction, so it remains functional but replaceable with "careful investigation" or similar phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The subway maintenance tunnel is anchored early, provides the discovery site (flooded crawlspace), and returns in the final image with layered meaning ("the tunnel hummed with the distant passage of trains, the sound reverberating through layers of history"). The setting enables the lantern's concealment for a century and its revelation after the flood, so it is causally necessary. Spatial choreography is clear (Maya kneels in damp concrete, emerges to rain above). However, the tunnel does not constrain Maya's choices in the middle—once she touches the lantern, the vision could occur anywhere. The setting is essential for discovery and closure resonance but does not supply tactical resources or obstacles during escalation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The drought's end and subsequent flooding are the enabling conditions for the lantern's discovery, anchoring the story's immediate causality. Rain bookends the piece (opening establishes post-drought rains; closing shows rain still falling). However, "after the drought ends" is a background condition rather than a live timeframe that tightens decisions. No clock or deadline presses Maya's choices in scene; she could investigate for hours or days with no change in stakes. The timeframe provides setup and thematic echo (water washing, cleansing) but does not create tactical pressure, so it remains in the mid-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Maya's desire to break free from her supervisor's controlling influence is signaled early (implicit in "Management called them accidents") and made explicit in the memory flood: "He was the controlling influence she had felt pressing on her investigations for years." This realization drives her decision to call Internal Affairs, altering the closure. Friction is present—she risks her position and must confront institutional power. However, the supervisor's control is told rather than dramatized; we never see him obstruct her on the page or witness her prior submissions to his authority. The motivation shapes the final choice with cost but lacks middle-scene embodiment of the conflict between compliance and resistance.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Fortified vulnerability" is named explicitly mid-story ("her therapist had called it") and operationalized through Maya's ability to "witness without being consumed" and "remain open while staying grounded." The tone modulates from investigative calm to overwhelming sensory immersion during the vision, then returns to controlled resolve at closure. It charges the thematic question (how to carry others' suffering) and differentiates Maya from the workers who panicked. However, the tone is told through therapeutic label rather than enacted through prose rhythm, diction shift, or embodied contradiction. The piece describes the tone rather than performing it, which limits its integration into the narrative texture.</comment>
