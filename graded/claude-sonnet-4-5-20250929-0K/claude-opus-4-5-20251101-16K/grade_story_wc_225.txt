<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's internal arc from arrogant tutor to self-forgiving problem-solver is earned through weeks of tactile work. Her productive fidgeting is embodied ("Her hands twitched," "Her fingers bled") and her final mercy—forgiving herself—lands as a choice, not epiphany. Internal contradiction shows in "purpose without pressure" versus her earlier arrogance. Minor slip: "She forgave the woman who had failed her student" edges toward therapeutic self-awareness, though the embodied rain and noise anchor it in the present moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density increases through weeks of decoding, then releases in the final beat when the tapestry shimmers and time resumes. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mira's act frees the village but does not redeem her past; the cost is visible in "She had fixed nothing of her past" and felt in her trembling. Orientation anchors promptly (exiled tutor, Stillhaven, frozen village). One meaningful deepening occurs when she realizes the puzzle is "not about victory, but about stalemate." Causal linkage is present but leans on summary ("For weeks—or what felt like weeks") rather than dramatized turns, which keeps this from the high 8s.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The frozen village (dog mid-leap, child's laugh caught) and the tapestry's platinum labyrinth constrain Mira's problem-solving and charge the final image when "the dog landed" and "the child laughed." Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "woven hush," "distant thunder rolling slowly," "rain on rooftops." The weaver's cottage functions as micro-setting, and the tapestry itself—tool and object—drives her choices. Minor deduction: the village's frozen state is vivid but does not pressure her choices in the middle; it remains static backdrop until the release.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: solving the tapestry puzzle to release the village. One meaningful tightening: Mira realizes the solution requires "freeing every piece, not capturing the king," which narrows her approach. The final act—pulling the last thread—is hers, and the cost is legible: "She had fixed nothing of her past." Accumulative lens fits, and the resolution follows from her sustained decoding work. Weakness: the weeks of work are summarized rather than dramatized in beats, so escalation reads as a density increase rather than a series of reversals or narrowing choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the chess problem "not about victory, but about stalemate" mirrors Mira's internal shift from seeking absolution to accepting imperfection. The platinum labyrinth and the woven hush operate as earned motifs that constrain and then release. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: "forgiveness was not earned through suffering, but chosen through grace," dramatized through the tapestry's completion and the rain breaking the suspended thunder. No explicit thesis statement in the final paragraph; the image of rain and noise does the work. Slight deduction: "She forgave herself for being imperfect, for being human" edges toward articulation, though it remains tied to the present moment and the sensory release.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV, consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature: Mira's focus on patterns, threads, and chess logic. Diction ("winnowed truth from confusion," "fierce repose") is controlled and distinct. Syntax modulates with pressure: short sentences at the climax ("The tapestry shimmered. Outside, the dog landed."). No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks. Voice remains coherent under stress. Minor note: "fierce repose" is declared rather than fully embodied in rhythm, though the surrounding work supports the claim.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes. Information density is high in the tapestry-decoding section. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Clarity and momentum are strong. Minor deduction: "She had been exiled from the capital three years ago, after the prince she tutored lost the Tournament of Kingdoms. It had been no ordinary game. The stakes had been a border province…" is scaffolding exposition that could be more tightly woven into present action. The final image ("one more piece freed from a labyrinth of her own making") is strong but edges toward overt metaphor.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The chess-puzzle-as-tapestry premise is fresh and specific. The frozen-village frame transforms the "exiled tutor seeks redemption" template through the woven hush and the stalemate logic. Mira's arc—forgiveness through grace rather than suffering—avoids easy catharsis. Transformation test passes: the story depends on the tapestry and chess logic. Weakness: the core emotional arc (self-forgiveness after professional failure) is familiar, and the story does not subvert or complicate it beyond the fresh framing. The ending's explicit articulation of the lesson reduces boldness slightly.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's decision to decode the tapestry, her realization that the puzzle requires freeing every piece, and her final act of pulling the last thread are key turns. Her choice to forgive herself is the closure beat. Early signal, middle development (weeks of work), and closure participation all present. Cost: she accepts that her past remains unfixed. Causal pressure is strong, though the weeks of work are summarized.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The platinum labyrinth appears early (tapestry border), is handled across multiple beats (decoding, recognizing the chess problem, pulling the final thread), and charges the closure when it completes itself and the village is freed. Specific properties (frayed threads, chess logic) matter. Cost connection: solving it does not redeem her past. Strong integration; only the summarized middle work prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Woven hush" is introduced early, recurs ("The woven hush of the place pressed against her ears," "The woven hush lifted from her heart"), and reweights at closure when it lifts to reveal "the ordinary, beautiful noise of the living world." It shapes stakes (the village is trapped in silence) and the final image. Weakness: it operates more as atmospheric motif than as a constraint that alters tactics in the middle. Lyric reprise is strong, but mid-scene pressure is limited.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Fidgets productively" is embodied early ("Her hands twitched," "restless fingers would arrange and rearrange pieces") and enables her decoding work ("For weeks… she worked. She winnowed truth from confusion"). It constrains nothing but enables the solution. Cost: "Her fingers bled. Her eyes burned." Present across beats and tied to closure. Mid-band due to enabling rather than constraining role and lack of visible tradeoff beyond physical pain.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Winnow" appears once explicitly ("She winnowed truth from confusion, separating threads that belonged from those tangled") and shapes the weeks of work. The action is specific to the tapestry puzzle and drives the solution. It could not be easily swapped; the metaphor ties to both chess (eliminating bad moves) and weaving. Present in middle development and implied at closure. Mid-high score: it is essential but appears in one explicit beat and is then subsumed into summary.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The method is signaled early ("she began to decode the frayed threads"), its mechanics shape her approach ("Each loose strand corresponded to a choice—a branch in the platinum labyrinth"), and it drives the climax ("On the final day… Mira pulled the last thread into place"). Specific and irreplaceable. Cost: weeks of bleeding fingers. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Only the summarized middle work prevents the highest band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The time-frozen village provides the puzzle and frames stakes (villagers must be freed). It supplies resources (the tapestry in the weaver's cottage) and pressures Mira's choice to solve it. The frozen state is vivid and specific. Weakness: the village does not constrain her tactics in the middle; it remains static until she solves the puzzle. Closure participation is strong (the dog lands, the child laughs). Mid-high for setup and payoff, but limited middle pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"During the lull of distant thunder" opens the story and recurs ("distant thunder rolling slowly, endlessly, never breaking into rain," "the thunder beginning to fade," "the first drops of rain finally fell"). It reweights at closure when the rain breaks, signaling time's resumption. It does not tighten decisions or alter tactics in the middle; it operates as atmospheric marker. Lyric reprise is purposeful, but lack of tactical pressure limits the score to upper-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mira's desire to forgive herself is signaled early ("seeking absolution—or at least, forgetfulness"), shapes her choice to engage the puzzle ("the work itself had been enough"), and lands at closure ("She forgave the woman who had failed her student. She forgave herself"). Friction: she cannot undo her past, and the village will not thank her. Cost: she must accept imperfection. Strong dramatization and closure linkage. Minor deduction: the final articulation is slightly explicit.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Fierce repose" is declared once ("A fierce repose settled into her bones") and modulates with pressure: calm concentration during decoding, trembling at completion, then stepping into rain. The tone charges the final image (acceptance without victory) and coheres across turns. Weakness: the phrase itself is told rather than fully embodied in rhythm at every beat, though the surrounding texture supports it. Strong thematic fit and closure participation.</comment>
