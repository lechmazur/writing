<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mirin's interiority is concrete and particular—"quietly driven" manifests as collecting spirals rather than weeping, mapping destruction obsessively through sleepless nights. Her micro-choices (raising the whistle, playing the forbidden sequence, reaching for a fresh shell) reveal a hierarchy of values: understanding over safety. The final choice is earned by prior causality and forecloses survival with visible cost. Embodied emotion is present ("hands steady despite everything") though some moments lean toward summary rather than contradiction-in-action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page as Charged Poise: Mirin initiates contact, the watchers wake and begin walking, and she reaches for a fresh shell to map what comes next—options crystallize with undeniable pressure and conceptual cost (witnessing the end). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with purposeful pattern-building through spirals, cracks, and the watchers' slow transformation. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mirin deciphers "For you to be ready" and escalates by playing the question, forcing revelation. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by the second paragraph; no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The turtle-shell city is vivid and purposeful: cracks radiate from the western shore, districts built in eye sockets, vertebral rises. Setting actively constrains—the rusted gate traps inhabitants, fractures spread as a communication pattern. Micro-setting qualifies: the shell Mirin traces and the whistle she raises both charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective ("sun bleached everything white and terrible," "still water") and filtered through professional attention to patterns. Spatial choreography remains clear across the workshop, skull crown, and horizon.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and signaled early: decipher the expedition's message and understand the watchers' purpose. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mirin decodes "For you to be ready," then escalates by blowing the whistle despite knowing "some sounds, once released, cannot be taken back." Agency drives the turn—her decision to question them triggers their awakening. The cost is legible on the page: she accepts witnessing (and recording) the city's destruction and the watchers' approach. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure builds through escalating cracks, spirals in impossible directions, and the final crystallization of witness-burden.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: knowledge as compulsion and burden, witnessing as both curse and calling. The watchers are "not watching" but "waiting," and Mirin's drive to understand transforms her into the witness they require—the cost is visible when she reaches for a fresh shell even as "the horizon began to walk toward her." The final image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing: understanding means becoming part of the pattern of endings. Subtext operates through spirals (clockwise/counter-clockwise, directions that shouldn't exist), the unblown whistle that must eventually sound, and "quietly driven" as both strength and doom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and perceptual signature—Mirin notices patterns, coordinates, radiating fractures. Diction remains character-particular ("cartographic secrets," "pattern languages," "those ancient figures") with controlled register. The prose texture is distinct: compression in "thirty-seven days had passed since the gate rusted shut" balances with lyric expansion in "the sun continued to shine, beautiful and merciless." Some filter verbs appear ("she could see," "could not yet decipher") but are voice-motivated and don't dull immediacy. No dialogue present; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies purposefully with short declaratives ("They never moved. They never spoke.") balancing longer image-building sentences. Minor scaffold appears: "desperate hands" and "white and terrible" edge toward stock phrasing, and "beautiful and merciless" in the penultimate paragraph leans generic. The phrase "quietly driven" recurs three times, once as label-adjacent summary ("She was quietly driven to understand"). Sentence openings vary; no paraphrase loops. Figurative language (spirals as language, cracks as response) remains coherent and pattern-taught.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of shell-cartography, pattern-language communication, and witness-as-purpose feels specific and earned. The premise transforms familiar cosmic-horror beats through lived professional detail (reading spirals, mapping fracture patterns) and a non-obvious moral calculus: Mirin chooses understanding over escape even when it means recording her own doom. The watchers' patient awakening and the city's destruction as communication avoid stock horror reveals. Risk-taking in the Accumulative structure and commitment to witness-burden without salvation elevate the piece. "Quietly driven" as both descriptor and doom-engine adds depth.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mirin is present throughout; her choices (tracing shells, climbing to the skull crown, playing the whistle, reaching for a fresh shell at the end) create all key turns. Her professional identity shapes perception (spirals as coordinates, cracks as pattern) and tactics. The final choice—to record rather than flee—grows from established drive. Cost is visible: she accepts her role as witness to the ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The whistle appears in three beats: given by Solven, carried unblown ("some sounds...cannot be taken back"), and finally played to question the watchers. Its use triggers the watchers' awakening and shapes closure. However, its mechanics are somewhat generic—any signal device could serve. The reweighted meaning (sound as irrevocable summons) is present but not deeply specific to a reed whistle's properties.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The lost expedition frames stakes from the opening, provides the spirals Mirin decodes, and delivers the fatal question through Solven's final shell. It shapes her motivation and supplies the pattern-language she translates. The expedition's fate ("only their shells remained") establishes the cost of questioning and makes Mirin's choice to repeat that question causally charged. Present in setup, middle decoding, and closure framing.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Quietly driven" constrains multiple on-page actions with visible cost: she collects spirals instead of weeping, maps obsessively through sleepless nights, climbs to the highest point despite danger, plays the forbidden question. The attribute appears embodied in choices that foreclose safety. Label repetition ("quietly driven" used three times including once as summary) slightly weakens the execution, but the trait demonstrates tradeoffs throughout.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Cracking is the story's central mechanism: hairline fractures → spreading cracks → the watchers themselves cracking as they wake. Each crack redefines options—the expedition's shells spiral impossibly, the city's cracks radiate from the western shore as a response pattern, the watcher's face fractures into recognition. The action is irreplaceable; removing it would collapse causality, escalation, and the communication system. Present in setup, escalation, and directly shaping closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Pattern languages frame Mirin's expertise from the opening ("each whorl a coordinate") and enable her to decode the expedition's spirals (clockwise/counter-clockwise, impossible directions). The method is signaled early and shapes her final action—translating the question into sound. However, mechanics remain somewhat abstract; we see results (decoding "For you to be ready") more than process. Present across beats but could be more tactile.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The turtle-shell city pressures all choices: the gate rusts shut (entrapment), cracks spread from the western shore (communication pattern), districts built in eye sockets and vertebral rises (spatial constraints). The setting is irreplaceable—Mirin climbs "the crown of the central turtle's skull" to signal the watchers, and the city's fracturing is the watchers' response. The shells provide both habitat and the medium of revelation. Micro-setting (workshop on vertebral rise, skull crown vantage) alters tactics and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The rusted gate establishes the timeframe ("thirty-seven days had passed") and creates urgency through entrapment. Day thirty-eight marks Mirin's decision to act. However, the time pressure is more atmospheric than tactical—no ticking clock forces the specific moment she plays the whistle. The timeframe shapes setup and marks progression but doesn't tighten mid-scene decisions. Present but somewhat static.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mirin's desire to question the watchers drives setup (decoding the expedition's message), middle choices (mapping the response pattern), and closure (playing the question despite knowing the cost). The motivation is dramatized through concrete actions and faces friction: "some sounds, once released, cannot be taken back." Her hands remain steady "despite everything," showing the cost of pursuing understanding. The want conflicts with survival, creating authentic tension across beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sunwashed dread is coherent and textured throughout: "sun bleached everything white and terrible," "gold and horror," "beautiful and merciless." Tone modulates with pressure—the opening's ominous stillness, the mounting dread as cracks spread, the charged crystallization when the watcher turns its head. The final image holds both light and doom in perfect balance: "the sun continued to shine, beautiful and merciless, as the first watcher took its initial step." Tone charges closure without becoming a single static mood.</comment>
