<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior is textured through her chalk-artist lens and her "lilac-colored" terror, and her social perceptiveness drives micro-observations. The old woman's fearlessness triggers Mira's shift, but the turn lacks contradictory impulses acting in scene—Mira moves from terror to acceptance without visible internal friction or a foreclosed path with felt cost. Her final "space to draw" reads as insight rather than a choice that narrows options. Interiority is specific, but the closure lacks the earned renunciation or embodied trade-off the band above 7.0 requires.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (whispering grotto, mist, Mira, the unlearning). The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: details and reflections about the unlearning, the mandala, and the tile flake build density until the final "emergent hush" reweights the premise. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the final image ("space...room to draw") reconfigures the unlearning from loss to creative potential. Cost is conceptual (certainties shed) but not viscerally felt on the page; the ending gesture is interior sketch rather than a decisive action or visible forfeiture. One meaningful deepening (mandala interpretation) is present, but the cost remains oblique.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The grotto is anchored early with mist, damp stone, acoustic murmurs, and central chamber. The sand mandala becomes a micro-setting focal point, constraining Mira's interpretation and charging the moment when she places the tile flake at its heart. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("lilac unease," "ambient whispers"). The mandala's void and chaotic edges directly shape her realization, pushing this into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: discovering meaning in the unlearning's mess. The mandala scene provides one meaningful tightening when Mira reinterprets chaos as dispersal, narrowing her stance from terror to acceptance. The old woman's assertion ("emergent hush") crystallizes the shift, but Mira's agency is primarily receptive—no on-page choice that forecloses a prior path or forces a visible trade-off. Pressure accumulates texturally rather than through reversals, fitting the Accumulative lens, but the cost at closure is conceptual and not sharply felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—meaning emerging from uncertainty—develops through the mandala's void-and-scatter pattern, the tile flake's intimacy-across-distance echo, and the "emergent hush" phrase. The ending image ("space...room to draw") reweights the premise without moralizing, offering a resonant answer to the central question. Subtext operates in gesture (placing the shard, closing eyes) and the woman's calm. The lilac unease modulates into potential rather than resolution, avoiding tidy binaries. No overt thesis statement mars the final beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mira; perceptual signature (chalk artist's eye, social radar) colors her noticing. The woman's appearance introduces brief dialogue that carries subtext ("the emergent hush") and advances theme. Diction is controlled ("gauze," "lilac-colored," "seeds scattering") and voice-consistent. Brief elevation ("hierachies...categories...organize existence") fits a reflective mode without violating Mira's lexicon. No head-hopping. Filter verbs ("felt," "saw") appear but remain voice-appropriate. Distance modulates purposefully at the introspective close.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in beats like the mandala description. Minor loops appear: "whimsical" twice in quick succession, "the patterns" echoed across two paragraphs, and "uncertain...darting...trailing" reads as a synonym stack. The phrase "working through the patterns in a sand mandala to negotiate" contains an awkward embedded clause that slightly muddies the sentence. Figurative language ("mist hung like gauze," "sugar in water") is purposeful, but the density of metaphor in the unlearning exposition risks slight overwriting. No major artifact touches closure. Propulsion is steady; no scaffold loops obscure cause/effect.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The unlearning premise and acoustic-space motif (whispering gallery, grotto) combine in a fresh synthesis. "Emergent hush" as a conceptual anchor is memorable. Emotional terrain—navigating uncertainty without red-alert danger—feels specific. The mandala-as-map turn is earned in hindsight. However, the seeker-in-mystical-space frame and the wise-elder-arrives beat echo familiar templates; the story transforms them through Mira's artist lens and the lilac-unease tone but does not fully escape the archetype. No derivative echo of famous lines. Risk is moderate; the reflective mode suits the material but plays safe structurally.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira (whimsical chalk artist) is present throughout. Her artist's eye drives the mandala interpretation (one key turn). The trait "whimsical" is mentioned but does not constrain a choice; her perceptiveness and visual skill do the causal work. She closes eyes to sketch mentally at the end, linking her profession to closure, but no on-page decision hinges uniquely on her being a *chalk* artist versus any visual artist. Two beats (mandala study, final mental sketch) with one clear turn; swappability is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tile flake is introduced early (pocket, salvaged from whispering gallery), handled mid-scene (Mira touches it, reflects on its acoustic past), and placed at the mandala's heart in the closure beat. Three touches across three beats. Its acoustic-intimacy property charges the ending gesture (whispers "perhaps...again"). Removing it would weaken the closure's resonance but not break the plot; the mandala alone could carry the turn. Specificity and closure linkage push it above 6.0, but its causal pressure is symbolic rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Emergent hush" is named mid-story and explained by the old woman, then reprised in the penultimate beat as a felt presence. It shapes Mira's realization (the void making room) and reweights the unlearning from dissolution to potential. However, it arrives via exposition rather than through Mira's on-page discovery; it does not constrain her actions or alter tactics. Setup is late (~50%); development is thematic; payoff is atmospheric. The concept enriches theme but does not drive plot turns.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Socially perceptive" is labeled twice: Mira notices seekers' nervous movements and later reads the woman's lack of fear. These observations inform her stance shift but do not constrain a choice or impose a visible cost. The trait enables interpretation rather than action. No on-page moment where social perception forces a trade-off or alters tactics. Functional but replaceable with general observational skill; no unique cost tied to the trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Interject" appears once: Mira wants to argue with the woman but the protest "died on her tongue." The suppressed action is a micro-turn (she listens instead of arguing), but removing "interject" and using "speak," "challenge," or "respond" would not alter structure. The beat is functional, yet the specific verb is ornamental. No causal pressure unique to "interjecting" versus any verbal challenge. Single beat, swappable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The sand mandala is introduced early (central chamber), studied in detail (void center, chaotic spirals, scatter at edges), and Mira places the tile flake at its heart in the closure beat. Three beats. The mandala's pattern—void, spiral, scatter—directly enables Mira's realization ("dispersal...seeds"). Removing it would collapse the mechanism of her insight. The "through the patterns" phrasing is slightly awkward but present. Setup, development (interpretation), and payoff (tile placement) all clear. Causal and closure-linked.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The whispering grotto is anchored early (mist, damp stone, vibrations, hidden chambers) and its acoustic property (murmurs traveling through stone) frames the setting's thematic resonance. The grotto supplies the mandala and the seekers, shaping Mira's encounter and realization. Mist thickens in the penultimate beat, charging the atmosphere at closure. The setting does not impose a tactical constraint (no locked door, no ticking clock), but it provides the crucible for theme and the final "hush." Early setup, thematic development, closure participation. Specificity and resonance lift it above 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"During the unlearning" is signaled early and repeatedly ("the unlearning," "old knowledge dissolving," "categories fading"). It establishes the story's conceptual stakes and Mira's terror. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—there is no deadline, no escalating crisis within this window. The unlearning is backdrop and theme rather than a live clock that alters tactics. Setup is strong; development is thematic; no payoff beat where time pressure changes Mira's choice. Functional but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira's desire "to discover meaning in the mess" is dramatized: she traces walls, carries the tile flake, studies the mandala, and closes eyes to sketch new forms. The motivation drives her presence in the grotto and her interpretive turn at the mandala. Conflict is internal (terror vs. potential) rather than a high-stakes external obstacle, but the friction between wanting certainty and finding "space" is present. Three beats (arrival, mandala study, mental sketch) all serve this want. No moment where the desire imposes a visible cost or forces a sacrifice; the ending grants resolution without trade-off. Strong involvement, moderate cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Lilac unease" is named early and operationalized as "gentle purple...fading at the edges," distinct from "sharp red" danger. The tone modulates from terror to soft fear to cautious potential. At closure, the unease remains ("lilac unease") but is reframed as "space...room to draw," charging the final image with ambivalent possibility. Coherent through turns; the color metaphor is specific and held. The tone constrains emotional register (no melodrama, no triumph) and subtly pressures Mira's receptive rather than combative stance. Setup, development, payoff all clear; tone shapes the ending's feel.</comment>
