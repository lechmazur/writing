**Drive Lens:** Accumulative/Textural. The story builds through layered imagery and symbolic deepening toward a Conceptual Repricing at closure — Vera's realization that her spiraling mind was destiny, and her commitment to the archeological role.

<question>1</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Helix-minded," "chaotically precise" are labels rather than dramatized traits; the character moves from arrival to revelation without genuine struggle, contradictory impulse, or micro-choice under pressure. The weeping is unearned — "without knowing why" is stock emotional shorthand. No path is meaningfully foreclosed; her commitment reads as smooth confirmation, not costly decision.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean within the first paragraph. However, the structure is and-then sequencing: arrives → enters cave → arranges mirrors → receives visions → commits. No meaningful complication or resistance. The CR closure ("Everything was connected") is asserted rather than dramatized with felt cost — "spend years modifying her mind" is future-tense summary, not on-page price. Cost proof test fails to point to an exact sentence where cost is undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The canyon setting is functional and evocative — moonlight as activating key, cave entrance, rock strata as library. The micro-setting of mirror arrangement constrains action. However, sensory detail tilts overwhelmingly toward metaphor ("wound in the earth's memory," "dark synapse") rather than tactile specificity. The canyon does charge the final double-helix image, meeting the constraint test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Nearly zero resistance or complication. Vera follows coordinates, arranges mirrors, and the method works immediately. No option is narrowed, no trade-off is forced, no obstacle tests commitment. The "escalation" is purely additive (more dreams arrive) without any price or narrowing. Under the Accumulative lens, density increases but no cadence shift reweights the dominant stake with cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Final paragraph moralizes directly: "Everything was connected. Nothing was truly lost. Only waiting to be remembered." This is a Thematic Echo penalty (−0.7). The theme of connection is told through metaphor chains rather than emerging from dramatized events. "Engineering became about optimization instead of wonder" is pseudo-profound without narrative grounding. Theme outruns pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited with a consistent lyric register. Some perceptual signature in spiral/helix thinking. However, pseudo-scientific terms ("synaptic plasticity," "quantum particles") read as label-dropping rather than voice-motivated diction. No dialogue. The voice is competent but lacks the singular texture that distinguishes it from generic literary-speculative prose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>High figurative density throughout peak beats without teaching a restraining pattern: "wound in the earth's memory," "dark synapse waiting to fire," "dreams moved through her like earthquakes." Template cadence in the dream list ("A child's dream... An old woman's vision... A young man's hope..."). Paraphrase loops on the connection theme across the final third. The closing three sentences are scaffold moralizing that dulls the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The "archeologist of abandoned dreams" concept is genuinely interesting, and the canyon-as-neural-pathway metaphor shows creative fusion. However, the grandmother's legacy quest, quantum-entanglement-as-connection, and mystical-science-device are well-worn speculative tropes that aren't transformed through specific, lived detail. The story stays in beautiful abstraction rather than committing to irreplaceable particulars.</comment>
