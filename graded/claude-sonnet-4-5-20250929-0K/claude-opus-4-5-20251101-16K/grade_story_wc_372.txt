<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera's motivation is clear and sustained—preservation against oblivion—and her forty-year devotion grounds her choices. However, interiority remains largely summary-driven; we see her "gently meticulous precision" and "quiet satisfaction" asserted more than embodied through contradictory impulses under pressure. The discovery of her own vow provides a micro turn, but the emotional stakes feel preordained rather than tested. No visible internal conflict forces a choice that forecloses a path with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The story establishes an accumulative/textural lens: Vera catalogs slides, each one deepening the theme of preservation against fading. Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph (who, where, when). The closure—measuring her own vow and finding it unbroken—reads as Earned Stasis with conceptual cost (endurance against entropy). However, the final beat lacks a decisive tightening; the satisfaction is asserted rather than charged by a live risk or irreversible price on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The frozen library setting is vivid and specific: "walls of perpetual ice," "crystalline silence," "quartz hush." Spatial choreography is coherent, and the environment constrains Vera's work (dropped slides mean erasure). The calibration prisms and frequency sampler ground her labor in tactile detail. The setting charges the final image when "the frozen library creaked once, settling deeper into its crystalline permanence," tying stasis to entropy.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve meaning from oblivion—is signaled early and remains coherent. The work of cataloging provides accumulative pressure, and Vera's discovery of her own vow tightens focus. Yet no on-page choice narrows options or forces a visible trade-off; she performs her duty without friction or failure that would test commitment. The story deepens thematically but lacks escalation that forecloses a path with felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the particulars: vows as luminous imprints, the "timeframe of fading," preservation as an act against forgetting. The final image—Vera's own vow measured and unbroken—answers the central question (can meaning endure?) without moralizing. The "quartz hush" and recurring slides build subtext. However, the ending risks resolving into quiet affirmation without ambiguity or counter-pressure that would make the cost of endurance more undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, with consistent psychic distance. Diction is controlled and voice-specific: "gently meticulous," "crystalline permanence," "hungry edge." The single line of dialogue ("Stable enough") feels natural and fits the quartz hush tone. Perceptual signature is present in Vera's professional filter (frequency signatures, luminescence patterns). Minor register drift into elevated phrasing ("spectral imprint," "luminous vows") fits the mythic frame but occasionally distances the reader from immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is clean, vivid, and propulsive. Strong specific images: "Frost crawled across shelves," "intertwined strands of commitment, fidelity, hope." Sentence rhythm varies purposefully. A few minor artifacts: "her breath visible in the perpetual chill" is generic cold-setting shorthand; "pressing against the world's edges" verges on stock metaphor. The "quartz hush" recurs effectively. Information density is high; no paraphrase loops or scaffold detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The core premise—luminous vows cataloged in a frozen library as humanity's illusions fade—is specific and fresh. The magic-lantern slide metaphor transforms the trope of archival preservation. However, the emotional arc (dutiful archivist finds her own vow intact) follows a predictable structure without a non-obvious turn. The "timeframe of fading" risks abstraction; grounding the stakes in a single slide's failure or Vera's own flicker would deepen originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Vera as "orderly records chief" is present throughout and her role shapes every beat. She catalogs, measures, and preserves; her choices (selecting slides, recording measurements) structure the narrative. However, these are procedural rather than high-stakes decisions; no on-page choice narrows options or alters tactics under pressure. The discovery of her own vow provides a lyric reprise but does not force a renunciation or change. Strong middle development, moderate closure linkage, but low causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The magic lantern slides appear in setup (introduced in paragraph 2), are handled across multiple beats (Seventh Meridian wedding vows, Vera's own vow), and charge the closure (her vow "returned to its place among thousands of others"). Each slide's "luminous imprint" drives Vera's work and the stakes (one dropped slide = erasure). Specificity is high; the slides' frequency patterns and failing luminescence matter. Closure linkage is strong; the final image relies on the slide's endurance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Luminous vows are the story's conceptual spine: "the spectral imprint of a vow once spoken with true intent." They shape stakes (preservation vs. oblivion) and tactics (frequency sampling to diagnose decay). The concept appears in setup, drives cataloging work, and charges the ending (Vera's own vow remains unbroken). However, the vows function more as static objects than active forces; no vow's specific content changes Vera's approach or forecloses a path. Moderate causal pressure; strong thematic presence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Gently meticulous" is introduced early ("Vera moved through the crystalline aisles with gently meticulous precision") and recurs ("to be gently meticulous in her devotion"). It constrains her work (carelessness = erasure) and defines her commitment. However, the trait is asserted more than tested; no on-page moment shows her forced to choose between gentleness and speed, or meticulousness and risk. The attribute supports characterization but does not enable or constrain a pivotal choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Measure" drives the narrative: Vera sets up equipment, positions slides, activates the sampler, records frequencies. The action appears in setup (paragraph 5), structures multiple beats (wedding vows, her own vow), and anchors closure ("She measured her own vow now"). Measurement diagnoses decay and verifies endurance, shaping the story's stakes. However, the action is procedural; no measurement fails or forces a tactical shift. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"By sampling frequencies" is signaled in setup ("the frequency sampler, the calibration prisms"), used on-page ("activated the sampler, watching as it analyzed the light's oscillations"), and returns at closure ("by sampling frequencies she had sampled countless times before"). The method's mechanics matter: frequency patterns allow reconstruction if slides shatter, and irregular pulsing diagnoses failing vows. However, the method never fails or forces adaptation; it functions smoothly throughout. Moderate specificity and beat involvement, weak causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The frozen library is introduced in paragraph 2 and anchors every beat: "walls of perpetual ice," "perpetual chill," "quartz hush," "crystalline permanence." The setting constrains Vera's work (one dropped slide = erasure) and charges the closure ("the frozen library creaked once, settling deeper"). Spatial details (aisles, shelves, cloudbanks) remain consistent. The environment's tactile presence (frost, cold, silence) shapes Vera's meticulous approach. Strong setup, moderate development pressure, strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "while illusions fade to memory" is named in paragraph 4 and frames the stakes (humanity's dreams thinning, certainties dissolving). It colors the cataloging work (each year more slides arrive) and the closure (vows endure despite fading). However, the timeframe functions as backdrop rather than active pressure; no clock tightens Vera's choices or forces acceleration. The concept is thematic and consistent but does not constrain tactics or alter the pace of decision.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Vera's motivation "to conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" is stated clearly in paragraph 5 and drives her forty-year devotion. It shapes every cataloging choice and charges the closure (her own vow unbroken = meaning preserved). The motivation is consistent and thematically resonant. However, it is told more than dramatized; no on-page moment shows Vera tempted to abandon her duty or forced to choose between competing goods. Strong thematic presence, moderate dramatized conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Quartz hush" is introduced early ("quartz hush that filled every corner of the library"), recurs mid-story, and returns at closure ("in the quartz hush of her frozen sanctuary"). The tone is coherent and specific: crystalline silence, subdued reverence, meticulous care. It modulates subtly with Vera's emotions (pause at her own vow, "quiet satisfaction" at the end). The tone charges the final image by reinforcing stillness and endurance. Strong consistency and closure linkage.</comment>
