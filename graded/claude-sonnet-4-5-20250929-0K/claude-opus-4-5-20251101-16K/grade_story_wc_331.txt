<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior life is specific—her conviction about narrative sediment, her three-year mapping project—and the scarf's multi-generational weight embodies her obsession. The final beat shows contradictory impulses (tears of validation vs. uncertainty about crossing) acting simultaneously. However, the choice to "only needed to decide" defers agency rather than enacting it; the ending crystallizes options without foreclosing a path with visible cost on the page, landing closer to setup than closure-driven characterization.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—years of mapping coalesce into the discovery, then reweight in the final paragraph's charged hesitation. Orientation anchors (Mira, library, 5 AM shifts) arrive early. The closure unit is Charged Poise: Mira confirms the seam's existence and withdraws, crystallizing the choice between safety and crossing. Cost is felt (tears, "courage she hadn't yet gathered") but the decision is deferred off-page, weakening the closure's finality. One meaningful deepening (discovery → emotional confirmation → retreat) is present, but the ending's "until then" postpones the decisive change rather than enacting it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The library's non-Euclidean architecture (corners that don't meet, asymmetric hallways) directly enables Mira's search and the seam's discovery. The scarf functions as micro-setting (dowsing rod, warmth against the wall) and constrains her method across beats. Sensory detail is selective (fluorescent hum, rain-streaked windows, thickened air) and filtered through Mira's POV. The architecture section placement feels organic. The final image charges setting through the seam's physical presence, satisfying the 9+ gate, though occupational library detail (catalog, shelving systems) remains thin.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding where stories live) is signaled early and coheres through Mira's geodesic walks and the scarf's analog-memory function. The discovery beat tightens pressure: air thickens, fabric warms, hope reawakens. However, the protagonist's retreat ("didn't go through. Not yet") defers the high-stakes choice off-page, undercutting escalation at closure. Under the Accumulative lens one meaningful intensification (search → discovery → emotional confirmation) is present, but the visible cost is modest—tears and hesitation rather than a trade-off that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme (stories as physical sediment, inheritance of belief, courage to cross into the immaterial-made-real) emerges through the scarf's layered memories, the grandmother's death, and Mira's solitary vigil. The final image—hand withdrawn, scarf tucked, return to the desk—offers a resonant non-literal answer: the threshold exists, but she remains a "keeper of doorways" rather than a traveler. No overt thesis statement mars the ending. The patron's oblivious turn grounds the thematic question in observed solitude, and the dust motes "frozen like words waiting to be spoken" layer texture without forcing the moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single-POV, stable third-limited with close psychic distance. Perceptual signature is character-specific: Mira measures "angles they made between shelves," sees patrons as unaware, filters setting through Lobachevsky's theorems. Diction ("liminal shifts," "hyperbolic fold," "analog memories") fits an eccentric academic voice. No head-hopping. The "observed solitude" phrase in the penultimate paragraph borders on meta-commentary but stays anchored in the patron's glance. Minor slip: "The fluorescent lights hummed their mechanical hymn" elevates briefly into lyricism that feels authorial rather than Mira's idiom under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings are not formulaic. Information density is high in the architecture and scarf beats. However, paraphrase loops appear: "She believed... she believed" (paragraph 2), "Every story... every plot... every character" (paragraph 5), and the final paragraph's "waiting to be spoken / waiting on the other side" near-synonym pair. The "tears streamed... absorbed them" beat stacks filter-like constructions ("silent and warm," "as it had absorbed") without added pressure. Template cadence in "She had inherited... She had spent... She believed" runs across three paragraphs. These artifacts cluster but do not obscure causality, so the deduction remains moderate (−0.6 in Q7 for loop/template presence, −0.4 for the filter stack).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise (hyperbolic geometry as portal to narrative sediment) is conceptually fresh and the scarf's analog-memory conceit is specific. However, the "librarian discovers secret passage" frame is familiar, and the ending's deferral ("if she was brave enough") withholds the risky choice that would elevate originality. Emotional truth is present (grief for the grandmother, solitary validation), but the transformation test is weak: swap the library for another liminal workplace and the arc holds. The non-Euclidean math is ornamental rather than driving tactics. No close echoes of famous lines, yet the piece plays it safe by stopping short of crossing.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's odd-hour schedule is signaled early (paragraph 1) and her role as observer/mapper drives the search across beats. Her final choice (withdraw, return to desk) alters tactics by deferring the crossing, a meaningful but modest turn. Present in closure. Two beats (mapping, discovery). Causal role in both. Swappable with "archivist" or "curator" without major edits, capping irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The scarf appears in four beats: inheritance (paragraph 3), dowsing (paragraph 6), warmth test (paragraph 8), tear absorption (paragraph 11). It enables the discovery method (trailing, pressing, warming) and charges the closure through multi-generational memory accumulation. Early signal, repeated use, closure linkage. Cost connection is conceptual (carrying forward grandmother's legacy). Unique properties (analog memories in fabric) matter. Would break discovery mechanics if removed.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Analog memories (information in matter, not data) frame the scarf's function and Mira's belief that narratives accumulate physically. Introduced early (paragraph 3), it shapes the dowsing method (paragraph 6) and reappears in the tear-absorption beat (paragraph 11). Stakes hinge on it: stories must go somewhere, and the scarf's traces seek their kin. However, the hyperbolic-geometry mechanism operates independently; the concept flavors theme more than altering tactics. Present in closure image but not causally decisive there.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Sanely eccentric" appears once as the patron's perception (paragraph 1) and is illustrated by the tattered scarf and odd hours, but it does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. Label-only mention. No middle development or closure participation. Ornamental characterization that could be cut without altering the search or discovery.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Reawaken" is the pivotal verb in paragraph 9: "reawaken something in her chest—a hope she had buried when her grandmother died." This turn shifts Mira's emotional state from methodical search to tearful validation, charging the final beats. The discovery is incomplete (she does not cross), but the reawakening of hope enables the tears and the decision to withdraw rather than abandon the quest. Present in closure logic. Irreplaceable; "confirm" or "validate" would not carry the resurrection metaphor tied to the grandmother's death.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry is introduced early (paragraph 4: Lobachevsky, parallel lines, triangle angles) and shapes Mira's three-year method (tracing geodesics, paragraph 6). The seam's discovery hinges on this math (paragraph 7). However, the mechanics remain abstract; no on-page choice tests whether the geometry works or fails. Swappable with "sacred geometry" or "ley lines" without major rewrite. Functional but not indispensable; the scarf's warmth could locate the seam without the math.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The Scientific Poetry Library (verse + equation premise, non-Euclidean architecture, spectrogram wing) is introduced in paragraph 2 and the architecture section (paragraph 7) supplies the seam's location. The setting enables the search (odd hours, liminal stacks) and the patron's oblivious reading frames Mira's solitude. Present in closure (return to circulation desk). Two beats (mapping, discovery). However, the library's unique collection (Keats annotated, quantum villanelles) remains set-dressing; any liminal archive would serve. Causal role is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"While patrons browse" frames the discovery (paragraph 7: "a single patron absorbed in meteorological haiku") and the ending (paragraph 10: "the patron turned a page"). Time pressure is implied (Mira must work around observation) but not dramatized; no urgency or ticking clock alters her tactics. The patron's glance (paragraph 10) charges the "observed solitude" theme but does not tighten the decision. Present in two beats, functional for tone, but swappable with "during closing hours" or "between shifts."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The desire to find where stories live is stated in paragraph 5 and drives every beat: the mapping project (paragraph 4), the geodesic walks (paragraph 6), the discovery (paragraphs 7–9), and the final hesitation (paragraph 12). Friction between validation and fear ("courage she hadn't yet gathered") is dramatized through tears and withdrawal. Cost is felt (grandmother's death, years of searching, solitary vigil). Present in closure. Three beats. However, the motivation remains largely interior; no on-page test forces Mira to choose between the search and another live stake.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Observed solitude" is coherent across the piece: patrons who "rarely noticed her" (paragraph 1), Mira "watching them" (paragraph 1), "the patron... saw an odd woman" (paragraph 10), "her observed solitude" (paragraph 11). Tone modulates from methodical (early mapping) to charged (discovery tears) to hesitant (final withdrawal). The final image (dust motes, patron turning page, Mira at desk) sustains the loneliness and charges the threshold moment. Present in closure. However, the phrase "observed solitude" in paragraph 11 is explicitly named rather than purely evoked, reducing subtlety.</comment>
