<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera's motivation to uncover her mother's hidden truth is clear and drives her forward, but her interior life leans heavily on sensory cataloging rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to "step backward" feels more like following a discovered clue than an earned renunciation with visible cost—the decision arrives too smoothly. Embodied emotion is present in texture ("taste of revelation, texture of resolve, frequency of fear") but occasionally tips toward abstraction. The protagonist's competence as a mapper is never tested by genuine failure or blind spots that compound before resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening paragraph. The closure unit is a Decisive Change—Vera redirects her search from forward to backward, choosing to pursue the ghost universe—but the cost feels conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page. The inferred lens is Causal (because/therefore linkage: shard sings → coordinates appear → understanding floods → choice to go back), and it holds through the ending. One meaningful tightening occurs when Vera realizes her mother destroyed the home universe, narrowing her options to a single path with heavy implications.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The repair bay is vividly anchored with selective sensory detail ("texture of oxidized steel, humidity at forty-seven percent") filtered through Vera's mapper sensibility. The shard functions as micro-setting, constraining each twelve-hour cycle and charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean across universe shifts, and the scorched symbol on the far wall supplies a concrete choice-point. The setting could more directly pressure Vera's tactics—right now it provides atmosphere and clues but doesn't force a trade-off or resource constraint at the climactic beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering her mother's withheld truth—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the REDIRECT inscription forces Vera to reverse her search direction, narrowing options. The escalation is driven by Vera's agency (she chooses to step backward), and the cost is present but more conceptual than visceral: "It would be heavy, Vera knew. But she had spent a lifetime learning to carry weight." A more immediate forfeiture or visible price at the moment of choice would raise this into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the quest to uncover a buried truth and the moral weight of genocide across realities. The recurring green shard shifts meaning from heirloom to key to evidence of erasure. The final image—stepping backward through the weave of worlds—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Minor slip: "Some truths are better left buried" is stated twice, nudging toward on-the-nose articulation rather than letting the material speak. The piece resists tidy morals and embraces complexity with the mother's ambiguous heroism/villainy across universes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature—sensory cataloging, mapper's precision—that remains consistent under pressure. Narrative certainty matches what Vera can know; her realization about her mother is inference drawn from accumulated clues, not omniscient fact. Diction is controlled and purposeful, with vocabulary ("subsonic hum," "topology," "cyclically spontaneous") fitting Vera's professional lens. Minor register drift occurs in the final paragraph ("weave of worlds," "frequency of fear") where the language elevates slightly, but it reads as intentional cadence shift rather than voice break.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally, and information density is high throughout. One paraphrase loop appears: "Her mother's face. Her mother's hands… Her mother's voice" could tighten by one beat. Template cadence emerges in the listing of parallel universes ("In one… In another… In a third…") without clear payoff beyond exposition. The climactic realization paragraph ("You destroyed it") condenses effectively, but "genocide across dimensional lines" introduces elevated diction that slightly clashes with the mapper's concrete sensibility. No loops or artifacts touch the closure beat itself.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—multiverse travel via an heirloom shard, tracking a parent's hidden past—combines familiar genre elements (portal fantasy, family mystery, parallel worlds) without a transformative angle that makes this exact story feel irreplaceable. Vera's mapper profession provides texture but doesn't drive the central choice as distinctly as it could; swap in "navigator" or "tracker" and the arc holds. The revelation that the mother destroyed their home universe is a solid turn, but the mother-as-ambiguous-destroyer is well-worn in SF. Strongest freshness: the sensory map-making lens and the cyclical shard mechanic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Vera's mapper profession is signaled early and shapes her perception (cataloging textures, humidity, frequencies), but her key turn—the choice to redirect—arises from discovering coordinates and the inscription, not from a mapping-specific decision. She uses the skill to build topology but not to enable or constrain the climactic choice. Present across beats but more observational than causal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The shard appears in the opening, triggers each shift, guides the climax revelation (it "pulsed against her chest, as if agreeing"), and shapes the final action ("gripped the shard, let the green light swallow her"). It drives at least three beats and is indispensable to the closure. Specificity is strong: green glass from a non-existent universe, warm despite chill, singing cyclically. Minor friction: its exact mechanics remain somewhat abstract rather than tactile.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>World-weaving is present throughout—Vera has spent months stepping between realities, and the shard enables each jump. It shapes stakes (finding the origin universe) and tactics (following traces, building sensory maps). The concept participates in the ending when Vera chooses to "step backward through the weave of worlds." It's essential but slightly generic; the specific mechanics of weaving don't constrain a pivotal choice as much as the shard does.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Cyclically spontaneous" is defined ("every twelve hours, give or take") and constrains Vera's timeline, but no on-page action dramatizes a cost tied to the rhythm's unpredictability. She anticipates the shift, records data, and steps through—no moment where the cycle's randomness forces a sacrifice or alters tactics under pressure. Present and functional but replaceable with "periodic shifts" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The redirect action is the story's hinge: Vera realizes she must search backward, not forward, redefining her entire quest. It's triggered by the inscription and drives the final choice to step into the ghost universe. Removing this exact turn would collapse the narrative arc. It reweights all prior tracing and charges the ending with new stakes. High causal pressure, strong closure linkage, irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Parallel universes are signaled early, and Vera's method of following her mother's passage through variants is established in the second act. The method shapes her approach (building sensory maps of each reality, noting differences) and the final step backward. It's present across beats and participates in closure, but the mechanics remain somewhat abstract—shifting light, murmur of dreams—without tactical constraints that force a visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The spaceport repair bay anchors the opening with vivid detail and provides the scorched symbol clue on the far wall, which triggers the key realization. It's functional and atmospheric but largely static; Vera could discover the same coordinates in any location. The bay doesn't pressure her choices or supply resources that alter tactics. Mentioned early and at the turn, but swappable with another abandoned industrial space.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"In the murmur of half-remembered dreams" appears as a phrase describing the liminal space between realities. It recurs at the ending ("In the murmur of half-remembered dreams, she felt her mother's presence stir") but functions more as poetic framing than a timeframe that tightens decisions. No live clock or urgency tied to this phrase constrains Vera's choices on the page. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Vera's motivation to discover the withheld truth is dramatized throughout—she's spent months weaving between worlds, following traces, driven by "the unbearable heaviness of not knowing." It drives the climactic choice to step backward and shapes the ending's stakes. Minor friction: the motivation is stated more than tested by conflicting wants (e.g., fear versus need). Strong setup, middle involvement, and closure linkage.</comment>
