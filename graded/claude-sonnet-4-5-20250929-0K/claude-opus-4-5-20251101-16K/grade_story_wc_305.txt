<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and voice-particular ("turning her rage into something quieter"), and her decision to guide her daughter onward is motivated by consistent traits. The daughter's embodiment feels thinner—she exists primarily to receive Mira's kindness—limiting relational crucible. Internal conflict operates through renunciation rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; the choice to let go is earned but arrives without visible struggle in the final beat. Minor deduction for the phrase "turning her rage into something quieter," which edges toward summary.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure operates as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mira's vigil with the hairpin reweights her prior forgiveness and ongoing waiting, forecloses reunion with visible cost ("she would be here…ready to guide her home once more"). Orientation anchors early (grotto, clouds, Mira's role). The hairpin recognition deepens pressure through pattern—given, kept, returned—charging the final image. Cost is legible: eternal separation sustained by purpose. One meaningful tightening present; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The umbral grotto supplies concrete anchors (clouds, tree, pool, starlight) and the tree physically enables Mira's thinking refuge, constraining her coping method. Sensory selection is selective and POV-filtered ("vineyard hush," "scalloped edges that caught the grotto's dim light"). The final image charges the hairpin with starlight, and the tree recurs purposefully. Spatial choreography tracks clearly across moves. Does not quite reach 8.0: the grotto's rules (souls arriving, pool mechanics) are asserted rather than discovered through action, and the setting could tilt more forcefully into choice-shaping pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Mira's search for contentment amid eternal loss. Her decision to guide her daughter away rather than reveal herself forecloses reunion with felt cost. The recognition of the hairpin tightens options; her choice deepens the cycle. Agency is renunciation under Accumulative lens. Cost is visible on the page ("Perhaps contentment wasn't a destination…requiring its own rebirth"). The escalation operates through pattern reweighting rather than reversals; one meaningful tightening present, consistent with the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: forgiveness as necessity, contentment in cycles, the cost of eternal purpose. The hairpin anchors thematic weight—given, lost, kept, returned—without stated moral. Mira's final insight ("Perhaps contentment wasn't a destination") reweights prior material through image and accumulation. No sermonic summary; the vigil image offers a resonant answer to the central question of finding contentment. Subtext operates in silence (daughter does not recognize her) and the charged hairpin reprise. Resists tidy resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV stable in third-limited; perceptual signature is voice-particular ("kindly decisiveness," "vineyard hush," "scalloped edges gleaming like small smiles"). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, advancing plot through recognition and ritual. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (closer at the hairpin moment, wider in reflective beats). Free indirect style is clean. Minor repetition of "kindly" as a descriptor, but the adjective is consistent with Mira's role. Rhythmic control holds under pressure; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; information density is high (most lines do multiple jobs). "Vineyard hush" and "scalloped edges" carry vivid, idiosyncratic texture. Minor artifact: "the sense that somewhere, someone is watching over you" edges toward sentiment without undercutting closure. The phrase "turning her rage into something quieter" summarizes a beat that might warrant dramatization, but does not dull the final image. No loops, scaffolds, or filter-verb stacks in peak beats. Clarity and propulsion maintained throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The umbral-grotto caretaker premise is derivative of afterlife-guide templates, but the story transforms it through the hairpin recognition and the specific calculus of forgiveness-as-necessity. The daughter's unawareness creates earned dramatic irony; the decision to guide her onward rather than reveal adds moral complexity. The tree-climbing method and the scalloped jade add particular texture. Risk is moderate: the concept leans familiar, but the emotional specificity (eternal separation sustained by purpose) avoids generic everywhere settings. Within-band adjustment for modest risk-taking.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's caretaker role is signaled early, shapes her decision to guide her daughter (middle turn), and charges the final vigil image. Her choice to remove the hairpin and send her daughter onward forecloses reunion with visible cost. The attribute constrains action across beats and participates in closure. Scores ≥7.0 require specific cost: the eternal waiting and the daughter's non-recognition are tied directly to Mira's caretaking commitment.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The hairpin is introduced early (first third), handled in the recognition beat (middle), and reweighted in the final image ("scalloped edges gleaming like small smiles"). Its movement—given to daughter, kept through death, removed by Mira—structures the emotional arc and charges closure. The scalloped jade is specific and irreplaceable; swapping it would break the recognition beat and final resonance. Cost is tied to the object: keeping it sustains memory and eternal separation. Causal pressure, closure linkage, and beat involvement all strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rebirth is Mira's occupation and frames the stakes (guiding souls through forgetting). It constrains the daughter's fate (must forget, must leave) and shapes Mira's renunciation. Mentioned in the opening third, operative in the middle (pool, new life), and implicit in the final vigil ("when her daughter's soul returned again"). Does not reach higher bands: the cycle is a setting rule more than an evolving pressure that changes tactics; Mira's choice would remain similar under a different metaphysic. Present in closure but not causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Kindly decisive" appears early ("her voice carrying that kindly decisiveness"), enables the daughter's trust, and constrains Mira's final choice: she must guide without revealing. The trait is embodied in action (removing the hairpin gently, guiding to the pool) and forecloses the option of confession. Visible tradeoff: kindness sustains the cycle at the cost of recognition. Does not reach 8+ because the trait operates more as consistent characterization than as a reversible hinge; the story would survive if Mira were "gentle and firm" instead.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The scallop detail anchors the hairpin's recognition ("scalloped edges that caught the grotto's dim light") and returns in the final image ("scalloped edges gleaming like small smiles"). Present in setup and closure; lyric reprise reweights the object with undeniable emotional charge. Does not reach higher bands: "scallop" is a descriptive feature rather than a distinct action; the story's turns trace to recognition and renunciation, not to scalloping itself. The adjective could be replaced (fluted, ridged) with minor edits, though the specific texture supports closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tree-climbing is introduced early ("She had climbed the great tree…to think better"), used in the middle reflection (silver leaves, roots drinking clouds), and reappears at closure ("Mira climbed the great tree afterward"). The method constrains Mira's coping and charges the final vigil image. Specificity matters: the tree is rooted in clouds and pierces starlight, supporting the grotto's logic. Does not reach 8+: the climbing itself is assertion more than dramatized struggle, and the tree could be replaced with another refuge (ledge, tower) with moderate edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The grotto is anchored early (clouds, eternal twilight, tree, pool), supplies the pool that sends souls onward (constrains Mira's choice), and charges the final image (starlight, hush). The setting's rules—souls arrive translucent, physical objects stay—pressure the hairpin's retention. The tree enables Mira's vigil. Spatial choreography is clear. Reaches 8+ for closure linkage and causal pressure: removing the grotto breaks the story's metaphysic and the final image. Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The timeframe ("after forgiving the unforgivable") is signaled early and frames Mira's earned stance. Forgiveness shapes her current kindness and the decision to guide her daughter without bitterness. The backstory (thirty years, decades of stillness) anchors her readiness but does not tighten present decisions with a live clock. Present in setup and thematically operative at closure ("Perhaps contentment…requiring its own rebirth"), but the "after" is more premise than pressure. Lyric reprise acknowledged; does not reach higher bands because no countdown or deadline alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mira's desire for contentment is stated early ("she had never found the source of contentment she sought"), tested in the middle (daughter's presence offers glimpse, not fulfillment), and reweighted at closure ("Perhaps contentment wasn't a destination…requiring its own rebirth"). The motivation drives her vigil and constrains her choice: she cannot abandon her purpose to claim reunion. Cost is visible (eternal waiting). Does not reach 8+ because the motivation operates more as thematic anchor than as conflicting pressure; want versus fear is muted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Vineyard hush" is introduced early, modulates with pressure (deepens at the hairpin recognition), and charges the final image ("Mira kept her vigil in the hush"). The tone is coherent through turns and reflects Mira's stillness without flattening urgency. The image is specific and idiosyncratic, supporting the grotto's atmosphere and Mira's emotional restraint. Reaches high band for closure linkage and coherence; the hush reweights the opening calm with the cost of eternal patience. Strong lyric reprise.</comment>
