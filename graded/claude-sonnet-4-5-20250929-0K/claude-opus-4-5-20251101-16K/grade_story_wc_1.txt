<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera's motivation (discovering purpose in pauses) is established early and shapes her trajectory from restless artist to someone who can wait. Her embodied response to frost patterns and the ledger strip shows interiority through action. However, the arc leans heavily on summary and reflection rather than micro-choices under immediate pressure; the climactic news of the arsonist's arrest is processed in a single contemplative beat without visceral contradiction or cost-laden decision. The final gesture (palm on glass) reads more lyric than a choice that forecloses a path with visible struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is swift (canyon cottage, post-fire artist). The piece accumulates through frost observation, ledger discovery, and route-walking, building toward the arsonist news and final frost meditation. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): "The frost would form again tomorrow with new patterns to retrace" crystallizes her stance with undeniable pressure and the cost of releasing revenge in favor of perpetual becoming. The ellipsis between beats is legible under the accumulative lens, though the news-letter moment is told rather than dramatized, slightly dulling the turn's immediacy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The canyon setting, frost-kissed stones, and morning window anchor sensory choices throughout. Frost hexagons and canyon paths constrain Vera's daily routine and shape her new artistic method. The final window-frost image charges closure by mirroring the opening and embodying her acceptance of transience. Sensory hierarchy (frost geometry, canyon silence) reflects her shift from luminous spectacle to intimate shadow-holding, and the smuggler's alcoves ground her retracing walks in tactile space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: rediscovering purpose after trauma. The piece shows one meaningful deepening—Vera's engagement with frost and ledger patterns shifts from observation to new art—but pressure remains gentle and reflective rather than escalating through reversals or forced trades. The arsonist's arrest arrives as external information, not a choice Vera must navigate with immediate cost. Her final acceptance is poised but lacks a visible price paid in the moment; the stated cost (releasing radiance-driven ambition) was already enacted off-page before the story opens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (survival as continuous adaptation, meaning in margins) emerges organically from frost patterns, smuggler history, and Vera's artistic pivot. The "Scorched Testament" series and final frost-melting image offer non-literal answers to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates through the ledger strip's implied parallel (hidden lives vs. luminous fame) and the frost's daily renewal. Minor slip: "luminous in ways that no fire could ever destroy" edges toward direct thematic statement in the closing line, though it grows from prior imagery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with Vera's perceptual signature (artist's eye for geometry, light, pattern). Diction matches her reflective state and craft vocabulary without anachronism. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: intimate for frost-tracing, slightly elevated for the smuggler meditation. No dialogue; internal voice remains consistent. Minor register lift in final paragraph ("held breath, the drifting space between stars") elevates slightly but stays voice-coherent and serves closure's lyric turn.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentences vary in length and rhythm; imagery is specific (hexagonal formations, charcoal ledger, river-tributary scars). Information density is high; most lines do double duty. Minor loop: "The frost would form again tomorrow" / "Tomorrow's patterns would be different" / "Tomorrow, she would be different too" cycles the same concept across three beats without advancing pressure. A few filter verbs ("She learned to read," "She learned to wait") cluster in the early adaptation section but remain voice-appropriate. Propulsion is steady; no major opacity or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of artist recovery, frost study, and smuggler history is specific and non-obvious. The "Scorched Testament" title and shadow-holding vessels offer fresh inflection on trauma-to-art arcs. However, the core arc (traumatized artist retreats to nature, finds healing through observation and new work) follows a familiar template. The smuggler's ledger adds texture but doesn't transform the emotional or causal logic; removing it would leave the frost-driven arc largely intact. Risk-taking is moderate; the piece commits fully to its lyric-reflective mode but doesn't destabilize reader expectation in service of deeper stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Vera is present throughout and her choices (waking before dawn, retracing routes, creating new work) shape the arc. However, most choices are enacted in summary across weeks rather than dramatized in scene with immediate alternatives and visible costs. The climactic news of the arsonist's arrest prompts contemplation, not a turn driven by her agency. She functions more as observer and synthesizer than decision-maker under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ledger strip appears in two distinct beats: discovery mid-story and as pinned companion above the workbench. It seeds the retracing walks and thematic parallel (shadow vs. light). Its return at closure is implied (scorched testament of the past) but not handled or reweighted in the final image; frost dominates the ending. Causal role is moderate; it enriches theme but could be replaced with another canyon artifact without breaking the arc.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Scorched testament" names the new art series and frames the thematic question (survival and transformation after fire). It shapes her artistic stakes on the page and recurs in the penultimate beat ("The scorched testament of the past did not define her"), directly constraining her stance at closure. The concept charges both her creative method and her release of the arsonist's hold. Strong thematic and closure linkage; modest causal pressure in middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Steadily adaptive" is illustrated through her daily frost study, route-walking, and artistic pivot. The trait enables her to "reshape herself around stillness the way water reshapes around stone," a visible transformation across the narrative. However, it's more a summary descriptor of change than a constraint that forces a specific trade-off in a single beat. Cost is felt (releasing restless production) but processed in reflection rather than immediate action under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Retrace" drives two beats: retracing frost geometries with her fingertip and retracing smuggler routes through the canyon. Both actions lead to her artistic method shift and thematic discovery (meaning in margins). The final image revisits the window-tracing gesture, reweighting it as continuous practice. The action is specific but not irreplaceable; "study" or "follow" could substitute with minor tonal loss. Closure linkage is strong; causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Frost patterns appear in the opening beat (window hexagons), recur as daily study ("depending on humidity, temperature, wind direction"), and anchor the final closure image (palm melting frost, tomorrow's new patterns). The method shapes her artistic work and thematic insight. Mechanics matter: frost's dependence on conditions mirrors her acceptance of transience. The final beat depends on frost's renewal to land the Charged Poise moment. Strong early signal, beat involvement, and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The canyon setting provides silence, isolation, and the paths for retracing walks. It pressures her toward stillness and away from her former luminous production. The stone cottage and window serve as micro-setting for the frost observations that drive her arc. The canyon enables rather than constrains; it's chosen refuge, not obstacle. Final image uses the window (canyon edge) to charge the melting-frost moment. Setting shapes tone and method but doesn't force a pivotal choice between competing options.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"After surviving the attempt" anchors the opening and frames her present search for purpose, but the timeframe remains vague (thirty years as artist; weeks in the canyon; spring arrest). No live clock tightens decisions. The passage of time is marked by daily frost cycles and the eventual letter, but these don't compress or escalate pressure. The "after" functions as backstory context rather than a constraint that alters tactics or forecloses paths on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Vera's desire "to discover purpose in the pauses" is stated early and illustrated through her waiting practice, frost study, and artistic shift. It conflicts with her prior "restless need to produce," creating internal friction. However, the motivation is more explored than dramatized in choice under pressure; her acceptance of the arsonist news and final frost meditation enact the desire without a visible trade-off or renunciation of a competing want in that moment. The motivation shapes her journey but doesn't force a peak choice with immediate cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Drifting resonance" coheres across the piece: reflective pacing, lyric imagery (stars wheeling, frost scripture), and accumulative rather than causal structure. Tone modulates subtly from early urgency (fire scars, restless production) to settled contemplation (held breath, slow work of melting). The final image charges the tone by literalizing drift and resonance in the melting frost and tomorrow's renewal. Tone supports the Accumulative/Textural lens and enhances closure without static repetition.</comment>
