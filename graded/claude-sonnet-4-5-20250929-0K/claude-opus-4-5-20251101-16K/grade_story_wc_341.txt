<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's grief-driven pursuit is embodied through telescope handling and journal notation, but her interior remains largely reflective rather than contradictory under pressure. The father exists only in memory without friction; no secondary character tests her stance on the page. The final classification "loved" reads as summary rather than a choice with visible cost, and her vigil continues unchanged—endurance without foreclosure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: observation notes layer into a memorial built from data and emotional categorization. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—the sky "holds everything it had ever witnessed"—with the felt cost of solitary vigil and scientific dismissal. Orientation anchors who/where/when early. One meaningful deepening occurs when her categorization shifts from clinical ("wistful," "anticipatory") to personal ("loved"), reweighting the dominant stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The gondola's altitude, brass fittings catching amber light, and the telescope's warmth against cold constrain her sensory world and charge the final image. Cirrus formations and cumulus masses are filtered through her father's emotional taxonomy, creating a purposeful perceptual signature. The sky itself functions as micro-setting, pressuring her memorial project through dissipating ice crystals and frozen vapor that "record passage."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving atmospheric memory—is signaled early and tightens once when her clinical observations ("yearning," "anticipatory") shift to the personal declaration "Classification: loved." The scientific community's dismissal provides external pressure, but it remains told rather than dramatized. No reversal tests her commitment; the vigil continues without a visible trade-off or foreclosed path, only deepening conviction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: brass telescope as inheritance, cloud classifications as grief taxonomy, the memorial "made of data" rather than stone. The final image—"love, when properly categorized, never truly scatters to the wind"—walks the line between earned resonance and direct statement, but the preceding work (frozen emotion, ancient starlight, her father's "melancholic" goodbye) grounds it in concrete observation. The piece resists tidy moral while offering a coherent stance on memory's material presence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with Mira's perceptual filter (clouds as vessels, empty spaces as memory). Diction occasionally drifts toward elevated register ("spooled wholeness of cable and dream," "quietly explosive truth") that reads more lyric than character-anchored. The whispered address to her father—"I'm building you a monument"—and her journal note feel authentic. No dialogue present to evaluate; internal voice is distinct but sometimes poetic beyond immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative density serves the lyric mode ("dusty and ancient," "absorbed twilight"), but "spooled wholeness" appears twice without reweighting and "empty spaces remember" loops across multiple beats. The phrase "quietly explosive" in "quietly explosive truth" and "quietly explosive faith" constitutes template repetition. Clarity remains high, propulsion steady, but the doubled motifs and scaffold phrasing ("suspended in," "made of") accumulate to −0.6 total in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Emotional meteorology as grief response offers a fresh angle, and the gondola vigil particularizes the memorial impulse. However, the core arc—scientist continuing deceased parent's dismissed research to prove emotional/atmospheric link—follows a recognizable template. The brass telescope and categorization system are specific, but the progression from clinical observation to personal declaration feels familiar. Risk-taking in lyric compression is present but does not fully transform the underlying structure.</comment>
