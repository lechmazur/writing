<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Amira's interiority is concrete and embodied through somatic markers (earth beneath fingernails, salt wind, heartbeat). The freeze response is viscerally rendered with muscle locking and breath catching, avoiding diagnostic label-speak. Internal contradiction operates consistently: she distrusts "recovery" yet practices navigation, holds grief while tending new growth. The final choice to return to the propagation house foreclosures passive mourning with visible cost—she must carry the photograph's weight while performing labor.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration through Earned Stasis: Amira's decision to fold the photograph and return to work crystallizes her stance—remembering through tending rather than forgetting. The accumulative lens holds throughout, with density building through layered images (lighthouse, arboretum, photograph, seeds) that converge in the final beat. Cost is legible: she accepts ongoing grief ("the aliveness of her grief") and the patient work that offers no resolution, only continuation. One meaningful deepening occurs when the freeze episode becomes navigable rather than obliterating, narrowing her path from passive suffering to active endurance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The arboretum-on-cliff setting constrains choice throughout: Amira's propagation work provides the tactile anchors (soil coolness, metal railing) that enable her somatic navigation. The cliff's edge platform becomes the crucible where memory and present converge, with physical elements (wind, spray, stone) charging the freeze episode. The lighthouse serves dual duty as atmospheric detail and thematic mirror—automated, stripped of human touch—pressuring her choice between mechanical persistence and tender attention. Spatial choreography remains clear across all movements from eastern bed to cliff edge to propagation house.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: learning to move through flashbacks rather than be drowned. One meaningful tightening occurs when the freeze comes and Amira chooses to "let it happen" rather than fight it, narrowing her options from avoidance to navigation. The somatic method provides the means; the photograph provides the trigger; the decision to return it to her pocket and walk back forecloses passive grief with visible cost. Agency operates through endurance and attention rather than decisive action, fitting the accumulative lens. The resolution trades the false promise of recovery for ongoing work—a credible renunciation scaled to this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through particulars: jasmine courtyard/arboretum wildness, automated lighthouse/human tending, forgetting/remembering. "To anchor optimism in realism" is dramatized through Amira's navigation—she believes jasmine will bloom elsewhere while refusing to forget her sister. The final image of unseen seeds "reaching for light they could not yet see" answers the central question without moralizing: growth requires darkness, hope requires grief. The pearl-of-stillness concept integrates without becoming a thesis statement. Complexity is maintained—grief remains alive, unhealed, yet navigable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV control is clean throughout; distance modulates purposefully from close interior ("her lungs forgot their rhythm") to wider observation. Perceptual signature is consistent: Amira notices through botanical and embodied filters (rootstock bloom, plant struggle, somatic markers). Diction remains within her register—"quietly talented," "patient work"—without therapy-speak intrusion except the brief mention of "therapist" which contextualizes rather than explains. Psychic distance tightens during the freeze episode and pulls back for the final reflective beat, both shifts serving pressure. No head-hopping; free indirect style is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, and theme simultaneously. Rhythm varies naturally with long lyric sentences balanced against clipped action beats ("She breathed. Once. Twice. Three times."). One minor paraphrase loop: "the era of human watchfulness had ended, leaving only machines" echoes the prior automation description without added pressure. Register remains stable except one slight elevation: "refuse the lie that forgetting was freedom" reads slightly more abstract than Amira's established voice. Figurative language (dust as gray snow, pearl of stillness) is controlled and purposeful. Opening anchors voice; closing image recharges seed/light motif effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of PTSD navigation through botanical work is specific and non-obvious, avoiding both trauma-memoir clichés and recovery-arc templates. The arboretum-on-cliff setting and post-lighthouse-keeper frame provide fresh particulars. Risk is present in the quiet accumulative structure and the refusal of tidy healing. However, the "pearl of stillness" phrase and therapist reference gesture toward familiar mindfulness vocabulary. The transformation test passes—swapping names/places would diminish the specificity of arboretum work and cliff-edge geography. Emotional truth anchors the premise, preventing purely conceptual execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present in paragraph 3 setup (wedding, drone strike), drives the freeze episode in paragraphs 5-7 (middle development), and shapes the closure decision to fold the photograph and return to work rather than remain frozen. The survivor identity narrows Amira's emotional options and enables her somatic navigation method—she cannot simply "move on" but must find a way through. Cost is visible: she carries the photograph's weight and must perform ongoing labor with no resolution promised. All three gates met with strong causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Introduced paragraph 3 (setup), handled twice in distinct beats: paragraph 5 (she feels it, hasn't looked in weeks) and paragraphs 7-9 (unfolds it, holds it during freeze, folds it again with purpose). Returns with reweighted meaning at closure—what was avoided becomes deliberately carried. The photograph's threatened escape in wind and Amira's firm grip provide tactile closure linkage. Removal would eliminate the concrete anchor for memory and the visible cost of choosing to remember. Specific object properties (creases, sister's face, henna) matter throughout.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Introduced mid-story (paragraph 6, second third) as therapist language, then enacted in paragraph 7 during the freeze episode where Amira finds stillness at "the center of the storm." Shapes the freeze navigation tactic but remains somewhat abstract—the concept enables but doesn't uniquely constrain. Closure participation is indirect: the stillness allows her to breathe and proceed, but the final image emphasizes seeds and patient work rather than the pearl itself. Two gates met (middle and closure participation) with moderate causal pressure, but late arrival and replaceability with similar "calm center" concepts limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Signaled in paragraph 4 (setup: "quietly talented with growing things"), demonstrated through specific ability (coax bloom from dead rootstock, understand struggle), and connected to closure through the propagation-house return and her "quietly talented hands" in the final line. The attribute enables her navigation method—botanical attention provides somatic anchors—and establishes a visible cost: she channels grief into labor rather than expression. However, the talent itself doesn't constrain a difficult choice; it facilitates. Two gates met with modest causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Signaled paragraph 1 implicitly (Amira remembering), enacted paragraph 5 ("When the memories surged, Amira would freeze"), and becomes the central action of paragraphs 7-8 where "the freeze came then, as it always did." The freeze redefines Amira's options from avoidance to navigation and drives the key turn: "this time, she let it happen." Removal would eliminate the story's dominant pressure mechanism. Swapping for another trauma response (dissociation, flight) would require restructuring the somatic navigation method. All three gates met with strong causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Introduced paragraph 2 (setup: "through somatic markers, the body's quiet language"), mechanics demonstrated with specific examples (weight of earth, salt wind, heartbeat), and method actively used in paragraph 7 to navigate the freeze (cold railing, spray, solid stone). Shapes attempts by providing the concrete means of navigation—without this method, the freeze would remain unnavigable. Closure participation is direct: the method enables the final choice to return to work. All three gates met; specificity of the mechanics (touch, temperature, proprioception) creates irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Established paragraph 1-2 (arboretum on cliff with lighthouse below, eastern bed, cypress branches), used throughout for spatial anchoring and tactical resources. The cliff's observation platform provides the physical space for the freeze episode; the propagation house supplies the closure destination. Setting pressure is consistent: wind threatens the photograph, salt spray provides somatic anchor, the cliff edge positions Amira between growth (arboretum) and mechanization (lighthouse). Removal would eliminate the spatial logic of her navigation and the thematic mirror of precarious cultivation. All three gates met with strong constraint and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Present in paragraph 1 (lighthouse dark three years, Henriksen's ritual ended, beam automated) and paragraph 6 (last keeper died), but functions primarily as atmospheric context rather than temporal constraint. No urgency tied to this timeframe; Amira's choices would play identically if the keeper had died last month or ten years ago. The automation provides thematic mirror (mechanical vs. human touch) but doesn't tighten decisions. Setup gate met, but middle development and closure participation gates missed—the timeframe doesn't shape tactics or narrow options. Swappable with any post-change period.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Introduced explicitly paragraph 6 as the articulated goal, but dramatized throughout via Amira's actions: she plants seeds (optimism) while holding the grief-photograph (realism), refuses forgetting while believing jasmine will bloom elsewhere. Friction between wants and costs is visible—she must endure ongoing sorrow to maintain honest hope. The motivation shapes the closure choice: fold the photograph (acknowledge loss) and return to propagation work (tend future). However, the explicit statement "to anchor optimism in realism" reads slightly didactic, and the desire could be shown entirely through action. Two gates met with good friction, but the tell lowers the score.</comment>
