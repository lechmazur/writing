<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kira's interiority is concrete and sustained—her motivation is rooted in personal, sideways memories rather than scientific ambition. The piece effectively uses her professional role (mechanic) to ground choices, and her interaction with the nexus and the other-self shows embodied contradiction. However, the final shift feels more conceptual than costly; the "subdued awakening" lacks a visible forfeiture or trade-off that would elevate the arc. The other Kira offers wisdom rather than complicating the present choice, reducing friction at the peak.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (station, mechanic, Whisper Moths) by the first hundred words. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the nexus hums, the holographic overlay appears, and the other-self materializes—density increases toward a conceptual repricing of time as adjacency. Closure lands with the protagonist smiling and accepting simultaneous existence, which reweights the premise. However, the cost is muted; Kira will "continue being the obliging sky mechanic," suggesting minimal forfeiture or tactical change, which keeps the closure effect legible but not sharply felt.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The station's "mechanically warm" walls anchor sensory particularity and recur at key moments, constraining Kira's experience of isolation. Whisper Moths introduce electromagnetic interference as a ticking clock, and the observation dome's half-light creates urgency. The maintenance bay, plants, and "color that didn't exist yet" in the overlay charge the final image with contrasting textures. Spatial choreography (lever, nexus, holographic display) tracks cleanly, and the Moths' stirring signals window closure. Environment pressures the attempt and shapes the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving time moves sideways—is signaled early and drives the attempt. The Moths' electromagnetic window creates real pressure, and pulling the lever narrows options by committing the experiment. The holographic overlay tightens when the other-self appears, deepening understanding. However, the resolution is contemplative rather than decisive; Kira gains insight but no visible on-page trade-off or path foreclosed. The Moths wake and she "remains still," which fits the accumulative lens but leaves cost implicit rather than sharp.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—time as adjacency rather than sequence—emerges through the nexus, holographic projections, and the other-self's dialogue without overt thesis statements. The "mechanically warm" wall and "subdued awakenings" motifs recur purposefully, reweighting isolation into connection. The ending avoids moralizing; the image of standing between heartbeats carries resonance. However, the other-self's line "Time doesn't separate us. It just arranges us differently" edges toward thematic echo, and the protagonist's final smile feels slightly tidy given the weight of the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Kira throughout; perceptual signature (mechanic's pragmatism, sideways memories) is consistent. Diction fits her voice: "obliging sky mechanic," "pages in a book you're not meant to read in order." The other-self's dialogue carries distinct idiom ("icy warmth of someone who'd waited long enough to burn through anger"), and the brief exchange advances understanding without exposition dump. Psychic distance modulates purposefully during the overlay. Free indirect style is clean, and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies effectively ("The nexus hummed to life at twilight's exact angle, its core glowing purple bleeding into gold"). Information density is high; most lines advance character, setting, or concept. However, mild template cadence appears in the setup ("patching hull breaches, calibrating atmospheric filters, maintaining the transport shuttles") and some figurative language clusters without always sharpening the beat ("icy warmth," "subdued awakenings," "mechanically warm"). The phrase "her own figure standing in this same room, but different" is slightly redundant. No major loops or filter-verb stacks touch closure, keeping the score solid.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—time as adjacency visualized through holographic mapping—offers a fresh angle on temporal SF. The mechanic POV and Whisper Moths as electromagnetic complication are specific, not generic. However, the "meeting your other self" beat and the dialogue ("Time doesn't separate us") trend toward familiar metaphysical tropes without transforming them through unique consequences or a non-obvious moral calculus. The piece commits to its premise but resolves conceptually rather than through a choice that redefines stakes, limiting the sense of risk or surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kira appears throughout, and her mechanic role grounds the setting and her access to salvaged equipment. She pulls the lever (agency), adjusts the projector, and makes the final choice to remain still. However, her "obliging" trait is told but not tested; no one requests a repair during the window, so the attribute remains label-only. The character drives the attempt and closure but without a dramatized trade-off between obligation and experiment.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus is harvested (beat 1), hums to life at twilight (beat 2), pulses in rhythm (beat 3), and dims at closure (beat 4). Its twilight-angle specificity constrains the window, and its "purple bleeding into gold" glow charges the overlay. Removing it would collapse the attempt and closure. The nexus enables the holographic mapping and is causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Subdued awakenings" is named once in narration ("This was what subdued awakenings felt like") as a thematic label rather than a stake-shaping force. The protagonist's realization is quiet, fitting the concept, but the concept itself does not constrain tactics or alter options on the page. It functions as a descriptor of closure tone rather than a driver.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Mechanically warm" appears twice (early and at closure), anchoring Kira's comfort and returning at the final moment when she presses her hand to the wall. It shapes her emotional experience but does not constrain an on-page action or trade-off. The attribute enriches setting and tone without altering tactics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Pulling the lever activates the nexus, initiates the holographic projection, and triggers the other-self overlay—three causal beats. Clicking it back to neutral at closure resolves the attempt. The action is specific and irreplaceable; swapping "lever" for "switch" would require minor edits, but the gesture and its mechanical specificity are integral to the mechanic POV and the story's tactile logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Holographic principles are signaled early ("through holographic principles, she'd mapped the nexus's field distortions, creating three-dimensional representations") and shape the attempt by enabling the overlay. The method constrains what Kira can see (adjacencies, not sequences) and is specific to her salvaged equipment. However, the mechanics remain abstract; we see the projection flicker and stabilize but not how the holography translates temporal probability into the other-self image.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The xenobiology research station frames occupation, isolation, and access to salvaged tech. The observation dome, maintenance bay, and Whisper Moths roost provide spatial structure. The station's "mechanically warm" walls anchor sensory experience and recur at closure. However, the setting pressures mainly through the Moths' electromagnetic window rather than through Dr. Chen's lab hierarchy or station protocols, leaving some xenobiology flavor ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Moths' rest window creates real urgency: "the only window she had" and "In moments, the whole colony would wake, and their electromagnetic fields would scatter her readings into noise." The hush brackets the attempt across four beats (setup, lever pull, overlay, dimming) and the stirring Moths at closure signal time expiring. The timeframe tightens tactics and charges the final stillness.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kira's motivation—proving time moves sideways for herself, not for scientific credit—is stated early and drives the lever-pull. The "memories that came to her sideways" and "persistent sense that she was living adjacent to her own life" ground the desire in personal friction. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized through conflicting wants; no competing obligation (e.g., a repair request) tests her commitment during the window.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Icy warmth" is explicitly named once for the other-self's voice and implicitly present in "mechanically warm" and the Moths' "soft thunder." Tone mixes clinical distance (nexus mechanics) with yearning (smiling recognition), modulating across the attempt. However, the tone remains somewhat static—contemplative throughout—without a sharp shift under peak pressure. The final image carries warmth but not the chill of cost.</comment>
