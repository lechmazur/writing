<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Veris's motivation to belong is embodied through specific actions (sitting with Kael, holding Osen, making the sculpture), and her marsh-sculptor background provides concrete skill-transfer. However, the interior journey from isolation to belonging unfolds largely through summary across "months" rather than contradictory impulses dramatized in scene. The final sculpture moment offers a visible act of dedication, but the emotional arc is more narrated than inhabited under pressure. Secondary characters (Kael, Osen, Mira, Tav) apply thematic weight but remain somewhat interchangeable in their shared grief without distinct pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Veris's integration into the community deepens through the shared search ritual, culminating in the sculpture dedication that reweights her belonging from seeking to offering. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (the sculpture as both gift and claim; "belonging was not a destination but a continuous act"), with the cost legible in her months-long vulnerability and the final acknowledgment that the search itself—not its object—matters. The orientation is clean (crystalline orchard, crater, Veris as newcomer). One meaningful deepening occurs when the search becomes the gift, though the "months passed" compression elides the escalation beats that would show tactical shifts.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor are vivid and specific, grounding the community's ritual and Veris's final sculpture in a coherent mineral-alchemy setting. The crater's edge as "cupped palm" and trees that "caught light and fractured it into whispers of color" create a distinct sensory signature. The arbor recurs with purpose (Kael's grief scene, sculpture installation), and the crystalline shards Veris gathers constrain her creative choice, linking setting material to the closure image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the setting's details reflect Veris's sculptor's eye without catalog padding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Veris's grafting onto the community—is signaled early and tightens through the shared search expeditions that require trust ("hold the rope as you descended crater walls"). The sculpture dedication is a meaningful culmination that reweights her position from seeker to contributor, with the cost visible in her months of vulnerability and fierce sympathy. However, the escalation unfolds mostly in summary ("Months passed. They found seventeen new tags") rather than on-page reversals that narrow options or force trades. The final act is protagonist-driven and charges the ending image, satisfying the Accumulative lens, but lacks a second beat of visible tactical shift under immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the search-as-gift structure: belonging is a continuous act of seeking and offering, not arrival. The sculpture dedication ("I dedicate this to the seeking…To the way we've found each other in the looking") risks overt statement but is grounded in the hands-reaching-hands image and the months of embodied trust. Veris's suspicion that "the artist existed partly to be sought, that the searching itself was the gift" reweights the Cartographer motif without closing ambiguity. The final image of the prismatic sculpture and the promise to "seek it together" offers a resonant, non-literal answer. No platitudes or moralizing in the final beat, and the thematic question (what does grafting onto community require?) is answered through concrete action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable throughout, filtered through Veris's sculptor's perception ("trees grown from some mineral alchemy that caught light"). Diction is controlled and lyric ("hunger that had no name in any surviving tongue," "luminescent and beautiful and endless"), though it occasionally leans toward elevated register ("the polite distance of strangers," "their collective mystery") that can feel slightly writerly. Dialogue is sparse but functional and age-appropriate (Kael's "My mother's been gone three seasons"). The perceptual signature is consistent (marsh-sculptor noticing light, weaving, hands), and the voice modulates appropriately from isolation to connection. Psychic distance tightens in the final beats without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative language is generally controlled ("crater's edge held the orchard like a cupped palm," "grief and offered her own: the smell of marsh mint"). Information density is high in the opening and closing beats. However, some phrases carry stock metaphor or slight overwriting: "boldly sympathetic in a way that invited refusal but offered presence" is abstract; "luminescent and beautiful and endless as the search itself" stacks modifiers at closure without adding precision. The final paragraph's "Somewhere beyond the crater's rim, a new tag waited to be found" risks sentimentality but remains just anchored enough in the search ritual. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs; clarity is maintained throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The combination of post-apocalyptic fragmented language, crystalline orchard, and elusive street artist is specific and coheres well. The marsh-sculptor skillset transferring to crystal-weaving is a fresh detail that earns the final sculpture. However, the core emotional arc—outsider seeks belonging through shared ritual, culminates in offering a gift—is a familiar template, and the Cartographer remains a somewhat convenient MacGuffin (never found, symbolically perfect). The "luminescent ache" tone and the search-as-gift insight are executed with care but not radically transformed. The story commits fully to its premise and avoids the safety middle, yet the emotional truth, while specific, does not quite surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Veris as marsh-reed sculptor appears early and her weaving skill enables the final sculpture, a key decision that redefines her community position. The craft particularizes her perception and constrains her creative method (crystalline shards woven with reed techniques). However, her primary choices—sitting with Kael, joining the search—are sympathetic gestures not uniquely tied to sculptor identity. The sculptor attribute charges the closure but does not shape middle tactics distinctly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The obsidian arbor appears in two distinct beats: Kael crying beneath it, and the sculpture hung from it at closure. The final installation reweights the arbor from grief-site to communal monument, and its "glimmering frame" and "latticed bones" provide vivid physical anchors. However, the arbor does not constrain choice or alter tactics; it functions primarily as a symbolic location. The closure reprise is purposeful but not causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Webs of kinship" is explicitly named and operationalized: the shared search requires trust (holding ropes, remembering paths), and Veris's sculpture depicts "hands reaching toward hands, a web of interlocked fingers." The concept shapes her motivation, the search structure, and the final offering. It drives at least two beats (joining the search, dedicating the sculpture) and is causally active in the closure image, which literalizes kinship as interlocking hands.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Boldly sympathetic" is demonstrated when Veris sits with Kael ("invited refusal but offered presence") and later when she "held Osen when he wept, challenged Mira's self-doubt with honest anger." The trait enables her entry into the community and differentiates her approach. However, it is partly label-reliant ("boldly sympathetic" is told mid-scene) and does not visibly foreclose an alternate path or incur a specific cost tied to the boldness itself. It shapes one key turn (Kael's trust) but lacks friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The "dedicate" action is the structural hinge: Veris's sculpture dedication redefines her from seeker to contributor and crystallizes the search-as-gift theme. The dedication speech and the hanging of the sculpture are dramatized on the page, and the moment triggers community acceptance ("Kael took her hand. Osen stood at her shoulder"). Removing this action would collapse the closure. The dedication is causally prepared by months of search and her sculptor skill, and it carries visible relational cost (vulnerability, public offering).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The shared search for the Cartographer's tags is introduced early (Kael's mother gone "looking for the Cartographer"), frames the middle expeditions (finding seventeen tags, trusting others), and is reaffirmed at closure ("in the morning, they would seek it together"). The method shapes trust-building tactics and the realization that seeking itself is the gift. However, the mechanics of the search are summarized rather than shown in tactical detail, and the Cartographer is never found, limiting causal pressure. The search is essential to the theme but somewhat abstract in execution.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and crater edge are established immediately and constrain Veris's material choice (fallen crystalline shards for the sculpture). The setting's mineral-alchemy logic is consistent, and the arbor at the crater's lip provides a symbolic and physical anchor for two beats. The orchard community and its geography shape the search expeditions. The setting is more than postcard; it supplies resources and frames the final image, though it does not alter tactics under immediate pressure in a middle beat.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Beyond the murmur of lost languages" establishes a post-collapse timeframe and motivates the fragmented speech ("old words whose meanings had slipped away"). The temporal setting colors the community's search for meaning through the Cartographer's symbols. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—months pass in summary without deadline pressure—and the "time beyond" functions more as atmospheric backdrop than as a tactical constraint. It enriches tone but does not alter the pace or force choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Veris's desire to "graft herself onto this community the way orchardists grafted branches—to become not a visitor but a vital limb" is introduced early and dramatized through concrete choices: sitting with Kael, joining expeditions, creating the sculpture. The metaphor recurs and is tested ("the orchard folk held her at the polite distance of strangers until…"). The final realization ("belonging was not a destination but a continuous act") reprices the graft metaphor with visible cost (months of vulnerability, public offering). The motivation drives the arc and is causally resolved.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Luminescent ache" is embodied in the crystalline light-play, Veris's "hunger that had no name," and the closing line ("The ache of connection shone through her, luminescent and beautiful and endless"). Tone modulates from solitary grief to shared searching to communal offering, maintaining a coherent elegiac-hopeful register. The final image of the prismatic sculpture and Kael's hand-taking charges the ache with beauty and cost. The tone is consistent across beats, though the closing phrase "luminescent and beautiful and endless" risks over-statement.</comment>
