<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sev's motivation is clear and embodied through the half-mask's physical constraint and the memory-loss scars, creating a credible cost structure. The "strangely honest" trait drives concrete choices ("They never are") but remains somewhat label-dependent rather than fully dramatized through contradictory impulses in peak moments. Mahl functions primarily as exposition delivery rather than applying immediate pressure. The final renunciation (removing the mask, revealing scars) feels earned by prior causality, though the internal conflict between preservation duty and personal cost could be more contradictory and present simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Earned Stasis with visible cost (the scarred tissue, memory loss mapped physically) and the pavilion's satisfied silence reconfigures the opening murmur into rest. The piece follows a clear Causal lens: prophet triggers parapet → parapet movement signals decay → Sev must consecrate before time runs out. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraphs. One meaningful tightening occurs when the kinetic parapet breaches, forcing the final consecration. The cost is legible in Sev's unmasking and the tissue damage, though the exact sentence showing memory-price payment in this specific ritual could be sharper.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The murmuring pavilion's interior "folding impossibly" and the kinetic parapet rising "like teeth from the sand" create vivid spatial anchors that constrain Sev's timeline and tactics. The salt circle and speaking stones function as tools in the consecration ritual. The half-mask serves as embodied micro-setting, forcing "the brain to reconcile two ways of seeing" and directly enabling the threshold work. Sensory detail (murmurs layering, sand shifting against wind) is filtered through Sev's peripheral awareness and professional lens. The dunes and pavilion charge the final image when the parapet forms its protective ring.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve echoes before decay) is signaled early and tightens when the parapet begins moving, creating a legible countdown. The meaningful escalation occurs when Sev commits to the consecration knowing the memory-price, then dramatizes the ritual under time pressure. Agency is clear: Sev's decision to create the clearing and the physical act of completing it forecloses the path of walking away. The cost (removing the mask, revealing scars from "previous consecrations") is visible on the page. No antagonist is required; the decaying echoes and rising parapet provide coherent pressure under the Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme (wisdom preservation across time, the cost of being a threshold-keeper) emerges through Sev's scarred face, the ritual's mechanics, and the prophet's purpose rather than direct statement. The final quiet and Sev's unmasking offer a resonant answer to "why preserve what belongs to the old world" without moralizing. The half-mask and peripheral awareness function as recurring images that shift from tool to revealed cost. "Even endings felt like beginnings" flirts with theme-statement but is anchored to the specific situation (the parapet standing guard, the silence after millennia of murmurs). The piece resists simplistic answers, though Mahl's question "Why do you do this?" invites a slightly expository response.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with consistent psychic distance and perceptual signature (peripheral awareness, sideways knowing). Sev's diction stays grounded in ritualist idiom ("conjured clearings," "whisperfield calm") without register drift. The dialogue between Sev and Mahl is spare, goal-driven, and carries subtext ("They never are" admits systemic unreadiness without elaboration). Free indirect style is clean; filter verbs ("understood," "felt") are voice-motivated and don't dull immediacy. The prose rhythm modulates appropriately, tightening during the ritual and breathing in the final paragraph's reflection. No head-hopping or unearned certainty about off-stage events.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence openings vary and information density is high; most lines do double duty (e.g., "The half-mask covering the left side of their face caught the early light—porcelain white against sun-darkened skin—marking them as one who walked between revelation and interpretation" anchors appearance, status, and thematic role in one move). The ritualist terminology ("kinetic parapet," "whisperfield calm," "conjured clearing") is specific and consistent. Minor scaffold appears in "This was what Sev had come to preserve: not the knowledge itself, but its echo" which slightly restates the opening's premise. A few filter-verb stacks in expository passages ("understood this," "calculating time," "feeling through peripheral awareness") accumulate but don't obscure closure. One paraphrase near the ending: "Not empty silence, but the satisfied quiet of purpose achieved" closely echoes the prior sentence's content.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The combination of half-masked threshold-walker, living architecture (murmuring pavilion, kinetic parapet), and memory-as-payment creates a fresh synthesis that avoids pure template fantasy. "Peripheral awareness" as a method and "consecrate through holding both inside/outside simultaneously" transform familiar mystic-ritual tropes through specific mechanics tied to the mask's function. The "kinetic parapet" rising after three thousand years to protect decaying wisdom offers a non-obvious escalation trigger. Risk-taking in the compressed timeline and the ritualist jargon layer ("whisperfield calm," "conjured clearing") commit fully to the premise without retreat. The emotional truth of voluntary memory sacrifice for future strangers grounds the speculative elements. Proximity check: no close echoes of famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sev appears in paragraph one, makes the key decision to perform the consecration (middle), and executes it at closure. The choice to remove the half-mask in the final sequence reweights the opening image with visible cost. Two distinct beats: arrival/assessment and the ritual itself. Causal pressure: Sev's threshold-walking ability enables the clearing creation; without this character the story fails. Closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The kinetic parapet is mentioned in beat one ("I felt it from twenty leagues away"), discussed in beat two (Mahl's disbelief, Sev's explanation of the failsafe), and breaches the surface at closure to form the protective ring. Three beats, setup early, closure participation clear. However, the parapet is primarily reactive (it moves because the prophet triggered it) rather than manipulated by Sev; it constrains the timeline but Sev does not handle or use it directly. The protective ring at the end charges the final image but feels more like environmental consequence than tool.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Conjured clearings frame the story's stakes in paragraph one, are explained mechanically ("an open space called into being through will and ritual") in beat two, and the act of creating one constitutes the climax. The concept shapes tactics: Sev needs salt circle and speaking stones, must stand at the threshold, speaks words "that existed only as vibration." The clearing's successful stabilization is the decisive change. Cost is explicit: "a portion of their own memories given in exchange." Three beats, high causal pressure, closure-defining. The concept is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Strangely honest" appears in the second paragraph and enables one on-page moment: Sev's line "They never are" which surprises neither character. The trait is labeled ("Line walkers earned their title by speaking what others circled around") rather than demonstrated through multiple conflicted choices. It does not constrain the consecration decision or reappear with reweighted meaning at closure. Setup present, one functional beat, but swappable (a "forthright" or "blunt" line walker would work with minor edits). Mid-band functional role without indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Consecration is Sev's purpose from the opening, the method is detailed in the middle (salt circle, speaking stones, threshold stance), and the act of consecrating the clearing is the story's climax. The final paragraph shows Sev "consecrating the threshold between what had been and what would come" as the closing image. Three beats, high specificity (the ritual's mechanics matter and are irreplaceable), and the story's logic collapses without this exact action. Cost linkage strong: consecration requires memory sacrifice. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Peripheral awareness" is named in paragraph two as "that sideways knowing," attributed to "decades of walking the lines," and shown tracking the parapet's progress ("Sev's peripheral awareness tracked the kinetic parapet's grinding progress"). It reappears in the final paragraph: "feeling through peripheral awareness the gentle hum of preserved wisdom." Setup early, constrains one middle choice (time calculation), and charges the ending image. However, the mechanics are more told than demonstrated (we don't see Sev fail at direct perception and succeed at sideways knowing). Two beats, functional but the method could be replaced with "heightened sense" or "intuitive feel" without structural collapse.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The murmuring pavilion frames the opening, its changing tone signals the prophet's effect, its "layered shadows" produce Mahl, its interior space "folded impossibly" creates the setting for the ritual, and its "satisfied quiet" closes the story. The murmurs condense into the conjured clearing, making the pavilion both container and content. Three or more beats, high closure linkage. The pavilion's murmurs are the echoes Sev must preserve; removing this setting breaks the story's logic. Environment constrains choice (the decay forces the timeline) and supplies the resource (the echoes themselves).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the prophet" is established in the opening ("fourth morning after the prophet") and the prophet's arrival triggers the parapet cycle, but the prophet never appears on-page and the past-tense framing reduces urgency. The countdown (parapet rising, "hours, perhaps") tightens the middle decision but elapsed time during the ritual is vague. Two gates (setup, middle constraint) but the timeframe is more backdrop than live pressure. A "before the parapet fully rises" frame would be swappable with similar tension.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to preserve the echo of wisdom" is dramatized in Sev's opening walk, Mahl's challenge ("The old wisdom belongs to the old world"), and Sev's response anchored in specific duty rather than abstraction. The memory-cost creates friction: Sev wants to preserve but must sacrifice self to do so. This want-versus-price tension drives the consecration choice. Three beats (arrival, justification, execution), and the final unmasking reveals the accumulated cost of this recurring motivation. The desire is irreplaceable (a treasure-hunter or scholar would not pay this price).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Whisperfield calm" is named in the ritual scene, described as "pervading the pavilion," and the final paragraph closes with "In the whisperfield calm, even endings felt like beginnings." The tone is coherent through the turns (no jarring tonal breaks) and modulates subtly (murmurs fall to "a hush of anticipation" during the ritual, then "satisfied quiet"). Setup in the first third, return at closure. However, the tonal register remains relatively static; peak pressure (Sev's knees trembling) does not disrupt the calm in a way that then restores it with new charge. Functional reprise with closure linkage, but the tone does not reweight the stake as sharply as a more dynamic modulation would.</comment>
