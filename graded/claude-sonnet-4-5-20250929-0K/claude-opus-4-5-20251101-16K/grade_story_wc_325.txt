<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's contradictory nature as a claustrophobic spelunker is embodied through physical reactions ("constriction in her chest," shallow breath) and her renunciation is earned by prior causality. Internal conflict operates simultaneously in the descent sequence where fear and duty co-exist. The final choice to release the recordings carries visible cost—she endured terror on behalf of the dead—but some interiority leans slightly abstract ("tracked invisible things" as gift/curse reads more declarative than enacted in micro-choices under duress).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mira's endurance forecloses retreat and the final image reweights her gift with visible cost. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The causal lens holds—descent because of the codex discovery, download completion forces ascent because tide returns—and one meaningful tightening (water rising) narrows options. A small causality slip: the "detector" appears suddenly calibrated to "signal ghosts" without prior setup of what it measures or how she built it from salvaged parts.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The facility's tidal phase transitions constrain Mira's timeline and charge the final image ("ocean exhaled behind her"). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: water stains at chest height, frost on metal, the hum of old cables. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly through corridors and the central monitoring room. The detector and cables function as micro-setting objects that drive choice. One minor note: "perpetual twilight" and "caught between tidal changes" offer vivid atmosphere but the exact visual state during her descent could be sharper.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake—recovering the unremembered researchers' final messages—is signaled early and tightens when the tide turns, forcing faster work. Mira's agency (descent, download, ascent under rising water) forecloses passivity with visible cost (terror endured). One meaningful pressure point: water at ankles accelerates the download beat. The stakes remain largely internal and atmospheric; external opposition is environmental rather than dramatized conflict, which fits the lens but limits escalation texture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—standing by the invisible and forgotten—emerges through Mira's descent and the researchers' fidelity to their posts. The final image ("someone who tracked invisible things because the invisible still mattered") offers resonance without overt moralizing. Gold-flecked names and the codex anchor the theme in concrete particulars. However, the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("that was the only gift she could offer") that risks articulating what the image already charged, and "crashing hush" recurs as concept more than lived sensory paradox.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV distance is stable; Mira's perceptual signature filters detail through her claustrophobia and her gift for tracking invisible things. Diction fits her technical expertise and solitary mission. Purposeful compression ("the evacuation that wasn't, the official silence") serves voice and momentum. One register slip: "electromagnetic residue, perhaps, or the faint hum" mid-descent reads slightly over-articulate for crisis conditions, and "crashing hush filled the chamber—the paradox of powerful silence, the roar of absence" stacks abstractions where concrete sensory contradiction would sharpen the effect.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and propulsion is strong; most sentences advance character or atmosphere. Information density is high in the opening exposition and descent sequence. A paraphrase loop appears: "tracked invisible things" recurs as concept in multiple beats without evolving imagery. Minor template cadence: "She passed laboratories... Bunk rooms... A photograph..." list-structure at mid-story. "Crashing hush... paradox of powerful silence... roar of absence" in one beat stacks near-synonyms. No clarity break at closure; artifacts are mid-story only, so deduction remains modest.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of claustrophobic spelunker, undersea cables as communication veins, and tidal phase transitions offers a fresh frame. The codex with gold-flecked names hidden in a medieval archive is a specific, non-obvious anchor. Emotional truth in Mira's terror and fidelity feels earned. However, the "forgotten research facility flooded and abandoned" premise echoes familiar lost-station templates; transformation comes more from Mira's contradictory nature than from world-logic surprise. The detector's sudden introduction and capabilities feel convenient rather than inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's claustrophobia creates friction in her descent choice, and her decision to complete the download as water rises alters tactics (working faster). Present in setup (opening beat), middle (counting rungs to manage panic), and ending (emerging gasping). Specific cost: she endures terror to honor the unremembered. Swappability is low—remove her phobia and the internal conflict flattens. One beat shy of indispensable; her choices follow from the trait but the escalation curve could lean harder into panic-driven micro-decisions.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The codex appears in setup (archive discovery with gold-flecked names), middle (reading names aloud in bunk rooms), and ending (clutching it at the surface). It frames the mission and returns with slight reweighting: from memorial object to witness carried back. However, the "gold fleck illuminations" are described but not causally active—no on-page moment where the flecks guide choice, alter light, or impose cost beyond being a mnemonic. Present across beats but function remains largely atmospheric rather than pressure-driving.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Undersea cables shape stakes (the researchers monitored global communication) and supply the mechanism for message recovery (cables still hum, cache still records). Present in setup (cables made landfall, facility's original purpose), middle (cables converge at monitoring room), and ending (cables carry voices). Specific mechanics: download from the message cache depends on cables' residual current. Remove cables and the retrieval logic collapses. One step from indispensable: the concept drives two beats and closure participation, though the "electromagnetic residue" Mira tracks is asserted more than demonstrated.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Tracks invisible things" is Mira's stated gift, enabling her to follow "electromagnetic residue" and "signal ghosts" to the cache. Present in setup, invoked in the descent, and thematically charged at closure ("tracked invisible things because the invisible still mattered"). However, the trait is largely told rather than shown in causally distinct beats—no on-page moment where tracking alters a navigational choice or reveals hidden passage. Cost is more thematic than tactical. Functional role in one key turn (finding the cache) but the mechanics remain abstract.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The return structures the entire second half: water rises, forcing ascent; Mira emerges with the recordings, fulfilling the mission. Setup (descent), development (download under time pressure), payoff (climbing as facility floods). The action is causally irreplaceable—no return means no closure. Visible cost: terror endured, physical exertion. The return is the spine of escalation and resolution. One nuance: the ascent itself is compressed into a single sentence ("climbing as the facility transitioned"), so while essential, the beat could carry more tactical texture.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Phase transitions" (solid floors becoming pools, frozen pipes thawing, the facility's daily drowning) constrain Mira's six-hour window and create urgency. Present in setup ("perpetual twilight, caught between tidal changes"), development (water seeping through fractures), and payoff (facility transitions from air to sea). Mechanics matter: the tide's turn forces her to work faster and then flee. Remove phase transitions and the time pressure collapses. Strong causal role across beats. One limitation: the exact mechanics (why six hours, how she timed entry) are asserted rather than shown through prior observation or failed attempts.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Station Eleven (the forgotten research facility) supplies all spatial pressure: carved stone passage, rusted hatch, laboratories, bunk rooms, central monitoring room. Setup (built into cliffside, flooded thirty-seven years prior), development (narrowing corridors, water stains, equipment as "bones"), payoff (ocean reclaims it). The facility's layout and state constrain her descent and retrieval. Micro-setting objects (hatch, ladder, detector, cables) drive choices. Remove this exact setting and the retrieval mission, tidal constraint, and closure image all break. Essential across beats and indispensable to closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The tidal six-hour window is stated early and drives urgency: "For six hours, seawater retreated... For six hours, it returned." Development shows water beginning to seep and reaching her ankles, accelerating the download. Payoff: she ascends as the tide completes its turn. The timeframe constrains tactics and shapes the final image. However, the exact elapsed time on-page is untracked—no running clock or countdown that makes minutes matter. Present in setup/development/payoff with moderate causal pressure, but the live-ticking urgency remains more asserted than counted.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mira's motivation—to stand by the unremembered—is dramatized through her choice to descend despite claustrophobia, read names aloud, and complete the download under rising water. Setup (codex discovery, intent to release recordings), development (honoring each researcher by name), payoff ("stood by them in return"). Friction between desire (remembrance) and cost (terror) is visible. The final paragraph articulates the motivation slightly too directly ("the only gift she could offer"), but the prior beats earn it through enacted choices. Strong role in escalation and closure, one step shy of indispensable due to late summary.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Crashing hush" as tone descriptor appears in setup ("powerful silence") and payoff ("hush settled over everything, crashing into silence"). The paradox of sound/silence charges the final image and reflects the researchers' absent presence. However, "crashing hush" functions more as thematic label than modulated sensory experience—diction asserts the paradox rather than enacting it through contradictory sound details. Coherent across the piece and purposeful at closure, but ornamental in execution. Functional role with lyric reprise; one grade shy of essentiality due to abstract treatment.</comment>
