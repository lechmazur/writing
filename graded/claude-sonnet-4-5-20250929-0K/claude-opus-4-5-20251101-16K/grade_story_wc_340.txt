<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's inquisitiveness is embodied through concrete choices—finding the diary, wearing the goggles, chasing scattered light—rather than told. Her relationship to the deceased mother and Captain Aldric gains weight through discovered diary entries that reveal lineage. The final beat earns her smile through accumulated understanding rather than convenience, though the emotional progression from grief to gladness lands quickly. Internal contradiction is present but light: curiosity drives her forward while loss anchors her.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens holds: the elevator's rise structures ten beats that deepen Mira's understanding through fragmented diary reveals, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (permission to hold sorrow and gladness simultaneously). Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening beat. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost—she gains permission but the mother remains lost—and the final image reweights prior material without stating a moral. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length, and the cost is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The icebound spire's elevator shaft channels scattered light through ice crystals, directly enabling the diary decryption—environment constrains and enables the central discovery. The tenth-floor arrival frames the ending image with gold and rose light painting the cloud sea below. Sensory detail (cold brass, rattling cage, frosted windows, prismatic ribbons) is selective and purpose-driven. The goggles and light function as micro-setting that charges the final beat, meeting the 9+ gate test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—seeking understanding beneath loss—is signaled early and tightens through the elevator climb as diary entries accumulate pressure. Mira's agency is attention and pursuit; she chooses to wear the goggles, chase the light, and absorb Aldric's final lesson. The ending forecloses simple grief with a trade-off: she accepts simultaneous sorrow and gladness, a renunciation of emotional tidiness with visible cost. One meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens is sufficient and the cost is unmistakable.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme—joy beneath anguish—emerges from Aldric's diary particulars (honeyed tea, violet sunsets, terrible jokes) rather than abstraction. The final image offers a non-literal answer: Mira holding "sorrow and gladness in the same trembling hands" without stating a moral. Recurring motifs (light through ice, the goggles, the captain's final gift) reweight prior material at closure. No thematic echo or explain-everything ending; the captain's wisdom is earned through concrete experience and the piece invites reflection without confusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single-POV third limited with stable distance and distinct perceptual signature: Mira notices through a servant's lens (cleaning quarters, climbing floors, reading carelessly left letters). Narrative certainty matches her knowledge; inferences read as inferences. Diary passages shift register appropriately, filtered through rose-tinted goggles. Psychic distance modulates purposefully at emotional peaks (throat tightens, hands tremble). One purposeful elision—the mother's accident details—serves the closure by keeping focus on present discovery rather than backstory.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops or scaffold. Information density is high: most sentences advance discovery, emotion, or thematic weight. Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual pulse matched to the elevator's climb. Figurative language (pages "unfold like wings," light "scattered into prismatic ribbons") is purposeful and coherent. The floor-by-floor structure imposes clean segmentation without mechanical repetition. Opening anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by image that recharges earlier motifs with no summary.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The elevator-as-frame and light-decryption mechanism offer a fresh synthesis of familiar grief-and-discovery material. Specificity (rose-tinted navigation goggles, invisible ink revealed by refracted ice light, a servant's quiet observation) transforms the premise beyond template. The ending resists tidy resolution: Mira's smile coexists with permanent loss, earning emotional truth. Minor deduction for the encrypted-diary trope's proximity to common puzzle-box narratives, though the execution through accumulated fragments and the captain's voice distinction lift it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's servant role frames her access (cleaning Aldric's quarters, finding the diary beneath floorboards) and her inquisitive observation drives every turn. She chooses to wear the goggles, chase the light, and internalize Aldric's lesson. Her decisions alter tactics across multiple beats and shape the closure image directly. Early signal, beat involvement across all ten floors, causal pressure, and closure linkage all present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The goggles appear in beats 1 (found), 5 (lifted to eyes), 6 (filter light), 9 (removed and pressed to page), establishing narrative necessity. Their rose-tinted lenses enable decryption by filtering refracted light, a unique property that cannot be swapped. They carry lineage weight (mother's, then Aldric's) and charge the closure by enabling the final gift. Causal pressure, closure linkage, specificity, and irreplaceability all strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The encrypted diary is discovered in beat 1, structures all ten floors of revelation, and delivers Aldric's final lesson that reweights Mira's grief. The encryption changes tactics: she must use goggles and scattered light to decode it. The diary's content directly shapes the closure permission. Early signal, beat involvement, causal pressure, closure linkage, and cost connection (the lesson enables her acceptance of dual emotions) all present.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Warmly inquisitive" is embodied through concrete actions: asking questions about everything, lingering over letters and ledgers, pursuing the diary's meaning despite encryption. The trait enables discovery (she found the hidden journal because she cleaned thoroughly and noticed) and constrains her path (she cannot help herself; curiosity compels the climb). It shapes multiple beats and connects to closure, though the cost of curiosity itself is oblique.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Unfold" appears literally as Mira opens the diary ("opened the diary carefully, watching the pages unfold like wings") and metaphorically as understanding unfolds across the climb. The action is repeated with purpose: each floor reveals new text as light shifts. It redefines options by transforming illegible symbols into readable passages. Beat involvement, causal pressure, and closure linkage present, though swappable with "open" or "reveal" in some uses.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Scattered light is signaled in beat 5 ("dawn light began to pierce the ice"), mechanically explained in beat 6 ("Fractured by ice crystals... scattered into prismatic ribbons"), and enables decryption by transforming invisible ink. The method is irreplaceable: only this specific interaction of light, ice, and goggles makes text visible. It shapes Mira's attempts (she must chase the moving light) and charges the ending image. High specificity, causal pressure, and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The icebound spire supplies the ice crystals that scatter light for decryption and frames the ending with the cloud sea below where the mother's airship rests. The elevator shaft's ice-crusted walls are essential to the discovery mechanism. The setting constrains choices (Mira must ride the elevator during dawn) and charges the final image (gold and rose light, infinite cloud sea). Setup, development, and payoff all present with strong causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The ten-floor climb structures every beat with precise tracking (second, third, fourth... tenth floor markers). Time tightens decisions: light shifts as the elevator ascends, creating a narrow window for decryption. The climb's rhythm paces revelation and builds pressure toward the tenth-floor arrival. The timeframe is irreplaceable—static reading would collapse the discovery arc. Causal pressure, closure linkage, beat involvement across all ten segments, and high specificity present.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>The motivation is dramatized through Mira's pursuit of the diary's meaning despite encryption, embodied in her trembling hands and tightening throat as she absorbs loss after loss. It conflicts with grief (she misses her mother, will always miss her) yet the ending earns simultaneous gladness through accumulated understanding. The motivation shapes all beats and delivers the closure image directly: holding sorrow and gladness together. Friction, cost, causal pressure, and closure linkage all strong.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Affectionate detachment is established early ("loved it the way one loves a childhood home—completely, but from a distance") and modulates under pressure: clinical observation at floor 4, emotional tightening at floors 6-7, culminating in "she was also smiling" at closure. Tone charges the final image by enabling Mira to hold contradictory emotions without collapse. The detachment allows observation; the affection enables acceptance. Coherent through turns with purposeful modulation, though one additional mid-climb tonal test would strengthen.</comment>
