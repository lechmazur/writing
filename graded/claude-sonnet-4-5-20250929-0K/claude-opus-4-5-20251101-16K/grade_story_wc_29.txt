<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and specific—she's driven to expose the tricksters—and her cautious hope and technical competence feel character-particular. The interior work is mostly concrete ("stomach drop," hands trembling), though the phrase "cautiously hopeful" becomes a label rather than embodied contradiction in the climactic beat. Internal conflict appears as memory of Okonkwo's optimism versus her present grimness, but the final choice to increase amplitude lacks a visible tradeoff or foreclosed path; she smiles grimly and settles in, which reads as endurance without cost. The final image crystallizes stance but doesn't show what she's sacrificed or what option she's closed off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when early and maintains a causal chain: Mira hears convergence patterns → activates subsonic transmitter → trickster signal reorganizes → she increases amplitude. The closure is a Charged Poise/Resonant Reconfiguration: the final image ("one interpreter refused to look away") crystallizes her stance with the game ongoing, reconfiguring the opening premise of passive listening into active contest. Cost is conceptually present (she's now a target, "the newest power play"), but the felt or visible price at the ending beat is oblique—no concrete loss or foreclosed option appears on the page in the final paragraph. The drive lens reads Causal-Situational Hybrid (motivated escalation into a crystallized stance); it holds without contradiction, though the cost could be more immediate.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The basement studio is anchored early with vivid particulars (headphones, charts pinned across walls, ancient broadcast array) and constrains Mira's options—she works in secret, modifies equipment over months, and the array's subsonic capability enables her tactic. The astronomical charts function as micro-setting: they map communication windows and she consults them "one final time" before acting, so they guide choice. The university trembling above supplies social pressure. However, the final image ("charts on her walls flutter as if touched by wind") is metaphorical rather than a concrete constraint on her next move, so the setting's role at closure is atmospheric rather than tactical. Spatial choreography and sensory detail are clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>One dominant stake—expose the false signal and prove manipulation—is signaled early. Pressure escalates through Mira's agency: she flips the switch, the trickster responds with words, she increases amplitude. The trickster's reorganization into "CLEVER LITTLE SIGNAL READER" is a meaningful reversal that narrows options (passive exposure is no longer possible; she's now in direct contest). The final image reconfigures the game into an ongoing duel with stakes made legible ("humanity had a player who understood"). Cost is conceptually present (she's now a known opponent, the game is "far from over"), but no on-page forfeiture or visible sacrifice appears in the closing beat—no stamina limit, no burned bridge, no immediate price paid. The escalation is driven by protagonist choice under a Causal-Situational lens and the tightening is clear, but the cost at closure remains felt rather than shown.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from events: humanity's need to understand versus cosmic manipulation, passivity versus active engagement, the cost of playing games whose rules you don't fully know. The piece resists moralizing; Mira's stance is earned through her months of secret work and the trickster's immediate response. The final image—"you had to talk back"—answers the central question (how to outwit tricksters) through action rather than statement, and the line "The stars watched. The signals danced" offers resonant ambiguity without confusion. "Cautiously hopeful" recurs as a touchstone, reweighted from Okonkwo's optimism to Mira's grim resolve. No thematic echo or label-speak in the final paragraph. The ending reweights prior material (listening alone was never enough) without stating a moral, achieving non-literal resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled; no head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (tighter during the convergence, pulling back for context on the department fracture). Diction is mostly character-consistent ("Cosmic tricksters," "fortress," "stomach drop"), though "seeding just enough genuine information among the lies" and "humanity reaching out with one hand while the other formed a fist" drift slightly toward summary register. The trickster's voice ("CLEVER LITTLE SIGNAL READER. WE WONDERED WHEN YOU'D PLAY") is distinct and goal-driven. Mira's perceptual signature (she notices patterns, frequencies, convergence windows) is specific. One brief slip: "felt her stomach drop" is filter-verb usage that's acceptable here as voice-motivated economy, but "watched the transmission go out" in the same context is less immediate. Rhythmic control under pressure is solid; sentence lengths tighten during the broadcast sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, conflict, or world. Rhythm varies naturally, with shorter sentences during the broadcast sequence accelerating momentum. No paraphrase loops or scaffold. Minor issues: "The tricksters wanted exactly this. Division. Confusion" is a fragment stack that works for emphasis but borders on overwriting. "Something that felt almost amused" uses a filter construction where "amused" could be more direct. The phrase "Humanity reaching out with one hand while the other formed a fist" is a stock metaphor that reads generic. "The charts on her walls flutter as if touched by wind" is figurative language in a high-pressure beat that doesn't add concrete information. Sentence openings vary; paragraph cuts are clean. Grammar and tense are consistent. No loops, but the cumulative figurative density in the climax (flutter, dance, watch) nudges toward overwriting without crossing into opacity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—cosmic signals as deliberate manipulation, a radio-station interpreter fighting back with subsonic frequencies—offers a fresh angle on first-contact narratives. The detail is specific (subsonic interruption, convergence windows, modified broadcast array) and tied to character competence. The turn (trickster responds playfully rather than being simply exposed) feels earned and reweights the stakes from revelation to ongoing contest. However, the "cosmic trickster" concept and the fractured-department conflict are familiar genre furniture, and the piece doesn't transform them beyond executing competently. The line "humanity had a player who understood" and "The stars watched. The signals danced" are evocative but not surprising in hindsight. The synthesis is specific enough to avoid derivative penalties, but the final image doesn't offer a non-obvious inflection that makes the whole feel inevitable. Risk-taking is modest; the piece commits fully to its premise without bold structural choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira (celestial signal interpreter) makes every key decision: she activates the transmitter, increases amplitude when the trickster responds, and refuses to look away. Her professional skill (distinguishing patterns, modifying equipment) enables her tactics. The role is causally indispensable; removing "interpreter" would collapse the logic. Present in setup (first paragraph), middle (months of secret work), and closure (she talks back). Her choices drive all three beats of escalation. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Astronomical charts appear in the opening (pinned across walls, mapping communication windows), are consulted "one final time" before she acts (middle choice constraint), and flutter in the climax. Two beats with evolving function: first as reference, then as physical response to the subsonic pulse. The flutter is metaphorical rather than tactical—it doesn't alter her next move—so closure participation is atmospheric. Early signal, beat involvement, but swappable with "monitor screens" or similar. Lyric reprise (walls → flutter) reweights slightly but doesn't impose cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Power plays" frames the university conflict (Harrison's faction seizing the observatory, department fracture) and the tricksters' manipulation, and the final paragraph names "the newest power play." The concept shapes stakes (Mira must counter both human and cosmic manipulation) and her tactic (interfering to expose the false signal is itself a power move). Present in setup and closure; middle development is implicit in her months of secret work. However, the concept is more thematic label than unique tactical constraint—"manipulation" or "contest" would function identically. One causal beat (her broadcast is a counter-move), but the specificity of "power plays" doesn't drive irreplaceable choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Cautiously hopeful" is named twice: Okonkwo's stance in memory and Mira's self-reminder during the broadcast. The trait enables her to continue increasing amplitude despite the trickster's response, but it's mostly a label rather than a constraint with visible cost. The final image (grim smile, settling in for a long night) shows determination but doesn't reveal a tradeoff between caution and hope. Present in setup (Okonkwo's optimism) and middle (Mira's reminder), but closure participation is oblique. The attribute colors her stance but doesn't foreclose an option or impose a tactical price on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Interfere" is the story's spine: Mira's goal is stated ("It was time to interfere"), she flips the switch to scramble the signal, and when the trickster adapts she increases interference. All three major turns trace to this action. The verb is specific and irreplaceable—"listen," "observe," or "respond" would not capture the active disruption. Present in setup (months of modification to enable interference), middle (the broadcast begins), and closure (she refuses to stop). Strong causal pressure; the action redefines the human-trickster relationship from passive to active. Cost connection is conceptual (she's now a target) but clear.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Subsonic frequencies are introduced early ("through subsonic frequencies, Mira had discovered, the tricksters' signals could be interrupted"), enable her tactic (the modified array broadcasts subsonic pulses), and the climax hinges on increasing amplitude. The method is specific—audible radio wouldn't work, and the mechanics (scrambling signals to reveal artificial seams) shape her approach. Present in setup, executed in middle, and drives closure escalation. Not swappable; removing "subsonic" would require inventing a different technical lever. However, the method is explained rather than demonstrated with sensory detail, so its mechanics remain abstract. Two beats with strong causal linkage and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The university radio station (WKUX basement studio) is her "fortress," supplies the modified broadcast array, and provides cover (people think she's just listening). The setting enables her secret work and offers the technical resource she needs. Present in setup, middle (months of modification), and closure (she's still there at midnight). However, the setting is mostly functional backdrop; it doesn't pressure her final choice or constrain tactics at the ending beat. The university trembling above adds social pressure, but the radio station itself could be swapped for any private technical workspace. Early signal, one middle constraint (access to the array), but closure participation is spatial rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"As the community divides" frames the university conflict (department fracture, opposing camps) and recurs in the final paragraph ("above her, as the community divided"). The timeframe is ongoing rather than ticking; no countdown tightens Mira's window. The convergence has an eleven-minute window, but that clock isn't tracked on the page and doesn't alter her moves. Division shapes stakes (she must act while factions war) but doesn't impose a tactical cost or deadline. Present in setup and closure as thematic frame, but middle development is weak—no moment where the escalating division forces a faster or riskier choice. Swappable with "during the crisis" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To outwit cosmic tricksters" is Mira's explicit goal, introduced via Okonkwo's warning and restated in her final realization ("to outwit cosmic tricksters, you couldn't just listen"). The desire drives her months of preparation and her choice to broadcast. Friction appears between caution (waiting for the right moment) and urgency (the convergence window closing), and between hope (believing exposure will unite the factions) and realism (the trickster's playful response proves the contest is ongoing). Present in setup, middle (her decision to flip the switch), and closure (the final thematic line). The motivation is dramatized through her trembling hands, grim smile, and refusal to stop. Strong causal pressure and specificity; not swappable with generic "solve the mystery."</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Ethereal grit" reads as cosmic wonder (distant stars, signals dancing, something ancient) combined with grounded determination (basement studio, modified equipment, Mira's grim smile). Tone is coherent through turns: the opening is tense and specific, the convergence moment lifts into awe ("something that felt almost amused"), and the ending returns to resolve ("settled in for a long night"). Modulation fits pressure, tightening during the broadcast and broadening at the close. However, "ethereal" sometimes drifts toward generic lyricism ("The stars watched. The signals danced") without unique sensory grounding, and "grit" is more asserted (she's determined) than embodied in concrete cost. Tone charges the final image but doesn't impose a tactical constraint. Present throughout with purposeful modulation, but the blend is more atmospheric than structurally indispensable.</comment>
