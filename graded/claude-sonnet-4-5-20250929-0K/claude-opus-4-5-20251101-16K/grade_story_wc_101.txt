<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's character is established through consistent, embodied choices—her gentle persistence manifests in noticing absences, devising the midnight runs, and refusing impossibility. Her internal state shows lived contradiction: the literature teacher who became a community organizer carries both roles without therapy-speak. The backstory fragments (grandmother's bell, teaching poetry) anchor present choices rather than floating as exposition. Minor slip: Bekir and the young mother remain functional but thin; their agency serves Mira's arc without independent pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image crystallizes the community's resilience under sanctions with visible cost—anonymity, midnight secrecy, ongoing invisibility. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through repeated bell rings, the redistribution ritual, and Bekir's challenge, culminating in Mira's declaration that they must become "unbreakable" before declaring themselves. Orientation is immediate (ridge arbor, exile settlement, sanctions context by paragraph two). One meaningful deepening occurs when Bekir voices the tension between invisibility and recognition, and Mira's response reweights the stakes from survival to intergenerational cohesion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor frames and closes the story, charging the final image; the ridge geography and midnight darkness constrain the redistribution method. Sensory detail is selective: "bruised purple" valley, bell's "amplified quiet," shadows moving between houses. The settlement's spatial layout (houses, storage shed, rocky path) remains coherent across moves. The arbor itself doesn't constrain a peak choice but supplies the vantage and symbolic anchor for Mira's stance. Micro-setting (the bell against her ribs, hands moving in silence) enriches texture without driving a turn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving community dignity while distributing aid—is signaled early and tightens when Bekir raises the younger generation's demand for public recognition. The midnight runs embody the tactic; Mira's refusal ("Not yet") forecloses the path to visibility with visible cost (continued anonymity, exhaustion, risk). Agency is clear: Mira's design (shared darkness, no one knows who takes what) and her decision to delay declaration shape the resolution. One meaningful turn: the elder redirecting supplies and the young guiding grandparents demonstrate the intergenerational support Mira seeks, validating her method under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—collective endurance and rootedness through shared secrecy—emerges from the midnight ritual, the bell's transformation from escape token to召唤 signal, and Mira's insistence that declaration must wait until they are "unbreakable." The final image (people carrying anonymous gifts and "something harder to name") answers the central question without stating a moral. Bekir's recognition that Mira is "planting roots that would outlast sanctions" offers thematic resonance earned by prior particulars: the seventeen-year-old guiding his grandmother, the formula passed without words. No overt philosophizing; subtext operates in gesture and silence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Mira; psychic distance tightens during the midnight procession and widens slightly for Bekir's historical perspective without head-hopping. Voice carries distinct texture: "amplified quiet," "gently persistent," the bell "silent and patient." Dialogue is sparse, natural, goal-driven: Bekir's challenge and Mira's deflection advance plot and reveal her tactical patience. Free indirect style is clean ("Invisibility was exhausting" reads as Mira's thought without filter clutter). Perceptual signature: Mira notices absences and names, tracks who stops attending. Minor note: Bekir's interior ("He had seen enough history") briefly converges with Mira's idiom but remains legible as his knowledge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully: short declaratives during the procession ("We carry together. We leave together.") contrast with longer reflective beats. Information density is high; most sentences advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Figurative language is controlled: "bruised purple," "amplified quiet," bell that "seemed to amplify the quiet rather than break it." Minor loop: "gently persistent" appears twice as a summary label (paragraph 2 and later); the second use feels scaffolded rather than earned by new action. Syntax varies; no template runs. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The midnight-redistribution design offers a specific, non-obvious solution to the pride-versus-need dilemma; shared darkness as the method for preserving dignity feels fresh. The bell's transformation from escape artifact to召唤 signal is purposeful. However, the exile-community-under-sanctions premise and the wise-woman-organizer arc are familiar templates; transformation arises more from execution than conceptual ingenuity. The intergenerational angle (young guiding old, old redirecting to young) adds texture but doesn't fundamentally reweight the frame. Risk-taking is moderate: the quiet, ritual-centered structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's choices create the key turn: she devises the midnight runs (setup), enforces the anonymity rule during distribution (middle), and decides to delay public declaration in favor of building "unbreakable" bonds (closure). Her role as leader is causally active across all three beats; removing her agency would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The bell appears in three beats: crossing borders (backstory anchor), the midnight召唤 (two rings frame the distribution), and the final paragraph where its echo fades. It enables the gathering tactic and charges the closure image ("the bell would ring again at midnight, gently persistent"). However, its mechanical function—召唤 device—could be substituted with another signal (horn, light) without breaking causality. The emotional/symbolic weight (grandmother's gift, silence-to-声音 shift) elevates it but doesn't make it indispensable to plot turns.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Anonymous donations shape the core problem: how to distribute aid without wounding pride. The concept drives the midnight-run tactic (middle) and underwrites the stakes (survival versus dignity). It appears early (six months of packages) and persists through closure (people carrying "anonymous gifts"). Swappability: a different aid source (e.g., rationed supplies, barter) would require only minor edits. The anonymity itself—protecting donors and receivers—adds specificity and slight irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Gently persistent" constrains Mira's approach: she invites the withdrawn "until even the most withdrawn returned," refuses Bekir's urgency ("Not yet"), and frames endurance as her method ("Then we last years more"). The trait is demonstrated in action (noticing absences, devising the secret runs) with visible cost (ongoing invisibility, exhaustion). It shapes two beats (her organizing method, her refusal to declare) and charges the final image (the bell as "gently persistent" 召唤). Label appears twice; second use summarizes rather than advancing.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Declare" anchors the conflict: Bekir reports that younger members want to declare the community publicly, and Mira refuses ("Not yet"). This choice forecloses the visibility path and reweights the ending—they will declare "as a family" only after becoming unbreakable. The action is verbalized rather than performed on the page; the story ends before any declaration occurs. Setup is clear, closure linkage strong, but the beat itself is a decision about future action rather than an immediate turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Midnight food runs are the story's engine: Mira devises them (setup), the procession occupies the central sequence (hands dividing supplies, young guiding old, grandmother redirecting formula), and the final image promises their continuation ("the bell would ring again at midnight"). The method solves the pride problem through shared darkness and enforced anonymity, shaping tactics and enabling the intergenerational support Mira seeks. Mechanics are shown, not told; the method is irreplaceable to this story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The arbor frames the story (Mira climbs to it at dusk, returns alone at dawn) and supplies a vantage for watching the community. It anchors the opening and closing images, lending symbolic weight to Mira's isolation-within-leadership. However, the arbor does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters a beat; the key action (midnight redistribution) occurs at the storage shed. The ridge geography matters more than the arbor itself. Strong lyric reprise, but mid-scene absence limits causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sanctions pressure pervades: they drove the exile, enable the anonymous donations (sympathizers who "couldn't openly defy"), and frame the stakes (invisibility as survival tactic). Bekir's "The sanctions could last years more" tightens Mira's resolve. The timeframe shapes why the community must remain hidden and why Mira resists public declaration. However, sanctions function as static background constraint rather than a ticking clock; no on-page escalation tied to sanctions policy. Cost is conceptual (ongoing precarity) rather than a live countdown.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Building intergenerational support is Mira's explicit goal ("This was how she meant to build intergenerational support"), dramatized through the midnight procession: the seventeen-year-old guiding his grandmother, the grandmother redirecting supplies to sick children, the young mother and elderly man exchanging formula. The motive drives her refusal to declare early ("First, we become unbreakable"). Friction: Bekir's challenge (younger generation wants recognition now) versus Mira's patience. Cost: continued invisibility and exhaustion. The motive is told once but enacted across three beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Amplified quiet" is named explicitly ("a single, clear note that seemed to amplify the quiet rather than break it") and sustained through whispered dialogue, silent hands dividing supplies, and shadows dispersing. The tone modulates: dusk reflection (opening), tense procession (middle), solitary vigil (close). It charges the final image: the bell's echo fading into ridge, dawn approaching, silence promising return. Coherent across turns, though the overt articulation of the phrase in the text risks breaking the effect it names.</comment>
