<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is present but often abstract ("the weight of all we leave unsaid"). Her decision to place the pearl is motivated by the etched confessions but feels more thematic than character-earned—protocol demands she report, yet we don't see internal friction or cost in the "heartbeat of a hesitation." The grandmother parallel offers grounding, but the leap to broadcasting hope feels more concept-driven than rooted in contradictory impulses acting in scene. Embodied emotion is scarce in the pivotal moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly: bunker inspector, Bunker 7, dormitory level. The piece follows a causal progression (discovery → caves → placement → broadcast effect) that tightens toward the pearl's activation. However, the closure effect—the caves singing and broadcasting hope—arrives as a magical consequence rather than a decision that forecloses options with visible cost; the "impossible" broadcasting through vents stretches causality without prior constraint. The ending offers Conceptual Repricing but the cost to Mara herself is not legible on the page. Lens: Causal with magical convenience at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The quartz-dusted walls, sagging bunk frames, and crystal caves are vivid and specific. The caves constrain Mara's movement (she "squeezed through") and the central pillar becomes the locus of the climactic act, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mara's professional eye (dosimeter clicks, resonant hush). The environment actively shapes the closure, elevating this category near the 8.0 threshold.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to report the structural risk or preserve the caves—is signaled at the fracture discovery. The "heartbeat of a hesitation" frames the turn, but Mara's choice is described rather than dramatized with visible friction or trade-off. No consequence for defying protocol appears on the page; the broadcast effect rewards her without cost. Escalation occurs through discovery layers (footlocker → caves → pillar) but lacks genuine narrowing of options or felt price at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme—buried hopes and the light of speaking them—emerges through concrete particulars (etched shells, the pearl, the caves' song). The final paragraph explicitly moralizes ("the weight of all we leave unsaid, and the light that emerges when we finally speak it"), undercutting earned resonance with direct statement. The pearl-as-witness metaphor is purposeful but the ending tells the theme rather than trusting the image to carry it. Apply thematic-echo penalty: −0.5 for final-paragraph thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mara; no head-hopping. The prose carries a distinct, elevated register ("cathedral arches, refracting her single beam into a thousand spectral promises") that remains consistent and voice-motivated. Perceptual signature is professional-technical (dosimeter, structural scan) layered with lyric compression. However, the final paragraph shifts into essayistic summary ("she had discovered what holds them together"), diluting the narrative stance at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and clarity is generally strong, but figurative density in high-pressure beats borders on overwriting: "bunk frames sagged like ribs of a starving beast," "latent radiance pulsing in rhythm with her own heartbeat," "spectral promises." The final two paragraphs loop conceptually, restating the theme across multiple sentences without added pressure. Template stems appear: "I wanted... I dreamed... I hoped... I wished... I planned... I meant... I promised..." (acceptable as found-text confessions). Apply density and paraphrase-loop penalties: −0.6 total.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The bunker-inspector premise and etched-shell confessions offer specificity, but the core emotional arc—discovering buried hopes and choosing preservation over protocol—follows a familiar template (relic discovery → emotional revelation → magical restoration). The broadcast-through-vents climax introduces a rule change (the pearl and caves can transmit dreams to the town) not prepared by prior constraints, reducing earned inevitability. Transformation is partial; the setting and objects are particular, but the resolution leans on convenience.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara's role as doomsday bunker inspector frames the discovery and the protocol conflict. Her choice to place the pearl rather than report the caves is the key turn, but it's understated and lacks on-page cost. Present in setup, middle (discovery), and payoff (placement), satisfying all three gates, but causal pressure is soft.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cultivated pearl appears in the footlocker, warms against Mara's palm, brightens as confessions are read, and is crowned atop the pillar to activate the caves. It is handled in at least three distinct beats and drives the closure action. Strong causal linkage and closure participation, though the transformation (warming, brightening) is asserted rather than grounded in prior world logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Latent radiance" is present as a descriptor (the pearl's hidden light) and thematic echo, but it does not constrain tactics or alter Mara's options on the page. It names the effect rather than shaping the conflict. Mentioned in the middle and ending but not causally active.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Mara "acquires abandoned hopes" by reading the shells and choosing to honor them. This attribute drives her decision to place the pearl, but the acquisition itself is passive (she finds them) and the cost of that choice is not visible. Present in middle and ending; one key turn, but swappable with "discovers" or "inherits" without major loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Crown" is the climactic action: Mara places the pearl atop the central pillar, activating the caves. The verb is specific and charged, and the story builds toward this moment. However, the act itself could be restated as "placed" or "set" without breaking logic; the word "crown" adds metaphorical weight but is not mechanically essential. Strong payoff, but moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The confessions etched inside seashell spirals are discovered in the footlocker, read aloud by Mara in the caves, and trigger the pearl's brightening. The method shapes the middle beat (reading each spiral) and charges the closure. Present in setup (discovered), development (read), and payoff (released into the caves). Solid integration across beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The crystal caves are discovered via the fracture, constrain Mara's movement (she squeezes through), and provide the central pillar that becomes the stage for the climactic act. The caves' acoustics amplify the confessions and enable the broadcast effect. Setting is essential to escalation and closure; removing the caves would collapse the ending's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"During the heartbeat of a hesitation" appears once as a transition marker before Mara's choice, but the timeframe is metaphorical rather than a tightening clock. It does not alter tactics or create urgency; the story could proceed without this phrase. Ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation "to dissolve the walls between hearts" is stated in the final paragraphs as theme but not dramatized as a desire under friction. The act of reading confessions aloud and placing the pearl implies this goal, yet we don't see Mara wrestling with competing wants or costs tied to this specific motive. Present in ending, but told rather than lived.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Resonant hush" recurs as a motif (opening line, caves description, penultimate paragraph) and modulates from eerie quiet to charged stillness. The tone is coherent and purposeful, supporting the lyric register and charging the final image. Strong control across turns, though the final shift into essayistic summary slightly dilutes the hush.</comment>
