<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The calligrapher's motivation is signaled but her interior life remains thin—she "wanted to know" and later "realized" in label-only summary. The wilting trait is described but never constrains an on-page choice with visible cost; the guard scene offers potential friction but she "forced herself to stay straight" without embodied struggle or trade-off. Emotional states are asserted ("heart quickening," "heart full of light") rather than enacted through contradictory impulses. The final scroll-sharing moment with the neighbor arrives as sentiment without prior relational pressure or cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive promptly (greenhouse city, toxic sky, calligrapher). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—density builds through archive discovery and tape listening—but closure lacks visible cost: she leaves "with the reel...and a heart full of light" and transcribes "each truthful word" without forfeiture or obstacle. The candor-as-gold-leaf motif recurs but does not narrow options or reshape stakes at the end. No meaningful tightening occurs; the arc is additive (search → find → transcribe) without pressure or sacrifice on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The greenhouse city, toxic sky, and archive chamber are rendered with vivid sensory detail (bruised sky, sour air, brittle reels). Setting enables the search—the water-reclamation plant houses the archive—and the guard scene uses spatial staging to apply momentary pressure. However, the environment does not constrain the protagonist's final choice or charge the closure image; the studio and greenhouse serve as backdrop for the transcription without altering tactics. The zinc fragment is handled twice but functions more as talisman than tool that shapes outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding lost conversations—is signaled early, but escalation is absent. She pieces the map, descends the ladder, listens to tapes, and retrieves her own reel in a sequence of steps without reversals, costs, or narrowing options. The guard's "half-truths" momentarily threaten but he "let her pass" with no loss or trade-off. The archive visit succeeds without obstacle; she "spent hours listening" but no competing demand or resource limit alters her tactics. Closure is discovery plus transcription, additive rather than earned through agency under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The candor-versus-dishonesty theme is declared repeatedly ("every small honest moment creates a leaf that never wilts," "as long as there were honest words, the oasis of memory would never dry") rather than emerging from dramatic particulars. The ending offers a resonant image—neighbor's tears watering plants—but it follows overt thematic summary in the prior paragraphs. The archive's rule (honest words remain, lies decay) is told, not demonstrated through conflicting choices or visible cost. Subtext is sparse; the calligrapher's realization is articulated rather than implicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but generic ("her heart quickening," "a whisper of paper") without character-particular texture. Diction remains consistent, though register drifts toward elevated abstraction in reflective passages ("a testament to candor's power," "the soil of memory"). The guard's dialogue and the tape snippet are brief but functional. Psychic distance stays controlled, yet the voice lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure—syntax remains even across discovery, descent, and closure without tightening or shift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "She wanted to know...so she began to search" / "She decided to transcribe...The process was slow" / "She thought of the many times...Each small lie..." (three consecutive "She [verb]" stems). Figurative language ("bruised sky," "gold leaf on parchment," "oasis of memory") recurs without fresh iteration or payoff tied to closure. Filter verbs and summary dominate peak beats: "She realized that," "She understood that," "She knew that." Information density is low—key beats (piecing the map, listening to tapes, transcribing) are narrated in summary rather than scene. The final third stacks abstractions ("candor bloomed," "oasis of memory would never dry") that dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The premise—truth-sensitive calligrapher searching for lost conversations in a toxic-sky city—combines familiar dystopian and allegory tropes without transformation. The archive-as-memory-bank and honest-words-endure motif follow predictable symbolic logic. The wilting-leaves trait is asserted but not leveraged to create choices or irony. Emotional beats (discovery, realization, sharing) follow template progression without surprise or fresh inflection. The final image (tears watering plants) offers pastoral comfort but no non-obvious synthesis or risk that heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The gilded-leaf calligrapher is present throughout and her search drives the plot. However, her choices are mostly procedural (piece the map, descend the ladder, play the reel, transcribe) without on-page decisions that narrow options or incur visible cost. The guard encounter offers potential friction but she "forced herself to stay straight" and he simply lets her pass. Her final choice—to transcribe and share—alters no prior tactic and forecloses no path. Setup and development gates are met; closure participation is passive (she transcribes after the search succeeds). Swappable with another seeker archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The zinc-etched postal plate fragment appears in three beats: discovered among map pieces, held warm during the archive search, and implied present when she returns. It guides her to the hidden reel, enabling one turn. However, its "etched lines a map within the map" and "compass of candor" properties are told rather than demonstrated through constraints or costs. It does not shape tactics under pressure or return with reweighted meaning at closure—it is carried but not causally active in the transcription or sharing. Setup, development, and closure-presence gates are met, but causal pressure and irreplaceability remain modest.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Candor in small moments is declared as theme throughout ("candor in small moments kept her leaves bright," "every small honest moment creates a leaf") but does not shape on-page stakes or tactics. The calligrapher does not face a choice between honesty and evasion with cost; she simply pursues truth and finds it. The archive's rule (honest words remain) is exposition rather than a constraint she navigates. Present as thematic echo, but the concept does not alter options or force trade-offs. Functional but ornamental; swappable with "memory" or "sincerity" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The wilts-near-dishonesty trait is introduced early and mentioned twice: her leaves curl at the guard's evasion and later shimmer at honest moments. However, it never constrains an on-page action with visible cost—she "forced herself to stay straight" without dramatized struggle or forfeiture. The trait is descriptive flourish rather than a mechanism that shapes choices or closure. Setup and one development beat (guard) are present, but closure participation is absent; the final transcription does not test or leverage the trait. Label-only use trends low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Reread appears in four beats: piecing the map, rereading the postal plate, rereading/listening to tapes in the archive, and implied in the transcription process. The archive listening is the story's emotional center—she "spent hours listening, rereading the tapes"—and discovering her own voice is the key turn. However, the action itself is summarized rather than dramatized, and the final transcription is a separate act (writing, not rereading). Setup, development, and closure proximity gates are met; causal pressure is moderate. Swappable with "listen" or "review" in some beats without major edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Piecing together the shredded treasure map is introduced early and dramatized briefly ("matching torn edges under lamplight," "The map's final piece fell into place"). It enables the journey by revealing the archive location and is signaled in setup. However, the method does not constrain later choices—once pieced, it functions as static information. The mechanics (how many pieces, what effort, what cost) remain vague. Development and closure participation are absent; the map is not revisited or reweighted at the end. Functional transit device, swappable with "decoded clue" or "consulted instructions."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The sprawling greenhouse city under a toxic sky is vividly rendered (glass corridors, vines, bruised sky, sour air) and frames the entire narrative. The water-reclamation plant location is integral to finding the archive. The toxic sky provides atmospheric pressure and the greenhouse studio offers a contrasting haven at closure. However, the environment does not constrain the protagonist's tactics or alter the outcome—she moves through it without obstacle or resource cost. Setup, development, and closure-presence gates are met; causal pressure is light. The setting stages but does not shape the final choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"After the last oasis dried" anchors backstory but does not impose a present timetable. The protagonist searches "lately," descends "into the night," and "spent hours listening" without time pressure or deadline affecting her choices. The archive remains accessible; no clock or decay threatens the tapes. Timeframe is atmospheric context rather than a constraint that tightens decisions. Setup is present as exposition; development and closure participation are absent. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The desire to find where lost conversations go is stated early ("She wanted to know") and drives the search plot. It motivates the map-piecing, descent, and archive exploration. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices or competing wants. She pursues it without cost, doubt, or obstacle; the guard lets her pass and the archive yields freely. The final transcription and sharing extend the motivation but do not test it against a countervailing pressure. Setup and development gates are met; friction between want and cost is absent. Functional but one-note.</comment>
