<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The bell tuner remains abstract throughout—no contradictory impulses, no micro-choices under pressure, only poetic assertion of her erosion. The child arrives late and serves as witness rather than participant; no relationship pressure tests the tuner. Interiority consists of elevated declarations ("she understood her work was not preservation but transmission") rather than embodied thought under stress. The final "laugh a sound like breaking ice" gestures toward transformation but lacks prior causal grounding in her psychology.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who she is and why she climbs emerge gradually through the first 25% without clear spatial anchors. The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode—building density through image and motif—but lacks a single on-page reversal or tightening that narrows options. The child's arrival functions as witness to an already-complete sculpture rather than a decision point. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing (wonder preserved through kinetic art outlasting speech), and the cost is legible in the tuner's self-erasure, but the transformation occurs off-page across seasons rather than in this scene's pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The bluff, iceberg fragment, and kinetic sculptures supply vivid, purposeful detail filtered through the tuner's mission. The fragment's blue glow and the sculpture's twilight performance charge the final image effectively. Spatial choreography remains coherent despite the abstract setting, and the altitude's "strange magic" keeping ice between thaw and freeze grounds the fantastical element. Sensory hierarchy is strong—light, wind, metal, and ice dominate as the work demands—though the villagers and workshop receive minimal concrete grounding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving wonder through kinetic art—is signaled early but never tested on the page. No external opposition or internal doubt forces a trade-off; the tuner completes her masterpiece without visible obstacles or cost during this scene. The child's witness provides thematic resonance but no reversal. The piece accumulates texture rather than escalating pressure, and while the tuner's self-erasure is named, it unfolds across seasons rather than through a dramatized choice here. One deepening—the realization of transmission over preservation—occurs, but it feels asserted rather than earned by prior friction.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the kinetic sculptures, iceberg fragments, and the tuner's gradual dissolution—wonder as transmission rather than capture. The final image of the child touching ancient water and seeing whales reweights the opening's muteness and gray world without stating a moral. Subtext operates effectively in "seasonally mute becoming perpetually so" and the tension between speech and struck metal. Minor slip: "her work was not preservation but transmission" edges toward thesis statement, though it's embedded in action and the child's touch provides a concrete answer to the thematic question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds a consistent elevated register throughout, with diction ("tremor of unspoken things," "glisten with meaning") that matches the lyric-mythic mode. Psychic distance remains stable and purposeful, though the narrator's certainty about what villagers remember and the child's inner seeing ("she saw through time to when whales sang") brushes against POV leakage. No dialogue appears. The voice carries a distinct texture—rhythmic, incantatory—but syntactic patterns repeat (long clauses with nested subordination) without modulation under the child's arrival, which should intensify pressure. The perceptual signature is consistent but not character-particular; it reads as authorial voice rather than the tuner's mind.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and mostly coherent ("color of wonder," "truth was not a thing to be spoken but a pattern to be revealed"), though mixed vehicles occasionally clash ("erosion as necessary cost" / "hollow out the self" in adjacent lines). Template cadence emerges: "She [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" sentence stems recur across a dozen lines without variation. Paraphrase loops: "seasonally mute" is restated three times with minimal new information. Information density is uneven—the middle third describes the sculpture's mechanics at length while the child's encounter compresses rapidly. Rhythm does not modulate with the child's arrival; syntactic structure remains uniform through the climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The premise—truth communicated through kinetic sound-sculpture after language fails—offers a fresh synthesis of post-linguistic SF and synaesthetic art. Execution leans on familiar post-apocalyptic gray-world imagery and the mentor-observes-child trope without transforming them through specific lived detail. The iceberg-at-altitude and "blue shadows on clouds" provide memorable images. Risk-taking in the lyric-accumulative structure is notable, though the lack of on-page conflict or character friction plays it safe thematically. Transformation test: the emotional arc (artist completes work, child witnesses) could transfer to other media/settings with minimal change, suggesting the freshness resides in the images rather than the narrative stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The bell tuner is present throughout and her past choices (taking seasonal muteness, forging sculptures) frame the premise, but she makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or narrows options. She observes the child's reaction and "understood" transmission, but this realization is told rather than enacted through a consequential choice. Setup and payoff gates are met; middle development is observational only.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The iceberg fragment appears early as the sculpture's centerpiece, is handled/positioned by the tuner in the construction beat, and returns charged at closure when the child touches it and sees through time. Its specific property—holding ancient freeze and blue breath—is irreplaceable and shapes the final image's resonance. Three distinct beats: selection/placement, twilight performance glistening, child's tactile contact. Causal pressure is moderate; it enables the thematic reveal but does not constrain prior choices.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Symphonies of truth" frames the tuner's mission early and recurs in the twilight performance ("symphonies of truth emerged not as melody but as architecture"). It shapes her goal but does not constrain tactics on the page—she builds what she intended without friction. The concept charges the ending's emotional logic (vibration replacing vocabulary) but remains thematic rather than forcing a trade-off. Setup, development as method, and payoff in the child's climb all present; causal pressure is low.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Seasonal muteness is introduced early, reappears mid-story ("seasonally mute becoming perpetually so"), and is present at closure when she "laughed a sound like breaking ice." It colors her relationship to language and charges the irony of her laugh, but it does not constrain an on-page choice—she neither speaks nor withholds speech under pressure. Lyric reprise reweights the theme, but the trait remains primarily symbolic. Setup and payoff gates met; middle development is label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Glisten" recurs prominently: the bluff's method seeks "frequencies that might glisten," the iceberg fragment would "glisten as if the ice itself were weeping light," and at closure the fragment "glistened with such intensity that it cast blue shadows." The word anchors the visual-thematic turn and is irreplaceable for the light-as-wonder metaphor. It charges the final image decisively. However, no major turn traces to the act of glistening; it is the result rather than the driver of the child's arrival. Setup early, present at climax, lyric reprise with cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Kinetic sculpture is signaled early as the tuner's method, described in mechanical detail mid-story ("counterweighted beams and suspended bells"), and performs at closure to enable the child's vision. Its mechanics—wind-driven motion translating pressure into sound—matter and are specific. Two beats: construction and twilight performance. It enables the thematic payoff but does not constrain the tuner's choices; she completes it without obstacle. Setup, development, and payoff gates all met; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The whispering bluff is named in the opening line, provides altitude that keeps the iceberg fragment frozen, and remains present through closure. Its height above clouds and constant wind are irreplaceable for the sculpture's function. The setting's properties (thin air, cloud layer, treacherous path) supply resources and frame the stakes, but they do not pressure a choice on the page. The tuner's workshop "perched on the bluff's edge" and villagers climb to it, embedding it in action. Setup, development as resource, and payoff presence all met; tactical constraint is minimal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The timeframe—after words become unnecessary—is established early ("language had dissolved," "when the last newspaper rotted") and shapes the premise (bells replace speech). It recurs at closure when the child, "born after words became unnecessary," touches the fragment. The temporal setting justifies the tuner's mission and charges the thematic resonance, but it does not create urgency or narrow options on the page. No live clock; the passage of seasons is summarized rather than tracked. Setup and thematic payoff present; middle tactical pressure absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation to preserve wonder is stated early ("to preserve the color of wonder"), drives the tuner's labor across seasons, and is refined at closure into transmission. It is tested thematically—wonder leaches from the world, forcing her method—but not through on-page friction between competing desires. The child's arrival confirms success rather than forcing a choice. The cost (self-erasure: "her own colors seeping into her work") is legible and ties to the motivation. Setup, development as goal, and payoff with cost all present; internal conflict is low.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Muted vigor coheres throughout: restrained diction ("breath crystallizing," "tremor of unspoken things") combined with active verbs (climbed, forged, struck, turned) and assertive claims ("she alone remained"). Tone modulates subtly—expository calm in the workshop description, sensory intensity at the twilight performance, quiet resonance at closure. It charges the final image's "mute and perfect and forever new" without breaking into sentimentality or overt triumph. The tone is consistent with the post-linguistic setting and supports the thematic weight. Strong coherence and purposeful modulation under pressure.</comment>
