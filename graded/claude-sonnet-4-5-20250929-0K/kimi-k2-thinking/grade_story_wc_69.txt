<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mrs. Kaelin's expectant resignation and thirty-autumn history provide stable interiority, but her characterization relies heavily on summary ("she knew," "she had carried") rather than contradictory impulses dramatized in scene. Marco's moment of vulnerability—breathing, subtracting defense, singing one note—shows embodied choice under pressure and earns the transition. The broad cast (Amina, multiple students) remains functionally flat; no secondary character applies immediate pressure that forces a trade-off with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern-building through subtraction culminates in the shared chord, then jumps decades to Marco-as-teacher in a lyric reprise. Orientation anchors early (velvet library, autumn, Mrs. Kaelin, students arriving). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise—the rosette passed on, the method preserved—but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse; no single on-page forfeiture or trade-off crystallizes at the ending beat. The decades-long ellipsis and summary layering ("In coming years, the conservatory would close") dilute immediate pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The velvet library and autumn light anchor setting early and recur purposefully; dust motes, drapes absorbing daylight, and the blown leaf pressed between scores provide sensory specificity filtered through Mrs. Kaelin's attention. The rosette's carved voids function as micro-setting, charging the final image when Marco receives it. Spatial choreography (students filing in/out, Mrs. Kaelin at the lectern/desk) remains clear across time jumps, and the velvet library frames both opening and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—braiding diverse voices, unlearning hatred through subtraction of noise—is signaled early and recurs, but the pressure remains declarative rather than tested by a live opposition or narrowing choice. Marco's sung note and the group chord demonstrate agency, yet no on-page reversal forces a trade-off or forecloses a path; the decades-long summary tells us the method persists without showing a moment where it might fail or cost Mrs. Kaelin something immediate. The final passage of the rosette to Marco is a gesture of continuity, not a choice under duress.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme—what vanishes leaves traces, harmony is subtraction—emerges organically from the rosette's negative space, the method of subtracting noise, and the braiding metaphor. The ending avoids explicit moralizing; the note "Keep carving the silence" and Marco's return to a velvet library reweight prior material with quiet resonance. However, certain phrases ("unlearning hatred takes longer than any season," "vanishing arts leave traces") edge toward thematic echo, and the final reprise, while earned, is more lyric assertion than a non-literal answer charged by prior conflict.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV anchors in Mrs. Kaelin's perceptual bias (thirty autumns, traveled stillness) with consistent narrative distance. Dialogue is minimal but functional: Marco's raised hand, Mrs. Kaelin's "Pass it on" feel purposeful. However, certain lines ("She was expectantly resigned," "traveled stillness," "vanishing arts") repeat elevated diction that, while voice-motivated, risks self-conscious lyricism under emotional pressure. The decades-long summary in the final third shifts psychic distance without clear cue, and the prose occasionally slides into authorial observation rather than strictly character-filtered perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies across beats, and sentences like "The chord they built was imperfect but intentional, each strand necessary" achieve clarity and concision. However, template stems recur: "She knew," "She had," "She taught," "Mrs. Kaelin [verb]" across multiple paragraphs, creating cadence drag. Paraphrase loops appear ("vanishing art," "vanishing faster," "A vanishing art, yes") and the phrase "expectantly resigned" repeats three times without added pressure. The high density of metaphor (rosette, braiding, negative space, traveled stillness) in the final third risks overwriting; some lines ("veined like the rosette's channels—nature's own carving") feel decorative rather than propulsive.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The zither rosette as organizing metaphor—negative space enabling song—offers a specific, non-obvious synthesis of the vanishing-arts concept with the unlearning-hatred stake. The method (subtract noise to find one true note) transforms a familiar teaching-story arc through the particular object and Mrs. Kaelin's traveled history. However, the emotional arc (skeptical students → tentative harmony → teacher passes on legacy) follows a well-worn template, and the final decades-long summary dilutes immediacy. Risk-taking is present in the lyric, elliptical structure, but the piece does not fully commit to dramatizing the cost or complication that would make the synthesis feel inevitable rather than illustrated.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mrs. Kaelin is present throughout and her choices (placing the rosette, explaining the method, passing it to Marco) frame the narrative. She is named in the opening beat, her expectant resignation is invoked three times, and she anchors the closure by giving Marco the rosette and the instruction to "Pass it on." However, her decisions do not create reversals or force trade-offs with visible cost on the page; she observes and facilitates rather than acting under pressure. The decades-long summary tells us she "aged" and "retired," but no single on-page moment shows her altering tactics or foreclosing a path. Her role is essential to setup and thematic framing but not to escalation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The zither soundhole rosette appears in the opening beat (placed on the lectern), is explained in the teaching moment ("the holes, not the wood, let the zither sing"), handled in the climax (placed in Marco's palm), and returns in the final line (Marco places it in his own library). It is present across setup, development, and closure, and its negative-space metaphor is causally tied to the method of subtracting noise. However, the rosette is not physically used or manipulated in multiple beats; it is described, passed, and wrapped in a note, serving more as symbolic anchor than tactile tool that alters tactics. Its closure participation is strong but the middle development is thematic rather than action-driven.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Vanishing arts" is named in the opening third ("This was a vanishing art, she knew"), recurs in multiple beats ("The art of listening, she knew, was vanishing faster than any instrument," "A vanishing art, yes, but persistent"), and frames the thematic closure (the conservatory closes, the rosette is passed). It shapes the dominant stake—preserving the method of subtraction—and the final image of Marco continuing the practice in his own library. However, it functions primarily as thematic label rather than a live constraint that changes on-page tactics; the concept is echoed rather than tested by a moment where a vanishing art must be defended or where its loss would foreclose a path. The piece tells us arts vanish without showing the protagonist choosing between preservation and another cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Expectantly resigned" is named three times (opening, midpoint, final paragraph) and attributed to Mrs. Kaelin's stance toward student resistance and the "beautiful work of braiding voices." It is present in setup and closure and appears to constrain her tactics—she does not force but waits, she anticipates noise returning yet persists. However, the trait is label-only; no on-page action explicitly shows Mrs. Kaelin choosing patience over force with visible cost, or her expectant resignation preventing a more direct intervention. The attribute is asserted rather than dramatized through a trade-off, and it could be swapped for "patient," "weary hope," or "stoic acceptance" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Denote" appears twice: "Today would denote a shift" (signaling the lesson) and "She filed empty scores, each blank staff denoting what we choose not to play." The word is present in setup and ending, and it thematically aligns with the method of subtraction—marking what is omitted. However, the action is abstract and easily swappable; "signify," "mark," or "show" could replace it with minor edits. No major turn traces to the act of denoting; the students' harmony and Marco's later teaching arise from the method of subtracting noise, not from the specific semantic work of "denote." The word functions as thematic gloss rather than causal lever.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The method "by subtracting noise" is signaled early ("they would subtract noise until only one true note remained"), demonstrated in Marco's beat (he sings one note "subtracting the noise of his own defense"), and enacted collectively as students "subtracted their noise and offered single tones." It recurs in the closure note ("Keep carving the silence") and Marco's continuation of the practice. The method is present across setup, development (it shapes the students' attempts), and ending, and it is causally tied to the dominant stake. However, its mechanics are told more than shown; we see the result (the chord) but not the struggle or friction of the subtraction process. The method is indispensable to the concept but not dramatized with visible cost at each use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The "velvet library in autumn" is named in the opening line, provides sensory anchors (dust motes, late afternoon light, drapes absorbing daylight, leaves against windows), and returns in the ending when Marco "placed it in his own velvet library, where autumn light still filtered through." It is present in setup and closure, and the velvet drapes and library setting frame the stillness that the method requires. However, the setting does not pressure choices or supply resources that alter tactics; it is postcard description that supports tone rather than micro-setting that constrains action. The library is essential to atmosphere and thematic closure but not to escalation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Unlearning hatred" is named twice ("unlearning hatred takes longer than any season," "Mrs. Kaelin nodded, knowing through years of unlearning hatred") and the decades-long arc is summarized in the final third ("In coming years," "When she retired," "Marco, now a teacher"). The timeframe is present and thematically central, but it is not dramatized as a tightening constraint; the passage of thirty autumns and the eventual closure of the conservatory are told in summary rather than shown as a clock that alters present moves. The piece does not track time within the single lesson scene, and the decades-long ellipsis diffuses rather than sharpens pressure. The timeframe is conceptually load-bearing but not tactically live.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to braid diverse voices into harmony" is signaled early ("braiding diverse voices into harmony"), demonstrated when the students build their chord ("braiding diverse voices into harmony"), and recurs in the closure ("the beautiful work of braiding voices into a listening future," "a braid withstands where threads break"). It shapes Mrs. Kaelin's dominant stake and is present across setup, middle enactment, and ending. However, the desire is more illustrated than conflicted; no on-page friction tests whether Mrs. Kaelin must sacrifice something immediate to achieve the braiding, or whether the harmony costs her autonomy, time, or another goal. The motivation is causal and indispensable but not dramatized with visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Traveled stillness" appears three times: "the traveled stillness settle deeper," "listening to the traveled stillness that belonged to all of them now," "traveled stillness can be a destination rather than a departure." It is present in setup (implied by the breath-holding opening) and closure (the final paragraph). The tone is coherent and modulates subtly—early dust-mote quiet gives way to the exhale after the chord, then the decades-long summary carries elegiac distance. However, the phrase "traveled stillness" is ornamental and replaceable; "earned quiet," "shared silence," or "settled peace" could substitute without structural loss. The tone charges the final image but the specific diction is not indispensable.</comment>
