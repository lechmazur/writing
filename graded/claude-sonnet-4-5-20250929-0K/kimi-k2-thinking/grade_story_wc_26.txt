<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's "sharp-eyed dusk noticer" identity and "softly deliberate" motivation remain consistent throughout, with micro-choices (analyzing footage, placing the stone) that flow from her vigilance trait. However, interiority is often abstract and poetic rather than embodied—"luminous regret" and "shape of hope" read as labels rather than particularized sensations. The final act of placing the stone carries visible cost (pocket emptied, piece of self forfeited), but the interior experience of that sacrifice remains somewhat generic. The transformation moment lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; she moves smoothly from analysis to binding without internal friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (pattern taught early via repeated dusk observations, silent video footage, shadow's progressive freedom; deepening through stone's increasing weight and shadow's metamorphosis). Orientation anchors arrive early (blooming library, cloud-world, her role). Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): the shadow transforms from threat to guardian, she forfeits the stone, and "luminous regret" crystallizes the cost—hope preserved but a piece of herself lost. The causal chain is mostly clean: stone catalyzes binding, footage comparison reveals the shadow's pattern, placement on screen triggers metamorphosis. One slip: the mechanism by which pressing a physical stone onto a monitor screen binds a shadow is asserted rather than prepared by prior world-rule anchoring, creating a small causality gap at the climactic beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The blooming library above clouds is vivid and purpose-driven: glass-and-steel petals, shelves glowing with new light, the contrast of earth-memory (river) versus cloud-world. The river stone functions as micro-setting, constraining the protagonist's choice and charging the final image when its absence is felt. Spatial choreography is clean (archive room, monitor, table). The world after shareable dreams is consistently invoked but remains slightly abstract—how dreams are shared or what that changes about daily library operations is left vague, weakening the setting's pressure on choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserve the library's "shape of hope" from the unbound shadow. Escalation under Accumulative lens: shadow grows bolder across decades of footage, feeds on hope, dims the luminous aura; protagonist realizes stone is catalyst; places stone in shadow's path on-screen. One meaningful tightening: her realization that the stone "could bind the shadow, if used with the right intent" narrows options to a single high-cost act. The cost is legible on-page: stone absorbed, pocket emptied, "luminous regret" as the trade-off. Agency is present (decision to place stone, acceptance of loss). The shadow's transformation from threat to guardian reweights the outcome with bittersweet consequences, though the mechanics of that transformation feel slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—preservation of hope entails sacrifice—emerges organically from the stone's weight, the shadow's metamorphosis, and the protagonist's empty pocket. The final image (shadow as luminous veil, library blooming with "warmth that was both comforting and bittersweet") offers a resonant, non-literal answer: hope endures, but at personal cost. "Luminous regret" recurs as both tone and thematic conclusion without explicit moralizing. The shadow not disappearing but transforming into a guardian adds complexity. Minor slip: "the shape of hope" is invoked often but remains slightly abstract; one more concrete manifestation (a specific dreamer's experience, a particular shelf's glow) would anchor the universal in stronger particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (notices shadows, dusk, subtle movements), though the diction occasionally drifts into elevated literary register ("luminous regret," "the delicate shape of hope") that feels slightly removed from lived interiority. Sentence rhythm modulates with pressure: longer, reflective constructions early, shorter decisive beats at the stone-placement climax. Free indirect style is mostly clean, but some filter verbs ("she realized," "she knew," "she wondered") appear where direct perception would sharpen immediacy. No dialogue to evaluate. The prose voice is distinct but borders on uniform lyricism without enough variation under peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sentence openings vary, paragraph lengths create visual rhythm, and the read-aloud test passes cleanly. Information density is high in the climactic paragraphs (stone placement, shadow metamorphosis). However, multiple paraphrase loops and synonym cycles appear: "softly deliberate" is stated twice in adjacent beats; "shape of hope" recurs five times with minimal variation; "luminous regret" and "luminous aura/veil" appear in close succession without reweighting. Template cadence: several paragraphs open with "The shadow..." or "She..." in runs of three or more. Stock metaphors ("river of memory," "fragile hope") lack fresh specificity. These artifacts dull momentum in the middle third and touch the closure paragraph ("luminous regret" × 2). Applying patterned-artifact penalty: −0.9 in Q7 for paraphrase loops and template stems; an additional −0.3 for stock metaphor strings in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise—library archivist binds a shadow using a river stone and silent video footage—synthesizes several familiar elements (archives, shadows as metaphor, guardian transformation) but does not echo a widely used template. The "shadow as both threat and guardian" turn is thoughtful, avoiding simple exorcism. "Softly deliberate" vigilance and the archive method add specificity. However, the emotional arc (lonely custodian preserves institution at personal cost) and the river-stone-as-memory motif feel well-worn without sufficient transformation through lived detail. The shadow's mechanics and the stone's binding power are asserted late without grounding in unique world logic. Risk-taking is modest; the lyric tone and accumulative structure are competent but safe.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Character "sharp-eyed dusk noticer" is introduced in the opening line, drives the discovery (comparing footage, noticing shadow's movement), and makes the key decision (placing the stone). Present in setup, middle choice, and closure. Her observation skill constrains her approach (patient analysis rather than confrontation) and enables the binding. Specific causal pressure: without her noticing the shadow's pattern, no solution emerges. Cost tied to her: she forfeits the stone, ending with "pocket now empty" and "luminous regret." The trait shapes three distinct beats and is indispensable to the plot.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Object "river stone" appears in paragraph 4 (setup), recurs in paragraph 11 (she realizes it is catalyst), and again in paragraphs 13–14 (placement on table, pressing into shadow's path, final disappearance). Handled physically across three beats. Its evolving meaning—from childhood memento to catalyst to binding agent—reweights the stake. Causal pressure: without the stone, no binding occurs. Closure linkage: "pocket now empty" charges the final image with loss. Irreplaceable: no other object could substitute without rewriting the protagonist's personal history and the shadow's origin link. Strong integration, but the mechanics of how it binds (physical stone on screen) are under-explained, slightly reducing necessity score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Core concept "a shadow unbound" is introduced in paragraph 7, drives the central conflict (shadow growing bolder, feeding on hope), and shapes the protagonist's goal (bind it). The shadow's mechanics constrain tactics: she must analyze its path, use the stone as catalyst. Closure: shadow metamorphoses from threat to guardian, directly fulfilling and transforming the concept. Present in setup, middle escalation (paragraphs 8–9), and closure (paragraphs 14–15). The concept is not merely thematic; it alters on-page options and costs. High irreplaceability: the entire plot depends on this exact concept.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Attribute "softly deliberate" is introduced in paragraph 10, repeated verbatim in paragraph 13 ("with a softly deliberate gesture"), and implied in her patient nightly analysis. It constrains method (slow, careful study rather than impulsive action) and enables success (patience reveals the pattern). However, the trait is more told than shown—no on-page beat where haste would have failed and her deliberation visibly saves the day. The cost connection is weak: her deliberation does not itself extract a price; the stone does. Functional but replaceable with "patient" or "methodical" with minor edits. Mid-band integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Action "metamorphose" occurs in paragraph 14 at the climax: "the shadow began to metamorphose, its dark edges curling into tendrils of light, reshaping into a new form." This moment is the major turn, redefining the shadow from threat to guardian and resolving the dominant stake. Prepared by the stone's catalyst role (paragraph 12) and the protagonist's decision (paragraph 13). The transformation drives the closure: without it, no resolution. Present in middle (realization it can transform) and ending (transformation on-page). Highly specific and irreplaceable; no other verb or action could substitute. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Method "by comparing silent video footage from decades apart" is introduced in paragraph 6, employed in paragraph 7 ("By comparing the silent video footage, she had noticed..."), and returns in paragraph 13 ("she queued the footage from thirty years ago, then the current, silent frames"). The method shapes attempts: her discovery of the shadow's pattern depends on it, and the final binding occurs as she plays the footage. Present in setup, middle development, and closure. Causal pressure: without the footage comparison, she cannot identify the threat or its path. Specific mechanics matter (silent, decades apart) and are irreplaceable. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setting "blooming library above clouds" is introduced in paragraph 2, recurs in descriptions (glass-and-steel petals, shelves, archive room), and is present in the final paragraph ("The library continued to bloom above the clouds"). It provides the stakes (preserve this place) and supplies the archive room and monitor as resources. The cloud-world context (earth turned to memory) adds thematic weight. However, the setting does not constrain a key choice—no moment where the library's floating nature or its glass petals force a tactical decision. Postcard-descriptive rather than pressure-driven. Micro-setting (archive table, monitor) does more causal work. Mid-to-high band: present across beats and ending, but only moderately shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Timeframe "after dreams become shareable" is stated in paragraph 2, implied in the library's purpose (shared imagination), and briefly invoked in paragraph 17 ("The world after dreams became shareable held many wonders"). However, it does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on-page. No scene where the shareable-dream mechanic forces a choice or imposes a deadline. The timeframe is ornamental worldbuilding rather than a live constraint. Mentioned in setup and ending but absent from middle development. Swappable with another speculative premise without structural impact. Low-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation "to preserve the shape of hope" is stated explicitly in paragraph 10, drives her nightly analysis (paragraph 11), and culminates in the stone-placement act (paragraph 13) and its cost (paragraph 18). The desire is dramatized through action (comparing footage, realizing stone's role, accepting the sacrifice). Friction: preserving hope costs "a piece of oneself," and the ending acknowledges this trade-off ("luminous regret"). Present in setup (implicit in her role), middle (explicit statement and choice), and closure (cost paid). Strong causal pressure and cost connection. Minor deduction: the motivation could be slightly more embodied in contradictory impulses (e.g., temptation to flee, doubt about the worth of the cost).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tone "luminous regret" is named in paragraph 16 and embodied throughout via imagery: the stone's weight, the shadow's dimming effect, the "warmth that was both comforting and bittersweet," the protagonist's empty pocket and full heart. Coherent across setup (melancholy dusk-noticing), escalation (shadow feeding on hope), and closure (transformation preserves hope but at personal cost). The tone modulates appropriately: reflective early, tense at the climax, bittersweet at the end. It charges the final image strongly. Minor deduction: "luminous regret" is stated as a label in paragraph 16 rather than entirely emergent from scene details, and "luminous" recurs as a modifier (aura, veil, regret) without sufficient variation.</comment>
