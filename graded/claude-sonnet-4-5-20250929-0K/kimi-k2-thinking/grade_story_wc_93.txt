<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara remains abstract throughout: her precognitive visions are declared but never embodied in concrete micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. The "promise to her dying mentor" is a placeholder motive with no textured memory or present cost. Interior states are labeled—"trembling," "flooding her mind"—without contradictory thought or character-particular perception. The final seated moment reads passive; no on-page choice forecloses a path with dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who, where, when anchor by line 3; waived. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: aurora, dust, rocks, and eels build density toward a pattern-recognition climax. Closure unit: Elara lets the glow fade and accepts witnessing over solving—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis). Cost is conceptual ("the promise still lingering, now a quiet hum") but not viscerally felt on the page; the decision to stop lacks a visible trade-off or forfeited alternative that the text dramatizes. The lens holds, but the RR lacks sharp-edged cost, capping mid-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The tidal bluff, aurora, and frictionless sea are vividly rendered and filter through Elara's attention (star dust reacting to the aurora, eels surging). The setting enables the rock-placing and eel-pattern mechanics. However, the environment does not constrain a choice with visible consequence; it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than tactical pressure. Micro-setting (painted rocks, dust pouch) charges the final image but does not alter options mid-scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: decode the eel patterns to honor the mentor's promise and momentarily restore friction. One tightening: Elara places the final rock, dust flares, eels form vectors, then she chooses to let it fade. Agency is renunciation, which fits the Accumulative lens. Cost clarity is weak: "her own shadow dissolving into the aurora" is a potential price shown in vision but not paid or refused on the page; the actual choice to stop carries no dramatized trade-off or tactical consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme—sacred patterns as witnessed rather than solved, transience versus control—emerges through the dust/rock/eel sequence and the final seated moment. The borrowed-dawn motif bookends the piece and reweights meaning at closure. However, the final paragraph moralizes: "the sacred patterns were not meant to be solved, but to be witnessed" is an explicit thesis statement rather than earned image. Thematic Echo in the penultimate paragraph ("she understood") also dilutes resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited, stable POV throughout. Diction trends elevated ("blackened spine," "borrowed dawn," "fragments of glass") but remains internally consistent. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is vague: we learn Elara notices patterns but not how her precognitive mind distinctively filters stimuli under stress. No dialogue to test. Filter verbs ("believed," "realized," "understood") cluster in reflective passages without voice motivation, dulling immediacy slightly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence deploys metaphor or elevated register ("blackened spine," "whispers of ancient eels," "shards of glass," "borrowed dawn," "living vectors," "luminous net"). In peak beats (dust flare, eel surge, final choice) density obscures causal clarity—what exactly happens when she "lets the glow fade"? Paraphrase loop: lines 24–26 restate "patterns in eels, stones, light, dust, aurora" without advancing pressure. Template cadence: "She [verb]" opens six sentences in the final third. Figurative muddle and scaffold artifacts together warrant −1.2, placing mid-5s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Core premise—frictionless world, eel herder, precognitive visions, Fibonacci rock sequences, star dust—assembles prompt elements without transformation. "Borrowed dawn" and "collapsed star dust" read ornamental; substituting "twilight" or "glowing mineral" would not alter logic. The Fibonacci/eel-pattern method is sketched but not dramatized with specificity (how does a teal rock at this position differ from coral at another?). Emotional arc (honoring a promise by witnessing rather than solving) is familiar coming-of-age wisdom. Proximity check: "borrowed light" echoes common poetic phrasing. Transformation test fails: swap names/setting and the arc remains generic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara appears in every paragraph but her choices are passive: she arranges rocks (off-page decision), places a final rock (described action), watches eels, then sits. The decision to let the dust fade is told in summary ("She let…") rather than dramatized with competing impulses. Two gates (setup, closure participation) met; missing middle choice. Ornamental protagonist whose observation dominates over agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Star dust seeds early (paragraph 6), reacts to aurora (paragraph 7), flares when the final rock is placed (paragraph 15), then fades by Elara's choice (paragraph 21). Four beats; causal role in the flare/eel-surge sequence. However, its unique properties are vague ("whisper of dead sun's flame")—generic glowing powder would function identically. Closure linkage present but swappability and lack of specific cost (no dramatized trade-off when she lets it fade) limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The promise to the dying mentor appears in paragraph 5 and lingers in paragraphs 23–24 as "a quiet hum." It motivates the rock-placing but is never tested by a competing desire on the page; no scene dramatizes choosing the promise over safety or another goal. Lyric early-to-final reprise reweights meaning slightly (from urgent to quiet acceptance). Two gates; missing middle friction. Thematic anchor without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Precognition is declared in paragraph 4 ("cursed with precognition") and invoked in paragraphs 12 and 17 ("visions intensified," "flooding her mind with overlapping futures"). Label-only: no on-page scene shows a vision altering her choice or imposing visible cost. The shadow-dissolving price is previewed but neither paid nor refused in dramatized action. Late middle use; ornamental trait without constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Harness" governs the dust-flare sequence (paragraphs 15–19): Elara's rock arrangement triggers the dust reaction and eel surge, momentarily anchoring friction. One major beat. Closure pivot: she chooses not to sustain the harnessing, letting it fade. Two gates met. However, the mechanics are vague—"harnessing" could be replaced with "activating" or "channeling" with no structural change. Mid-band for causal role with high swappability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rock-placing in Fibonacci sequences is introduced in paragraph 9, executed in paragraphs 10–11, and the final rock triggers the flare in paragraph 14. Two beats; setup and payoff clear. The method enables the eel-pattern recognition and dust reaction. However, the mechanics lack specificity: why Fibonacci? How do teal versus coral hues matter? The text asserts mathematical precision without showing tactical choices dependent on it. Functional but underdramatized.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Tidal bluff and aurora frame every scene; the frictionless sea enables the sliding-surf eel movement. Setup immediate; closure reprise ("the world slid, but she slid with it"). The setting does not constrain a mid-scene choice with visible cost—Elara's rock-placing could occur on any shoreline. Lyric resonance at closure (borrowed dawn giving way to day) reweights the opening image. Two gates; missing middle pressure. Atmospheric anchor rather than tactical necessity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"After friction disappears" anchors the premise (paragraph 2) and shapes the world-logic (frictionless sea, paragraph 19 "friction did not fully return"). However, timeframe as a pressure device is absent: no urgency tied to when friction vanished, no countdown forcing Elara's choice. The "borrowed dawn" suggests a brief window but does not tighten tactics. Label-only presence; does not alter decisions.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The desire to understand sacred patterns appears in paragraph 5 (promise to seek them), paragraph 8 (decode via star dust), and paragraph 18 (realization that patterns are interplay of light/dust/aurora). Motivates the rock-placing. However, no on-page friction between this want and a competing fear or cost; the choice to stop is framed as wisdom rather than sacrifice. Two gates; missing dramatized conflict. Thematic motivation without felt trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Borrowed dawn" opens (paragraph 1) and closes (paragraphs 22, 26, 29) the piece, suggesting transience and impermanence. Tone is consistently lyric-elevated, matching the aurora/star-dust imagery. However, tone does not modulate with pressure: the final seated moment and the dust-flare climax share identical register and pacing. Static mood; no cadence shift to charge the ending. Lyric reprise earns mid-band but lacks intensification.</comment>
