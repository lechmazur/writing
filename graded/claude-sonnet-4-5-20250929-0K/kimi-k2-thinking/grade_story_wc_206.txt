<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The repairman's interiority leans heavily on label-only emotion ("doubt," "inadequacy") rather than embodied contradiction. His curse mechanics (rust spreading near dishonesty) constrain surface actions but the protagonist mostly narrates rather than choosing under competing impulses. The climactic moment—speaking "true names" to components—reads as a ritual declaration without visible cost or foreclosed alternative. Backstory about the "careless lie" is told rather than dramatized in a micro-choice that tilts the present.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal scaffolding. The closure unit is a Decisive Change (rust healed, song restored, dawn returns) with conceptual cost legible in the woman's transformation. However, orientation anchors arrive slowly: who/where/when coalesce only after multiple paragraphs of atmospheric setup, costing −0.3. The ticking-clock pressure ("eleven chimes") and the chip-tethering action do tighten options, but the resolution feels largely procedural—no visible tradeoff between competing goods at the final beat. Cost is present (covenant broken, woman freed) but arrives as declarative outcome rather than a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The resonance chamber is vividly rendered ("sound folded upon itself," "silver veins," "quartz pedestal grown in dark for a thousand years") and the setting does constrain: the pedestal amplifies the melody, the chamber's acoustics matter. Sensory detail is dense and purposeful. The final image of dawn "unfolding petals across the sky's black canvas" charges the ending, and the chamber's physicality shapes the repair sequence. Micro-setting (the box, the chip, the tweezers) also functions as constraint, lifting this above postcard description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: restore the melody before midnight or "dawn will never come." The ticking clock (eleven chimes) provides genuine temporal pressure. One meaningful tightening occurs when the repairman's own doubt creates a "false note" and rust blooms, forcing him to speak "true names" to clear the air. However, the resolution feels procedural—once he speaks truth, the chip glows, the music plays, the covenant breaks. No visible tradeoff between competing goods; the protagonist's action is more ritual than renunciation. Cost is conceptual (covenant broken) but not felt as a trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (honesty vs. rust/corrosion, mending as act of truth) emerges from the repairman's curse and the covenant mechanics. The final image—music box playing "truthful tune that would never break"—offers a resonant answer to the central question without overt moralizing. However, the woman's revelation as "the city's forgotten song" and the line "to mend what isn't torn" veer close to thematic echo in the final paragraph. Subtext operates in the rust mechanics and the philosopher's stone's warmth, but the ending articulates meaning a bit too directly ("let honesty sing").</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Voice carries a heightened, quasi-mythic register ("tinkersong wonder," "luminous melody," "ancient harmonics") that coheres across beats. Diction is consistent but occasionally slips into stock fantasy phrasing ("malignant flower," "serpent of corrosion"). The woman's single line of dialogue ("The song must play before the clock strikes twelve, or dawn will never come") reads stiff and expository. Perceptual signature is present (the repairman notices gears, vibrations, resonance) but not deeply idiosyncratic. No purposeful elision or POV withholding that serves closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and many lines carry strong imagery ("each tick a falling grain of sand," "spider silk and moonlight drawn from memory"). However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: rust spreading/blooming/retreating is described in adjacent paragraphs with synonym churn; the covenant "whispered temptations" then "screamed in defeat" in near-succession. Template cadence runs: "He wound… He spoke… He placed…" stack without variance. Stock metaphors ("malignant flower," "serpent of corrosion") appear in high-pressure beats. Clarity is maintained, but density suffers from repetitive phrasing. Deduct −0.8 for loops and template cadence touching the climax.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Core premise (repairman cursed by dishonesty, must restore a magical music box) is functional but derivative of steampunk/fantasy templates. The "philosopher's stone chip" and "covenant of rust" are genre-standard rather than fresh. Specific details (resonance chamber, meteoric iron tweezers, quartz pedestal grown in darkness) add texture but do not transform the underlying repair-quest arc. The woman-as-dawn twist arrives late and feels convenient. The story commits to its premise but lacks a non-obvious synthesis; removing the rust/honesty mechanics would leave a standard quest. Derivative premise penalty −0.8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The repairman is present throughout and his actions (lifting the chip, polishing gears, winding the spring) drive beats. His choice to "speak true names" clears the corrupted air and enables the final repair. However, most beats are procedural execution rather than choices between competing goods. Setup: early. Development: middle choices constrained by rust. Payoff: present at closure as agent of repair. Two gates met; causal pressure moderate; closure linkage strong. Swappability: a different cursed artisan could perform similar beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The philosopher's stone chip appears early ("glimmered among the gears"), is handled mid-story ("lifted the stone chip, feeling its warmth"), and flares at closure ("chip flared, and the covenant of rust screamed in defeat"). Three beats, all causally linked: the chip's alchemical power must be tethered to the melody to restore the song. Removing the chip would break the repair logic. Setup: early. Development: tethering action. Payoff: flares at climax. Specificity: its warmth and glow are irreplaceable. Cost: the tethering action is high-stakes but the chip itself does not impose a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "covenant of rust" is named early and shapes the protagonist's curse: lies cause rust, honesty heals. It pressures the repairman throughout (his joints ache, rust blooms when he doubts). The covenant "screamed in defeat" at closure when truth burns through. Setup: early. Development: constrains middle actions (must speak truth to components). Payoff: broken at climax. Causal pressure: the covenant forces honesty. Specificity: the rust mechanic is central. However, it reads more as thematic metaphor than a pact with visible terms or antagonist. Cost: breaking it heals the repairman, but no visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Wilts near dishonesty" is the repairman's curse, introduced in line one. It constrains him throughout: rust spreads when lies fill the air, his knuckles flare when he doubts. This attribute enables the central conflict (must work with absolute honesty). Setup: immediate. Development: visible in middle beats (rust blooms, then retreats). Payoff: healed at closure. One visible cost: his own doubt fouls the air and causes pain. However, the trait is more atmospheric constraint than a single pivotal choice-enabler. Swappability: a different honesty-curse could function similarly.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Tether" is the core repair action: "tether the chip to the box's heart" with "a thread of pure intent," later "a filament of spider silk and moonlight." The act of tethering occurs at the climax and enables the melody to play. Setup: method named mid-story. Development: preparation (polishing gears, speaking true names) leads to tethering. Payoff: "The connection sang as it formed" and music pours forth. Causal pressure: without tethering, no repair. Specificity: the act is irreplaceable. Cost: requires "pure intent" under pressure. Late signal (second third) caps slightly, but closure linkage is strong.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Mending what isn't torn" is introduced as paradox mid-story: "tuning the resonance before the music failed, preventing the break before it happened." The method shapes the repair logic (preemptive fix), but it is articulated rather than demonstrated in a distinct beat. The phrase recurs in the final paragraph ("to mend what isn't torn, to tether hope to mechanism"), reading as thematic echo. Setup: mid-story. Development: mentioned as concept. Payoff: restated at closure. Swappability: the repair could be framed as "restoring" without this exact paradox. Cost: none visible.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The resonance chamber is present throughout: "beneath the clock tower, where sound itself could be shaped like glass." The chamber's acoustics matter: "sound folded upon itself," "silver veins" amplify tone, the quartz pedestal "hold[s] sound like memory." The repairman places the box on the pedestal to amplify the melody. Setup: early. Development: chamber's properties constrain the repair method. Payoff: the melody fills the chamber and light stitches darkness. Causal pressure: the chamber's resonance is necessary for success. Specificity: no generic workshop. Cost: none visible, but the setting shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"In the balance" and the ticking clock ("eleven chimes echoed from above; one remained") tighten decisions. Time pressure is live: "the tower's pendulum sliced seconds like a scythe, each tick a falling grain of sand." The deadline (midnight) is clear and consequences explicit ("or dawn will never come"). Setup: early (client's warning). Development: clock tracked ("timeframe hung in the balance," "one remained"). Payoff: the song plays before the twelfth chime. Causal pressure: time narrows options. Specificity: the clock is irreplaceable. Cost: the rush forces precision under stress.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To reclaim the light stolen by midnight" is stated early as motivation. The "luminous melody that once guided lost children home" and the client's warning ("or dawn will never come") frame the stakes. However, the motivation is declared rather than dramatized in conflicted choices. The repairman never hesitates or weighs his own safety against the children's need; he simply proceeds. Setup: early. Development: mentioned but not tested. Payoff: dawn returns. Causal linkage: the goal drives action. Cost: none visible—no friction between want and price. The motivation is functional but not embodied in a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Tinkersong wonder" pervades the prose: "symphony of tinkersong wonder, each note a gear clicking into eternity," "meteoric iron tweezers," "spider silk and moonlight drawn from memory." The tone is heightened, quasi-mythic, and consistent across beats. It modulates slightly (darker when the covenant whispers, lighter when dawn returns) but remains in the same register. Setup: immediate in voice. Development: tone supports the magical-realist repair. Payoff: the ending's "truthful tune that would never break" charges the final image. Coherence: strong. Modulation: moderate. The tone is present but not transformative at closure.</comment>
