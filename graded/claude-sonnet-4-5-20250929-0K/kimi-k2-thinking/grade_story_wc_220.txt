<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Wick's motivation is concrete and embodied through scent-tracking instincts repurposed toward connection rather than bodies. His interior contradiction—sharp nose, heart elsewhere—drives the journey and Maya's archive revelation earns its emotional weight through prior deployment details. The final curl among cylinders shows genuine transformation with visible cost (leaving the settlement, accepting she's gone). Minor slip: the "translate distance into closeness" epiphany arrives slightly over-articulated for a bloodhound's interior voice at that exact moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Wick finds the vault and plays Maya's messages, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where his search ends with her voice filling silence—felt cost in accepting she won't return physically. Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the journey gathers fragments (cylinder, leaf, riddle, scent memory) that cohere at the vault discovery. Orientation anchors quickly (settlement, Wick, retired). One meaningful deepening occurs when the monogram reveals Maya's identity, narrowing his goal and raising emotional stakes. The three-day trek compresses cleanly without losing causal thread.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cracked wasteland, scrap mountain, and vault constrain Wick's route and the leaf-pattern hatch mechanism requires the preserved object to open—setting directly enables closure. Micro-details (crushed radiator water, ration packs, buried uniform scrap) ground survival choices and the scent memory navigation. The corroded shipping container and vault's cylinder-lined chamber charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy fits a bloodhound POV (scent-first perception, "wild hush" as absence of bird cries). Spatial choreography remains clear across the three-day trek.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (reconnection with Maya) signals early and tightens when the monogram reveals her identity, narrowing Wick's goal from abstract connection to specific recovery. The riddle's answer—presence bridges distance—requires Wick's agency (the journey, placing the leaf) and forecloses his scavenger life with visible cost. The vault discovery reverses his isolation into intimate proximity via recorded voice. Pressure accumulates through scent memory, water scarcity, and the three-day crossing, cohering under the Accumulative lens. One strong tightening and a clear trade-off (settlement safety vs. archive discovery) earn high-band entry.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (bridging distance through preserved presence) emerges organically from the phonograph mechanism, wax leaf, and vault archive without thesis statements. The final image—Wick curled among cylinders—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: closeness exists in grooves and voice, not physical return. "Tinted revelations" integrates as the warped voices and aged cylinder deliver meaning through filters of rust and grief. The autumn leaf's vein-map and fire-color subtly contrast the wasteland without symbolic shouting. Subtext operates in Maya's note timing ("three days before") and Wick's scent-hallucination of her uniform.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds stable with bloodhound-specific perception (parsing frequencies "like reading Braille with his eardrums," scent memory navigation). Diction remains grounded in canine interiority without anthropomorphic overreach. The prose modulates effectively from settlement détente to trek urgency to vault intimacy. Kess and the archivist exchange is brief but distinct (raccoon pragmatism vs. Wick's driven focus). Minor slip: "intuitively descriptive" and "translating pressure waves into syntax" drift slightly into analytical register for a dog's lived experience, though the metaphor recovers quickly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines advance place, memory, or object significance. Rhythm varies appropriately (short beats during trek, longer reflection in vault). No paraphrase loops detected. The "wild hush" motif recurs purposefully without becoming mechanical. Minor deductions: "The stench of metal and memory" and "a world that had screamed itself raw" verge on stock post-apocalyptic phrasing. "His mind worked intuitively descriptive" is a slightly awkward construction that momentarily stalls momentum. Figurative density in the opening paragraph (rusted spine, screamed raw, wild hush) clusters without pattern-teaching, though the images remain legible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The bloodhound-as-tracker protagonist avoiding bodies post-war is a strong inversion; the phonograph-cylinder archive and wax-leaf key offer specific, non-obvious synthesis. The riddle mechanism and vault discovery feel earned in hindsight through scent-memory setup and the monogram reveal. The post-resource-war scrapyard setting risks template territory but the leaf/cylinder pairing and canine POV provide fresh angles. Risk: the three-day trek and vault discovery follow familiar quest beats; transformation lies in the emotional particularity (Maya's ordinary-moment recordings) rather than structural surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Wick's retired-bloodhound status drives his scent-parsing ability (cylinder voices, buried uniform, riddle navigation) across multiple beats and his choice to leave the settlement for the vault. The retirement contrast (bodies vs. salvage, now connection) reweights at closure when he finds Maya's archive. His professional instinct enables the journey's success and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The wax-preserved leaf appears early (shipping container), its vein pattern becomes the hatch symbol (middle choice: he must carry it and recognize the match), and it unlocks the vault (closure mechanism). The leaf's fragile, fire-colored map contrasts the wasteland and its preservation mirrors the phonograph archive theme. Three beats, causal gate participation, high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Tinted revelations" shapes the cylinder-listening beat ("colored by age and exhausted hope," "through a filter of rust and grief") and reappears at closure ("In grooves of the past, in tinted revelations, he found his answer"). It enables the warped-voice riddle mechanism and charges the theme. However, the concept remains somewhat atmospheric rather than imposing a visible tactical cost or hard constraint; it colors interpretation more than forcing a choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Intuitively descriptive" is labeled ("His mind worked intuitively descriptive, translating pressure waves into syntax") and enables Wick to parse the cylinder riddle, which directs his journey. It appears in the key middle beat and connects to his bloodhound training repurposed. The trait could be more embodied as instinct-without-words rather than semi-analytical; the phrasing risks telling over showing, capping higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The riddle ("When distance is measured not in miles but in silences, what bridges the gap?") appears early (cylinder playback), drives Wick's three-day trek eastward, and its answer (presence itself) unlocks the vault hatch when he places the leaf. The riddle's logic structures his navigation and the answer's realization is the pivot that grants closure access. Two key beats plus closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Reading grooves in the phonograph cylinder is signaled early (Kess's cracked-horn phonograph, lithium battery exchange), provides the riddle text that drives the journey, and the vault contains thousands more cylinders that deliver closure (Maya's voice filling silence). The method's mechanics matter: needle-drop, warped voices, "parsing frequencies," and the grooves-as-archive motif. Three beats, high specificity, indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The scrapyard settlement provides the opening anchor, supplies the phonograph via Kess, and Wick leaves it for the scrap mountain—his departure from salvage work to the vault is the journey's frame. The cracked wasteland forces survival tactics (radiator water, ration packs) and the easternmost scrap mountain houses the vault. Setting constrains route and resources, charges atmosphere, and the vault's cylinder-lined interior delivers closure's charged space.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"After the last resource war" establishes the wasteland state, the too-many-bodies context for Wick's retirement, and Maya's note is dated "three days before the final bomb"—the timeframe anchors backstory and loss. The three-day trek measures Wick's commitment. However, the post-war setting functions more as static backdrop than live pressure; no urgency tightens decisions during the journey itself, and the historical framing doesn't constrain present tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Wick's desire to "translate distance into closeness" is voiced by Maya in memory, tested through his scent-driven search and three-day journey, and resolved at closure when he curls among the cylinders—closeness achieved through archived voice. The motivation drives every major choice (playing the cylinder, decoding the riddle, leaving the settlement, opening the vault) and friction appears in his "heart elsewhere" and the impossibility of physical reunion. Felt cost in accepting presence-without-return.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Wild hush" establishes tone in paragraph one ("that particular silence of a world that had screamed itself raw," scavenger birds circling without cries), modulates through the trek ("deepened at night, broken only by whisper of sand"), and the closure inverts it ("the silence was broken by love preserved in grooves"). Tone coheres across turns and charges the ending contrast between outer wasteland quiet and inner voice-filled vault. The hush both oppresses and finally yields.</comment>
