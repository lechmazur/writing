<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is sustained through embodied detail ("doubt pooled in her sternum like dark matter"), but her decision-making reads largely reactive rather than driven by internal contradiction. The "quietly enthusiastic" attribute appears as label-only repetition without constraining choices or creating visible tradeoffs. Motivation is declared ("wavelength align with purpose") but never tested against a competing want or fear that would fracture her resolve.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece establishes pattern through repetition (coins cast three times, static bursts intensify, backwards prophecy fragments attention) and achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure when Elara "became the new signal." Cost is felt conceptually—she dissolves into function—but the final image's pressure is diluted by the preceding summary-heavy paragraphs that tell transformation rather than dramatize a final precipitating choice. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph; no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ambered observatory deck recurs with purposeful specificity (resin walls, compressed nebulae, deck shuddering) and constrains Elara's ritual casting of lots. The telescope's brass inscription anchors the backwards prophecy, and the amber walls "glowed from within" charges the final image with evolutionary resonance. Strong setting work lifts the score, though the void-beyond-void telescope moment reads ornamental rather than action-shaping.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—"wavelength align with purpose or dissolve"—is signaled early and sustains pressure. The three coin-casts provide structural tightening, but the escalation reads as repetition-with-variation rather than a meaningful narrowing of options or raising of cost. The climactic moment ("she had found the alignment") arrives as realization-summary rather than a choice that forecloses a live alternative with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of alignment-versus-dissolution emerges through the backwards prophecy, static bursts, and wavelength imagery. The final line "Having been, she will be" and Elara becoming "the decision itself" offer a resonant non-literal answer. However, the piece edges toward thematic echo when Elara articulates "not to save what was lost, but to honor its frequency"—a near-thesis statement that reduces ambiguity. The recurring coins and static motifs accumulate meaning without over-explaining.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single POV with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature ("static bursts...a dialect of loss," "tuning fork struck against the anvil of entropy"). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that strains plausibility for moment-to-moment perception under pressure ("compressed nebulae, whole galaxies frozen in their death-throes" reads more authorial than focalized). No head-hopping; the voice is consistent but occasionally sacrifices immediacy for conceptual density.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Heavy overwriting in figurative density: nearly every sentence in the opening third carries metaphor or elevated image ("ambered observatory," "fossilized reality," "cosmic afterbirth noise," "causality's corpse"), creating a drumbeat rhythm that flattens rather than accelerates pressure. Paraphrase loops appear: "understanding static bursts" recurs three times with synonym churn (distill meaning, find the signal, feeling the shape of silence). Template cadence in the middle third ("She had spent…," "She needed…," "She grabbed…," "She walked…," "She understood…," "She would…") triggers −0.6. The closure beat is touched by summary-heavy phrasing ("her own wavelength stretch outward") rather than concrete action, escalating the line-debt penalty to −0.8. Filter-verb stacks ("began to distill," "needed to understand," "realized she must distill") add −0.5. Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack and the high-pressure beat guideline: baseline −1.4 in Q7, escalated to −1.7 for touching closure, plus disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The backwards-prophecy and collapsed-cosmos frame offers conceptual ambition, but the execution leans on stock speculative furniture: observatory, coins-as-coordinates, static-as-language, tuning-fork metaphor. The "Decision Maker" role and "cast lots" ritual read as template fantasy rather than transformation of familiar material through character-specific stakes. Emotional truth is present in Elara's doubt and enthusiasm, but the plot's emotional arc could transfer wholesale to a different setting with renamed objects—failing the transformation test.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade>comment>Elara casts lots three times (setup, middle, closure), satisfying the three-gate model. However, the casting reads as ritual repetition rather than decisions that create key turns; each cast intensifies atmosphere but does not narrow her options or change her knowledge in a way that alters tactics. The final cast confirms rather than precipitates her transformation. Functional but largely ornamental pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade>comment>The collection of foreign coins appears in all three gates: described in the opening, cast twice in the middle, and dissolved into light at closure. The coins' "wavelengths" and "interference patterns" provide causal pressure (they hum, synchronize with her heartbeat, form a mandala). However, their specific foreignness or individual properties are never leveraged; generic ritual tokens could replace them with minor edits. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, but swappability limits irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade>comment>The backwards prophecy ("You must have already chosen") is introduced early, recurs as interpretive frame ("this outcome meant she had already succeeded and failed simultaneously"), and anchors the final line ("Having been, she will be"). It shapes Elara's interpretive stance and charges the closure image. However, it does not constrain her on-page choices in a way that forecloses options or imposes visible cost; it functions more as thematic resonance than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade>comment>The attribute "quietly enthusiastic" is mentioned three times as label-only descriptor without dramatized constraint or tradeoff. It does not enable or prevent a single on-page action, nor does it create friction with another trait or stake. The final "quietly enthusiastic and drenched in stellar doubt" reads as ornamental parallelism rather than character-specific pressure. Present but functionally inert.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade>comment>Distillation appears in two beats: "began to distill meaning from the noise" and "must distill not information, but intent." The action is thematically coherent and tied to the static bursts, but the mechanics are abstract; the reader cannot trace what Elara does differently in each distillation attempt. The final transformation ("distilled existence down to this") reprises the concept but does not turn on a specific distillation choice. Functional across beats but swappable with "decode" or "interpret."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade>comment>Understanding static bursts is signaled early ("spent eternity learning the method"), attempted mid-scene ("distill meaning from the noise"), and resolved at closure ("understood...feeling the shape of silence"). The method's mechanics remain vague, but its escalating pressure (static intensifies, coalesces into voice, then ceases) shapes the arc. The final silence charges the closure image. Functional method with modest causal pressure and clear closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade>comment>The ambered observatory deck appears in the opening line, recurs with specific pressure (resin walls, compressed nebulae, deck shuddering), and becomes "her vessel now, ambered and eternal" at closure. The setting constrains ritual action (coins spun across the deck) and supplies the telescope inscription that introduces the prophecy. The amber walls' glow at the end reweights the deck from tomb to potential birth. Strong causal and closure integration; environment meaningfully shapes both tactics and final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade>comment>The timeframe "after the universe contracts" is declared in the opening but does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page. Elara has "spent eternity" learning, and "tonight was different"—but no clock, countdown, or temporal pressure forces her choices. The contraction functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than a live constraint. Present in setup and thematically coherent, but no middle or closure pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade>comment>The motivation "to wavelength align with purpose" is stated early ("must wavelength align...or dissolve"), tested in the middle coin-casts, and achieved at closure ("the wavelength alignment held"). It creates a binary stake (align or dissolve) that sustains pressure. However, the desire is never dramatized in conflict with a competing want or fear; Elara pursues alignment without visible internal friction or tradeoff. Strong setup and closure linkage, but lacks the contradictory impulse that would elevate cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade>comment>Stellar doubt is introduced early ("doubt pooled in her sternum"), recurs through mid-scene ("the backwards prophecy...led her here, to this moment of stellar doubt made manifest"), and persists at closure ("quietly enthusiastic and drenched in stellar doubt"). The tone modulates coherently with pressure (doubt intensifies as static screams, softens at alignment). The final pairing of enthusiasm and doubt charges the image without false resolution. Coherent tone that supports accumulative pressure and resonates at closure.</comment>
