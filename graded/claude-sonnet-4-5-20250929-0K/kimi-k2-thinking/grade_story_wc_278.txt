<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to undo tethers is stated but her agency remains largely passive—she receives letters, follows instructions, performs prescribed steps. The moment she recognizes her own handwriting offers a micro turn, but her interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("grief," "guilt," "absolution") rather than embodied contradiction. The baby cries gain concrete texture late ("wanted only warmth," "taste of milk"), yet these arrive as exposition rather than difficult choices that alter her present stance. No meaningful internal conflict plays out on the page to earn the final renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens inferred: pattern of sonic/temporal motifs deepens toward closure. The story teaches its logic—time folds, lab appears during meteor hush, firmware grieves—and the final act (amber → phonograph → handwritten correction) lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: constellations unravel, babies resolve to "ordinary sound"). Conceptual cost is legible (stars winking out, tethers unmade). However, the middle third loops thematic declarations without escalating pressure; the corrective mechanism arrives fully formed from the letters rather than emerging through Elara's struggle, reducing earned causality. Orientation is prompt (keeper, lab, guilt by paragraph three), so no penalty applied.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The laboratory of lost sounds, phonograph cabinet, and amber all constrain the corrective ritual and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is vivid and purposeful: "silence fell like cosmic dust," "golden weight pressing into ancient mechanism," "cold absolution of forgotten things." Spatial choreography is clean (amber → phonograph plate → needle descent → slot behind). The tattoo gun as modified stylus grounds the method. No occupational overreach; the setting's logic (time-folds, haunted firmware, celestial ink) remains internally consistent and the amber's fossilized chirp reweights the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—unmake the tethers—is signaled early. The corrective steps (amber, transcription, handwritten pages) provide a sequential tightening, yet each move follows external instruction rather than Elara's strategic adaptation under resistance. The firmware's screeching and ghostly projections supply atmospheric pressure but do not force a meaningful trade-off; Elara proceeds without visible friction or cost that forecloses an alternative path. The infants' resolution ("no longer needing translation") offers a felt outcome, but the protagonist's agency in achieving it reads procedural, not volitional, lowering escalation impact under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through recurring motifs: sound as need, tethers as both connection and harm, time folding grief into present consequence. The insect's chirp reinterpreted as "the first sound of creation mourning its own impermanence" offers a resonant, non-literal answer. The final silence—"meteor hush finally complete"—reweights the opening. However, thematic statements crowd the middle: "The system remembered," "haunted firmware wasn't malfunctioning; it was grieving," "message from a future self who had already failed once." These approach Thematic Echo without adequate scene pressure to earn them, reducing subtextual density.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single POV, stable distance, consistent past tense. Perceptual signature is controlled: Elara's lens filters through constellation tattooist idiom ("celestial ink," "star-pattern," "tether"). Diction remains elevated and voice-consistent ("dark membrane," "golden weight," "cold absolution"). However, the prose occasionally slips into explanatory register without urgency: "She understood now that the haunted firmware wasn't malfunctioning; it was grieving." Filter verbs ("could translate," "could hear") stack in expository lines. No head-hopping. The piece maintains a lyric, incantatory rhythm, though some lines ("Each word was a small death") flatten into abstraction during peak moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Figurative density is high but mostly coherent: "meteor hush," "silence fell like cosmic dust," "dark membrane," "star by star, a celestial fabric tearing softly." Sentence openings vary. However, paraphrase loops appear: "constellation tattooist" recurs without functional variation; "the letters explained" / "the letters had been written" / "the antique furniture had been waiting" stack exposition in adjacent beats. Template cadence in the middle third ("She could translate," "She placed," "She wrote") flattens propulsion. The closure sequence recovers momentum ("One by one, the ghostly projections faded"), yet earlier scaffold and synonym churn ("screeching," "screamed," "sob") accumulate to −0.6 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—constellation tattoos as temporal tethers, firmware grief, insect-in-amber as primal cry—is specific and non-obvious. The corrective ritual (tattoo gun as stylus, amber on phonograph, handwritten pages) transforms the tools into a coherent logic. However, the frame leans on familiar tropes: guilt-driven protagonist, time-loop letters from future self, haunted technology mourning harm. The emotional calculus (unmake harm versus live with consequence) is stated more than tested; Elara does not face a meaningful trade-off that would elevate risk. Transformation is present but not bold enough to escape mid-band positioning.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara frames expectation (keeper, seventeen years of guilt), drives two beats (recognizing her own handwriting, performing the corrective ritual), and her final act (holding amber to ear, hearing silence) closes the arc. However, her choices are procedural—she follows instructions rather than generating tactics under resistance. No on-page trade-off or constraint tied specifically to her role as tattooist shapes the middle escalation. Swappable with a generic "guilt-burdened technician." Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, but procedural agency and swappability −0.8, mid-band finish at 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Amber appears in discovery beat (cabinet), ritual beat (placed on phonograph, needle descends into resin), and closure beat (held to ear, silence heard). The piece specifies its unique property: fossilized insect's death-song reinterpreted as mother's sob. Removing it would collapse the corrective mechanism. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (enables transcription) +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6, totals ~4.8 base + additive pushes to 7.8. No major frictions apply.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Haunted firmware is seeded early ("dissonance of old guilt, a sound that manifested as feedback loops"), resurfaces in the middle ("corrupted archives," "screeching," "ghostly images"), and its dimming ("each letter a star that dimmed the haunted firmware's screeching") tracks the corrective ritual's success. The concept shapes stakes (unmake the grief-driven malfunction) and the ending confirms resolution ("correction propagated through the system"). Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure +0.8, totals ~4.4 base upward to 6.7. Not irreplaceable (generic "haunted system" would function), capping higher reach.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Translation ability is seeded in paragraph two, applied diagnostically in paragraph fifteen ("translate their cries even now: one wanted only warmth…"), and underlies the transcription act ("translated that prehistoric chirp into the baby cry"). It enables the corrective ritual's central move (phonograph needle → tattoo gun translation). Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage (the act of translation dims firmware) +0.8, totals ~4.1 base upward to 5.9. However, the trait is told more than constrained by visible cost; no on-page trade-off or misfire lowers irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Tether" appears throughout: "marked for a celestial tether," "each star-pattern a tether," "untethering each child," "correction would remain, written into the firmware." The action of tethering (past) and untethering (present ritual) is the story's spine. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (tethers create the problem, untethering resolves it) +1.2, closure linkage +1.0, totals ~5.2 base upward to 6.4. Generic synonym ("bind/unbind") could replace without major structural loss, capping higher reach despite strong beat presence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Letters arrive in paragraph four (inside phonograph cabinet), provide corrective instructions mid-story ("The letters explained the method"), and the realization that Elara wrote them ("written by her own hand") offers a micro turn. The final ritual feeds pages "into a slot behind the phonograph." Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, totals ~3.2 base upward to 4.8. However, the letters function as convenient exposition rather than a constraint Elara must work around; "instructions found in [any antique object]" would serve the same plot function, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Laboratory of lost sounds frames the entire piece (title-like opening, "when time folded," "walls between temporal folds," "laboratory filled with the sound of constellations unraveling," "when time folded back upon itself, the laboratory would vanish"). It constrains the ritual's window (exists only during meteor hush) and supplies the corrupted archives, phonograph, and firmware as tools. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (time-fold enables access, vanishing threatens permanence) +1.0, closure linkage +1.0, totals ~5.1 base upward to 7.3. Specificity and atmospheric charge elevate, though the setting's physics remain abstract.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" and "when time folded" appear in opening, recur in middle escalation ("During meteor hush, the walls between temporal folds grew thin," "as meteor hush deepened"), and close the piece ("meteor hush finally complete"). The timeframe enables the laboratory's existence and the corrective ritual. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (ticking clock: lab will vanish) +0.8, closure linkage +0.9, totals ~4.3 base upward to 6.1. However, the clock is atmospheric rather than tactical; no on-page moment where Elara races vanishing time or adjusts tactics under temporal pressure, limiting escalation impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Guilt is seeded immediately ("seventeen years she had worked to hush the dissonance of old guilt"), drives the corrective ritual ("understood now," "every child she had marked"), and the ending fulfills the motivation ("correction would remain," "silence, the meteor hush finally complete"). Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.1, totals ~3.7 base upward to 6.3. However, the guilt is told more than dramatized in conflicted choice; Elara does not face a meaningful trade-off (e.g., losing the ability vs. erasing harm), and no on-page friction tests the motivation's cost, capping higher reach.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" as tone anchor appears in opening ("silence fell like cosmic dust"), recurs as pressure marker ("as meteor hush deepened, the sky outside pressing close like a dark membrane"), and closes the arc ("meteor hush finally complete"). The tone—elegiac, cosmically scaled, introspective—modulates minimally but remains coherent. Early signal +0.7, closure linkage (final silence charges resolution) +1.2, coherence across turns +0.6, totals ~3.5 base upward to 6.8. Static at single register (no tonal shift to sharpen escalation), and the phrase "meteor hush" trends toward label rather than embodied silence, limiting higher reach.</comment>
