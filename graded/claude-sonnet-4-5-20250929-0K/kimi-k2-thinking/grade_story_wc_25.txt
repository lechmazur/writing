<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marek's expertise in acoustic architecture and his ability to identify walks is specific and consistent, driving his choices under pressure. However, the protagonist remains competent throughout without meaningful internal contradiction or struggle—his plan works perfectly, leaving no visible cost or foreclosed path. The smuggler's crew is caught, but Marek's stance and capabilities are unchanged. Micro-choices exist but don't reveal a hierarchy of values with visible trade-offs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal. The story anchors orientation clearly (labyrinth keeper, Port Kessler, geomagnetic storm). The challenge from the smuggler provides a clear inciting incident, and the whisper's journey through the labyrinth follows motivated steps. However, the closure lacks visible cost—Marek wins the bet, keeps the corridor, and gains the coin as a trophy with no path foreclosed or stance altered. The final paragraphs summarize his reputation rather than landing a decisive on-page change or renunciation with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is vividly rendered with corrugated walls, seven-high stacks, and acoustic properties that actively constrain Marek's method. The geomagnetic storm amplifies metal surfaces into resonating chambers, directly enabling the whisper's travel. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout (central junction, eastern edge, north gate). The environment shapes tactics and charges the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving whispers travel farther than shouts to keep the northern corridor—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation is minimal: Marek executes a pre-calculated plan without adaptation or setback, and the reversal (catching the smuggler's crew) happens off-stage through the watchman's alarm. No visible price is paid; the protagonist gains everything (corridor, coin, enhanced reputation) without forfeiting a live option or facing a trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The theme—precision whispers build better pathways than noise—emerges through concrete action (the tuning-fork key, folded maps, acoustic nodes) rather than assertion. The zodiac coin and folded maps recur with shifted meaning. However, the final paragraphs state the theme overtly ("he'd proven that whispers travel farther than shouts...calculated spontaneity") rather than trusting the image to resonate, and the ending moralizes about "silence builds better bridges than thunder," reducing ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and focalized through Marek's expertise. Vocabulary is controlled and voice-specific ("corrugated," "acoustic architecture," "ghost walks"). Dialogue is minimal but purposeful ("You're the one who says whispers carry further than screams"). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. Distance modulates appropriately with tension, and perceptual signature (identifying walks, hearing vibrations) is consistent and character-particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the middle section (key as tuning fork, coin vibration, harmonic nodes). However, the opening and closing contain scaffold phrases ("He'd been waiting for this moment," "From then on, the longshoremen said") and thematic paraphrase loops in the final four paragraphs that restate the whisper-versus-shout thesis multiple times. The phrase "calculated spontaneity" appears twice without reweighting. Minor template cadence in exposition passages ("His method seemed mad...Now Marek understood").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The combination of zodiac-folded maps, a tuning-fork key, and acoustic architecture in a container labyrinth during a geomagnetic storm is specific and non-obvious. The transformation of the labyrinth into an instrument is fresh. However, the framing (maintenance worker with secret knowledge proves his skill to a doubting challenger) and the perfect-execution arc follow a familiar template. The story commits fully to its premise and demonstrates conceptual integrity, with sufficient specificity to avoid the derivative-premise penalty.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marek's role as labyrinth keeper frames the entire story and his expertise drives the method. He makes the key choice to whisper at the central junction and strike the tuning fork, altering tactics. However, his decisions feel pre-scripted rather than adaptive under pressure; he executes a plan he'd rehearsed "a hundred times in his mind." Present in setup, middle action, and closure, with causal pressure, but swappable with "sound engineer" or similar expert without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The zodiac coin appears in three beats: the smuggler presses it into Marek's palm, Marek uses it to vibrate the whisper (pressing it against the wall, striking it with the key), and it hangs from his key ring at the end as a trophy. It enables the acoustic method (vibration medium) and recurs with shifted meaning (from challenge token to badge). However, its Gemini symbolism and zodiac properties are ornamental; a plain coin would serve the same acoustic function. Two gates (setup, payoff) with functional middle use, but specificity is low.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Folded maps are central to Marek's method: "each fold represented a harmonic node where sound would amplify and redirect." They appear in setup (unfolding the twelve-crease map), shape middle tactics (the whisper follows mapped routes: "turn at Cancer, echo through Leo"), and return at closure ("kept his paper maps folded in twelve creases," "if you knew how to fold the map just right"). The maps constrain and enable the acoustic solution, making them indispensable. Removing them would require a complete structural rewrite.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Marek's ability to identify walks is signaled early ("identifying people's walks: the stagger of drunk longshoremen...the prowling toe-heel of thieves") and used twice: recognizing the smuggler's "too smooth" walk and identifying "each person's walk in the chaos" during his sprint. It characterizes him vividly and enables recognition of the smuggler. However, the trait doesn't constrain a choice or impose a visible cost; it's a skill that works perfectly without trade-off. Functional across beats but not essential to closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The smuggler's challenge ("Prove it before the storm ends, or I take the northern corridor forever") is the inciting incident that sets all action in motion. It defines the stakes, imposes the time limit, and drives Marek to execute his acoustic proof. The challenge appears in setup, structures the middle (Marek's whisper and sprint), and resolves at closure (smuggler caught, Marek keeps corridor). Removing it would collapse the narrative entirely. All three gates, strong causal pressure, and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The key is seeded early ("a tarnished key with no apparent lock, hanging from his belt") with mystery ("opening the way sound travels"), revealed as a tuning fork at the climax ("struck it against the coin, and the specific frequency...resonated"), and used to enable the whisper's travel through harmonic amplification. It appears in three beats and is indispensable to the method. However, it arrives as a solution to a problem it didn't help create; no earlier beat depends on it. Strong closure linkage and causal pressure, but late functional reveal limits integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is the story's stage and instrument. Seven-high stacks create the amphitheater, corrugated walls carry the whisper, narrow corridors (Virgo) amplify sound, and the eastern edge/north gate locations structure the climax. The geomagnetic storm turns metal into resonating chambers. The setting constrains Marek's method (acoustic pathways) and enables his proof. Spatial choreography is clear and essential; no other setting could support this story. All three gates, high specificity, and direct closure impact.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The geomagnetic storm creates urgency ("before the storm ends"), disables technology (frozen cranes, dark screens), and provides the amplification Marek needs ("the perfect storm provided the power"). It appears in setup, pressures the middle action (Marek must act during the storm window), and subsides at closure ("the storm subsided"). The timeframe tightens decisions and makes the method possible. However, elapsed time within the storm is vague; we don't track the clock ticking down. Strong across all three gates with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Marek's desire to prove whispers travel farther than shouts is stated early by the smuggler and drives the entire plot. It shapes his method (whispering instead of shouting) and is validated at closure (the watchman hears the whisper, the smuggler is caught). However, the motivation is given to him by the challenge rather than arising from internal conflict, and there's no friction between this want and a competing cost or fear. Functional across beats and essential to structure, but not dramatized through contradictory impulses or visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Calculated spontaneity is referenced twice as Marek's trait ("calculated spontaneity had prepared him," "through calculated spontaneity...when to speak softly") and describes his approach: he's rehearsed mentally but acts in the moment. The tone is consistent—methodical expertise meeting improvisation—and modulates appropriately (calm setup, focused action, reflective closure). However, it functions more as a character label than a tonal charge that reconfigures meaning at the end. Present in framing and closure mention, but not indispensable to mood or final image.</comment>
