<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior motivation ("to teach endings how to begin") arrives as thematic assertion rather than earned contradiction; her shift from "practiced detachment" to "heart, now open" telescopes across repetitive loop encounters without embodied cost in micro-choices. The voice crackles through with distinct turns ("frozen, thawed a little"), but emotional progression flattens into therapy-speak ("heart unburdened," "estrangement, once a fortress, now felt like a bridge"). No genuine internal conflict dramatized—desire to connect versus cultivated isolation never collide in a single charged beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the loop pattern is taught early, accumulates through wrong-number calls, and breaks when Mira snaps the disc. Closure lands on-page (she walks out, phone silent, loop broken) with visible action, but cost remains asserted ("heart unburdened") rather than felt—no legible forfeiture or trade-off shadows the final image. Orientation is clean by line 2. The loop itself functions as a structural constraint, but the resolution (disc-snapping) arrives without prior escalation of what the disc costs her or enables, weakening causal pressure under even an accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The subway utility tunnel and glass booth anchor early with vivid particulars (iron beams, glass walls, rotary phone, stale air). The glass harmonica disc supplies recurring sensory detail (hum, vibration, final shatter cascade) and constrains the climax choice. Spatial choreography remains coherent across beats. However, the "hum of streetlamps" timeframe floats as lyric atmosphere without affecting access, urgency, or tactics—setting detail ornaments rather than pressures most beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (breaking the loop to escape eternal repetition) signals by paragraph 12. One meaningful tightening occurs when the loop "trembled" after the disc note, then Mira snaps it free. Yet escalation reads thin: the phone rings "the same voice, the same plea" across nights without compounding tactical constraint or visible cost until the climax. The disc-snapping choice arrives without prior friction—Mira decides, acts, succeeds—no trade-off or sacrifice dramatized on the page. Coincidence (new caller's voice changes the loop) complicates without clear protagonist agency driving that shift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Theme ("teach endings how to begin") is stated explicitly multiple times ("Mira's motivation surfaced," "she had learned that every ending is only the start") rather than earned through image and choice. The glass-disc motif recurs but never accumulates contradictory meaning; it remains symbol-as-label. The final line ("every echo eventually finds its own silence") offers lyric resonance but no non-literal reweighting of prior particulars—closure moralizes rather than charging ambiguity. Subtext in gesture and silence is minimal; most emotional shifts are declared.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds stable with clean focalization; no head-hopping. Diction carries a consistent lyric register ("glass harmonica disc spinning silently," "thorny hedge," "fragile thread of connection") that stays character-particular. Filter verbs ("felt," "realized," "wondered") appear frequently but remain voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy in peak beats. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close at the disc-touch, wider during tunnel walk). Minor slips: "The story, like the tunnel, ran deep" intrudes as meta-commentary in the final third, and some syntactic stems repeat ("She had," "Mira's," "The phone").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high in early beats (booth, disc, calls introduced economically). However, paraphrase loops appear: "each call added a new layer… yet also a fragile thread" restates connection without advancing pressure; "she had learned that every ending is only the start" echoes "teach endings how to begin" within three lines. Template cadence in the final third: "Mira smiled… Mira walked… Mira knew… She would always be… Her heart… And each new day…" stacks parallel stems without pattern-teaching payoff. Figurative language density spikes in closure beats ("echo lingered," "door at dawn," "spirit lingered") without muddle but borders on overwriting. Apply −0.6 for loops and stems.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Core premise (operator trapped in time loop, breaks free via destroying haunted object) follows familiar template without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The glass harmonica disc and wrong-number calls supply specific texture, but the emotional arc (isolation → connection → freedom) and resolution (destroy haunted object, walk away unburdened) hit expected beats. "Teach endings how to begin" reads as prompt-language rather than emergent insight. No bold risk elevates; the piece chooses median safety at each turn. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies: −1.0 adjustment for untransformed loop-breaking template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Mira (underground phone booth operator) is present throughout and makes the climax choice (snapping the disc). She answers calls across multiple beats and her decision to confront the disc drives the ending. However, her choices in middle beats (staying on the line, weaving stories) do not visibly alter tactics or narrow options—loop persists identically until the disc-snap. Setup early, development minimal (observation more than decision), payoff strong. Two of three gates; causal pressure moderate; closure linkage solid. Band ~5–6; closure participation and beat count lift toward 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Glass harmonica disc introduced early (paragraph 4), touched and sounded in the climax (paragraphs 21–22), and shattered to break the loop (paragraph 32). Appears in at least three distinct beats with evolving function: atmospheric hum, Mira's touch producing a note that shifts the loop, final destruction. Cost tied to it (she must break it, cuts her palms). Setup, development (touch → note → trembling loop), and payoff all present. Causal pressure solid; closure decisive. Irreplaceability high (unique object, specific mechanics). Band 7–8; minor swappability concern (any magical object could serve) nudges toward 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Cultivated estrangement stated in paragraph 3 ("cultivated estrangement like a gardener tending a thorny hedge") and echoed at closure ("estrangement… now felt like a bridge"). Functions as thematic label rather than constraining tactics—Mira's isolation does not visibly prevent or enable specific choices in the loop beats. Setup present, development absent (no on-page cost or friction tied to estrangement), payoff nominal (mentioned but not reweighted). Ornamental use; no causal pressure. Band 3–4; thematic echo without stake-shaping holds at 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Melodically haunted (paragraph 4: disc hums when air stirs; paragraph 22: "high, clear note that pierced the tunnel"). Attribute enables the climax action (note causes loop to tremble) with visible consequence. Present in two beats (ambient hum, Mira's touch → note). Setup early, development (touch produces effect), payoff (shattering ends haunting). Cost indirect (must destroy disc to stop loop). Causal role in one major turn; specificity moderate (any haunting could serve similar function). Two gates; causal pressure moderate; closure linked. Band 5–6; leans toward 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Loop introduced paragraph 12 ("trapped in a loop, a single night repeating"), drives Mira's escalating burden across beats 13–18, trembles after disc note (paragraph 24), and breaks when disc shatters (paragraph 32). Shapes at least three major beats and defines the central problem and resolution. Setup, development (accumulating calls, woman's call shifts it), and payoff all present. Causal pressure high; irreplaceability strong (removing loop removes story logic). Closure linkage decisive. Band 7–8; strong integration across beats and ending holds at 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Wrong number friendships (paragraph 6: "intermittent wrong number calls"; paragraph 14: "wrong number friendships, these ghosts of strangers"). Method present in multiple beats (man's call paragraphs 8–11, woman's call paragraph 26) and shapes Mira's tactics (offering comfort, weaving stories). Setup early, development (calls accumulate, woman's call differs), payoff moderate (calls are vehicle but loop-breaking is disc-driven). Causal role in one turn (woman's call shifts loop tone); mechanics matter but do not resolve. Two gates; swappability moderate (any recurring interaction could serve). Band 4–5; leans toward 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Subway utility tunnel anchored early (paragraph 1) with vivid detail (iron, streetlamps, stale air). Supplies spatial frame and houses booth/disc. Mentioned in multiple beats but does not constrain choices or supply resources that alter tactics. Micro-setting (booth, disc) does constrain climax, but tunnel itself remains postcard backdrop. Setup strong, development absent (tunnel does not pressure), payoff nominal (Mira walks down it). Causal pressure low; irreplaceability moderate (any isolated space could serve). Band 4–5; lyric reprise (tunnel echo final lines) nudges toward 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Timeframe "between the hum of streetlamps" (title/paragraph 1) recurs as lyric motif (final paragraph: "when the streetlamps hummed just so") but does not tighten decisions or track a live clock. Loop implies repeated nights, but no urgency or temporal constraint pressures Mira's choices. Setup present, development absent (time does not narrow options), payoff ornamental (mentioned but not causal). Swappable with any ambient time marker. Band 2–3; lyric reprise without pressure holds at 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Motivation "to teach endings how to begin" stated explicitly (paragraph 15) and echoed at closure (paragraphs 38, 45). Shapes Mira's tactics in middle beats (weaving stories for the man, paragraph 16–17) with visible effect (he speaks of hope). Setup mid-story, development (stories shift caller's tone), payoff strong (motivation articulated and enacted). However, desire is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses; friction between isolation and connection remains abstract. Two gates; causal role in one beat; closure linked but label-heavy. Band 5–6; leans toward 5.5.</comment>
