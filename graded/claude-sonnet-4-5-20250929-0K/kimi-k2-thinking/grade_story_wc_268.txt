<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Sylvar's interior is largely absent; we are told he is "a quiet thunder" with "regally unpretentious grace" but never witness contradictory impulses or embodied emotion under pressure. The plan unfolds through exposition rather than difficult micro-choices, and Vael's interiority remains opaque—his ambition is declared, not dramatized. The closure (Vael's glamour shattering) arrives without visible cost to Sylvar or a meaningful foreclosure of options; his "task complete" stance reads as serene competence rather than earned endurance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the opening lines, avoiding penalty. The causal chain—Sylvar inscribes riddles, Vael deciphers them, the rune sunders the glamour—is legible, but the closure lacks felt cost: Sylvar smiles, the throne awaits, and the library "remained." No path is visibly foreclosed, and the final image (rune fading, echo of truth) reconfigures little. The ending reads as accomplished mission rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with on-page price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ancient temple library is vivid and atmosphere-rich ("crumbling pillars wrapped in vines of silvered starlight"), but remains postcard description rather than a constraint on choice. The ink pellets and slender green-leather volume supply texture, yet spatial choreography is vague—Sylvar "moved through the aisles," Vael "found a slender volume"—and the library's "graceful collapse" operates as metaphor, not tactical pressure. The setting does not narrow options or alter the final image's charge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unmask the pretender—is signaled early and sustained, but escalation is minimal: Sylvar's plan proceeds without reversal, and Vael's discovery of the riddle does not complicate matters or force a trade-off. The rune's activation feels automatic rather than a choice under pressure, and the visible cost is absent—Sylvar's vigil continues, the throne awaits, no path is foreclosed. One tightening (the glamour unraveling) occurs, but agency and price remain off the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—truth versus illusion, the weight of guardianship—emerges through image (starlight vines, hollow-eyed pretender, "graceful collapse") rather than assertion, and the rune of drift acquires symbolic weight. Yet the final paragraph moralizes gently ("keeper of secrets and a witness to the sundering of lies"), and the core question (what price does Sylvar pay?) receives no non-literal answer. The ending offers resonance but not repricing; the library's state and Sylvar's stance remain unchanged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Sylvar, with brief access to Vael's gleaming eyes and gasping lips. Diction is elevated and ornate throughout ("a quiet symphony of ink and paper," "the slow lung of eternity"), creating a consistent texture but minimal perceptual signature—Sylvar's way of noticing feels generic rather than character-specific. The prose does not modulate under pressure; metaphor density remains constant from opening to closure, and Sylvar's internal voice lacks distinct idiom or blind spots.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades: nearly every sentence carries metaphor or simile ("each tome a tomb," "each stroke a note in a melody of revelation," "invisible crown," "hollow echo"), creating density without propulsion and obscuring the causal spine. Paraphrase loops appear ("His shoulders…bore the invisible crown" / "He had lived across the pause…each night a breath") and template cadence runs through the Vael sequence. Register remains elevated even at the closure beat ("divine hammer," "motes of light"), and figurative coherence wobbles ("pulled at his glamour" / "threads…unraveling" / "shattered like glass"). The final third inherits all these artifacts, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—guardian inscribes cryptic messages to unmask a glamoured usurper—is serviceable but not fresh, and the resolution (magical rune dissolves illusion) follows a familiar arc without transformation. Specific details (iron gall ink pellets, green leather, seventh page) add texture but remain ornamental; the emotional truth of Sylvar's millennium-long vigil is asserted rather than inhabited. The "regally unpretentious" gesture and "graceful collapse" metaphor offer mild freshness, yet the core feels median-safe rather than risky or inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Sylvar is on the page throughout and his plan drives the plot, but his diminutive stature appears only in label ("diminutive titan," "small frame," "shoulders, though small") without constraining a choice or shaping tactics. The trait does not create friction or cost; "small for a titan" is atmospheric rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Iron gall ink pellets appear in one beat (Sylvar carries "a small pouch" and inscribes with "steady hand"), are mentioned again in the closure paragraph ("now spent, their purpose fulfilled"), but are never handled on the page or used in a second distinct action. The object is functional but replaceable; any inscribing medium would serve.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The rune of drift is seeded in Sylvar's cryptic messages, discovered by Vael on the seventh page, glows and beckons mid-scene, and Sylvar places his hand upon it to "sunder the pretender's illusion completely" at closure. It shapes two beats (Vael tracing the spiral, Sylvar activating it) and defines the climax, though the mechanics ("willed the rune to sunder") remain abstract. Present in setup, development, and payoff with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Regally unpretentious" appears as label ("regally unpretentious grace," "regally unpretentious gesture") but never constrains an action or creates visible cost. The attribute is ornamental; Sylvar's choices do not hinge on balancing regal authority with humility.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Sunder" appears explicitly at the climax ("willed the rune to sunder the pretender's illusion completely") and defines the resolution; the glamour "dissolved into motes of light." The action is irreplaceable and causally central, though the cost to Sylvar or the world remains off the page. Early setup (rune of drift as "unmake the weave of illusion") and payoff are present.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Cryptic messages are signaled early ("inscribe cryptic messages upon the margins of forgotten tomes"), shape Sylvar's method across multiple beats (he writes, Vael finds and deciphers), and the mechanism (riddle → rune activation) drives the climax. The method is visible in setup, development, and payoff, though the execution (how exactly the ink "seeps into parchment like secrets") remains abstract.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The ancient temple library frames the entire piece and supplies the ink, tomes, and shelves as resources, but does not constrain choice or alter tactics. The "graceful collapse" operates as metaphor rather than physical pressure, and Sylvar's movements through aisles are narrated without spatial friction. Present throughout but functions as backdrop rather than crucible.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Across the pause of shifting constellations" appears in the opening ("He had lived across the pause of shifting constellations") and the closing ("lost in time"), but the timeframe remains atmospheric. No clock tightens decisions; the millennium-long vigil is summary, and the climactic beat (Vael reads, rune activates) unfolds without temporal pressure or deadline.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation—"to unmask a pretender to the throne"—is stated early and sustained through Sylvar's plan and the closure, shaping the dominant stake. Yet the desire is told rather than dramatized in conflicted micro-choices; Sylvar's interiority shows no friction between the goal and competing wants or costs. The motivation drives structure but lacks embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Graceful collapse" appears as metaphor repeatedly ("the library itself seemed to sigh," "graceful collapse of forgotten epochs," "continued") and the tone—stately, elegiac—remains consistent through turns. The phrase charges the final image ("a keeper of secrets…witness to the sundering of lies"), yet the tone does not modulate with pressure; Vael's unmasking proceeds at the same measured pace as the opening's cosmic stillness.</comment>
