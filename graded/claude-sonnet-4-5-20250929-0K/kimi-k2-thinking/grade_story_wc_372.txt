<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The orderly records chief remains a label without contradictory impulses or embodied emotional texture. His "gently meticulous" nature is asserted repeatedly but never dramatizes a cost or tradeoff under pressure—he simply performs his task with no friction between wants and fears. The vague motivation "to conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" floats as abstraction rather than grounding in a specific stake that could be lost. The ending grants success without meaningful foreclosure or visible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation debt is severe: who this chief is, where exactly "above clouds" places him, and what the frozen library's jeopardy concretely entails remain unclear past the 120-word threshold, triggering the −0.3 to −0.5 penalty and the Q3 = 7.0 cap. The piece cycles through synonym-heavy description rather than causally linked beats; the chief adjusts the lantern, measures frequencies, and projects the vow in a sequence that reads as outline rather than because/therefore pressure. Closure claims the library is saved and the vow rekindled, but no decisive cost is legible on the page—the final paragraphs loop the same ideas without a felt before/after change. The drive lens remains ambiguous between Accumulative and Causal throughout, never cohering.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The frozen library and quartz hush create vivid atmosphere, and the magic lantern slide offers a recurring concrete object. However, setting functions primarily as backdrop: the chief's actions are not constrained by ice, altitude, or the architecture in ways that narrow his options or alter tactics. The ending claims the shelves "respond" with renewed strength, but this shift is asserted rather than shown through spatial or sensory specificity that charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving the library's memory—is declared but never tested by a choice that forecloses an alternative path. The chief measures, recalibrates, and projects the vow without encountering resistance, failure, or a trade-off; each action succeeds in sequence without escalation. The claimed cost (the vow is "temporary," oblivion remains inevitable) is told rather than dramatized, and the ending loops assurance rather than crystallizing a price paid or path renounced.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges as "meaning against oblivion," but the piece states this thesis overtly across multiple paragraphs rather than letting it accrue through concrete particulars. The final lines deliver summary moralizing ("his records will forever conjure meaning from oblivion's edge") that replaces scene pressure with abstract assertion. The luminous vows function as symbolic tokens mentioned repeatedly without evolving meaning or constraining a choice that would earn thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The third-person limited stance remains stable, and diction carries a consistent lyric register ("quartz hush," "luminous vows"). However, the voice lacks perceptual signature—observations are generic and interchangeable rather than filtered through the chief's specific expertise or emotional bias. Repeated syntactic stems ("The chief adjusted," "The chief felt," "The chief knew") create template cadence across high-pressure beats, flattening rhythm and violating the loop-check guidelines.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "while illusions fade to memory" appears four times, "luminous vows" recurs in nearly every paragraph without functional variation, and the final third restates the same content across five consecutive paragraphs with minor synonym churn. Template cadence runs dominate (e.g., "The chief [verb]" opens six sentences in close succession), triggering the −0.4 to −0.6 deduction. Stock metaphors ("edge of oblivion," "breath of memory") and elevated diction ("conjure meaning") clash with the action-level clarity the piece claims. These artifacts touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and warranting escalated penalty near −1.7 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise—preserving memory in a frozen sky-library via magic lantern—offers surface novelty but executes through familiar "guardian of forgotten knowledge" beats without transformation. The chief's task and success follow a predictable arc with no fresh inflection or non-obvious synthesis; swapping names and props would leave the emotional template unchanged. The ending's claim of hope is asserted rather than earned through a turn that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The orderly records chief is present throughout and performs the central actions (measuring, recalibrating, projecting), satisfying setup and development. However, his choices are unopposed and succeed without trade-offs; he observes and adjusts rather than making decisions that alter tactics under pressure. He appears in the closure beat but is not causally active there—the final paragraphs loop assurance rather than crystallizing a choice or cost. Late deduction for swappability and lack of specific causal pressure in closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The magic lantern slide appears in setup (first paragraph), is used in multiple beats (projecting patterns, adjusting focus, revealing the queen's vow), and is mentioned in the closure ("the magic lantern slide's glow persisted"). However, its mechanical properties do not constrain choices—the chief adjusts it without friction or failure—and the final mention is ornamental rather than causally active. The slide enables the plot but could be replaced with a similar device without restructuring the story. Mid-band for multi-beat presence and closure mention, limited by swappability and lack of causal pressure at the end.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Luminous vows are introduced early and named repeatedly, satisfying setup. They function as the object of the chief's quest (development) and are claimed to be preserved in the ending (closure participation). However, the concept operates as a thematic label rather than shaping on-page choices or narrowing options—the chief measures and projects the vows without encountering resistance or cost tied to their luminous properties. The vows' mechanics remain abstract, never constraining tactics in a dramatized beat. Functional but replaceable, trending toward ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Gently meticulous" is asserted in the opening and repeated as a label ("his gently meticulous spirit") but never dramatized as a trait that constrains or enables a choice with visible cost. The chief's actions (measuring, recalibrating) are consistent with carefulness, but no beat shows a trade-off where meticulousness conflicts with urgency or causes a mistake. The attribute remains decorative, present but not integrated into causal pressure or closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Measure" is the chief's central action, appearing in setup, multiple middle beats ("measure the fading light," "measure the luminous intensity," "measured again"), and the final paragraph. However, the act of measuring does not create turns or narrow options—it succeeds each time without complication. The story could substitute "record" or "preserve" with minimal structural change. The action is load-bearing for the plot but lacks irreplaceability or causal friction that would push it higher.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"By sampling frequencies" is introduced in the middle third ("measure the luminous intensity by sampling frequencies") and appears again near the end ("by sampling frequencies, ensuring no vow was lost"). The method is named but its mechanics never constrain a choice—the chief samples frequencies successfully without adjustment or failure tied to the technique. Setup is delayed, development is summary-only, and closure participation is a label mention. Late arrival and lack of causal pressure cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The frozen library above clouds is anchored in the opening line, recurs throughout, and is claimed to "hold firm" in the closure. The setting provides vivid atmosphere (quartz hush, frosted walls, creaking shelves) and the altitude implies isolation. However, the environment does not constrain the chief's actions—he moves and works without friction from cold, fragility, or the library's stated jeopardy. The ending asserts the library is saved but does not show how its architecture or altitude altered the final image. Multi-beat presence and closure mention earn mid-band, limited by lack of tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"While illusions fade to memory" appears as a recurring phrase but functions as poetic atmosphere rather than a ticking clock. The timeframe does not tighten decisions—the chief works at his own pace without urgency or a deadline that alters tactics. The phrase recurs in the ending but does not reweight pressure or signal acceleration. Present in setup and closure, but ornamental and non-causal, trending low.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"To conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" is stated explicitly in the opening third and repeated in the final paragraphs. However, the motivation remains abstract—no beat dramatizes the chief's fear of failure or conflicting desires that would create friction. He pursues his task without doubt, cost, or trade-off between this goal and another want. The motivation frames the plot but is told rather than tested, and the ending loops the same thesis without a choice that embodies it. Functional but replaceable with any preservation motive.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Quartz hush" is established in the opening line, recurs as a descriptor, and bookends the ending. The tone remains consistently lyric and reverent, creating a stable mood. However, the tone does not modulate with pressure—peak beats (measuring the vow, saving the library) carry the same rhythm and register as exposition. The final image repeats "quartz hush" but does not charge it with new meaning or cost. Multi-beat presence and closure reprise earn functional credit, limited by static affect and lack of tonal escalation.</comment>
