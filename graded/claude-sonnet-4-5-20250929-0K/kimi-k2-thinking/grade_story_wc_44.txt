<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clear and her "quietly deliberate" trait shows in pacing, but interiority remains abstract—"focused on the intricate web of runes glowing in her mind" tells rather than shows contradictory impulses. Her actions align with stated goals, yet no genuine internal conflict surfaces; she executes the task competently without visible struggle or cost that forecloses a path. The final satisfaction is declared, not embodied through a choice that reveals competing values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece follows a causal lens: Elara identifies the problem, hypothesizes a solution, and enacts it through the key and rune sequence. Orientation anchors (who, where, fractured-world when) arrive promptly. However, the closure—"shadows knew their place"—lands as summary rather than a decisive on-page image with felt cost; the automaton's sealing is described but the price to Elara or the world remains abstract. One meaningful tightening occurs (the final loop's reversal), meeting minimum escalation, but the ending resolves too neatly without visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The nocturnal observatory on a floating isle and the fractured sky are vivid, anchoring the reader early. Sensory details (brass glinting, low hum, luminous lattice) are purposeful and integrated into action. The automaton and key function as micro-setting elements that constrain Elara's method, and the noon-shadow phenomenon charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean, though the world's "impossible colors" and bent-reality premise remain decorative rather than pressuring choice at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding where shadows go at noon and preventing the sealed awakening—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elara must relearn the final loop, narrowing options. The automaton's response and shadow-thinning create escalation under the causal lens. However, no visible price is paid: Elara succeeds without forfeiting time, safety, or resource; the "sealed awakening" threat is contained off-page with no dramatized consequence. Agency is decision-based, but cost remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme—understanding and containing the unknown through patient scholarship—emerges from action rather than statement. The shadow-as-puzzle motif recurs and the final journal entry attempts resonance. Yet the ending offers a tidy answer ("shadows knew their place") that resolves ambiguity mechanically rather than reweighting prior material with cost. The piece tells us Elara "cared little for fame; she only wanted the shadows to be understood," which is thematic summary rather than embodied through contradictory choice or loss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—Elara notices runes, gears, shadows—though diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("sealed pocket," "luminous lattice") without clear voice anchoring. Psychic distance is controlled, and the narrative certainty fits what Elara can know. No dialogue; interiority is functional but leans on filter constructions ("She realized," "She recognized") that dull immediacy. The prose reflects her deliberate nature through pacing, a purposeful alignment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and paragraphs breathe appropriately; information density is moderate. However, paraphrase loops appear: "She had to relearn the final loop, a pattern she had only seen once before. It required a reversal of the first loop..." restates without advancing pressure. Template cadence runs in the middle third ("She began... The automaton responded... Shadows... flickered... She realized...") create mechanical pacing. Minor clarity issues: "spoons bent reality" is intriguing but unexplained, and "sealed awakening" remains abstract. No line-level artifacts touch the closure beat, limiting penalty accumulation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The floating-isle-observatory and shadow-at-noon puzzle offer a specific angle on scholar-versus-mystery. The clockwork automaton and rune loops integrate premise and method. However, the core arc—solve arcane puzzle, prevent awakening, succeed cleanly—follows a familiar template without meaningful transformation or risk. Emotional stakes remain abstract; no bold choice that raises cost or subverts expectation. The "spoons bent reality" detail hints at originality but is ornamental. Specificity in world-building lifts the piece, but the resolution is too tidy to feel fresh.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout, frames the quest, makes the decision to use the key, traces runes at midpoint, and completes the final loop at closure. Her choices alter tactics (turning clockwise, reversing the serpent) and the outcome depends on her agency. However, much of her work is summarized ("set the key," "began the first loop") rather than shown beat-by-beat with on-page friction. The cost—time, risk, or internal conflict—is minimal; she succeeds without visible trade-off. Two-gate involvement (setup, closure) with causal pressure but swappable scholar archetype and low dramatic cost cap the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The clockwork automaton key is introduced early (first third), used twice on-page (inserted and turned; later noted as "resting safely"), and shapes the closure by enabling the seal. Its brass-teeth specificity and starlight simile add texture. However, the key functions primarily as a plot unlock; no evolving meaning or reweighted reprise charges the final image beyond "the automaton sat dormant again, its key resting safely." Two beats (insertion, final mention) plus closure participation meet the 7+ threshold, but lack of secondary cost or charged transformation limits ascent.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Sealed awakenings" is introduced in the first third as the entity within the automaton, motivates Elara's urgency, and shapes the stakes (if the seal fails, the world twists further). The concept pressures her method—she must close loops to strengthen the seal—and is present at closure when "the sealed awakening within thrashed" before being contained. However, the awakening itself remains abstract; no on-page manifestation or evolving threat beyond a single shudder. Swappable with "dormant force" or similar. Three gates met (setup, middle pressure, closure mention) but low irreplaceability and ornamental final handling cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Quietly deliberate" is attributed twice by name and enacted through pacing: "Elara's fingers moved with practiced care, quietly deliberate, never faltering." The trait enables her success (steady hand for precise rune-tracing) and costs nothing—no moment where haste might have saved time or where her caution forecloses an option. The attribute is demonstrated in behavior but lacks on-page trade-off. Present in setup and closure; one visible action but no felt cost. Mid-band functional use without causal pressure or constraint that alters outcome.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Relearn" is signaled early ("She needed to relearn the archaic sequence"), pressures the midpoint turn ("She had to relearn the final loop"), and defines the climax (reversal of the first loop). The action is specific and not easily swappable—forgetting and recovering knowledge creates the obstacle and solution. However, the relearning itself is summarized; no on-page struggle or memory-searching dramatizes the cost. Three beats (setup, mid-pressure, closure execution) with causal necessity but low dramatization of the act itself. Essential to the plot, specific to the concept, but missing embodied friction caps below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Closing loops" is introduced early as the method ("close the loops of power"), shapes Elara's tactics (tracing serpent loops, reversing the pattern), and defines the climax ("closing the circuit completely"). The mechanics matter: each loop consumes shadow and strengthens the seal. However, the loops themselves are abstract—described but not physically detailed enough to feel irreplaceable. Three gates met; causal pressure on multiple beats; specific to the automaton's mechanism. Swappability is moderate (could be "sealing sigils" with minor rewrites). Strong integration but not indispensable, capping just below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The nocturnal observatory on a floating isle anchors the opening, frames Elara's isolation, and supplies the automaton and key on a dusty shelf. The setting enables her work (runes visible only by moonlight, midday observation) and the balcony provides the final noon-test beat. However, the floating isle and fractured sky are ornamental—no on-page moment where the environment pressures a choice or alters tactics. Present in setup, mid-description, and closure walk-through; functional resources but no causal constraint. Two gates (setup, closure participation) plus resource provision trend mid-band; lack of pressure or obstacle caps ascent.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After spoons bend reality" is mentioned in the opening to establish the fractured world but never explained or developed. The timeframe does not tighten decisions—Elara works at her own pace with no urgency tied to this event. The "months tracing glyphs" tells us time has passed, but no live clock or deadline pressures her. The midday observation (noon) is the key temporal anchor, yet it functions as setting detail rather than a constraint. Setup mention only; no development or closure participation. Ornamental backstory with no causal role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To find where shadows go at noon" is Elara's stated motivation in the first third, drives her hypothesis and method, and is answered at closure ("they slipped into the automaton's hidden dimension"). The question shapes her observations and the rune-work. However, the desire is told rather than conflicted—no moment where her curiosity costs her safety, time, or another goal. Present in setup, middle pressure (observations, hypothesis), and closure answer; causal role in driving plot but no dramatized friction or trade-off. Three gates with clear payoff but low embodied struggle caps below 7.0.</comment>
