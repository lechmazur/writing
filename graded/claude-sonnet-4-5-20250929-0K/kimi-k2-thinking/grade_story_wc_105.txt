<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation—to find the sound of trust breaking after Kael's betrayal—anchors interior logic consistently. The synesthetic trait (hearing colors) provides character-specific perception, though its application feels more ornamental than constraining in key beats. The final letting-go of the device carries some weight, but the protagonist remains largely observational rather than under pressure to choose between competing goods. Embodied emotion is present but leans toward abstract metaphor ("wound that wouldn't clot") rather than visceral contradiction in the moment of crisis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers absences, artifacts, and memory imprints toward a final reconfiguration when Lyra hears the sought frequency and understands trust as cessation of transmission. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly in the opening lines. The closure—Lyra releasing the device and reframing betrayal as "stopped transmitting"—constitutes a Conceptual Repricing with felt cost (renunciation of the search, acceptance of irretrievable silence). One substantive friction: the forge's sudden reignition feels convenient, arriving without prior setup or cost to enable the climactic hearing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The sunken greenhouse, black water, bioluminescent remnants, and corroded pipes create a vivid, pressure-laden environment. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: algae glow becomes chimes, copper whispers brass, water prunes hands. The forge and nutrient bath function as micro-setting elements that constrain action (ash collection, device immersion). Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout. The shipwrecks "leaning closer, listening" in the penultimate image charges the ending without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the sound of trust breaking—is signaled early and sustained. The piece accumulates pressure through collection, archive-building, and the synesthetic flicker of "diseased violet." The forge reignition constitutes a meaningful tightening that narrows options: Lyra can finally hear the target frequency. Cost is legible in the device's release and the acceptance of silence as a "cleared channel." One friction: the escalation relies on a near-coincidental event (forge spontaneously reignites) rather than protagonist agency driving the turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme—trust as transmission, betrayal as silence—emerges through concrete particulars: vials of harmonic gaps, the whine beyond hearing, the grey of dead coral. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer: trust doesn't shatter but stops broadcasting, leaving "pristine absence." No overt moralizing; the insight arises from Lyra's sensory archive and the final image of the device drifting "like a failed promise." Subtext operates in images (ashen forge, salt-scabbed panels, pale fruits) that avoid explicit thematic statement. The piece resists tidy resolution, embracing ambiguity in the "quiet that comes after."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains stable psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: synesthetic perception, accumulation metaphors, technical precision ("harmonic gaps," "frequency voids"). Diction is elevated but consistent, matching the narrator's specialized idiom. No head-hopping; all access flows through Lyra's filter. One friction: the narration occasionally drifts into abstract declaration ("a wound that wouldn't clot," "the battered marvel of it all") that tells emotional stakes rather than grounding them in embodied perception, slightly softening immediacy in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and largely coherent: "cathedral of rust and salt," "memory becoming a medium," "wind through a ribcage." Rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high. Two frictions lower the score: (1) Near-paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines—"ashen forge," "forge's heart," "forge had gone cold," "forge reignited"—cycling through synonym variants without added pressure. (2) Several metaphors stack in single sentences ("wound that wouldn't clot," "whine like glass screaming underwater," "hollow note singing through the orchard like wind through a ribcage"), creating momentary density without always clarifying causality. No line-level opacity that obscures closure, so penalties remain moderate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—hearing aid designer in a flooded greenhouse collecting acoustic absences to reverse-engineer betrayal's sound—feels specific and non-obvious. The synesthetic condition and memory-imprint forge offer fresh angles on trust and loss. Emotional particularity (trust as ceased transmission rather than fracture) avoids generic templates. One limitation: the greenhouse's bioluminescent past and the crew confessions burned into structure read as atmospheric dressing without transforming the central arc; removing those details would not fundamentally alter Lyra's search or closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lyra, the hearing aid designer, frames the setup and collects absences across multiple beats. Her synesthetic design work and archive-building drive middle action. The final choice—releasing the device—closes the arc. However, her professional role (designer of hearing aids for "deaf memory") functions more as thematic backdrop than a skill or constraint that shapes tactics under pressure. Two of three gates are met (setup, closure); causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ashen forge appears early as backstory (original reactor burning memories into structure), returns mid-story as a drift of ash particles, and reignites at the climax to enable Lyra's hearing. Its properties (memory imprint, ash as medium) are specific and irreplaceable. It constrains the method (requires ash collection) and triggers the key turn. Closure participation is strong: the forge's reignition makes the ending possible. One friction: the reignition itself feels coincidental rather than earned by protagonist action, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The impact of memories—crew confessions burned into glass, ash as remnant moments, the forge imprinting witnessed promises—shapes the world logic and Lyra's method. Memories-as-physical-artifact enables her reverse-engineering tactic. The climax depends on compressed memory reigniting the forge. The concept appears in setup, drives middle beats (collecting memory voids), and charges the ending when "the imprint of that silence settled into the ash, into the forge, into the very water." All three gates; strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Lyra's synesthesia (hearing colors faintly) is introduced early, colors her perception throughout (algae glow as chimes, corroded copper as brass whispers), and enables her to perceive the "diseased violet" flicker of trust breaking. It provides perceptual access others lack. However, it never constrains a choice or imposes a visible cost; she simply perceives differently without trade-off. Two gates (setup, development via the violet detection); moderate specificity; no cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Imprint" functions as both backstory mechanism (reactor imprinted memories into structure) and climactic event (forge reignites "with compressed memory, the ash becoming a medium for the imprint"). The action is irreplaceable: only imprint logic allows acoustic absences to generate sound. It drives the key turn (particles glow, voices return) and shapes the ending (silence imprinted permanently). All three gates; strong causal linkage; closure participation clear. Slight swappability concern: "record" or "encode" could substitute with modest rewording.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Collecting absences is signaled early ("Lyra collected absences—the harmonic gaps… frequency voids"), defines her method across beats (vials of saline, archive of silence), and enables reverse-engineering at closure. The method's mechanics matter: each missing note defines original form via negative space. It constrains her tactic (passive collection rather than active generation) and the climax depends on the accumulated archive. All three gates; moderate causal pressure; closure linkage via the "cleared channel" insight. Irreplaceability moderate: "recording silences" could substitute.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks anchors every beat: black water presses panes, nutrient bath holds the device, corroded pipes whisper, grafted branches divide, forge reignites within. The setting supplies resources (ash, water, aurora light) and physical constraints (depth, salt, decay). Spatial choreography is precise. The shipwrecks "lean closer, listening" in the penultimate line, charging the final image. All three gates; strong causal and atmospheric pressure; high specificity and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Cell division appears as a time marker: "cells divided in the grafted branches… the slow rhythm of mitosis marking time more honestly than any clock" and "she listened as cells divided in the branch she held, each split marking the nanosecond Kael's hand had committed its betrayal." It provides a biological clock that layers onto the climax. However, it does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; Lyra's actions proceed independently of mitotic rhythm. Two gates (setup as framing device, closure as metaphoric overlay); no pressure or constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation—to find the sound of trust breaking after Kael's betrayal—is introduced early ("a wound that wouldn't clot"), drives every beat (archive-building, device assembly, listening), and resolves at closure when she hears the frequency and understands it. The desire is conflicted: she needs clarity ("crack like ice or sigh like falling ash") but acceptance costs renunciation (dropping the device). All three gates; strong causal and emotional linkage; visible cost in the final letting-go.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Battered marvel" is coherent throughout: the greenhouse "had been a marvel once," now "a battered cathedral," fruit trees "still tried to fruit against all logic," and "the battered marvel of it all was that the orchard still grew." The tone—ruin laced with stubborn persistence—modulates with pressure and charges the final image of the pale, salt-tasting fruits and the "pristine absence." Setup and closure participation clear; tone integrated into imagery and diction. Slight abstraction in the phrase "battered marvel of it all" lowers specificity slightly.</comment>
