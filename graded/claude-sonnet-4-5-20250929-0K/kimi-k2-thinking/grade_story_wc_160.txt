<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Alia's interiority relies heavily on atmospheric description rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final choice to propose the hybrid plan is declared rather than shown through micro-decisions that reveal competing values. Embodied emotion appears in phrases like "heart quickened" and "quiet tremble," but therapy-speak intrudes ("slyly heartfelt," "encrypted compassion") at key beats. The council's adoption feels too smooth; no visible cost forecloses a path for Alia personally.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when early. The drive lens reads Causal (discovery → transcription → proposal → vote), but the council's acceptance lacks meaningful resistance or reversal—Alia presents, they vote, construction begins. The closure lands (the amphitheater lives, harmonizing past/future), yet the cost remains conceptual and diffuse rather than a specific forfeiture or consequence Alia faces on the page. One meaningful tightening occurs (the message reveal), but escalation flattens after that beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The amphitheater and volcanic setting are vivid and purposeful: "scarred by ancient fires," "sulfurous sigh," groaning stones. The surveyor's chain and envelope anchor tactile detail that drives discovery. Spatial choreography (valve, flagstone, basalt blocks, council arch) remains clear. The mountain's breath functions as micro-setting, constraining action and charging the final image when "the mountain breathed again, a low rumble…affirming the new harmony."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—harmonizing conflicting community values—is signaled early. However, the council's doubt ("rippled through the assembly") deflates immediately without testing Alia's resolve through a concrete counter-offer or walkout. The floodgate design is the lone tightening; no visible price (loss of allies, resource scarcity, personal risk) shapes her tactics afterward. Agency reads as presentation rather than sacrifice or hard tradeoff.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (encrypted compassion as shared heartbeat, measured change) emerges from the chain/envelope mechanics and the hybrid floodgate. The phrase "encrypted compassion was not a hidden code, but a shared heartbeat" tips into overt articulation in the final third, though it grows from prior image work. The antique chain as ceremonial guide and the "living museum" offer resonance without didacticism. Subtext operates in the council's silence and Alia's whispered promise, though the ending risks over-explanation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, perceptual signature (machinist's eye on valves, ridges, pressure points) is consistent. Register occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("throbbed with the slow, rhythmic breath," "dappled resolve") that edges past Alia's likely lexicon under stress. Dialogue is minimal (council murmurs, no direct speech), so naturalism and subtext tests are untested. Psychic distance holds; no head-hopping. Filter verbs ("noticed," "felt," "realized") cluster but do not obscure immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Figurative language saturates many beats without pattern-teaching: "throbbed," "whispered of forgotten measurements," "coil around her palm," "dappled resolve," "lantern in the twilight." Mixed metaphors appear ("encrypted compassion," "slyly heartfelt") in peak beats, reducing clarity. Paraphrase loops: "The mountain breathed again" / "as the building breathes" restates the central image without added pressure. Sentence openings vary; rhythm modulates. No template cadence runs. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The volcano amphitheater + floodgate machinist premise is specific, but the adhesive-analysis method and surveyor's chain feel ornamental rather than causally indispensable—Alia could decode the message via any antiquarian skill. The emotional arc (doubt → resolve → council vote) follows a familiar template; the community conflict resolves with minimal friction. "Encrypted compassion" and "dappled resolve" read as prompt-fulfillment labels rather than organic discoveries. The transformation test is soft: swap volcano for canyon, surveyor's chain for cartographer's compass, and the plot holds.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Alia's expertise (floodgate maintenance, machinist precision) frames the opening and anchors the discovery beats. Her proposal of the hybrid design is a key turn that shifts community stance. However, the decision itself is told in summary ("she proposed") rather than shown through dialogue or resistant negotiation. Present in setup, middle (discovery), and ending (construction oversight), but agency at closure reads passive—construction happens under her "watchful eye" without a visible tradeoff or cost she bears personally.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The surveyor's chain appears in three beats: extraction (half-buried, etched symbols), mapping to adhesive patterns (shared grammar), and ceremonial installation (visitors trace it). Its symbols directly enable the transcription that unlocks the message, creating causal pressure. The chain's irreplaceability is strong (its etched symbols match the adhesive ridges). It charges the ending by becoming a tactile reminder of the past. Setup early, drives the middle discovery beat, and reappears at closure with reweighted meaning.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Encrypted compassion" is declared twice as a thematic label ("cryptic command, an encrypted compassion" / "encrypted compassion was not a hidden code") but does not shape on-page tactics or narrow options. The concept functions as atmospheric theme rather than a stake that Alia must navigate with cost. It does not constrain her choices or alter the council's decision calculus. Swappable with "hidden wisdom" or "ancient mercy" with minimal edits. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Slyly heartfelt" appears twice as a descriptor ("slyly heartfelt hope," "slyly heartfelt vow") but does not constrain or enable a concrete action with visible cost. It labels Alia's emotional register rather than driving a decision. The attribute could be removed without altering the plot or closure. No tradeoff emerges from being "slyly heartfelt" versus earnest or pragmatic. Label-only trait; no on-page demonstration of the slynness shaping her approach to the council.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Tremble" recurs in multiple forms: "heart quickened," "ground tremble," "quiet tremble of triumph." The mountain's tremor signals environmental pressure and anchors the volcano's presence, but it does not redefine options or drive a major turn—Alia's resolve steadies, the council votes. The final "quiet tremble of triumph" is emotional summary rather than a decisive action. Present across beats, but swappable with "shudder" or "pulse" without structural loss. Mid-band for recurring motif without causal indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The adhesive-analysis method is signaled ("old machinist's trick"), its mechanics detailed (magnifying lens, pressure ridges, swirls), and it directly enables the transcription that unlocks the hidden message. This discovery is the story's central causal hinge. However, the method arrives and resolves in one contiguous beat without shaping prior attempts or later tactics—Alia applies it once, successfully, with no friction or failure. Setup mid-story, drives one key turn, shapes the ending indirectly. Specific and irreplaceable within that beat.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The amphitheater anchors every beat: Alia's valve work, the chain/envelope discovery beneath flagstones, the council gathering under its arch, and the final living-museum transformation. The volcanic setting supplies immediate pressure (sulfurous sighs, groaning stones, tremor) and resources (subterranean springs, old channels). The amphitheater's channels become the vehicle for the hybrid plan, directly affecting outcome. Setting is indispensable to the plot and charges the final image ("the amphitheater lives"). Early setup, middle choices, closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"As the building breathes" recurs as a motif (mountain's breath, slow exhalation, low rumble) but does not create a ticking clock or deadline that alters Alia's tactics. The timeframe is atmospheric rather than functional—no urgency or countdown pressures the council vote or construction. The breath metaphor charges the final image ("the mountain breathed again") but does not tighten decisions. Present throughout, but time remains vague and unthreatening. Lyric coherence without tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Harmonizing conflicting values is the stated goal, dramatized through the two-hearted community (sacred history vs. modern profit) and Alia's hybrid floodgate proposal. The motivation shapes the discovery (seeking resolution) and the ending (council adoption). However, internal friction for Alia is absent—she does not wrestle with which value to prioritize or pay a personal cost to bridge them. The motivation is clear and causal but lacks on-page conflict between her own wants and the community's needs. Setup, middle, closure participation; functional but not deeply tested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Dappled resolve" appears once as a descriptor ("her resolve dappled like sunlight through the volcanic haze"), and the tone modulates from uncertainty ("doubt rippled") to affirmation ("lantern in the twilight," "steady"). However, the tone does not shift under peak pressure—Alia's steadying is declared rather than shown through syntax or rhythm change. The final paragraphs maintain a consistent lyric register without the dappled ambiguity returning to charge the image. Tone is coherent but static; the dappling metaphor is ornamental rather than functional.</comment>
