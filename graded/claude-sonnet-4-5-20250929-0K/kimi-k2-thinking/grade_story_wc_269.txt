<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lina's interior is coherent—grief, pattern-seeking, witness identity—but agency remains observational rather than decisional. The "revelation" about vanished shipping lanes arrives as reflection, not embodied choice under pressure. The final act (placing the atlas page, tapping a new rhythm) reads as ritual rather than a renunciation with visible cost that forecloses a live path. Interiority avoids therapy-speak and the coral-bleaching grief is consistently embodied, but the protagonist never faces a forced trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: rhythmic tapping, rising tide, and recurring atlas page accumulate toward the final rhythm-as-memorial. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (the "path that did not disappear"), but the cost remains conceptual rather than legible on the page—Lina has already been tapping, already witnessing; nothing is foreclosed. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by ~120 words). The "delayed revelation" about the collapsed model is told in reflection, not dramatized as a beat that changes tactics or options, weakening causal linkage to the ending image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The floating monitoring station is vivid (moored disc, steel railing, mildewed archive) and pressures the isolated, drifting tone. The atlas page as micro-object charges the final image (waterproof case, tapping a new rhythm). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—faded ink, raised contours, the needle's rise—filtered through Lina's witness role. No spatial incoherence; the tide gauge and archive function as constraints.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (why some paths disappear) is signaled early but remains abstract. The "discovery" that old models collapsed is reflection, not an on-page decision that narrows options. Tightening occurs conceptually (the atlas page becomes an anchor, the rhythm shifts) but no live choice forces a trade-off or forecloses a tactical path with visible cost. Pressure accumulates texturally via repetition (tapping, tide, bleaching) but does not escalate protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—loss, witness, paths built on vanished futures—emerges organically from coral bleaching, rising seas, and the torn atlas page. The final image (tapping as memorial, waterproof case) offers a resonant answer without sermonizing. "Periodically eternal" as motif recurs purposefully (tide, bleaching cycle, rhythm) and reweights the closure without becoming checklist symbolism. No label-speak intrusion; particulars (the shipping lane model, the fossil-fuel ban) ground the abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single-POV, third limited, with stable perceptual signature (witness vocabulary, pattern-seeking, tactile engagement with objects). Psychic distance is controlled; Lina's interiority is specific ("silent scream," "the deep," "the rhythm of a world reborn"). Minor diction drift: "periodically eternal" appears in narration as concept rather than Lina's own idiom, reading slightly imposed. No head-hopping; tense and stance remain consistent. Voice is competent and purpose-driven, though not maximally distinctive under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is clear and rhythmically varied, with strong opening and closing images. Minor paraphrase loop: "periodically eternal pattern" / "periodically eternal ghost" / "periodically eternal climb" restates the same conceptual frame without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in archive sequence: "She carried… There she began… Each piece…" runs three stems without variation (−0.4). Filter verbs ("felt eternal," "felt," "letting the rhythm carry her") cluster in reflective beats but do not obscure immediacy given the lens. No metaphor muddle. Information density is moderate; some lines advance atmosphere more than plot or character choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Premise—witness to climate aftermath, sea-level monitoring, vanished shipping lanes—is thoughtfully executed but recognizable from contemporary climate fiction templates. The torn atlas page as anchoring object and the tapping-as-memorial frame offer fresh inflection, avoiding generic postapocalyptic beats. The "delayed revelation" about collapsed models is conceptually interesting but not boldly transformed into a dramatic turn. Risk-taking is moderate; the piece commits to its accumulative, lyric mode without gimmickry, but the synthesis feels more competent than startling.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lina is present throughout, her witness identity frames all beats, and she performs key actions (fishing out the atlas page, assembling fragments, tapping rhythms, placing the page in a case). Setup early, middle development (archive assembly), and payoff (tapping a new rhythm) are all present. However, her choices are observational and ritualistic rather than decisional under pressure; she does not face a forced trade-off that alters tactics or forecloses a path with visible cost. The character shapes tone and thematic resonance but does not drive a causal reversal. Late limiter: the final "new rhythm" is asserted rather than earned by a prior decision that changed options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Atlas page is introduced early (washes against the platform), used in the middle (carried to archive, traced with finger, matched to logs), and returns at the end (placed in waterproof case as reminder). It appears in three distinct beats and is handled on the page. The page's "vanished shipping lane" directly supplies the thematic question (why paths disappear) and charges the closure image. Swappability friction: another lost map or document could serve a similar function with minor edits (−0.4). The page does not constrain a tactical choice under pressure; it is focal object and memorial rather than a tool that enables or blocks action.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Delayed revelation is present: Lina's realization that the shipping lane "was plotted using a model that assumed endless fossil fuel use" arrives midway and explains the vanished paths. Setup occurs in the archive sequence, and the concept returns at closure ("some paths are gone, others waiting to be drawn"). The revelation is told in reflection rather than dramatized as a beat that changes Lina's options or tactics, limiting causal pressure. It reweights the thematic question but does not force a visible cost or trade-off on the page. The concept feels more ornamental than indispensable to closure mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Periodically eternal" appears as a label in narration ("periodically eternal pattern," "periodically eternal ghost," "periodically eternal climb," "periodically eternal" rhythm at closure). The phrase is present across multiple beats and charges the ending image conceptually. However, it functions as thematic motif rather than a trait that constrains or enables a specific on-page action with cost. The attribute does not alter Lina's choices or tactics; it describes the tide and bleaching cycle externally. Swappability: "cyclical," "unending," or "recursive" could replace it with minimal structural impact (−0.5). No causal pressure tied to the trait itself.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Assembling fragments (atlas page, shipping log, satellite printout) is present in the archive beat and drives the delayed revelation about the collapsed model. The action is signaled, occurs on the page, and connects to the thematic question. It reappears conceptually at closure when Lina places the atlas page in a waterproof case and begins "tapping a new rhythm." Development beat is clear; payoff is present but understated. The action is somewhat swappable—researching, comparing, or decoding could serve a similar function (−0.4). The assembly does not constrain a tactical choice under pressure; it enables reflection rather than forcing a visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Tapping rhythms is introduced early ("a habit learned from an old fisherman"), used in the middle ("tapping a slow rhythm… counting the years," "began to tap a rhythm that matched the line's curve"), and central to the closure ("tapping a new rhythm, one that charted a course," "She let the tapping fade into the night"). The method appears in four distinct beats and is embodied on the page. It charges the final image as memorial practice. Swappability friction: another repeated gesture (sketching, humming, marking tallies) could serve a similar ritualistic function (−0.5). The tapping does not enable a tactical choice or impose a cost that alters options; it is expressive rather than instrumental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The sea-level monitoring station is established early (floating disc moored to the ocean floor, steel railing, tide gauges, cramped archive) and supplies the spatial frame for all action. The station's isolation and drifting quality directly support tone and thematic resonance. The tide gauges record the "periodically eternal" rise, and the archive supplies the materials Lina assembles. The setting pressures the witness role and charges the final image (moored sentinel). No tactical constraint: Lina's choices are not altered by the station's resources or limitations in a way that forecloses a path. The setting is atmospheric and coherent but does not drive a causal turn with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The fossil-fuel ban timeframe is established early ("the fossil-fuel ban had cleaned the air but left the sea rising") and supplies the conceptual backdrop for the delayed revelation (old models collapsed when the ban came). The timeframe reappears at closure ("a world that had moved beyond fossil fuels"). It shapes the thematic question but does not function as a live clock or tighten decisions on the page. Lina's actions (calibrating sensors, tapping, assembling) are not time-pressured. The ban is historical context rather than a tactical constraint. Swappability: another climate-policy shift could serve a similar conceptual role (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation (to discover why some paths disappear) is dramatized early ("why some paths disappear while the water rises, a question that nagged her") and drives the archive assembly and delayed revelation. It returns at closure ("Now she understood why some paths disappear"). The desire is clear and consistent. Friction: the motivation is pursued through reflection and assembly rather than a choice that faces competing costs or forecloses a tactical option. The question is answered conceptually, not through a visible trade-off on the page. The motivation shapes beats and thematic resonance but does not generate protagonist agency under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Drifting moored" tone is established early (the station "drifting with the tide," moored to the ocean floor) and sustained throughout via diction (slow rhythm, echoes, drifting thoughts, "quiet sentinel"). The tone modulates subtly—grief in coral-bleaching memories, curiosity in the archive, resolve at closure—without breaking coherence. It charges the final image ("The station drifted gently, moored to the seabed") and integrates with the "periodically eternal" motif. The tone is purposeful and consistent across turns, supporting the accumulative lens and memorial frame. No tonal rupture or static flatness.</comment>
