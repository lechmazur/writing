<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's role as arcane linguist remains label-only; her expertise in "mapping the maze of shelves" never constrains a tactical choice. The warden encounter and botanist rescue proceed through told summary rather than embodied decisions under pressure. Interiority is generic ("felt the diary's brittle pages," "stood firm, her voice steady") without character-particular contradiction or embodied emotion. The "carefully resourceful" attribute appears only as assertion; no on-page tradeoff demonstrates what she forgoes to succeed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Causal but linkage is weak: the diary's gaps function as a cipher only by authorial assertion, and the warden accepts terms without dramatized negotiation or cost. The closure—emerging into dawn with the diary complete—offers no visible price or foreclosed path; the "unheard symphony finally audible" is metaphoric summary, not an on-page reconfiguration. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive late (~150 words) but the fantasy frame mitigates confusion. The rescue succeeds via convenient plotting: the healing incantation appears without prior setup, and the library grants knowledge freely.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The mountain bookstore is vivid in metaphor ("rose like a forgotten organ," "stone chambers humming") but never constrains movement or choice; spatial choreography in the catacombs is vague. The glass-ceiling mosaic and herb-scented air are atmospheric postcards without tactical relevance. The warden's "eyes glowing like muted brass" and "silent chord" offer tone but no physical pressure. Sensory selection tilts heavily visual and generic; the "perfume of forgotten herbs" does not alter Elara's path or choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reach the library—is declared early but never tested on the page. The warden negotiation is summarized in two beats without visible cost or narrowed options; Elara proposes terms and the warden nods. The botanist rescue involves no obstacle or tradeoff: the healing incantation works immediately, and the return trip is frictionless. No on-page reversal tightens pressure; the story moves and-then through a sequence of cooperative acts. Coincidence solves (time traveler delivers the exact diary; gaps map to unfinished clauses) rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The "unheard symphony" motif recurs frequently but remains abstract metaphor without grounding in concrete action or cost. Theme of "gaps as bridges" and "unlearned lessons" is stated overtly ("every unlearned lesson held the potential to change history") rather than dramatized. The final image—diary now complete, mountain singing louder—asserts resonance without reweighting prior stakes. The warden's "silent chord" metaphor is repeated without evolving meaning. No thematic irony or counter-reading emerges; the tale resolves into a tidy moral about listening and resourcefulness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the metaphoric register ("forgotten organ," "mute chords," "golden chords") is consistent throughout. However, diction drifts into generic elevated prose ("Color returned to his cheeks," "plucked a volume at random") that lacks Elara's particular perceptual signature. Dialogue is minimal and functional; the botanist's "murmuring thanks in a language that had not been spoken for centuries" is told rather than rendered. The "unheard symphony" frame is coherent but leans on repetition of the same lexical cluster without fresh inflection under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high ("symphony," "chord," "note," "composition," "movement") across nearly every paragraph, creating template cadence without taught pattern or payoff. Paraphrase loops abound: "silent stories" / "silent song" / "silent chorus" / "silent chord"; "unheard symphony" appears nine times. Scaffold phrasing recurs: "She [verb]," "The [noun] [verb]," "Together they [verb]." The "visual symphony" mosaic and "acoustic" stone read as strained metaphor blurring literal sense. Filter verbs stack in peaks: "felt," "noticed," "realized," "thought." Information density is low; many sentences restate atmosphere without advancing situation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The core premise—mountain bookstore as labyrinth with a memory-fed warden—is familiar fantasy furniture. The "gaps as cipher" mechanic appears without groundwork and resolves via convenient fit between diary blanks and unfinished clauses. The time-traveler frame adds no causal pressure; he delivers the quest item and vanishes. Emotional arc is generic: competent expert completes mission, gains artifact, resumes work. The "unheard symphony" conceit is poetic but not integrated into character choice or world logic. No risky structural or perspectival choice elevates the material; the tale follows template quest-rescue structure without transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and touches every beat, but her linguist expertise does not constrain a single choice. She "maps shelves," "researches gaps," and "proposes a new agreement," all told in summary. No on-page decision alters tactics or cost; the warden encounter and botanist rescue proceed by assertion. Late-cap applies (no specific cost tied to her expertise), and swappability is high: any knowledgeable protagonist could fill the role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The botanical diary appears in beat one (time traveler hands it over), is examined for gaps (beat two), used as negotiation key (beat three), and returns completed at closure. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. However, the diary's mechanics—gaps map to unfinished clauses—are asserted rather than demonstrated, and the healing incantation arrives without prior setup. The closure reprise ("closed the botanical diary, its pages now a complete composition") reweights the object but the cost is conceptual, not action-tied. Swappability: any coded artifact could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The concept "rescue missions" is declared in exposition ("a rescue mission that had gone silent," "botanist's rescue became a legend," "other rescue missions sought her expertise") but the on-page botanist retrieval involves no obstacle or tradeoff. Setup is mid-story (traveler explains ~paragraph 5), development is summary (Elara finds him slumped, whispers incantation), and closure mentions future missions thematically without causal link. The concept shapes premise but not tactics or stakes within the dramatized beats.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Carefully resourceful" appears once as label ("Elara, ever carefully resourceful, felt the diary's brittle pages") without demonstration. No on-page action shows what she conserves or foregoes; the warden negotiation and botanist rescue proceed without visible tradeoff or constrained resource. The attribute does not enable or prevent any beat. Late first use (~paragraph 4), ornamental mention, and swappability (could delete with zero plot impact) all apply.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Renegotiate" appears early (paragraph 8: "renegotiate the ancient pact") and recurs at the warden encounter (paragraph 12: "proposed a new agreement") and closure (paragraph 26: "renegotiated the boundaries of knowledge"). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met, and the action drives the warden beat. However, the negotiation itself is summarized without dramatized back-and-forth or visible cost; the warden simply "considered" and "nodded." Specificity is mid: the action matters, but the mechanics are asserted. Two beats (warden, library) plus closure linkage elevate the score, but swappability remains (could substitute "bargain" or "persuade").</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Researching gaps" is signaled early (paragraph 6: "gaps were not errors but a cipher") and recurs at the warden moment (paragraph 9: "by researching gaps in the text, found clauses"). Setup and development gates are met. However, the method is told in summary; no on-page beat shows Elara comparing texts or testing hypotheses. The closure paragraph mentions "research gaps" again but as abstract theme, not causal action. Swappability is high: "study," "decode," "interpret" could replace with minor edits. No specific cost tied to this method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The mountain bookstore is present from the opening line and recurs in every major beat (stone chambers, catacombs, glass-ceiling cavern, return to desk). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The setting supplies the warden obstacle (paragraph 8) and the library goal (paragraph 21), driving two key beats. However, spatial choreography is vague; the labyrinth does not constrain movement or force tactical choices beyond generic "navigated." The "stone chambers humming" and "shifting" attributes are atmospheric without causal pressure. Three-gate presence and two-beat involvement raise the score, but lack of on-page constraint and high swappability (any magical library could substitute) limit further elevation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the time traveler arrives" anchors the opening beat (paragraph 2), but the traveler vanishes by paragraph 30 without creating urgency or deadline. No ticking clock tightens decisions; Elara's journey through the catacombs is leisurely ("moved carefully," "navigated the labyrinth"). Setup gate is met, but development and payoff are absent: time does not constrain or shape any choice. The traveler's departure at closure is summary without causal link. Ornamental mention and no middle or closure participation apply.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the library of unlearned lessons" is declared mid-story (paragraph 7: "library of unlearned lessons") and drives the warden negotiation and catacombs descent. Setup and development gates are met. However, the desire is never conflicted; no on-page beat shows Elara weighing cost or risk. The library's payoff (paragraph 21: "entered a cavern") is atmospheric rather than choice-driven, and the closure references "unlearned lesson" thematically without friction. Two-beat involvement (warden, library) lifts the score, but told-only desire and zero visible tradeoff limit further elevation. Late first appearance (~paragraph 7, past 25%) applies the late-cap at 4.6; strong development and closure linkage recover some ground.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "unheard symphony" tone is introduced in the opening line and sustained via musical metaphor throughout ("silent stories," "mute chords," "notes of light," "visual symphony," "unheard symphony"). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The tone is coherent and modulates slightly at closure ("finally audible to those who listened"), reweighting the initial image. However, the metaphoric register is static; "symphony" and "chord" recur without evolving meaning or charging a specific choice. The final image attempts resonance but remains abstract. Three-gate presence and closure reprise elevate the score; lack of variation under pressure and high ornamental density prevent higher placement.</comment>
