<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The liberator remains an abstract cipher throughout—"chained at the ankle," "his purpose burns bright"—with no embodied emotion, contradictory impulses, or concrete micro-choices that test his convictions. His motivations are declared ("to plant resilience") but never internally conflicted or dramatized through struggle; he moves through the sequence with unchallenged competence. The sentry encounter ("with staggering grace, he swings the chain") reads as choreographed rather than earned through flaws or limits. Diagnostic label-speak ("his mind a calm ocean") and therapy-register interiority ("his heart a compass") flatten what could be a visceral ordeal.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is acceptable: who (liberator), where (carnival redemption center), and when (present moment with "wall comes down" as timeframe marker) anchor by the opening paragraphs. The causal lens holds through the piano-key puzzle and sentry confrontation, but the closure lacks legible cost: the liberator kneels to plant a seed "triumphant," still chained, with no visible price, forfeited path, or meaningful alteration to his stance. The final image ("his chains a map, ready for the next horizon") gestures toward resonance but delivers only assertion. The Cost Proof Test fails—no sentence in the ending beat shows what he has lost or risked beyond what was already declared at the start.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The carnival setting is vivid in opening lines ("rusted carousel horses," "stale popcorn and decay") but degrades into postcard description; the chained protagonist never uses spatial constraints or tools to solve problems in ways only this setting permits. The piano bench and arrow appear as generic puzzle pieces, not environment-specific resources. The micro-setting (body, chain, piano) charges the sentry encounter slightly, lifting the score above ornamental, but the final kneeling in "dry ground" outside offers no tactile resistance or consequence tied to the carnival's particulars.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>A dominant stake ("plant resilience") is signaled early and persists. One meaningful tightening occurs when the sentry activates, forcing the liberator to "impede its advance," which narrows options briefly and uses the arrow. However, the escalation is mechanical: each obstacle (lock, sentry, vault hatch) is solved in sequence without compounding prior costs or forcing trade-offs. The resolution ("still chained but triumphant") asserts victory without showing what path was foreclosed or what price was paid; coincidence does not resolve, but neither does genuine agency under duress. Cost clarity at closure is absent, capping the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme of resilience emerges through concrete objects (seeds, dry soil) and the vault motif, but the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "a green rebellion against the arid silence," "promise of new life," "his chains a map." These are prompt-echo labels rather than earned images. The liberator's internal arc is static—he begins purposeful and ends unchanged—so the thematic question is never tested through struggle. The vault and seeds offer potential for a charged image but are summarized ("each a promise of resilience") rather than left to resonate non-literally. Thematic Echo penalty applied for prompt-like language in the final third.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited, but the narrator's voice is generic elevated prose ("his heart a steady drum," "the soil...seems to sigh") that converges with the thematic mood rather than filtering through the liberator's particular perceptual signature. Psychic distance is consistent but distant throughout—no embodied texture or character-specific diction. No dialogue is present; the single focalization avoids head-hopping. Minor register drift into abstract lyricism ("compass," "map of hope") without grounding in concrete perception. The piece reads as consistent committee voice rather than a singular, pressured consciousness.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops damage momentum: "chained at the ankle...still chained but triumphant...still chained," "promise of resilience...promise of new life," "his heart a steady drum, his mind a map of hope...his heart a compass, his chains a map." Template-cadence runs appear in the final third ("He knows...He imagines...He knows"). Figurative density in low-pressure moments (carousel horses, phantom archer, "melodic chime," "green rebellion") reads as ornamental overwriting. Stock metaphors ("his mind a calm ocean," "his heart a compass") flatten the closure beats. Cumulative artifact penalty (loops + template stems + stock figures): −1.2 in Q7; final-third presence disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The premise—chained liberator solving a piano-key puzzle in an abandoned carnival to access seeds—offers surface novelty but the execution is derivative: the puzzle is solved without setback, the sentry overcome with grace, and the seeds claimed without sacrifice. The "chains as ladder/map" conceit in the final lines is a late symbolic convenience rather than an earned transformation. Emotional specificity is absent; the arc could be transplanted to any setting with minimal rewrite. No bold risk or synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight; the piece reads as a response to a checklist rather than a singular vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The chained liberator is present throughout and frames the setup, presses piano keys in the middle beat, and kneels to plant a seed at closure—meeting all three gates and appearing in at least three beats. However, his choices are unopposed and costless: he studies, presses keys, retrieves the arrow, defeats the sentry, selects seeds, and plants without dramatized trade-offs or failures. The chain constrains him spatially but never forces a meaningful choice between competing goods or tactics. Causal pressure is minimal; swapping "liberator" for "prisoner" or "refugee" would require only minor edits. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.8, but swappability −0.7, ornamental chain use −0.6, and lack of cost connection −0.4 yield a net mid-band score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The arrow appears in three beats: lying beside the bench with "strange fletching," guiding the key sequence, and returning as a talisman at closure. Setup by first third, middle involvement (points to pattern, used to press final key), and closure reprise satisfy all three gates. The "iridescent feathers" and "phantom archer" gift add specificity, but the arrow's function is passive guidance rather than active constraint—it could be replaced by a diagram or marking with minimal loss. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9, specificity +0.4, but swappability −0.8, ornamental descriptor ("strange fletching") −0.5 = ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The clandestine seed vault is the story's central object: signaled in paragraph six ("beneath the cracked linoleum"), drives the piano-key puzzle (gate entrance), and is opened at the climax with seed selection shaping the kneeling closure. Setup early, middle puzzle causally depends on it, and closure action (planting seeds) flows from vault access—all three gates met. The vault's "ancient, resilient strains" shape the liberator's stated goal and the ending image of planting. However, the vault itself is static description; no choice is narrowed by its properties beyond "unlock it." Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, causal pressure +0.9, but static use −0.7, summary-only opening of vault −0.5 = ~6.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Patiently strategic" is labeled once in paragraph twelve ("He studies the bench patiently, strategic") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. He does not exhibit patience under pressure—no moment where haste would solve faster but risk failure, no visible trade-off between patience and urgency. The trait is asserted, not dramatized. Setup present (first third), no middle beat that tests it, no closure use. Label-only −0.8, single mention (not a beat) caps involvement credit, swappability −0.6 (could be "carefully methodical" without edit) = ~3.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Impede" appears twice: the wall's purpose is "to impede any intruder" (descriptor), and the liberator "must impede [the sentry's] advance" (action beat). The sentry encounter is the story's only pressured moment, and "impede" drives that turn—swinging the chain to redirect the sentry's force, confusing its programming. Setup late (second half), middle beat is the action itself, closure does not return to impeding. The action is signaled and matters, but could be replaced by "block," "deflect," or "counter" with no structural loss. Late introduction −0.4, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, swappability −0.6 = ~5.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The piano-key method is signaled early (paragraph nine: "keys are not metal...black and white keys of a forgotten piano"), developed in the middle (arrow points to "sequence of black keys forming a hidden chord," he presses them), and pays off at closure (arrow tip presses final key, lock releases). Setup, development, and payoff gates all met. The mechanics matter—without the key sequence, the vault stays locked—and the method is specific (piano keys vs. generic lock). However, the decoding is instantaneous; no trial-and-error or cost. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.0, but no cost −0.5, summary solution −0.4, swappability (could be any puzzle) −0.6 = ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival prize redemption center is named in the opening line and furnishes the piano bench, carousel horses, brick wall, and linoleum floor. Setup immediate, middle beats occur within it, closure plants seed outside but references carnival ghosts. However, the setting is postcard description—"rusted carousel horses," "stale popcorn and decay"—without constraining choices or supplying resources unique to a carnival. The piano could be in any building; the chain and vault are setting-neutral. Early signal +0.8, closure linkage (ghosts watch) +0.5, but ornamental use −0.9, swappability (could be warehouse, school, theater) −0.7 = ~4.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"When the wall comes down" is declared as the moment in paragraph seventeen and occurs at paragraph twenty-six ("The wall collapses"). The timeframe brackets the action but does not create urgency—no countdown, no visible consequence if he delays. He proceeds at narrative speed without time pressure altering tactics. Setup present (signaled early as story's axis), middle puzzle unfolds without clock, closure arrival is declarative not urgent. The phrase shapes expectation but not decisions. Early signal +0.6, closure linkage +0.7, but no tactical constraint −0.8, untracked time −0.6, swappability (any trigger phrase) −0.5 = ~4.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The motivation "to plant resilience in dry soil" is stated in paragraph five and repeated throughout, framing the liberator's goal. Setup early, drives the vault quest (middle), and closure action (planting seed) enacts it. However, the desire is declared, not dramatized through conflicted choices—no moment where planting risks something else he values, no friction between want and cost. The motivation is consistent but static, never tested. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, but told-only −0.9, no cost friction −0.7 = ~5.2.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Staggering grace" appears once in paragraph twenty-one ("with staggering grace, he swings the chain") describing the sentry encounter. The tone is asserted in that label but not sustained or modulated—elsewhere the prose is declarative and abstract ("his purpose burns bright," "his heart a compass"). No coherent tonal arc; the phrase is ornamental. Single mention (second half), no setup, cameo at one beat, no closure charge. Late introduction −0.6, ornamental label −0.8, single static mood −0.5, no closure linkage −0.4 = ~4.4.</comment>
