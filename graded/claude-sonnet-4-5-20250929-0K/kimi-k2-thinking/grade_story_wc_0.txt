<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena's interiority is concrete and her perceptual bias (converting phenomena to data patterns) is consistent throughout. The core tension between stripping away drama and finding meaning in gradual change drives her micro-choices in the greenhouse. However, the final realization feels somewhat summarized rather than earned through embodied contradiction—she observes, reflects, and concludes without a moment where conflicting impulses force a visible cost. The butterfly dust gesture reads as symbolic closure rather than a choice that forecloses a live option.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates sensory particulars (watermarks, mold, butterfly scales) and uses them to reweight Elena's understanding of decay and drama. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of the radio telescope's decay patterns reconfigures her professional lens with visible cost (she will "begin again" with a changed method). Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when she moves from seeking pure signal to hearing both signal and noise. Cost is conceptual and felt but slightly abstract—the story tells us she will admit "some questions required not answers but acceptance" rather than showing that admission on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The storm-damaged greenhouse is vividly anchored with sensory particulars (shattered glass, mossy stone, watery sunlight) and pressures Elena's understanding through accumulated decay evidence. The butterfly on the path and its transferable wing-dust function as micro-setting that charges the final image when the dust is brushed onto moss. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout. The radio telescope's "pocked" surface in the final beat extends the decay motif and constrains her future work, satisfying the 9+ gate for constraint/charge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Elena seeks to understand "the underlying mechanics" and strip needless drama from existence. One meaningful deepening occurs when the greenhouse "taught her otherwise," forcing a revision of her preprocessing method. Agency is renunciation—she will "let it live as memory" rather than document further—but this choice does not foreclose a live tactical option on the page; it summarizes a future stance. The cost (relinquishing her data-extraction approach) is legible but more conceptual than visceral.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the interplay of scientific method and natural decay without overt statement. The recurring dust motif (butterfly scales, watermarks, spores) accumulates and shifts meaning at the ending when Elena sees the radio telescope's decay patterns as equally valid. The final image of parking beneath the pocked dish and going inside to "begin again" offers a resonant answer to the central question—how to preprocess reality—without moralizing. Minor slip: "the lesson of a flood that taught her to stop looking for drama in the silence between the stars" edges toward explicit thematic summary in the penultimate section.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Elena filters the greenhouse through scientific lexicon ("spectral patterns," "pure signal of decay"). Distance control is consistent. The text message exchange at the climax carries subtext and advances her internal shift. Minor register slips occur when the narration adopts abstract phrasing not quite rooted in Elena's scientist voice—e.g., "the kindled humility of having witnessed" reads slightly elevated for the immediate moment. Psychic distance shifts are purposeful and support emotional beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "decay revealed itself through accumulated dust patterns" in paragraph 8 restates the concept already shown in paragraphs 4–7. The phrase "preprocesses reality" recurs four times without functional variation, creating template cadence. "Needless drama" appears three times in similar constructions. Apply −0.6 for loops and template stems. The final third maintains clarity and propulsion, preventing deeper penalties.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of astrophysics researcher and personal grief via decay patterns is specific and non-obvious. The greenhouse as laboratory for understanding non-instrumental observation offers a fresh angle. However, the emotional arc—scientist learns to value messiness over data purity—follows a recognizable template without full transformation through lived detail. The mother's accusation of "turning every silence into a supernova" is vivid, but Elena's epiphany arrives more through reflection than through a non-obvious choice or turn that grows inevitably from prior particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character present from the opening and drives the narrative. Elena's choices (kneeling to touch the butterfly, typing the message, brushing dust onto moss, deciding not to return) create small turns. However, most are contemplative gestures rather than decisions that narrow tactical options under pressure. She observes, reflects, and resolves—but the peak choice (to carry a "new preprocessing" back to the observatory) is summary rather than dramatized with competing costs on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Butterfly dust appears in three beats: Elena touches the wing and transfers scales to her skin (paragraph 5), reflects on the dust joining the "quiet archive" (paragraph 10), and brushes it onto moss as a "kind of prayer" (paragraph 27). The object reweights meaning at closure when she sees "a billion dust motes" in the living butterfly and later the radio telescope's decay. Strong causal presence and closure linkage, though the final reprise is slightly metaphorical rather than tactile.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Gradual change shapes the dominant stake (Elena's method of understanding decay) and is demonstrated on the page through watermarks, mold, and wing scales. The concept alters her tactics: she moves from seeking "pure signal" to hearing "both signal and noise." Closure reprices her professional approach via this concept. However, much of the work is reflective summary ("Each water stain...was not a data point") rather than a scene choice where gradual change constrains an action with immediate cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Preprocesses reality" is introduced as Elena's occupational trait and recurs throughout. It frames her initial approach (stripping cosmic noise) and the reversal (including the noise). However, the trait functions mostly as thematic label; it does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. She reflects on preprocessing but does not demonstrate a moment where this method versus another creates a tactical tradeoff or forecloses a path. Present and functional but largely ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Decay is central to every beat: shattered glass, dead butterfly, mold, watermarks, and finally the radio telescope's pocked surface. The action (witnessing and understanding decay) drives Elena's realization and shapes the closure image. Removing decay would break the story's logic entirely. The element is indispensable and appears in setup, middle reflection, and closure. Strong integration with felt cost—Elena must accept decay as meaningful rather than noise.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The method (accumulated dust patterns) is signaled early and demonstrated via watermarks, spores, and butterfly scales. It shapes Elena's realization that "decay revealed itself through accumulated dust patterns on every surface." The method appears in the final image (radio telescope's decay patterns) and reweights her approach. However, the mechanics remain descriptive rather than tactical—Elena observes the patterns but does not use them to solve a problem or make a choice with competing costs on the page. Lyric reprise with thematic charge but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Storm-damaged greenhouse is anchored in the opening sentence and supplies the entire scene's resources: shattered glass, mossy path, orchid bark, water-stained surfaces. The setting constrains Elena's investigation (she must witness rather than salvage) and provides the sensory evidence that alters her understanding. The space's decay state is causally active in every beat. Strong setup, development, and closure participation—the greenhouse is the crucible for her conceptual shift.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Three weeks after the flood" anchors the timeframe in the opening sentence and "after the flood" recurs in the final third. The timing explains the decay state (watermarks, mold colonization) and provides context for Elena's visit. However, the flood functions as backstory rather than a live constraint; it does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page. Elena's actions are contemplative and untimed. The element is present and logical but replaceable with any prior disaster without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Motivation introduced in paragraph 12 ("her mother had always accused her of needless drama") and reprised when Elena realizes "in seeking to strip needless drama...she had been stripping existence itself." The desire shapes her realization and alters her professional stance at closure. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized in conflicted action—Elena reflects on the accusation but does not face a choice where stripping versus embracing drama creates competing on-page costs. Functional but summary-driven.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Tone of quiet observation and humility is coherent throughout. "Kindled humility" arrives explicitly in paragraph 29 and is demonstrated via Elena's restrained gestures (kneeling, brushing dust, watching the butterfly leave). The tone modulates appropriately—scientific precision in early paragraphs softens to contemplative acceptance by the ending. The final image ("smiled, and went inside to begin again") carries the tone into closure. Strong coherence but slightly static; no sharp tonal shift under peak pressure to charge the final beat further.</comment>
