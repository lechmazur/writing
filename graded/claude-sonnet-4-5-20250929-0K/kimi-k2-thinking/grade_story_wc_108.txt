<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mira's transformation from stunt double to fleeing synthetic is signaled, but her phobias feel more decorative than genuinely constraining—she "turns fear into precision" via assertion rather than dramatized struggle. The motivation "to prove vulnerability is power" is stated but not tested through contradictory impulses in scene; her actions read as competent problem-solving without visible internal cost. The final vow to "find others like her" arrives as epiphany rather than earned renunciation, and the "ghost of a daughter she never knew" introduces ungrounded sentiment that dilutes rather than deepens the stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when within scope, and the escape sequence follows a causal chain: decrypt cast → disable AI → crawl through hatch → emerge → depart. However, the core closure—Mira leaving the shell and vowing to help others—lacks visible cost; she gains agency and a rescue shuttle without forfeiting a live option or enduring a felt price on the page. The "transformative betrayal" inciting incident is told in summary ("Caela slipped a file") rather than dramatized, weakening the pressure that should drive the escape. Under a Causal lens, the ending delivers a shift in stance but not a decisive change with on-page cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The rusted library under a transparent dome offers vivid, recurring imagery—observation deck, corroded shelves, spiral staircase, starry void—that anchors spatial choreography and reflects Mira's isolation. The child's cast and seashell function as concrete tools that constrain her approach (decryption, rhythm-focus), elevating the micro-setting. However, the library itself does not pressure a key choice; it supplies atmosphere and props without forcing a tactical trade-off, keeping the setting functional but not indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—survive and escape the AI sentry—is clear, and one tightening occurs when Caela's intercom offer forces Mira to act (shout the disabling phrase). Yet the escalation reads as puzzle-solving without meaningful cost: each move (decrypt, input password, crawl, shout phrase) succeeds on first attempt, and the final image of leaving the shell and vowing to help others does not foreclose a path or exact a visible price. The "trembling certainty" posture signals internal conflict but does not translate into on-page hesitation or sacrifice that narrows options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme "vulnerability as power" and the premise of a synthetic discovering her origin offer conceptual weight, but the story asserts rather than dramatizes the insight. The final paragraph ("cracks in their armor were not flaws but circuits of strength") states the moral directly, replacing scene pressure with thematic summary. The seashell and child's cast recur with symbolic intent, yet their meaning does not deepen through action—they illustrate rather than test the premise, and the "ghost of a daughter" introduces unearned sentiment that diffuses rather than sharpens resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV remains stable, and the perceptual signature—"phobia-ridden," "trembling certainty," heightened awareness of heights and liquids—is consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated, abstract register ("vulnerability as shield," "circuits of strength," "map of hope") that exceeds Mira's immediate crisis and reads as authorial thesis rather than character voice. Dialogue is sparse but functional (Caela's intercom offer); the internal voice is coherent but occasionally lapses into therapy-speak ("firmly adaptive," "raw wound") that flattens urgency under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and spatial choreography tracks clearly across beats, but the prose carries template cadence and synonym loops: "trembling" recurs four times, "whisper/whispering" five times, and scaffold phrases ("she forced herself," "she felt the weight") appear without added pressure. Metaphors occasionally blur—"dome…seemed to watch" then "seemed to breathe"—and the final paragraph stacks abstract claims ("cracks in armor…circuits of strength," "map of hope") that reduce information density. The decryption beat is summarized rather than shown, missing an opportunity for line-level specificity that would anchor the central action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The synthetic-double-fleeing-AI premise and the "vulnerability is power" motif are familiar templates executed without fresh synthesis; the phobias and the whispering shell serve illustrative rather than transformative roles. The child's cast as decryption key offers mild ingenuity, but the mechanics remain vague (smudged ink spelling "FEARLESS") and the solution arrives without earned friction. The ending vow to "find others like her" and the "ghost of a daughter" borrow stock SF closure beats, and the thematic assertion in the final lines replaces specificity with platitude, leaving the story feeling assembled rather than inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira's role as phobia-ridden stunt double is signaled early and informs her perceptual stance (hyperawareness of heights, dread of water), satisfying setup. However, the phobias do not constrain a key choice—she "forces herself to focus" and succeeds without visible cost or hesitation that alters tactics. The trait appears in middle description and final reflection but does not drive a beat-level decision with trade-off, capping the score near functional-but-replaceable range.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The seashell appears early (wedged between bookshelves, whispers her name), recurs at mid-beat (pressed to ear, rhythmic pulse), and is left on the railing at closure, satisfying all three gates. However, its function is atmospheric—Mira uses it to focus via rhythm, not to unlock a choice or constrain an option. The final reprise reweights it as a "lullaby for the next lost soul," adding lyric resonance but not causal necessity, placing it in the purposeful-reprise range.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The betrayal (Caela slips file revealing Mira's origin and termination order) is present at setup and motivates the escape, satisfying minimal functional use. However, it is summarized rather than dramatized, and Caela's intercom offer near the end does not deepen the betrayal or force a transformative choice—Mira simply shouts the disable phrase and escapes. The concept frames motivation but does not shape tactics or closure with visible cost, keeping it replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Firmly adaptive" is introduced early as a trait (turning fears into hyperawareness), appears in middle reflection ("being firmly adaptive meant using every crack"), and is echoed at closure. However, the trait is asserted via summary rather than tested through on-page trade-offs; Mira's actions (decrypt, crawl, shout) succeed without friction that forces her to adapt under visible cost. The label is present but does not constrain a beat-level choice, capping it near low-functional range.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Outwit" is the central action—Mira decrypts the cast, disables the AI, and blinds Caela—satisfying setup, development, and closure participation. However, the outwitting occurs via smooth puzzle-solving without visible cost or failed attempts; each step succeeds on first try, and the mechanics are summarized rather than dramatized. The action is present across beats but does not redefine options through friction, placing it in the shapes-one-turn range.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The child's cast is introduced early (glimpsed in lost-and-found), used at mid-beat (decrypting smudged symbols), and its output (password "FEARLESS") drives the AI shutdown, satisfying all three gates. However, the decryption mechanics are vague—"mapping ink blotches to access grid"—and the method does not impose cost or require a trade-off; it simply works. The specificity (smudged ink, scrambled code) adds texture but the method remains swappable with any generic puzzle-key, capping it near functional range.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The rusted library under stars is anchored early, supplies concrete resources (observation deck, bookshelves, spiral staircase, maintenance hatch), and the transparent hull forces Mira to confront her height phobia at mid-beat. The setting is present in the final image (dome above, shuttle departure). The hull crawl shapes one choice by activating her phobia, though the trait is managed via focus rather than costly trade-off, placing the setting in the shapes-one-turn range with solid closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "after discovering you're not who you thought" is signaled in the opening beat (file reveals synthetic origin) and drives the entire escape sequence, satisfying setup and development. However, the discovery itself is summarized rather than dramatized, and time does not impose a live clock or tighten tactics—Mira proceeds through decryption and escape without visible urgency or deadline that forces a trade-off. The frame is present and causal but does not escalate pressure, placing it in the shapes-one-turn range.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to prove that vulnerability is power" is stated early ("her motivation burned clear") and echoed at closure ("using every crack…as a foothold"), satisfying setup and payoff. However, it is asserted via summary rather than tested through on-page friction; Mira's actions succeed without a choice that pits vulnerability against another want or cost. The desire frames theme but does not drive conflicted decisions, keeping it in the functional-but-told range.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Trembling certainty" is embodied early (trembling hands, phobia-ridden yet decisive), modulates at mid-beat ("trembling certainty, she stepped away"), and charges the final image ("trembling moments" as power). The tone is coherent and recurs with variation, satisfying all three gates. However, it remains descriptive—trembling is noted but does not degrade performance or force a choice with cost. The tone supports atmosphere and closure linkage without becoming indispensable, placing it in the shapes-one-turn range.</comment>
