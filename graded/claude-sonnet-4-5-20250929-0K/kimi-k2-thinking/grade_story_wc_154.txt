<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Strong embodied interiority anchored to physical objects (coral, cast) that constrain choices. The anesthetic haze justifies fluid time and reflection without flattening present pressure. Interior monologue stays particular ("archipelagos despite ourselves"), though "shared anxiety" reads slightly diagnostic. Final choice—holding coral to cast—earns the renunciation of reach with visible cost scaled to length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure unit: Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final gesture ("I kept your number too") reweights abandonment as mutual preservation with undeniable emotional cost. Pattern taught early (coral/cast/translation motif) and paid off in final image. Orientation anchored by ~60 words (anesthetic, gurney, hospital). One meaningful deepening via decryption that narrows the guilt/forgiveness axis.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mist-clad atrium and brain coral texture charge the final image by mirroring neural/emotional labyrinths. Spatial choreography clean (gurney, chrome railing, cast). Sensory hierarchy filtered through anesthetic drift serves POV well. The atrium functions as micro-setting that constrains perception (twilight condensation = fading clarity). Minor: banyan tree silhouette and Honiara village references approach postcard in one beat but remain anchored to translation backstory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grafting meaning onto abandonment) signaled early and tightened via decryption beats. One meaningful reversal: smudges reveal "Find me in the quiet places" instead of condemnation, reweighting guilt as reciprocal absence with felt cost (daughter grew beyond reach). Agency is attention and renunciation under anesthetic pressure. No antagonist required; coincidence (anesthetic timing) complicates but does not resolve. Cost legible: he holds the objects but cannot reclaim the years.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (translation as bearing unspeakable weight; wounds opened to graft) emerges through coral/cast particulars without statement. Final decrypted message ("I kept your number too") offers non-literal answer to the question of mutual abandonment, reweighting prior guilt as shared preservation. Subtext in negative space ("where you stopped speaking") and coral's "remembers every tide" avoids moralizing. Quiet ending earns resonance from sustained motif work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Distinct perceptual signature: translator's habit of parsing codes, layered time under anesthetic, lexicon balancing technical (fentanyl, polyp) and lyric. POV stable; no head-hopping. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close in coral-tracing, wide in atrium dissolve). Minor register drift: "colonized his silence" and "archipelagos despite ourselves" elevate slightly beyond peak-stress diction, though voice-motivated and legible. No dialogue to assess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density high; most lines layer memory, sensation, and motif. Rhythm varies (short declarative "But the two are the same now" after longer spirals). Minor paraphrase loop: "translation is not about words but about carrying… He had carried too much" restates across two beats without added pressure (−0.3). Figurative language dense ("mist-clad," "banyan roots like unasked questions," "silence that grew teeth") but mostly coherent; one mixed vehicle: "silence…grew teeth" then "archipelagos" shifts root metaphor slightly (−0.2). No template cadence or filter stacks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Fresh synthesis: Pacific conflict translator + anesthetic haze + child's cast cipher integrates three non-obvious elements into unified stakes. "Translation between living and almost-lost" and "absence as first language" offer specific angles on abandonment. Transformation test passes: swap names/places and emotional arc collapses. Risk: non-linear time and heavy reflection under anesthetic could flatten, but piece earns it via decryption beats that advance present choice. Not derivative; avoids template abandonment plot via occupational specificity and coral/cast anchors.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Present in setup (translator, peace talks, ribs); middle beats anchor decryption skill and guilt source; closure gesture (holding coral to cast) flows from translator identity. Two beats: absorption of others' fears shapes present silence guilt, decryption enables final reweighting. Causal: occupation taught him "wounds must be opened," applied to daughter's cipher. Cost: his skill couldn't prevent the rift. Could swap for another empathic profession with edits, but translator-specific "carrying unspeakable weight" motif tightens fit.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setup: first paragraph, handled on gurney. Development: "remembers every tide" line primes memory motif, traced again mid-piece. Closure: held to cast in final gesture, recharging "brain remembering / bone mending." Three beats with evolving use. Causal pressure: coral's labyrinthine surface mirrors neural pathways under fentanyl, enabling decryption metaphor. Specificity: brain-patterned grooves matter. Visible cost: he holds memory object but cannot reclaim lost time. High irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setup: "shared anxiety" named mid-piece ("the same shared anxiety: that we become archipelagos"). Closure: mist "like forgiveness, indifferent and therefore kind" gestures toward collective wound resolution. One beat involvement (militants'/government's/children's fears carried). Friction: concept mostly told via thematic echo rather than dramatized choice pressure. No middle choice constrained by "sharedness" of anxiety—Kael's guilt is personal, not collective. Lyric reprise attempted but underspecified.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Present: boy on Malaita beach "shrewdly innocent, offering fragment like confession." Single mention, no development or closure link. Label-only; trait does not constrain choice or enable tactic. Could remove "shrewdly" without breaking logic. Ornamental characterization of minor off-page figure. Late first appearance (second third) and no payoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: "begins to unknot the tangle of guilt and memory." Development: decryption beats ("each deciphered glyph a loosening of the cord") enable middle pressure shift. Closure: decrypted message ("I kept your number too") delivers final reweighting. Two beats. Causal: unknotting allows reversal from condemnation to mutual preservation. Swappability: "decode" or "unravel" could substitute with minor edits, limiting top band. Cost visible: unbinding guilt also unbinds hope of repair.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Setup: cast's smudged notes introduced early. Development: stick figure, apartment code, invented script parsed across middle beats. Closure: decrypted phrase shapes final message. Mechanics matter: cipher = daughter's invented script, code = emotional map. Two beats. Causal: method gates access to reweighting. Friction: decryption mostly internal summary rather than on-page struggle with specific symbols. Could detail one glyph's solving to lift score. Still, essential—remove method and closure message has no dramatic foundation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup: first sentence. Development: condensation/mist anchor perception under anesthetic, banyan roots = "unasked questions" metaphor. Closure: "atrium's mist thickens into…forgiveness" charges final mood. Two beats. Micro-setting note: atrium is meeting-place memory, so it constrains present choice by layering guilt context. Friction: mostly atmospheric; does not supply resource or block tactic. Lyric reprise (twilight → forgiveness mist) reweights but stays metaphorical. Solid support, not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Setup: first line ("anesthetic pulls Kael under"). Development: "anesthetic sings in his blood, turning time fluid" enables layered memory structure. Closure: haze permits final gesture without full agency cost. Two beats. Causal: post-anesthetic state licenses reflection mode and decryption without violating realism. Does not tighten as live clock—no countdown pressure. Lyric allowance: seed (anesthetic) → final permission (forgiveness mist) reweights present/past boundary. Solid support, not urgent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setup: "unknot the tangle of guilt and memory, each deciphered glyph a loosening" signals desire. Development: "wounds must be opened to be grafted" applied to daughter silence. Closure: holding coral to cast enacts grafting gesture. Two beats with friction: wanting grafting versus accepting unbridgeable distance. Cost visible: new meaning does not restore daughter, only reweights guilt. Could articulate want/cost trade-off more sharply in one on-page micro-choice to reach high band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Coherent throughout: mist, bruised light, "mending," "indifferent forgiveness" sustain ache. Modulates: sharper at grenade/divorce facts, softens at coral-tracing, lifts at final decryption without resolving pain. Charges final image: "I kept your number too" = mutual ache. Diction consistent ("quietly grieving" texture in "bone mending, child growing older somewhere beyond his reach"). Strong tonal command; nearly indispensable to closure's emotional register.</comment>
