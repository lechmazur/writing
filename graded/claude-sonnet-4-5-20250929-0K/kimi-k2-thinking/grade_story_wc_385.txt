<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The Echo Singer remains a thin archetype rather than a character with contradictory impulses. Her motivation "to learn why some people echo" is declared but never tested against a competing desire or cost; she simply collects voices without sacrifice or transformation. The late reveal about "a love she had lost" arrives as convenient backstory rather than an embodied wound that complicates her present choices. Interiority consists mostly of abstract perception ("richly perceptive") and therapeutic self-awareness ("reed-blown melancholy") without the messy, irrational texture of someone under genuine pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural but never coheres—beats loop through the same "sang a note, echo returned, seashell whispered" structure without meaningful deepening or pattern break. Orientation is delayed past 120 words with no taught disorientation pattern (−0.4). The "conspiracy of silence" and "webs of intrigue" are asserted rather than dramatized, and no on-page reversal narrows options. The ending's "purpose crystallized" moment is told summary rather than a legible Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost; she walks away unchanged, her vigil continuing exactly as before.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The serpentine canyon and starlight are vividly rendered through repeated figurative language, but the setting remains postcard description—it does not constrain a single choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. The seashell, though handled multiple times, functions as a passive collection device rather than an environmental element that pressures decision. Spatial choreography is clear, and the "throat that swallowed starlight" offers strong atmospheric texture, elevating the score modestly despite the lack of tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to learn why some people echo"—is signaled early but never faces on-page complication or cost. No reversal narrows options; each echo she uncovers simply adds to the seashell without forcing a trade-off or threatening her goal. The late mention of "a love she had lost" could introduce personal stakes, but it resolves immediately in the same paragraph via summary ("she sang it into the canyon"). Agency is observation and collection, not decision under pressure; the canyon "responds" and "amplifies" without resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme of memory-as-wound emerges through the echo conceit, and the final image of her becoming part of the "endless refrain" offers lyric resonance. However, the thematic payoff is undercut by direct statement: "she understood that to echo is to be remembered," "some echoes are meant to be heard, not solved," and "every echo has its origin, its story, its end" read as thesis sentences rather than earned insight from concrete struggle. The "conspiracy of silence" and "webs of intrigue" remain abstract claims disconnected from scene pressure, and the closing acceptance of sorrow ("letting the sorrow fill her like a tide, then recede") feels like emotional arithmetic rather than lived cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyric register with purposeful compression and patterned repetition ("serpentine nexus," "reed-blown melancholy," "whispering seashell half"), teaching an accumulative voice early. However, the narrative distance is unstable: moments of close perception ("She felt the reed-blown melancholy deepen") alternate with omniscient cosmic framing ("the universe hummed on, indifferent") without clear motivation. The Echo Singer's perceptual signature is more atmospheric label ("richly perceptive") than a character-specific way of noticing, and the recurring phrases begin to feel algorithmic rather than voice-driven by the final third.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Severe template-cadence runs dominate: "She sang… She listened… She uncovered… She realized… She felt… She understood… She lifted… She realized… She lowered… She walked… She smiled… She continued… She accepted" across the final two-thirds creates mechanical drumbeat (−0.6). Paraphrase loops appear ("serpentine nexus" six times, "reed-blown melancholy" five times, "secret song" four times, "webs of intrigue" three times) without evolution (−0.4). Stock metaphor strings ("thread woven into the night," "veil," "web," "spiral," "tide") and filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she understood," "she knew") dull immediacy in peak beats (−0.5). Information density is low; many sentences restate atmosphere without advancing situation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The premise—a voice-collector in a resonant canyon—offers moderate freshness, but the execution relies heavily on stock lyric tropes: the wise solitary figure, the mystical landscape as mirror, the melancholy quest for memory. The "conspiracy of silence" and "webs of intrigue" appear as generic thriller scaffolding grafted onto a lyric frame without integration. The emotional arc of solitary acceptance and cosmic harmony is a familiar template, and the specific details (seashell, echo mechanics, the lost love) do not transform the premise into a lived, non-obvious synthesis. The piece reads as a competent response to prompt elements rather than an urgent artistic vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Present throughout and named in the first paragraph, but the Echo Singer makes no choices that alter tactics—she observes, collects, and accepts without conflict or cost. Her "decisions" are summary statements ("she realized," "she understood") rather than dramatized turns. She appears in the closure paragraph but passively ("the Echo Singer remained"), not causally driving the final image.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The whispering seashell half is handled in at least three beats: initial clutch, mid-scene listening merge, and final lowering. It enables her collection method and returns in the closure with changed meaning ("its whisper now silent, its secret safe"). However, it does not constrain a choice or impose cost—she uses it successfully throughout without friction. The object shapes her tactic but does not test or transform her.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Webs of intrigue" is asserted twice as theme ("conspiracy of silence," threads) but never dramatized as on-page stakes. The concept does not change her options or tactics; no intrigue complicates her collection, and the "conspiracy" is mentioned then forgotten. It functions as atmospheric label rather than active pressure, and could be removed without altering her arc.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Richly perceptive" is declared in the opening but never shown through a specific tradeoff or on-page cost. She "catches the faintest rustle" and hears "layers" in echoes, yet this ability never limits her, forces a mistake, or creates tension. The trait is label-only; removing it would require no structural change, only editing the descriptive claim.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Ensure" appears multiple times as her method: "to ensure that their stories were not lost," "to ensure no voice was lost," "ensured that no echo would ever be silenced." It frames her purpose but does not drive a key turn—she succeeds at ensuring preservation without obstacle. The action is present in the closure framing but could be replaced with "preserve" or "remember" with minor line edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Progressive disclosure" is mentioned once in the middle: "Progressive disclosure was her method: each note peeled back a veil." The mechanics are not shown—no escalating sequence of revelations that shapes her approach. It reads as a label for what she does rather than a method whose constraints matter. Not signaled early, not functional in closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The "serpentine nexus" and "starlight" are named in the opening and recur throughout, anchoring location and tone. The setting amplifies her voice and "responds" to her song, enabling her final broadcast. However, it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; she could perform the same actions in any resonant space. Present in closure ("under the starlit sky," "the canyon sang back") but not causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"While the universe hums its secret song" is named in the title and appears as a recurring phrase, but it does not function as a timeframe that tightens decisions. No clock or deadline pressures her; the "endless" and "indifferent" framing suggests infinite time. The phrase is atmospheric motif rather than temporal constraint, and removing it would not change her pacing or tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"To learn why some people echo" is stated early as her motivation and drives her initial action (singing to test the canyon). However, it is never conflicted—no competing desire or cost tests her commitment, and by mid-story the focus shifts to preservation ("to ensure") without friction. The question is answered via summary ("she realized that those who echo are the ones who leave a scar") rather than through a choice with stakes. Present but not dramatized under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Reed-blown melancholy" is introduced early and recurs five times, establishing a consistent tone that modulates through "deepened" to "gentle reminder" at closure. The tone is coherent through turns and charges the final image ("a reed-blown melancholy that was both lament and lullaby"). However, it remains a static mood rather than one that escalates or transforms with pressure; the same melancholy pervades beginning and end without meaningful shift, limiting its integration score.</comment>
