<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marek's interior is concrete and specific, rooted in grief and the ritual of glassblowing. His motivation to "craft safe zones for inquiry" emerges through embodied action—touching dampness, speaking to dead machinery—and the final realization about making space for asking is earned through on-page micro-choices. Internal contradiction appears in his theatrical declarations to emptiness paired with genuine mourning. Minor deduction: the epiphany "to craft safe zones for inquiry didn't mean providing answers, but simply making space for the asking" edges toward articulated thesis rather than remaining wholly implicit.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly: Marek, abandoned control room, spring thaw, established by the opening lines. The accumulative lens holds: thaw imagery deepens from seasonal detail to emotional metaphor, culminating in the bowl filled with meltwater and the floating bookmark—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the crack becomes "an entrance" and cost registers as acceptance. One meaningful tightening occurs when Marek discovers the new leak and creates "The Reservoir of Unasked Things." The gauge flicker at closure reweights prior stasis with quiet consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The control room functions as both setting and constraint: frozen gauge at forty-two percent, cracked observation windows, bird's-nest wiring, and the leak that drips onto Lena's chair all pressure Marek's ritual and charge the final acts. The portable kiln, glass pipe, and meltwater are handled tools that enable his craft. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "residual hum of stored current," "rhythmic pulses" of seeping water. The east-wall fracture that bleeds onto the chair becomes the literal anchor for the bowl placement, and the gauge's final flicker from forty-two to forty-three charges the exit image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is emotional recovery through ritual craft, signaled early and sustained. One clear tightening: discovering the new leak and touching the dampness parallels his own thaw, compelling him to "abandon his usual restraint" and blow the larger bowl. The act of filling it with meltwater and floating the bookmark is agency as renunciation and acceptance—foreclosing the path of frozen grief. Cost is legible: he leaves the bowl behind, accepts the crack as entrance rather than flaw, and descends with the thaw incomplete but ongoing. No antagonist required; pressure coheres through accumulated sensory and emotional weight.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of grief's thaw emerges through concrete particulars: the cracked bookmark, the frozen gauge, meltwater, "question jars," the realization that "fire was the only thing that understood frost." The final image—bowl, floating bookmark, flickering gauge—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moral summary. Subtext operates in gesture (touching dampness then chest) and silence (Lena's absence voiced through objects). Minor slip: "to craft safe zones for inquiry didn't mean providing answers, but simply making space for the asking" nudges close to thematic statement, though it remains tied to scene action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with tight focalization through Marek's perception. Voice carries distinct texture: "Behold! The silica, purged of its memory, prepares to become transparent witness!" blends theatricality with technical craft vocabulary. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close (touching dampness) to wider reflection (seven winters of suppressed mourning). Diction remains within Marek's lexicon—glassblower, engineer's widow—though "weighty lightness of an answer that wasn't also a question" and "ordinary alchemy" edge toward elevated register at closure. No dialogue present; monologue to machinery reads as character-specific coping mechanism.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; information density is high with most lines doing multiple jobs (e.g., "He'd stopped blowing glass for a year, until he realized that fire was the only thing that understood frost" delivers backstory, metaphor, and turning point in one beat). Clarity is generally strong. Deductions: minor filter-verb stack in reflective passages ("had become," "had been," "had long ago replaced"); the phrase "weighty lightness" and "ordinary alchemy" read as slightly strained oxymorons rather than earned paradox; light scaffold in "He understood that..." which could trust image alone. No major loops or template cadence; propulsion remains consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The glassblower-as-griever synthesis is specific and purposeful; "question jars" as vessels for containable doubt is a fresh inflection. The control room as dual furnace/sanctuary and the cracked bookmark as entrance rather than flaw transform familiar grief material through craft detail. Dramatic narration to dead machinery individualizes coping behavior. Risk is present in the accumulative, quiet closure that trusts image over catharsis. Minor predictability: the thaw-as-grief metaphor is well-executed but not entirely non-obvious; the final gauge flicker, while earned, is a conventional wink of closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marek is present throughout and his choices—unpacking the kiln, placing the bookmark, touching the leak, abandoning restraint to blow the large bowl, filling it with meltwater, leaving it behind—drive all major beats. Setup clear, middle choices constrain (touching dampness triggers the bowl decision), and the final descent with the bowl left in place closes the arc. His contemplative nature shapes perception and pacing. Causal pressure is moderate; the decisions feel inevitable given his grief but lack high-stakes trade-offs that would push higher.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The cracked leather bookmark appears in beat one (unpacking), beat two (placed on control panel against frozen gauge), beat three (realization that "the crack wasn't a flaw—it was an entrance"), and beat four (floated on meltwater in the bowl, darkening and widening). Its specific properties—leather creased like a worked hand, jagged crack—matter throughout. It bridges Lena's past (senior operator manual replaced with Rilke) to present ritual, and the crack's transformation from grief symbol to entrance reweights the closure. Strong lyric reprise with causal involvement; near-indispensable to the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The thawing heart shapes both metaphor and literal action: spring thaw as inciting condition, "slow unclenching of the valley's collective heart," Marek's frozen heart post-Lena, the accelerating thaw reopening leaks, touching dampness and feeling "the parallel thaw," and the final "thawing in increments measured not in degrees but in breaths." It alters tactics (creating the bowl to hold unasked questions) and charges the closure when he traces frost on the railing and it comes away wet. Present across all three gates but functions more as organizing metaphor than on-page constraint with high cost; cost is felt but diffuse.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Thoughtfully spirited" is demonstrated through precise-but-playful dance of heat and breath, theatrical narration to machinery ("Behold! The silica..."), and calling the space "almost sanctified." It colors his movements and voice but does not constrain a key choice with visible cost—he would perform the same ritual whether spirited or solemn. Label is embodied in gesture and tone rather than forcing a trade-off. Present in setup and middle, but closure participation is atmospheric rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Abandon" appears explicitly when Marek "abandoned his usual restraint and blew a piece larger than any before." This act is the major turn: it breaks prior ritual, births "The Reservoir of Unasked Things," and enables the meltwater/bookmark closure image. The verb's precision matters—restraint versus release—and the choice to leave the bowl behind is a second act of abandonment that seals the arc. Swapping "abandon" for "exceed" or "discard" would flatten the emotional charge. Strong causal and closure linkage; could edge higher with more mid-scene constraint tied to the word's recurrence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dramatically narrating mundane tasks is signaled early ("Behold! The silica, purged of its memory, prepares to become transparent witness!") and contextualized as his way of speaking "to the dead dials as he gathered molten glass on his pipe, his voice echoing the way Lena's used to when she called out readings." It characterizes coping and links past to present. The method appears in setup and middle (narrating each gather and turn) and is noted at closure ("he would continue to blow glass, narrating each gather and turn to the listening emptiness"). However, it does not constrain a choice or shift tactics; it colors action without altering outcome. Lyric reprise with thematic weight but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The abandoned control room is indispensable: its frozen gauge (forty-two percent, flickering to forty-three at closure), cracked observation windows, bird's-nest wiring, Lena's old chair, and the new east-wall fracture bleeding droplets all pressure and enable Marek's ritual. The space supplies the meltwater for the bowl, anchors the bookmark placement, and the gauge's final flicker charges the exit. Setting is micro (body, tool, room) and macro (dam, valley thaw); every named feature recurs with function. Strong setup, middle constraint (leak discovery triggers bowl decision), and closure participation (gauge, bowl left in place).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The spring thaw frames the entire piece: "Every spring, when the reservoir began its groaning thaw," "The ice melting outside wasn't just seasonal," "The spring thaw accelerated," and the final frost on the railing that "came away wet." Time is durational rather than ticking-clock, but it shapes urgency (thaw accelerates, leaks reopen) and alters Marek's state across the visit. The timeframe enables the meltwater and charges the closure gesture. Present in all three gates and clearly causal, but cost tied to the passage of time is conceptual rather than immediate; no on-page deadline tightens tactics beyond metaphoric pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marek's motivation "to craft safe zones for inquiry" is signaled early ("his motivation was singular"), dramatized through creating "question jars—delicate orbs with narrow necks, meant to contain the kinds of doubts that cut," tested when he discovers the new leak and creates "The Reservoir of Unasked Things," and resolved when he realizes the purpose is "not providing answers, but simply making space for the asking." The desire is conflicted: he wants to hold grief safely yet must risk exposure (filling the bowl, floating the bookmark). Cost is visible in leaving the bowl behind. Strong causal and closure linkage; slight deduction for the final articulation edging toward told thesis.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Weighty lightness" is present throughout: the oxymoron of grief held lightly, theatrical declarations in a grim space, "thoughtfully spirited" movements, sparrows listening to "declarations of ordinary alchemy," and explicitly at closure: "for the first time since Lena's death, Marek felt the weighty lightness of an answer that wasn't also a question." Tone modulates with pressure (solemn reflection, playful narration, quiet acceptance) and charges the final smile at "simple transience." The phrase itself is slightly forced—constructed paradox rather than emergent—but the tonal balance it names is sustained and coherent across beats.</comment>
