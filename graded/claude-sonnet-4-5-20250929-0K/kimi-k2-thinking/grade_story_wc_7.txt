<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and her ability to "taste memories" provides concrete sensory grounding. However, interiority remains largely declarative rather than contradictory—her resolve strengthens linearly without genuine internal friction or cost-bearing hesitation. The pruning action and final fruit-tasting show embodied choice, but the arc feels more like smooth unfolding than struggle against competing impulses. No meaningful renunciation or foreclosed path emerges on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. The celestial alignment provides a frame, and the sequence—prune, plant, water, sprout, taste—follows clear causal steps under a hybrid lens (causal setup, accumulative texture at closure). However, closure lacks visible cost: Mara tastes the fruit and smiles; no prior option is foreclosed, no tactical price paid. The ending reconfigures nothing with felt consequence, reading as wish-fulfillment rather than earned transformation. Apply −0.6 for cost-proof test failure and cap eligibility accordingly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse is vividly rendered with "metal ribs bleeding orange," and the spatial anchors (broken bench, cracked glass, soil) remain stable. Sensory detail is filtered through Mara's synesthetic perception (taste of memories, scent of chlorophyll). However, the environment does not constrain a choice or meaningfully shape the closure image—it functions as evocative backdrop rather than tactical pressure. The 9+ gate (environment constrains choice or charges final image) is not met; cap at 8.8.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—revive the forbidden garden—is signaled early. The pruning and planting sequence tightens pressure as the alignment peaks, and Mara's actions drive the sprouting. Yet the escalation is frictionless: no reversal, no competing cost, no tactical trade-off. The plant grows "rapidly," the fruit forms, and Mara tastes success without any live alternative foreclosed. One meaningful tightening is present (alignment window), but the cost at closure is abstract rather than legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme of renewal and memory emerges through imagery (rust to bloom, synaptic plasticity metaphor), but the story leans heavily on prompt-language labels: "gentle rebellion," "informal wisdom," "beauty from ruins" are stated rather than discovered. The final paragraph moralizes explicitly: "turning rust into bloom, silence into song" and "the memory would live on, one bite at a time." This thematic echo in closure triggers −0.6 to −0.8. The ending offers no ambiguity or non-literal answer; all threads resolve into tidy affirmation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, and Mara's synesthetic perception ("tasting the air," "flavors strengthened her resolve") provides a distinct perceptual signature. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("ethereal glow," "crucible of renewal") that feels imposed rather than character-rooted. No dialogue is present. Reflection is frequent but anchored to present stimuli (vines, soil, light). Under peak stress (alignment peaks, fruit appears), the prose maintains rhythm without head-hopping, though some lines veer toward lyric declaration rather than immediate thought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Clarity is generally maintained, but several paraphrase loops and synonym cycles appear: "gentle rebellion" recurs four times without added pressure; "informal wisdom" is restated; "beauty from ruins" echoes across paragraphs. Template cadence in the middle section: "She [verb]… She [verb]… She [verb]" across five consecutive sentences. Stock metaphors ("symphony of memories," "tapestry of laughter") cluster in the fruit-tasting beat. Apply −0.6 for paraphrase loops and template cadence, and an additional −0.3 for stock phrases in the closure beat (−0.9 total). Final third artifact disallows 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The core premise—chef with memory-taste revives a forbidden garden using a celestial event—synthesizes multiple speculative elements, but each feels checklist-driven rather than organic. "Synaptic plasticity" as metaphor for pruning is clever but stated rather than dramatized through specific constraint. The ending provides no surprise or reweighting; all elements resolve exactly as setup promises. The transformation test fails: swap Mara for any protagonist with a special ability, and the arc is unchanged. No bold risk or non-obvious synthesis elevates the material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara's chef identity and memory-tasting ability appear in setup and closure (tastes vines, tastes fruit), satisfying two gates. However, her choices—prune, plant, water, wait—do not depend on being a chef; any caretaker could perform them. The ability adds texture but does not constrain tactics or alter a key turn. Present across beats but functionally swappable; score mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The knowledge fruit seed is handled in multiple beats: held in Mara's palm, planted, watered, sprouted, fruited, tasted. It is present in setup, middle (planting), and payoff (fruit consumption). The seed's specific property—holding collective memory—shapes the closure image when Mara tastes it. However, removing this exact seed and substituting any magical/symbolic seed would not break story logic; the mechanics are generic. Causal pressure and closure linkage lift the score, but irreplaceability is limited.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Gentle rebellion" is named explicitly five times and frames Mara's motivation (defying the Order's prohibition). It appears in setup and closure but does not create a tactical choice or on-page cost—Mara never faces enforcement, consequence, or a moment where rebellion's gentleness versus force matters. The concept functions as thematic label rather than stake-shaping constraint. Present and functional but swappable with "quiet defiance" or similar terms.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Informally wise" is stated twice as exposition and linked to Mara's grandmother's teaching. It does not constrain or enable a visible action with cost; no scene tests informal versus formal knowledge. The trait is label-only, never dramatized through a choice where informal wisdom succeeds or fails. Cap at 3.8 for swappability and apply −0.3 for label-only use; final 3.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Pruning drives two key beats: Mara cuts vines (middle) and prunes excess growth after sprouting (closure approach). The action is specific—"each cut a quiet defiance"—and tied to the synaptic metaphor. Removing pruning would require rewriting the core sequence; it is not easily swappable. Early signal, causal pressure (clearing soil, shaping growth), and closure linkage (pruning to strengthen connections) combine for strong integration. Cost is visible (severing vines with memories), pushing into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Synaptic plasticity" is named three times as metaphor for pruning and growth. It is introduced in setup ("rooted in synaptic plasticity") and recurs at closure ("through synaptic plasticity, the garden would rewrite"). However, the mechanics are never demonstrated—how does this method differ from ordinary pruning? No choice depends on understanding or applying synaptic logic. The method is ornamental, a conceptual label without dramatized consequence. Present but not functional; low band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The rusted greenhouse is established in the opening line and remains the spatial anchor throughout. It provides resources (soil, frame for vines) and constraints (cracked glass, rusted metal). The celestial light pours through the cracks, enabling the sprouting. However, the greenhouse does not force a tactical choice—Mara's actions would succeed in any enclosed garden. Present in setup, middle, and closure; supplies atmosphere and resources but does not pressure decision-making. Mid-to-upper band for presence and consistency, but falls short of 7+ for lack of choice-shaping pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The once-in-a-lifetime celestial alignment is signaled early, peaks mid-story ("alignment peaked, a brilliant arc"), and enables the sprouting. It tightens the decision window (Mara must act tonight) and provides the "cosmic key." However, elapsed time is vague—"minutes melted into hours"—and no tactic changes because the clock runs. The alignment gates Mara's action but does not force a mid-story choice or cost. Setup, middle involvement, and payoff presence satisfy the three-gate model; causal gating lifts the score into the 5+ band, but weak tactical pressure limits further climb.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Mara's motivation—"to create something beautiful from the ruins"—is stated early and repeated at closure ("She had created something beautiful from the ruins"). It frames her goal and drives her actions (pruning, planting, tasting). However, the motivation is told rather than tested: no moment forces Mara to choose beauty over safety, speed, or another value. The desire is present and consistent but lacks friction or visible cost. Setup and closure presence without middle conflict caps the score below 6.0.</comment>
