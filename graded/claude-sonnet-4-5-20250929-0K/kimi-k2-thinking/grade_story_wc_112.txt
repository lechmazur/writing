<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and her obliging nature earns access through concrete favors (fixing Chen's shuttle). Internal experience shows through mechanically warm hands and patient observation. However, interiority leans abstract at key moments—"subdued awakening, quiet as the mechanic's own heartbeat" tells rather than shows contradictory impulses. The final choice (pulling the lever) feels inevitable from her conviction but lacks visible cost that forecloses a path; she simply releases it and keeps her secret.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors by ~80 words (Kael, Deck Seven, Persephone station). The piece accumulates pressure through sensory detail and magnetic convergence, then delivers a Conceptual Repricing: Kael sees timelines spreading sideways, proving her theory, though the data will be dismissed. Cost is conceptual (career risk, dismissal as "instrument error") and felt in "her mechanically warm hands now held a secret." One meaningful deepening when she pulls the lever and plunges the station into darkness, reweighting the dominant stake. Closure lands cleanly under the accumulative lens with undeniable pressure in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Station details (frosted copper valves, observation dome, sensor arrays) ground action and reflect Kael's mechanic expertise. Kepler-442b's twilight and the Aurelians' crystalline wings create vivid, purposeful atmosphere. The holographic projector constrains her approach and the magnetic nexus charges the closure image. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: tactile warmth of her hands, visual grids, auditory whispers below thought. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the single scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: proving time moves sideways, signaled early and sustained. Kael's agency manifests in the lever pull that diverts station power, a concrete choice with immediate consequence (plunging habitation into darkness, Chen's alarm). The magnetic nexus blooming and holographic timelines spreading constitute one meaningful tightening that narrows options under the accumulative lens. Cost is legible: career-ending pseudoscience label, data dismissed as error, but she holds the secret. The choice feels earned by her patient three-cycle wait and accumulated favors.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of sideways time emerges through the magnetic nexus, Aurelian wing synchronization, and holographic projections treating time as frozen slices. The final image—timelines settling back into "linear illusion"—offers a resonant answer without stating a moral. However, "time moves sideways, branching like frost rather than flowing like water" is stated early and restated at closure, reducing subtextual emergence. The piece invites reflection on perception versus reality, though Kael's conviction remains uncomplicated by doubt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single POV with stable close-third focalization. Perceptual signature is strong: mechanically warm traces, frost patterns, magnetic whispers, dimensions beyond waking. Diction remains consistently lyric-technical ("spectral grids," "singularity of probability," "violet flower opening in the aether"). Chen's single line of dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, contrasting with Kael's formal reply. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the nexus bloom. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Strong rhythm and varied sentence openings throughout. Information density is high in most beats. However, figurative language clusters heavily in the second half without always clarifying: "violet flower opening in the aether, its petals made of twisted spacetime and forgotten memories" stacks metaphors; "migratory paths crossing through time itself like threads in a cosmic tapestry" adds another vehicle. "Icy warmth" appears three times as a phrase or concept (final mention: "her voice carrying an icy warmth"). Minor paraphrase between "her theory was true" and "Proving that time moves sideways." No major loops or template cadence, but density of ornament in peak beats triggers −0.4 in this category.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Combining a xenobiology station, magnetic creatures, and holographic time theory offers a fresh synthesis. The Aurelians' crystalline wings synchronizing with magnetosphere and "brushing against yesterday and tomorrow" transforms the time-theory trope through specific world logic. Kael's obliging mechanic role and favor-economy access feel particular. However, the core "time is non-linear" premise and scientist-dismisses-maverick frame remain familiar; transformation through Aurelian biology and twilight convergence raises it above template but doesn't fully escape the archetype. Risk-taking in lyric density heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kael's obliging nature earns sensor access through concrete favors (fixing Chen's shuttle, signing requisitions). This trait shapes the setup and enables the central experiment. Her decision to pull the lever at the nexus is the story's key turn. However, "obliging" as a character driver recedes after setup; the lever choice stems more from her conviction than from her obliging trait constraining or complicating that moment. Present in two beats (favor-earning, lever-pull) with some causal role, but the trait itself doesn't impose visible cost at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus appears in setup (theory depends on it), development (Kael monitors the field, watches for convergence), and closure (blooms as "violet flower," timelines spread, then fades). It drives the central experiment beat and charges the final image when it "faded with the last light, taking its secret geometries back." The nexus is causally indispensable: remove it and the story's physics and closure collapse. Specificity is high (violet, twilight-triggered, magnetosphere interaction). Cost connection: career risk and dismissal as instrument error are tied to this exact phenomenon.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Subdued awakenings" is stated explicitly ("the realization came as a subdued awakening, quiet as the mechanic's own heartbeat") and shapes the tonal register of Kael's discovery. It appears in the closure beat, reweighting the moment as introspective rather than triumphant. However, it functions more as theme and tone than as a stake or tactic-altering concept on the page. The piece enacts subdued revelation through its quiet ending, but the concept itself doesn't constrain choices or narrow options in prior beats. Lyric resonance elevates it into mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Mechanically warm" is mentioned three times: fingers leaving warm traces on frosted valves, hands warm from holding the generator core, and final reference to "mechanically warm hands now held a secret." The attribute is present and consistent, but never constrains or enables a specific action with visible cost. It colors description and reinforces Kael's profession, yet remains ornamental. Swappable with "calloused" or "steady" without altering plot. No beat involvement beyond label.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pulling the lever is the story's decisive physical act: "Kael whispered, and pulled the lever that diverted all station power to the sensor cluster, plunging the habitation ring into temporary darkness." This action triggers the magnetic nexus bloom, the holographic timeline display, and Chen's alarm. The lever appears in setup (holographic projector adjustment) and culminates in the central turn. Releasing the lever concludes the experiment. The action is irreplaceable; the story's climax and proof hinge on this exact mechanism. Cost is immediate (power surge, Chen's alarm) and long-term (data dismissed).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Through holographic principles" is signaled early: "holographic projector, aligning it through holographic principles that treated time as a frozen projection waiting to be rotated." The method enables the visualization of timelines and appears in the central beat when spectral grids cast across the dome show "each line a possible timeline." However, the mechanics remain abstract; how holography achieves this effect is asserted rather than demonstrated. The method is present in two beats and necessary for the proof, but its specificity doesn't constrain tactics or shape choices under pressure. Functional but partly swappable with "quantum" or "harmonic."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The xenobiology research station provides the sensor arrays, power grid, observation dome, and proximity to the Aurelians—all essential to the experiment. Persephone's polar orbit and Deck Seven location ground the action. The setting enables Kael's access (through Chen's requisition) and supplies the resources (power diversion, sensor cluster). However, the station functions primarily as a necessary stage rather than actively pressuring choices or altering tactics. Spatial details are vivid but mostly atmospheric. The setting is indispensable for logistics but doesn't constrain Kael's final decision or charge the closure image directly.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Within the hush of beating wings at rest" is signaled as "the twenty-seven minute window Kael had waited three cycles to witness." The timeframe tightens the experiment: she must act during the Aurelians' synchronized sleep when the magnetosphere converges. The clock is live in the central beat ("At her console, Kael monitored... watching for the precise twilight convergence"). The window's closure ("the magnetic nexus faded with the last light") ends the opportunity. The timeframe drives urgency, shapes her wait across three cycles, and makes the lever pull irreversible once the moment arrives. Indispensable to escalation and closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to prove time moves sideways is established early ("Her theory... depended entirely on the magnetic nexus") and drives all choices: earning favors for sensor access, waiting three cycles, pulling the lever. The motivation is dramatized through her actions and sustained through the closure ("Proving that time moves sideways," she replies to Chen). Visible cost: career-ending label, data dismissed as error, but she keeps the secret. However, the motivation remains largely uncontested internally—no conflicting desires or doubts appear. The drive is clear and shapes beats, but lacks friction between want and fear.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Icy warmth" is stated three times: "mechanically warm traces on the frosted copper valves," "her voice carrying an icy warmth that matched the station's frozen halls and her own burning conviction," and implicit in the closing image of warm hands holding a cold secret. The oxymoronic tone is coherent, pairing frozen environment with Kael's internal heat. It modulates subtly (tactile warmth, vocal warmth, metaphoric warmth) and charges the final image. However, the phrase "icy warmth" is stated rather than enacted through contrast alone. The tone is purposeful and present in closure, lifting it into mid-band, but not fully woven into every beat's texture.</comment>
