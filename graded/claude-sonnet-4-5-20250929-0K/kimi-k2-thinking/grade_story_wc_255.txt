<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's colorblindness is established but never constrains a choice; her "innocently cunning" reputation is told, not shown through on-page action. Dorian's interiority is absent—he remains a reactive cipher. The barter happens without negotiation or embodied hesitation, and the transformation at the end is asserted ("felt a stirring") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Drive lens is ambiguous: the piece gestures toward Accumulative (phoenix/awakening motifs) but leans on weak causal linkage ("she hoped to barter," then "offered a trade") without dramatized negotiation or reversal. Orientation is delayed—who Elara is and why she's in this courtyard emerges across ~250 words via exposition rather than action. Closure is a told transformation ("his chest stirred," "her heart hummed") with no visible cost or foreclosed path; the barter completes frictionlessly. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) and lens ambiguity (−0.4) apply, with no meaningful tightening under any lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The courtyard anchors setting with jasmine, ferns, ivy, and furnaces; plants respond to the reed tongue, creating one functional micro-setting moment. However, the phoenix and spire remain ornamental backdrops, and spatial choreography is vague—where Elara stands, how Dorian moves through steam, and the layout of vases are never clear enough to constrain action. The glass droplet charges the final image, lifting the score slightly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elara seeking "a perfect note of sound" to complete her plant-communication system—is told, not tested. No negotiation, refusal, or complication appears; Dorian "hesitated, then nodded" without dramatized internal conflict or cost. The barter resolves in one beat with no reversal or deepening, and the "mutual awakening" is asserted rather than earned through agency or pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Beauty in imperfection" is stated repeatedly ("she could persuade a storm," "beautiful precisely because they were flawed," "imperfection was true art") rather than emerging from concrete choices. The phoenix frame and "bartered awakenings" remain ornamental motifs that do not reweight prior material. The final paragraph moralizes directly ("a tale of finding beauty in the imperfect"), triggering the thematic-echo penalty (−0.6).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The narrator's perceptual signature is generic (morning light, molten glass swirls, silver stones) without character-specific filtering. Register drifts into lyric/abstract ("a tapestry of grey and silver," "a language of flawed grace") that does not match Elara's trade-focused goal. No dialogue appears to test voice distinction. Psychic distance is unstable—Elara's interior is summarized while Dorian's is asserted ("felt a stirring") without access.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops: lines 6–7 repeat Elara's cunning reputation and barter goal; lines 25–27 restate the "awakening" idea across three sentences. Template cadence runs of "She [verb]" and "Dorian [verb]" appear in the final third. Stock metaphors ("frozen breath of memory," "veil of steam") and filter-verb stacks ("watched," "seeing," "feeling") dull immediacy in peak beats. Patterned-artifact penalty (−1.2) and late-third template presence disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The phoenix-rebirth frame, colorblind-painter protagonist, and glassblower trade echo widely used templates without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The barter resolves predictably (artist gains inspiration, craftsman embraces imperfection) with no friction or surprising turn. Derivative premise penalty (−0.8) applies.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but makes no key turn; she proposes the barter, receives the droplet, arranges plants, and paints—all without conflict or cost that alters tactics. Her colorblindness is mentioned but never constrains a choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The reed tongue appears in three beats: found at market (paragraph 8), hummed in the courtyard to make plants tremble (paragraph 12), and pocketed after the trade (paragraph 20). It enables one mid-action (plant response) and is mentioned at closure ("her heart hummed with the reed tongue's echo") but does not causally shape the final image or foreclosed path. Swappable with any resonant object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Bartered awakenings" is stated in the opening, repeated as dialogue premise ("offering to awaken"), and echoed in the final two paragraphs ("a sanctuary of bartered awakenings"), but it does not constrain tactics or create on-page friction—Dorian agrees without negotiation. The concept functions as theme label rather than stake-shaping pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Innocently cunning" is told in paragraph 6 ("her reputation innocently cunning preceded her; she could persuade a storm") but never shown through on-page action or visible tradeoff. No choice demonstrates the attribute's cost or friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Awaken" appears as the barter's core verb and is repeated across paragraphs 7, 16, 18, 25, and 30. It drives the premise (Elara offers to awaken Dorian's glass; he agrees) and frames the closure ("her awakening had come"), but the action itself is summary—no dramatized moment shows how the glass or Elara's world changes on the page with cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Plant communication is signaled in paragraph 11, demonstrated once when the reed tongue makes jasmine, ferns, and ivy respond (paragraphs 12–13), and completed in paragraph 20 ("forming a living score"). It shapes one middle beat but does not constrain the barter negotiation or charge the final image; the method is more ornament than engine.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The courtyard is present from paragraph 2 onward; plants and furnaces anchor the space, and the glass droplet's rainbow on stones provides the final image (paragraph 22). However, spatial choreography is vague—no layout constrains movement or choice. The setting enables the plant-communication beat and the glass-exchange but does not pressure the barter itself.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>"After the phoenix rose" is stated in the opening and closing but does not tighten decisions or create urgency. No clock or deadline is tracked; the barter unfolds at leisure. The timeframe is ornamental framing rather than tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"To find beauty in imperfection" is told in paragraph 4, repeated in paragraphs 16 and 27, and asserted at closure. It is never dramatized through a choice where pursuing perfection would cost something or where embracing flaw forecloses another path. The motivation remains thematic label without friction.</comment>
