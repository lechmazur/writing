<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's claustrophobia is mentioned but never pressures a choice with visible cost; she trembles but the compass "anchored her resolve" dissolves the tension without struggle. Internal conflict is asserted ("wistful rebellion," "prudently adventurous") rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final key retrieval feels frictionless—no moment where fear nearly wins, no trade-off between courage and caution that forecloses a path. Motivation remains abstract: "prismatic desire" and "wistful rebellion" are labels without embodied stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who Elara is and her specific spatial position remain vague through the opening paragraphs, triggering a −0.4 penalty and capping Q3 at 7.0. The compass-point mechanism that "coax[es] hidden doors" and "pierced the stone" is asserted without prior setup or cost; the door opens on first attempt with no failure or adaptation. Closure lands (she retrieves the key, envisions new blueprints) but the cost is conceptual only—no visible forfeiture, injury, or relationship price on the page. The causal lens wobbles: early beats suggest problem-solving (Causal), but the organ's "sonic tempest" revealing the door reads as coincidental aid (Situational), and the ending's thematic musing shifts toward Accumulative without a taught pattern.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The church, catacombs, and starlit chamber are visually rendered with purposeful detail ("constellations painted the ceiling," "mosaic of fractured geometry"), and the compass point recurs as a tactile anchor. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though "walls began to close in" is metaphorical rather than a material constraint that alters her path. The nexus setting contributes atmosphere but does not force a tactical choice—she descends, aligns the compass, the door opens. The micro-setting test is partially met: the compass point charges the final act, lifting the score above mid-band despite the lack of environmental friction on her choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering the key to the Architect's chamber—is clear, but pressure never tightens: the organ guides her, the compass works on first use, the key waits unguarded. "Claustrophobic grip of panic" is told, then immediately resolved by the compass anchor with no cost. No reversal, no failed attempt, no trade-off between speed and caution. The ending opens a thematic vista (reimagining city spaces) but does not narrow options or levy a felt price—she steps out with key and compass "ready for the next fallow season," undiminished. One brief intensification (walls closing) is noted but not sustained or paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme of rebellion against "rigid geometry of forgotten eras" and reimagining static spaces emerges clearly from the blueprint imagery and the final library scene. The organ-as-map metaphor and the compass/key pairing support the concept without overt thesis statements. However, the ending drifts into summary moralizing: "a quiet mutiny against the rigid geometry" and "the bravest explorers know when to listen" feel like authorial voice rather than scene-embedded resonance. The thematic question is posed but answered through assertion rather than a final image that reweights prior material with cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping, and diction stays elevated throughout. However, the narrative voice lacks a distinct perceptual signature—Elara's noticing does not feel character-specific, and the prose converges on a uniform lyric register ("prismatic desire," "wistful rebellion," "sonic tempest") that reads more authorial than character-filtered. Psychic distance remains fixed; no modulation under stress. The elevated diction ("malevolent will," "spatial mutiny") clashes with practical explorer interiority. No dialogue to assess. Stable execution but lacks the voice particularity required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Pervasive overwriting and template patterns: "prismatic desire," "phantom threshold," "sonic tempest," "wistful rebellion," "prudently adventurous," "spatial mutiny" stack figurative or abstract labels without concrete anchoring. Paraphrase loops abound: "compass point" is named 11 times, often in adjacent sentences with synonym churn ("copper-tipped drafting compass point," "blueprint drafting compass point"). Runs of "The [noun]" sentence openers create rhythmic monotony. Mixed metaphors: walls "breathing with malevolent will" (anthropomorphic) then "spatial mutiny" (abstract military metaphor) in one beat. The closure paragraph summarizes rather than dramatizes: "her wistful rebellion had not only unearthed a lost key but had also struck a chord of change." Baseline −1.0 for loops and register drift; −0.7 additional for figurative density obscuring action in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—explorer using geometry to unlock hidden chambers—is functional but draws heavily on adventure-quest templates (lone seeker, ancient artifact, guiding music, starlit treasure room). The compass-point mechanism and organ-as-map offer modest specificity, but the execution feels assembled from familiar beats without transformation. "Wistful rebellion" and "spatial mutiny" are evocative phrases but remain abstract; the story does not ground them in a non-obvious moral calculus or lived detail that would elevate beyond the template. The ending's "library of blueprints" and "reimagining spaces" gesture toward conceptual depth but are told rather than shown through a decisive, irreversible choice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her claustrophobia is mentioned, but her choices do not create key turns—she descends, aligns the compass, retrieves the key without failure or adaptation. The trait shapes framing (she trembles, the compass "anchored her resolve") but does not constrain an on-page decision with visible cost. Present in closure (she "stepped into the open air," envisions new blueprints) but not causally decisive there. Functional but replaceable: another explorer type would alter tone but not structure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The compass point appears in multiple beats: tracing parchment (opening), piercing the door (climax), and "still clutched in her hand" / used to trace a new blueprint (closure). Early signal, causal pressure at the door-opening beat, and closure linkage are all present. Specificity: "copper-tipped," "great-grandfather's drafting table," geometric function. However, it works on first attempt with no cost—no broken tip, no mis-alignment requiring adjustment—and could be replaced with another precision tool (key, stylus) with minor edits. Two gates plus closure participation place it in mid-band; lack of evolving use or visible price caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Spatial mutiny" appears as a phrase three times but functions as thematic label rather than shaping stakes or tactics on the page. Elara does not rebel against spatial constraints in action—the walls close but she proceeds; the door is "hidden" but opens on command. The concept is told ("a symbol of spatial mutiny," "wistful rebellion against...geometry") rather than dramatized through a choice where she defies or transforms spatial rules with cost. Ornamental: removing the phrase would not alter plot or closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Prudently adventurous" is asserted twice as a label but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. Elara "trust[s] the ancient harmony, yet cautious enough to keep one hand on the compass"—but both trust and caution succeed without trade-off. No moment where prudence costs her speed, or boldness risks injury. The trait is told rather than tested. Present setup, no middle development or closure participation with cost. Label-only deduction −0.3 applies.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Transfix" appears once at the climax: "only the precise geometry of the compass point could transfix" the phantom threshold, then "the point pierced the stone" and the door opens. This beat is the major turn (access granted), so causal linkage is strong. However, it is introduced late (past midpoint), works on first attempt, and could be replaced with "unlock," "activate," or "open" with minor edits. No failure requiring a second attempt, no visible cost (the point is unharmed, Elara uninjured). Late signal −0.3, swappability −0.5, one-beat use limits upside.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The organ is signaled early ("thrummed with the reverberation," "notes spiraling down") and described as guiding: "the music seemed to map the darkness, each chord a corridor." At the climax, "the organ's crescendo peaked...and in that sonic tempest, she saw...a door." Mechanics matter: the organ's lowest note echoes the compass point's metallic whisper, then "fell silent, its purpose fulfilled." Present in closure reflection ("the organ's final note faded," "taught her that sound could be a map"). Three beats, early signal, closure linkage. However, the organ acts as coincidental aid—Elara does not play it or respond with a tactical choice; it simply reveals the door. Situational pressure rather than protagonist-driven. Setup + middle + closure but swappable with another guide (light, wind) caps it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The "shadowed nexus" is named and described: catacombs under the church, then the final chamber "bathed in starlight...constellations painted the ceiling." Early signal, vivid visual detail, present in closure (she exits, the nexus "lay still" beneath). The starlight imagery charges the final chamber scene. However, the setting does not constrain choice—the passage narrows but she proceeds without detour; the door is hidden but opens on command. Micro-setting (body/compass) does more causal work than the nexus itself. Two gates plus closure image participation, but lacks tactical pressure. Lyric reprise lifts it above ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Fallow period" is named in the opening and closing sentences, and "first light of dawn" marks the end. However, time does not tighten decisions—Elara's descent, search, and return unfold without clock pressure or a deadline that alters tactics. The timeframe provides atmospheric context (barren season, symbolic rest) but is not tracked or made urgent on the page. Setup present, no middle or closure participation with cost. Atmospheric only.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The desire "to uncover a vital key lost to time" is stated early and drives the action: Elara maps catacombs, descends, retrieves the key, and opens the Architect's chamber. Present in multiple beats and closure. However, the motivation is told ("driven by a single, prismatic desire") rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or costs—no moment where exhaustion, fear, or a competing need threatens her pursuit. The key is found without rival claim or sacrifice. Strong causal presence but lacks friction between want and price on the page, capping it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Wistful rebellion" is named three times and echoed in imagery (organ as guide, defying forgotten geometry). Tone is consistent—melancholy determination—and modulates slightly (trembling to triumph to quiet reflection). However, the tone is asserted more than embodied: "wistful rebellion" appears as a label in narration rather than emerging from contradictory emotional beats. The final image ("quiet mutiny") reiterates the tone but does not charge it with new pressure. Coherent and present in closure, but static rather than dynamically modulated under stress. Functional but mid-band.</comment>
