<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's scars and firefighter expertise are established, but her interior life operates at a single pitch of poetic regret throughout. The core motivation—carrying guilt for thirteen years—remains static; micro-choices in the present (stone arrangement, releasing ash) feel ritualistic rather than testing contradictory impulses. The captain's death is recounted rather than dramatized, weakening emotional embodiment. Flaws exist but never complicate a live on-page decision.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: moonlit walk → stone circle → ash release → dawn writing attempts pattern-building toward thematic weight. Orientation anchors arrive (moonlit ridge, thirteen years post-fire) but the spatial journey lacks clear transitions between ridge arrival, kneeling, departure, and station return. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: teaching becomes the vessel for carried pain), but cost remains abstract—"weight shift from hands to shoulders" tells rather than showing a foreclosed path. No meaningful tightening of options occurs on the page; the walk enacts a pre-decided ritual.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Moonlit ridge, porcelain box fractures catching light, and fire-scarred hands anchor the scene with vivid sensory detail. The box's willow patterns and cracked glaze recur purposefully, and scars function as micro-setting (tissue thin as rice paper, each a letter). However, spatial choreography between ridge, stone circle, and station blurs; the environment observes rather than constrains. Celestial bodies (Jupiter, Saturn) are noted but do not pressure choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translating carried pain into teaching—is signaled early but never tested. The piece recounts a past choice (station vs. eastern flank) with high drama, yet the present action is a solitary, pre-decided ritual: walk, arrange stones, release ash, return. No on-page reversal narrows options; coincidence does not complicate. The ending (writing training manuals) is a resolution the text has already committed to, with no visible trade-off or cost that forecloses an alternative path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—survival as betrayal, memory as witness—emerges organically through the porcelain box, scar language, and stone circle without didactic statement. The final lines ("translate her pain into something larger") approach thematic summary but remain grounded in action (writing manuals). Subtext operates in the box's emptiness holding ash, fractures scattering light. The ending reweights prior material (innocence bargained becomes teaching tool), though the move is contemplative rather than earned through present friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV holds consistently; distance and tense remain stable. Perceptual signature appears (fire language, burn pattern reading) but diction drifts into elevated literary register throughout ("exchanged innocence," "choreography," "embodiment"). Under peak emotional beats, syntax remains uniform and ornate rather than degrading with stress. No dialogue present to judge. Voice reads as authorial rather than character-particular, with recursive poetic phrasing ("hard softness," "simple act of remembering") that flattens urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and unrelenting: "silver light pooled," "velvet sky," "ancient choreography," "tissue thin as rice paper," "polished smooth as river stones," "pack frame for the long carry of memory"—most sentences carry metaphor without pattern-teaching or earned payoff. Paraphrase loops cluster: "reflected deeply" / "reflecting deeply"; "translate pain" / "translate what they might carry" / "translated her pain"; "bargained innocence" / "bargain" repeated. Template cadence runs appear ("She'd chosen," "She'd spent," "She spoke," "She left," "She felt"). Artifacts touch closure beats ("illuminate," "enlighten," "enlightenments"). High-priority loop check fails; information density suffers under ornamental weight. Apply −0.6 baseline for template cadence, −0.4 for paraphrase loops, −0.5 for figurative saturation in peak beats; total deduction ~−1.5, with artifacts in final third disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Premise—firefighter returns to site of fatal choice to perform memory ritual—follows a recognizable template (guilt pilgrimage, symbolic object release). Celestial timeframe and porcelain box add texture but do not transform the arc. Emotional beats (scars as language, teaching rookies to avoid her mistake) are earnest but offer median, safety-hedged choices. The transformation test suggests the arc would work unchanged with different names and setting. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the piece opts for poetic elaboration over narrative surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Scarred firefighter appears early, drives the walk and stone arrangement, and shapes the ending (teaching recruits). Scars and fire-reading skill seed expectation. However, her expertise does not constrain a present choice; the climax is recounted (thirteen-year-old radio call), not enacted. Present beats (kneeling, releasing ash, writing manuals) flow from a pre-decided plan. Two gates clear (setup, payoff); middle development is thin. Causal pressure is retrospective. Cost is abstract (weight shift metaphor). Lyric seed-to-reprise lifts slightly but lacks on-page friction.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Porcelain box appears early (first sentence), is handled mid-scene (opening lid, ash release), and remains on ridge at closure. Blue willow patterns and heat fractures recur; moonlight catching cracks charges the final third. Three gates met. However, the box does not narrow options or create tactical friction—it witnesses rather than pressures. Cost connection is metaphorical (vessel for what cannot be contained) rather than causal. Specificity (captain's wife's heirloom, single charred button) adds irreplaceability. Strong lyric reprise but lacks decisive stakes leverage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Bargained innocence is named early ("bargained her innocence for survival by choosing") and recurs as thematic label ("exchanged innocence"). The past choice (station vs. flank) is recounted with high stakes, but that event is backstory. On the page, no present decision retraces or tests a bargain; the ritual accepts rather than challenges prior cost. Element functions as theme marker rather than pressure source. Missing middle development and closure participation in causal terms. Ornamental at present-tense level.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Gently skilled appears twice: "Elara was gently skilled at reading fire's language" and "Elara's gently skilled hands would teach them." The trait is asserted, not dramatized—fire-reading fails in backstory, and present-tense teaching is planned, not enacted. No on-page action demonstrates the skill under constraint or reveals a tradeoff (gentleness vs. decisiveness). Label-only; no visible cost or tactical consequence. Missing middle development. Introduced by ~15%, so late penalty does not apply, but causal work is absent.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Enlighten appears as verb ("tried to enlighten rookies") and noun ("Enlightenment didn't come from answers"). The action is planned for tomorrow (teaching recruits) rather than enacted. The ridge visit might enlighten Elara herself, but the shift is contemplative summary ("realized her motivation") rather than a dramatized turn. Setup present; closure nods toward it (writing manuals to show fire's language). Middle beat is weak—enlightenment is discussed, not demonstrated. Easily swappable with "teach" or "guide." Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Reflecting deeply appears as phrase ("reflected deeply on how survival could feel like betrayal," "reflecting deeply wasn't about resolution"). Method is named but not shown—narrative summary asserts reflection rather than enacting its mechanics through sensory anchor, memory fragment, or tactical choice. The entire piece is reflective in mode, yet the phrase itself is cosmetic. Swappable with "contemplating" or omittable. Missing middle development where reflection alters a present option. Label-only use; no cost tied to this specific method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Moonlit ridge path appears early, frames the entire walk, and is the site of stone circle and box placement. Path detail is vivid (silver light pooled between granite spires). The ridge does not constrain movement or create tactical friction—Elara walks freely, kneels, departs. Micro-setting (box, scars, stones) does more causal work than the path itself. Setup and payoff clear; middle development thin. Cost connection is metaphorical (ridge as witness) rather than physical. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Celestial bodies appear early ("planets performed their slow dance," "Jupiter and Saturn watching") and recur ("celestial bodies continued their patient waltz," "slow dance of celestial bodies taught her patience"). Timeframe is poetic but does not tighten decisions—no clock pressures choice. Dawn arrives at the end, marking passage but not imposing cost. The phrase is ornamental; removing "during the slow dance" would not alter story logic. Setup present; missing middle and closure participation. Swappable with "at night" or "over hours."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Motivation to translate pain into universal language appears mid-scene ("realized her motivation") and shapes the ending (teaching recruits, writing manuals so "others" might learn). Desire is asserted rather than tested—no friction between translating and another want. Setup slightly late (~40%); payoff strong (manuals as translation vessel). Middle development thin—motivation is discovered, not conflicted. Cost is implied (carrying weight forward) but not visceral. Functional role in closure but lacks on-page trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Hard softness appears once explicitly ("hard softness of someone who'd walked through flame") and is gestured throughout (scarred hands cradling fragile box, fire-twisted fingers with grace, hardness of truth and softness of grace). Tone is coherent and modulates slightly (past regret → present ritual → future resolve). However, register remains elevated and ornate throughout; no tonal compression under stress. The final image (cracked but luminous, empty but full) echoes the tone but does not decisively charge it. Setup clear; closure participation present but static. One-note lyricism trends mid-band.</comment>
