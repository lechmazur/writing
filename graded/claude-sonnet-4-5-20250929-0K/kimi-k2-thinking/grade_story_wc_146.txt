<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and consistent—restore balance through patient observation—but his characterization remains largely static across three centuries. The seven residents have distinct gaits memorized, yet they never appear as individuals making choices; they're drawn to the archway "without knowing why," which removes agency from the collective cast. The final moment shows Kael walking on with his "cryptic smile," but no internal contradiction or visible cost alters his stance. His infinite patience is asserted repeatedly but never tested by a moment where impatience would cost him or where waiting exacts a visible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds density through the archway's frequency, the tuning fork's absorbed memory, and the footsteps' rhythmic pattern, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) when the cobblestones shift and buildings remember. The cost is conceptual—the town's survival depends on another century or two of faithful steps—and the final image ("the ghost town breathed") reweights the opening hum of death into possibility. Orientation is clean by the first paragraph. The accumulation is legible, though the middle section recycles the setup (walking, listening, memorizing gaits) without a meaningful pressure increase until the strike of the tuning fork near the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ancient archway functions as both spatial anchor and constraint: its geometry amplifies sound, and Kael must stand beneath it to strike the fork and reset the town's frequency. The ebony tuning fork is handled twice (carved from the belltower, then struck against his palm) and its subsonic wave drives the ending. The cobblestones are tactile and specific—they remember original arrangements and shift millimeter by millimeter in response to footfalls. The "wild hush" recurs and charges the final image when death-hum transforms into the hush of possibility, giving the setting a felt presence that shapes the closure moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restore balance before collapse—is signaled early and held throughout. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as a tightening when Kael strikes the tuning fork, the seven residents are drawn to the archway, and his counterpoint walk begins to rebuild the town step by step. The cost is legible: another century or two of patient walking, an explicit deferral that narrows Kael's options to endurance. However, no live option is foreclosed on the page; Kael's infinite patience never faces a moment where impatience would solve faster or where waiting costs him something immediate. The rebuilding is invisible to the eye, described rather than dramatized in a choice that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the tuning fork's absorbed memory, the cobblestones' capacity to remember, and the residents' unconscious rhythms—pattern and persistence can resurrect what entropy devours. The central question (can sound restore architecture, can patience outlast collapse) receives a non-literal answer in the final image: the ghost town breathes, not yet saved but no longer dying. The ebony fork and archway recur with reweighted meaning, and "wild hush" shifts from death to possibility. The piece resists moralizing, though phrases like "shared balance" and "faithful steps" edge toward abstraction. The theme coheres with the accumulative design, but the middle section's repetition (he listens, he memorizes, he walks behind them) dilutes forward momentum slightly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Kael; no head-hopping. Voice is distinct in its lyric register—"wild hush," "cobblestones remembered," "ghost town breathed"—and the elevated diction fits the three-century timeframe and mythic stakes. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, zooming from close interiority ("feeling the wild hush") to wider narration of the town's response. However, several beats recycle identical syntactic stems: "Kael had been listening," "Kael had memorized," "Kael stood beneath it now," "Kael began to walk," "Kael walked on." The repetition of "infinitely patient" (three times) and "wild hush" (three times without sufficient reweighting between first and second use) creates a template cadence that flattens momentum in the middle third.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies across the piece, and the opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Several strong images land: "moss grew in its cracks like old blood," "cobblestones remembered," "subsonic wave that traveled through the archway's stones." However, paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines—"The method was specific" followed by "The method worked like this" a few paragraphs later; "infinitely patient" repeated three times without variation; "he'd waited, infinitely patient, adjusting his own step" mirrors "For three centuries, he'd waited, infinitely patient." The middle section stacks filter-adjacent constructions ("he'd carved," "he'd waited," "he'd memorized") and template-cadence openings ("Kael stood," "Kael began," "Kael walked"). The figurative language is vivid but occasionally strained—"moss grew in its cracks like old blood" works, but "the wild hush of a forest before storm, of a held breath before song, of seven hearts beating out of time" stacks metaphors without unity. No artifacts touch the closure beat directly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—a bell tuner restores a town via footstep rhythms and an ebony tuning fork—offers a fresh angle on ghost-town revival, synthesizing sound-as-architecture with patient observation. The archway's geometry, the fork carved from heartwood that absorbed three centuries of chimes, and the cobblestones' memory of original arrangement are specific and non-obvious. However, the emotional arc and stakes do not transform under alternate names and places; the patient craftsman restoring a failing structure through specialized knowledge is a familiar template. The middle third recycles exposition (he listens, he memorizes, he walks) without fresh inflection until the tuning fork is struck. The ending's image—"the ghost town breathed"—is resonant but not entirely surprising given the setup. Risk-taking is moderate: the lyric register and accumulative design heighten stakes without obscuring clarity, meriting a small within-band lift.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael is present throughout, signaled early as "the last bell tuner." He makes two key on-page decisions: striking the tuning fork and beginning the counterpoint walk. These actions drive the ending and narrow options (he commits to another century or two of walking). However, much of his involvement is observational—listening, memorizing gaits, walking behind residents—without on-page choices that alter tactics under pressure. His "cryptic" nature is asserted but not dramatized through a conflicted decision. Development is present (middle beats show his preparation), and closure linkage is strong (his walk activates the rebuilding), meeting two of three gates and supporting mid-band placement. The causal pressure is moderate; the element is functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ebony tuning fork is signaled early ("In his coat pocket rested the ebony tuning fork") and its backstory is specific: carved from the last black belltower's heartwood, which absorbed three centuries of chimes. It appears in two distinct beats: Kael holds it in his pocket (setup) and strikes it against his palm to emit the subsonic wave (climax/closure). The fork's unique property—carrying memory in its grain—enables the town's restoration and directly shapes the ending. It meets all three gates (setup, development via its carried memory, payoff in the strike) and demonstrates irreplaceability: no generic tuning fork could carry the absorbed chimes. However, it is handled in only two beats rather than three or more, and its cost is implied (another century of use) rather than made explicit on the page. Causal pressure is strong, closure linkage undeniable, specificity high, meriting a score in the 7–8 range.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Ghost town revival is the central concept, framing the stakes from the opening ("Thornhaven had not yet collapsed, though it stood on the precipice"). The concept shapes Kael's motivation and the mechanics of the ending: the cobblestones shift, buildings straighten, the town begins to rebuild step by step. It appears in setup (the town's precarious state), development (Kael's preparation and the residents' gaits as architecture), and closure (the invisible rebuilding and the final breath). However, the revival is described rather than dramatized in choices that alter tactics; Kael does not face a live decision where one path leads to collapse and another to survival. The concept is thematically resonant but functionally passive—it happens to the town, not through contested agency. All three gates are met, but the concept does not create a visible tradeoff or cost that alters present options, capping it in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Infinitely patient" is stated three times and defines Kael's approach, but it is never tested by an on-page moment where impatience would offer a faster solution with risk or where patience exacts a visible cost. The attribute enables his three-century wait and the final commitment to another century or two, but these are told rather than dramatized in a choice under pressure. It appears early (setup) and at closure (the final paragraph's "infinitely patient" and the commitment to continue), meeting two gates. However, the attribute is label-only; no scene shows Kael tempted to rush or suffering from prolonged waiting. The cost is conceptual (more time) but not felt in a micro-choice. Swappable with "steadfast" or "unwavering" with minor edits. Mid-low band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Rebuild" is the story's climactic action, signaled early in Kael's motivation ("to restore shared balance") and executed in the final third when his counterpoint walk causes the cobblestones to shift and buildings to straighten. The action shapes the ending directly and is causally tied to the tuning fork strike and the residents' emergence. However, the rebuilding is described as "invisible to the eye but deafening to the ear that knew how to listen," summarized rather than dramatized in contested choices. The action appears in setup (the stated goal), development (the method preparation), and closure (the on-page start of rebuilding), meeting all three gates. Causal pressure is moderate—Kael enacts it rather than choosing it under conflicting options—and the cost (another century) is told. Strong closure linkage and irreplaceability lift it into the mid-6s, but summary treatment and lack of visible tradeoff in the moment prevent higher placement.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The method is signaled explicitly in the first third: "via the rhythm of footsteps on cobblestones, he would rebuild what was lost." Its mechanics are detailed—Kael memorizes the seven residents' unique gaits, walks behind them to learn their rhythms, then strikes the tuning fork and walks a counterpoint that the archway amplifies. The method shapes the middle beats (his preparation and listening) and drives the ending (the counterpoint walk that shifts the cobblestones). It meets all three gates and demonstrates specificity: the footsteps' frequency, the archway's geometry, and the tuning fork's subsonic wave are unique to this method. However, the method is described and explained rather than tested in a choice where an alternate approach is rejected with cost. The long exposition ("The method was specific... The method worked like this...") tells rather than shows the mechanics under pressure. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage, but summary treatment and lack of on-page constraint prevent entry into the 7+ range.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ancient archway is signaled in the opening line and functions as the story's spatial and causal anchor. Its specific properties—stones that hum with a frequency only the dying can hear, geometry designed by forgotten masons, aperture that amplifies sound—constrain and enable Kael's method. The archway appears in three distinct beats: opening description, Kael standing beneath it to strike the fork, and the final image where its stones no longer hum with death but with possibility. It is irreplaceable; no other location could serve its function. The archway meets all three gates, shapes two key beats (the tuning fork strike and the residents' convergence), and charges the closure image by shifting from death-hum to wild hush of possibility. Causal pressure is strong, closure linkage undeniable, and the cost (the town's survival depends on this exact structure) is legible. High 7-band placement is merited.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Before the collapse" is the stated timeframe, signaled early: "Thornhaven had not yet collapsed, though it stood on the precipice." The temporal pressure is conceptual—the town could fall at any moment—but the timeframe does not tighten decisions in scene. Kael has three centuries of history and commits to another century or two of walking; no on-page clock narrows his window or forces a faster choice. The timeframe shapes setup (the precarious present) and closure (the town "had not collapsed yet, and now—perhaps—it never would"), meeting two gates. However, it is vague and untracked within the scene; we do not know how many days, weeks, or months Kael has before the next building falls. The element is thematic rather than tactical, present but not pressuring choices with a live deadline. Mid-5s fit for functional but replaceable temporal framing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Kael's motivation—"to restore shared balance between what stood and what had fallen, between the silence that devoured and the sound that could resurrect"—is stated explicitly early and drives his three-century vigil and final action. The desire is consistent and credible, and it shapes the ending when he strikes the fork and begins the counterpoint walk. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized in a moment of internal friction; Kael never faces a choice where restoring balance conflicts with another want or where the cost of balance (another century of solitude, deferred rest) tempts him to abandon the task. The motivation meets setup and closure gates, and it is specific to Kael's role as bell tuner. However, it is label-level and not tested under pressure, and the cost is conceptual rather than felt in a micro-choice. Lyric resonance (the opening silence/sound framing returns in the final "wild hush" shift) lifts it slightly, but lack of on-page conflict caps it in the low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Wild hush" is seeded early—"the wild hush that lived there—the hush of a forest before storm, of a held breath before song, of seven hearts beating out of time"—and recurs in the final paragraph: "The ancient archway stood witness, its stones no longer humming with death but with the wild hush of possibility." The tone is coherent and lyric throughout, modulating from the archway's death-hum to the held-breath anticipation to the final charged quiet. It charges the closure image by reweighting the opening's dying frequency into resurrection. The tone shapes perception in multiple beats (the opening, Kael's vigil, the tuning fork strike, the ending) and is irreplaceable; no other tonal choice could carry the story's stillness-under-pressure. However, the middle third's repetition (he listens, he waits, he memorizes) flattens the tonal progression slightly before the fork strike re-intensifies it. Strong closure linkage, specificity, and reweighting merit mid-to-high 7-band placement.</comment>
