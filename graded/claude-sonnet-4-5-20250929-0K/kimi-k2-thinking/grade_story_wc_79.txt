<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and consistent—mapping what others fear, driven by her mother's loss. Internal experience shows through her quiet determination and pattern-language mastery. The final choice to carve a question mark and continue mapping feels earned by prior causality, though the embodied cost could be sharper. "Quietly driven" operates mostly as a label rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in high-pressure moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land cleanly in the opening. The closure is a Charged Poise/Conceptual Repricing hybrid—Kael discovers the watchers are historians cataloging failed curiosity, inherits her mother's cracked-whistle key, and chooses to speak their language anyway by carving a question mark they will see. Cost is conceptual and relational (her mother was catalogued; the gate rusts from understanding) and felt in the sunwashed dread she now owns. One watcher raises a hand, reweighting prior material. Escalation proceeds through pattern-discovery and the harmonic whistle blow that shifts the turtle and turns the watchers' heads, narrowing ignorance into knowledge with a price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The turtle-shell city is established early and anchors spatial choreography throughout. Old Merra's shell becomes the site of discovery (crevice with whistle) and the canvas for Kael's carved question mark, directly shaping the closure image. The rusted gate, the watchers on the horizon, and the breathing rhythm of the turtles all constrain and enable Kael's choices. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through Kael's cartographer lens (calcium swirls, spiral geometries, salt taste). The highest point and the seventh turtle frame the climactic whistle blow.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: understanding the watchers and her mother's fate, signaled early and sustained. The cracked whistle discovery, weeks of study, crafting the shell whistle, and the dawn ascent provide escalation under the accumulative lens. The watchers' turning and the voice entering Kael's mind deliver a meaningful tightening that narrows options—her mother reached them but was catalogued. Kael's agency in the final beat (carving the question mark, choosing to speak their language) forecloses the path of ignorant safety with felt cost. The price is visible: she inherits sunwashed dread and cannot return unchanged.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—curiosity as catalogued death versus question-as-defiance—emerges from the cracked whistle, pattern-language study, and the watchers' revelation without overt statement. The mother's "key disguised as failure" and Kael's shift from seeking answers to asking questions reweight the premise. The carved question mark and the watcher's raised hand offer a resonant, non-literal answer: questions can be asked even when answers destroy. Sunwashed dread becomes hers to shape, a quiet stance that honors complexity. Minor slip: "chose to speak it anyway" risks thematic echo, though it stays within character idiom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filtered through Kael's cartographer perception (calcium geometries, spiral patterns, shell-mapper's tools). Voice is consistent and purposeful, with a measured, almost incantatory rhythm that matches the mythopoetic setting. Perceptual signature is clear: she reads histories in swirls, sees maps in cracks. Distance control is clean. Minor template cadence in mid-section beats ("She began to see it: the growth patterns…"; "Following its fracture lines…") slightly dulls immediacy but does not obscure causality. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Clarity holds throughout. Template-cadence runs appear in the middle third: "She began to see it…"; "The crack in the whistle wasn't damage—it was a map"; "Following its fracture lines…"; "If she could replicate it…"; several adjacent blocks open with "The" or "She" in mechanical alternation. Paraphrase loop: "quietly driven by the need to map" (paragraph 2) echoes "Kael was quietly driven, yes" (paragraph 34) without added pressure. Minor filter-verb stacking in expository beats. Apply −0.8 for template cadence and loops combined; artifacts do not touch the closure carving scene, so no additional caps triggered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of turtle-shell city, pattern-language cartography, and watchers-as-historians is specific and non-obvious. The cracked whistle as map and the harmonic frequency matching turtle breathing provide fresh mechanical detail. Emotional truth in inherited grief and the choice to ask rather than answer feels earned. The mythopoetic frame risks familiar quest-for-lost-parent territory, but the inversion—mother's failure as deliberate key, questions as architecture—transforms it. The final image (question mark large enough for watchers to see, one raising a hand) is memorable and grows from prior particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael as spiral-shell cartographer is seeded in paragraph 2, her methods shape the middle study/craft beats, and her final act of carving the question mark into Old Merra's shell deploys her craft to speak the watchers' language. Decisions to blow the whistle and carve the mark drive key turns. Removing this exact occupation would break the pattern-language mechanics and the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Reed whistle appears in beat 7 (found in crevice, her mother's, cracked), is studied in beat 12 ("weeks studying the cracked whistle"), informs the shell-whistle craft in beat 19, and the crack-as-map insight in beat 15 drives escalation. Its meaning reweights from damage to deliberate key. Closure hinges on understanding the crack's message. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lost expedition is introduced in paragraph 4, shapes Kael's dominant stake (finding her mother/understanding the watchers), and the watchers' revelation in beat 28 ("We watched the expedition crack…your mother had reached them") directly informs the closure choice. The expedition's recorded path matching shell growth (beat 14) enables the harmonic discovery. Present in setup, middle causality, and ending knowledge.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Quietly driven" is named in paragraph 2 and reprised in paragraph 34 ("Kael was quietly driven, yes, but not toward death"). It characterizes her approach (weeks of study, patient cartography) and the final stance (building a gate of questions, choosing to speak the language). Constraint is more tonal than a visible tradeoff; it colors choices but does not force a specific cost-bearing decision on the page. Functional but trends toward label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Crack" operates multiply: the cracked whistle (beat 9), the crack in the watchers' silence (beat 25), the crack-as-map insight (beat 15), and "her mother had cracked their language" (beat 32). Each use redefines options—from damage to key to method. The crack insight drives the harmonic discovery and the closure understanding. Removing this exact image-action would collapse the story's causal spine and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Pattern-language is introduced in paragraph 11 ("pattern-language of shells"), actively used in beats 12–16 (studying the whistle, reading expedition maps, discovering the harmonic frequency), and named again when the watchers' voice enters "through the pattern-language she had mastered" (beat 27). The method shapes all middle attempts and enables the closure communication. Signaled early, mechanics matter, and it charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>City on turtle shells is established in the opening sentence, supplies the spatial frame throughout, and Old Merra's shell becomes the discovery site (whistle in crevice, beat 7) and the closure canvas (carving the question mark, beats 37–39). The turtle's breath rhythm (beat 17) provides the harmonic key. The rusted gate (beat 1, beat 20) and the highest point (beat 20) structure the climax. Indispensable across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After the gate rusted shut" is named in the opening and reprised in beat 31 ("The gate had rusted shut not from disuse, but from understanding"). It frames the inciting condition (only six turtles accessible, the seventh unreachable) and thematically charges the closure (understanding forecloses return). Time itself is not tracked as a ticking pressure; the frame is more situational backstory than live clock. Functional lyric reprise that reweights the premise but does not tighten tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Desire to question the watchers is introduced in paragraph 5 (they took her mother, promise answers and dread), drives the study and whistle-craft beats (12–19), and the climactic ascent and whistle blow (beats 21–24). Friction appears when the watchers reveal they catalogue questioners (beat 28) and the gate rusts from understanding (beat 31), yet Kael chooses to ask anyway (beats 33–39). Cost is conceptual and relational. Present across setup, middle pressure, and closure decision.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Sunwashed dread" is named in paragraph 5, reprised in beat 21 ("sunwashed dread of the morning"), and owned in the closure: "The sunwashed dread remained, but now it was hers to shape" (beat 35). Tone coheres through the measured, incantatory prose and the watchers' ominous stillness. It modulates from passive inheritance to active claim, charging the final stance. The phrase itself and the tonal consistency across turns elevate this above ornamental use.</comment>
