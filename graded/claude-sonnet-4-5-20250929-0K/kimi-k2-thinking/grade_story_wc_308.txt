<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The skimmer's motivation is stated but her interior life remains abstract and label-driven throughout. Key moments rely on telling rather than embodied contradiction: "weathered resolve etched into her features" and "historically reverent by nature" function as shortcuts rather than lived tension. The final transformation—"no longer stationary in the way that mattered"—is asserted without a visible micro-choice or renunciation that forecloses a path with felt cost. Interiority never shows contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed but eventually anchored; the scene remains continuous in one location. The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the skimmer comprehends temporal navigation while standing still, and the final image crystallizes her new role. However, the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page—no visible sacrifice or forfeiture accompanies the epiphany. The dominant lens is Accumulative/Textural: layered imagery and harmonic repetitions build toward the final reweighting, though the causal linkage between stone-skimming and comprehension remains loose.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The bone towers, canyon, and rose quartz disc are vividly rendered and purposefully atmospheric. The environment supplies the harmonic framework (towers amplify tones, birds signal in flight) that the protagonist interprets, meeting the micro-setting standard. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics under pressure; it functions as a stage for revelation rather than a crucible that forces tradeoffs. Spatial choreography is clean and sensory detail is selective, but the 9+ gate (environment constrains choice or charges final image) is not met.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning to navigate without moving—is signaled early and coheres throughout. However, escalation is conceptual rather than causal: the skimmer watches, skims stones, and listens, but no on-page reversal narrows her options or forces a trade-off. The birds' spiral and the arrowhead's pulse align without resistance or cost, delivering an epiphany rather than a tightening choice. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is sufficient, but the final reweighting lacks a visible price that alters later tactics or forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—consciousness as navigation, stillness as agency—emerges organically from imagery and the protagonist's stance. The recurring "centuries of layered dust" and "pulse left wandering" accumulate meaning without overt statement. However, the final lines ("some movement happens only in the mind") tilt toward gentle moralizing, and the resolution is tidy rather than complex. The ending offers a resonant answer to the central question, but the lack of ambiguity or counter-reading keeps it in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single-POV narration is stable and the prose carries a distinct, elevated register ("pulse left wandering through generations," "when the world was dreaming itself into being"). Perceptual signature is consistent: the skimmer notices echoes, harmonics, and temporal patterns. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract poeticism ("temporal fabric," "consciousness ride the echoes") that distances the reader from embodied perception. Psychic distance remains controlled, and no head-hopping occurs, but the voice lacks the gritty specificity that would distinguish it from generic mystical-quest narration.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction ("limestone became bone and bone became history," "dust remembered"). In high-pressure beats (the bird spiral, the final comprehension), this density flattens momentum rather than sharpening it. Template-cadence runs appear in the opening third ("It had been her mentor's before her, and his mentor's before him" / "stone to sky, past to future"). Minor paraphrase loops: "centuries of layered dust" recurs five times without evolving meaning. Information density is moderate; many lines do atmospheric work but do not advance goal or knowledge.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The harmonic-navigation premise and lyric accumulation offer a non-obvious angle on the "mystic learns ancient wisdom" template. The bone towers as temporal markers and birds as living signal are specific choices that elevate the material. However, the emotional arc—solitary seeker receives long-awaited message and achieves understanding—follows a familiar template without transformation through lived cost or moral calculus. The final image (teaching others, becoming keeper of pathways) resolves into mentorship cliché. Risk-taking is present in the lyric mode but does not fundamentally subvert expectations.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The harmonic stone skimmer is present throughout and her choices (raising eyes, skimming stones, closing eyes) structure beats. However, these are observation and ritual gestures rather than decisions that alter tactics or foreclose options. Her comprehension at the end is delivered to her by the birds' signal rather than earned through a choice with cost. Setup and payoff are met; middle development is weak because her actions do not narrow a field of possibility.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The stone arrowhead appears in multiple beats: held and felt in the opening third, pulsing mid-story, warming and aligning with her heartbeat at closure. Its "wandering pulse" provides the central mystery and the final answer ("no curse but a compass"). However, the arrowhead is not handled with on-page cost—she does not make a trade-off involving it—and its properties are told rather than tested. Setup, development, and payoff are met; causal pressure is moderate; irreplaceability is high.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"A pulse left wandering" is seeded early, recurs as the arrowhead's mystery, and is resolved at closure ("the pulse left wandering had finally come to rest"). The concept shapes the dominant stake (deciphering the rhythm) and charges the final image. However, it does not constrain tactics or narrow options mid-scene; the skimmer's approach remains passive observation until the birds deliver the message. Setup and payoff strong; middle development and causal pressure weak.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Historically reverent" is labeled in paragraph four and again at closure ("historically reverent understanding"). It does not constrain or enable a visible on-page action with cost; it functions as character coloring rather than a trait that forces a tradeoff. The skimmer's reverence for silence and patterns is thematic backdrop, not a source of friction or choice. Label-only use; no beat involvement with pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Appraise" appears once: "Now it was her turn to appraise its true value—not as a weapon, but as a key to temporal navigation." This moment reframes the arrowhead but does not drive a turn; the skimmer does not act on the appraisal in a way that alters her options. The action is summarized rather than dramatized. Present in the middle third; no setup or closure participation. Swappable with "understand" or "recognize."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The flock of birds is introduced early (paragraph 12) and used twice: first as general reading of currents, then as a decisive signal (the tightening spiral) that the skimmer has "waited decades to witness." The birds' pattern delivers the key message and triggers her final comprehension. The method is signaled, matters to tactics (she watches and waits), and shapes the closure. Setup, development, and payoff met; causal pressure moderate; specificity high.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The towers of bone and canyon of endless echoes are anchored early and used throughout: they amplify harmonic tones, mark temporal pathways, and charge the final image ("the canyon had found its navigator"). The setting supplies the harmonic framework essential to the resolution. However, it does not constrain a choice under pressure or force a tradeoff; it enables rather than resists. Setup, development, and payoff met; causal pressure moderate; irreplaceability high.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Through centuries of layered dust" recurs five times as atmospheric marker and thematic refrain. Time functions as accumulated history rather than a live clock that tightens decisions. The skimmer's decades of waiting are mentioned but not dramatized as a ticking constraint. The phrase charges the closure image (dust falls away, revealing simultaneous time), meeting payoff; setup and lyric resonance are present, but middle causal pressure is absent. Swappable with other deep-time metaphors.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The motivation—"to learn navigation without moving"—is stated explicitly (paragraph 8) and drives the dominant stake throughout. The skimmer's watching, listening, and stone-skimming are goal-directed, and the resolution directly answers the desire. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices with cost. No friction between want and obstacle appears on the page; the birds' signal fulfills her desire without sacrifice. Setup, development, and payoff met; friction weak.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Weathered resolve" is labeled twice (paragraph 23, final paragraph as "quiet certainty"). Tone is consistent—patient, reverent, mystical—and modulates slightly from watchful waiting to realization. However, the tone does not shift under pressure or charge the final image with new emotional weight; it remains static. The elevated, lyric register is coherent but does not deepen through turns. Present throughout; closure participation weak; no visible cost tied to tonal evolution.</comment>
