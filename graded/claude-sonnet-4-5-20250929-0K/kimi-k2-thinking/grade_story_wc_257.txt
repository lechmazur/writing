<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation ("to teach a withering star...how to bloom again") arrives via abstract declaration rather than embodied contradiction or pressure-driven choice. The core emotional arc—grief as "white dwarf"—is told through metaphor rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values. Internal states are labeled ("numb," "ashamed," "subdued ardor") without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The woman's arrival and Elara's recognition that "the stencil had been her future self" land as exposition rather than earned renunciation or stance crystallization with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation Test: "timeless observatory beneath the world" is anchored by ~60 words, though "who" remains vague (mourning jewelry maker with no present physical grounding). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—density increases through metaphor and image—but causality is thin: the stencil "materializes," coordinates "pointed nowhere...yet tugged," and Elara "understood" without dramatized friction. The closure unit (Elara leaving a final crane, learning "rock bottom was foundation") is a Conceptual Repricing, but the cost is asserted metaphorically rather than shown through a specific forfeiture or realization that alters present options on the page. No on-page reversal narrows choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The observatory's metaphoric architecture ("curtains of intention," "dying stars hung like frozen breath") is vivid but functions as backdrop rather than constraint. The vellum stencil and origami figures do small spatial work (illuminated beneath lens, left in airlocks), yet no environmental detail forces a tactical choice or meaningfully charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains abstract—Elara moves through quadrants and observation decks without grounded proximity or access friction. The setting reads as lyric texture rather than pressure apparatus.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to teach a withering star...how to bloom"—is signaled midway but never tested by on-page opposition or a choice that forecloses a path. Mnemosyne "responded" passively; no reversal or tightening narrows Elara's options. The woman's arrival offers no complication, only confirmation. Escalation under the Accumulative lens requires density increase or pattern break with cost; here, the prose accumulates metaphor without a meaningful shift in pressure or a visible price paid that alters later tactics. Agency is observational rather than decisional.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme—grief as collapsed light, artificial hope becoming real through intention—emerges through metaphor rather than concrete particulars. The final image ("coordinates pointing nowhere—an invitation") gestures toward resonance but remains abstract, lacking the specificity to reweight prior material with undeniable cost. "Genuinely artificial" and "curtains of intention" are repeated as thematic labels without dramatized tension. No epiphany arises from on-page struggle; insights are declared ("she understood," "she learned") rather than earned through action and choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited, but psychic distance drifts between immediate perception and omniscient summary ("For three eternities," "The observatory remained timeless"). Perceptual signature is generic—elevated metaphoric diction dominates without character-specific bias in noticing. The woman's dialogue ("You taught my dying star to bloom," "voice like curtains closing and opening") reads as thematic echo rather than goal-driven speech. Diction stays in a narrow lyric register that does not modulate meaningfully under pressure, and the prose lacks the specificities of a lived-in mind.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Dense figurative language pervades without pattern-teaching or payoff: "lab-grown sorrow," "subdued ardor," "curtains of intention danced with the quiet joy of purpose." Metaphors stack in most sentences, reducing clarity and momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: "genuinely artificial" recurs as label; "withering" and "bloom" are synonym-churned across beats. Template cadence: "She understood," "She'd been teaching," "Elara understood," "She left." Register drifts into abstraction ("protein-engineered paper," "shifted its pulse") without anchoring in Elara's tactile experience. Information density is low; many lines rephrase prior metaphors rather than advance pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The core premise—mourning jewelry maker teaching a dying star to bloom via origami coordinates—offers surface novelty but resolves through metaphoric assertion rather than earned transformation. "Genuinely artificial" and "curtains of intention" function as conceptual ornament without constraining choice. The twist (stencil from future self) arrives late and shifts causality retroactively rather than growing from prior particulars. Emotional truth is abstracted into lyric generality ("mourned only the certainty of endings") rather than specific, verifiable detail. The synthesis reads as prompt-response assembly rather than a singular artistic stance with undeniable cost.</comment>
