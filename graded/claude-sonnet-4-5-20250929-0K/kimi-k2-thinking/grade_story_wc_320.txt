<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to interpret the signal is clear, and her shift from amplification to listening demonstrates growth. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract concepts ("silence made tangible," "frequency so pure it erased noise") rather than embodied contradiction. The climactic moment—touching the shard and experiencing emptiness—resolves too smoothly without genuine struggle or competing impulses acting simultaneously. The "practical relief" tears feel label-only rather than earned through layered emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story establishes a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: Mira strips down her equipment, touches the shard, receives the insight, and rewires the tower. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the opening paragraph. The closure—transformation from interpreter to listener—lands with conceptual weight, but the cost feels abstract rather than viscerally legible. The causal chain from "discard assumptions" to "pattern emerges" compresses insight into a single beat without intermediate friction, weakening the sense of earned discovery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The abandoned radio tower city, lunar perigee gravity, and gorge create a vivid, purposeful setting that pressures Mira's work. Concrete details—rusted ladder, moss grooves, swaying platform, copper wire—ground the action and reflect her practical methodology. The tools (amplifier modules, waveform analyzers, listening crystal) constrain her approach and are handled on the page. However, the "hundred spires webbed with cable" and gorge remain largely atmospheric; they do not alter her final choice as directly as the shard and equipment do.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—interpreting the star fragment to understand cosmic silence—is signaled early and shapes Mira's tactics. The turn from amplification to listening provides one meaningful tightening. However, the escalation lacks on-page resistance: Mira's three-night failure is summarized, and the lunar perigee breakthrough arrives without intermediate cost or trade-off. The resolution (rewiring the tower) unfolds without visible friction, and the promise to "teach them to listen" feels declarative rather than tested.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme—finding beginnings in endings, silence as presence—emerges organically from the shard's properties and Mira's methodical stripping of assumptions. The mentor's dying words provide thematic scaffolding without overt moralizing. The final image of dormant transformation and the promise to rewire other towers offers resonance. However, phrases like "silence as presence, a frequency so pure it erased noise" and "the beginning in every ending" border on abstract philosophizing. The theme is stated more than it is charged by concrete, costly particulars at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV remains stable and the narrative voice carries a distinct, restrained texture ("Fantasy had no room for romance when signals were life and death"). Diction matches Mira's technical focus (amplifier modules, waveform analyzers, copper sang). However, some phrases drift into elevated register ("serenely electric," "a thing of impossible weight and lightness") that feel authorial rather than character-rooted. The repeated stem "She had assumed..." in close succession and the phrase "discarding assumptions like broken glass" read as template cadence, slightly flattening the perceptual signature under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, with most lines advancing atmosphere or action. However, multiple prose artifacts accumulate: paraphrase loops ("She had assumed the shard was a signal... She had assumed silence was empty. She had assumed the tower's purpose..."), the stock metaphor "discarding assumptions like broken glass," and filter-verb reliance ("she could see," "she heard it"). The phrase "serenely electric" recurs without evolving meaning. The "tears were practical, a pressure release valve for the soul" intrudes with mechanical metaphor at a peak emotional beat. Template cadence and synonym churn slightly dull momentum in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The premise—a celestial signal interpreter discovering that silence is a seed rather than absence—offers a fresh angle on post-apocalyptic mysticism. The inversion (listening instead of transmitting) and the practical, hands-on approach ("grease-blackened," "brutal simplicity") avoid genre clichés. However, the "hollywood star fragment" and "fallen gods" gesture toward high fantasy without grounding those elements in specific world logic or lived consequence. The core emotional turn (amplify → listen) is elegant but arrives with minimal resistance, and the "beginning in every ending" framing echoes familiar wisdom-literature templates without a sharp, non-obvious inflection.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's role as celestial signal interpreter is integral to setup, drives her middle-beat choice to strip equipment, and shapes the ending promise to rewire other towers. Her professional identity constrains her initial assumptions and her shift to listening creates the story's turning point. Introduced in the opening lines, her occupation directly enables the climactic rewiring action.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The hollywood star fragment appears in paragraph one, drives Mira's three-night tuning attempts, is physically touched at the climax, provides the pattern for rewiring, and remains "dormant, its job complete" at closure. It constrains her initial methods (refusing frequencies/codes), enables the breakthrough (touching with bare fingertips), and its final state reweights the ending. The fragment is causally active across setup, climax, and ending.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The "shard of hush" concept frames the fragment's nature and is defined early ("silence made tangible, the space between words"). It shapes Mira's interpretive challenge and the climactic realization that silence is presence. However, it functions more as thematic label than tactical constraint; the actual breakthrough comes from physical touch and equipment stripping, not from wrestling with hush as a discrete property that alters her options beat by beat.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Serenely electric" describes the fragment's pulse in paragraph one and reappears in the climax ("The serenely electric pulse mapped a geometry of patience"). It colors the fragment's presentation but does not constrain or enable a distinct action with visible cost. The attribute is decorative—removing it would not alter Mira's choices or the story's causal chain. No tradeoff tied to this specific quality is dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Tune" frames Mira's goal from the start ("for three nights she had tried to tune it") and her failure to tune conventionally forces the pivot to listening. The climactic rewiring can be read as a new form of tuning (adjusting circuits to the shard's pattern). The action shapes her attempts and the resolution, though "tune" as verb becomes implicit rather than explicit in the second half, with "rewiring" taking over as the concrete action term.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The method "discarding assumptions" is stated in the mentor's dying words, explicitly enacted mid-story ("she began by discarding assumptions, literally—unscrewing the amplifier modules"), and repeated as internal process ("She let them all fall away, discarding assumptions like broken glass"). It drives the turn from amplification to listening and directly produces the climactic insight. The mechanics are shown through physical equipment removal and mental clearing, shaping both tactics and closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The abandoned radio tower city over a gorge is introduced immediately, provides the platform and antenna array that caught the fragment, and supplies the "hundred dark towers waiting" as the ending's forward stake. Mira's work on Tower Nineteen's circuits and her plan to move to Tower Twenty ground the transformation promise. The vertical drop and swaying platform add physical pressure. The setting constrains her location and tools, and the city's scope charges the ending image, though the gorge itself remains atmospheric.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Lunar perigee is introduced in the opening paragraph ("pulled at her bones as it pulled at the tides"), cited as the timing for peak cosmic tides that Mira chooses for her breakthrough attempt, and described as swelling/pressing during the climactic work. Its retreat marks the resolution's boundary. The timeframe tightens her decision to try "tonight" and the gravitational metaphor ("dragging clarity from confusion") links the moon's pull to her insight. It shapes when she acts and adds urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation "find the beginning in every ending" is voiced by the mentor, drives Mira's interpretive frame, and provides the thematic lens for the climactic realization (the shard is a seed, endings contain code for what's next). It is tested through her failed amplification attempts and resolved when she discovers the pattern. However, the motivation is more intellectual thesis than viscerally conflicted want; no competing desire (fear, doubt, personal cost) complicates her pursuit on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Fantasy practicality" is explicitly named ("Fantasy had no room for romance when signals were life and death. This was survival, not poetry") and demonstrated through grease-blackened hands, brutal simplicity, and methodical rewiring. The tone balances mystical elements (fallen gods, cosmic silence) with tool-work and physical labor. It modulates appropriately under pressure, staying restrained even at the climactic touch. The final promise to work "methodically" from Tower Twenty onward sustains the practical register and charges the ending with workman-like inevitability.</comment>
