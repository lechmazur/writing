<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Evers's bewilderment is characterized through the nonlinear inheritance mechanic, showing him struggling to order fragmented memories. The progression from confusion to understanding is earned through the bathroom scene and shell-carving sequence. However, the interiority often operates at high register ("translator of cosmic secrets," "bewilderment was not a flaw but the correct state") that reads more thematic than embodied, and the final epiphany about being "a mourner" arrives through summary rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The choice to bite the fruit and continue inquiring has visible consequence but lacks micro-hesitation that would ground the cost in lived contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens inferred as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through image density and pattern (orchard as language, shell as memory key, bathroom as clarity space) toward a conceptual repricing where the orchard is revealed as memorial garden. Closure lands on page with cost—Evers accepts his role as mourner knowing the "terrible beauty"—and the final images reweight prior material. Orientation is clear by the opening paragraph. The weakness: the middle section's escalation reads more as information reveal than tightening pressure; the bathroom breakthrough feels like a exposition delivery system rather than a beat that narrows options under duress.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The astral orchard setting constrains choice throughout: its rules forbid inquiry, its trees "speak" through fruit, the bathroom's privacy protocols enable the breakthrough. The pistachio shell functions as micro-setting, warming in his palm and requiring memory-carving. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through POV (silver branches, humming frequencies, recycled air). The orchard "tilting toward him" and branches swaying in vacuum directly charge the final sequence. Minor slip: "crystalline paths" and "liquid memories" lean decorative in the opening without immediate tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (forbidden knowledge vs. orchard rules) is signaled early and tightens through bathroom retreat, shell-carving, and fruit-biting. The piece deepens rather than reverses: each beat adds understanding rather than narrowing options through loss. Cost is visible—he accepts "terrible beauty" and "disquiet settled into his bones"—but the escalation reads more as puzzle-solving than agency under duress. The forbidden knowledge gravity "pulled at his curiosity" but no live option is foreclosed until the very end; the path from bathroom to tree feels inevitable rather than chosen against competing pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme (mourning across impossible distances, memorial as duty) emerges through image and event rather than statement. The orchard-as-language conceit deepens from decorative to structural: blossoms are sentences, fruit tastes like equations, trees are tombstones for dead universes. The final image—"between each heartbeat and breath, the story would continue, nonlinear and perfect"—reweights the entire frame without moralizing. One slip: "bewilderment was not a flaw but the correct state for a translator" edges toward authorial thesis in the bathroom scene. Otherwise the piece earns its wisdom through the shell-carving sequence and fruit-bite revelation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with controlled distance; Evers's perceptual signature favors cosmic scale and memorial language. Voice modulates purposefully: compressed clarity in the bathroom, lyric expansion at the final tree. Lexicon is consistent—"nonlinear inheritance," "simply complicated," "brightened"—and the elevated register fits a curator of astral phenomena. Weakness: several beats rely on stock constructions ("trembling palm," "flood of understanding," "terrible beauty") and filter verbs cluster in the middle section ("realized," "understood," "seemed"). The bathroom breakthrough paragraph stacks explanation where scene pressure could carry the insight.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in the opening and closing thirds. However, the middle section shows template cadence: "He needed to inquire... Instead, he retreated... There, among the humming pipes... The nonlinear inheritance meant..." reads as sequential exposition blocks. Paraphrase loops appear: "bewildered curator" / "bewilderment was not a flaw"; "forbidden knowledge" is named three times in proximity without added pressure. Mixed metaphor: memories arrive "like scattered pages" then must be "restrung" as beads. The closure sequence is clean and propulsive, but artifacts in the middle third prevent high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of nonlinear inheritance + memorial orchard + bathroom-as-philosophical-space is specific and non-obvious. The pistachio shell mechanic (memory carved via thought, not tools) transforms the "key to hidden library" trope through embodied constraint. The orchard-as-language conceit is earned through accumulation rather than assertion. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative/textural lens, high concept density) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor friction: the bathroom as breakthrough space is signaled but not fully inhabited—one more micro-detail of how the small space "compresses thought" would cement the transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Evers the bewildered curator is present throughout and his choices (retreat to bathroom, carve shell, bite fruit) create key turns. His bewilderment shapes perception and his decision to "continue to inquire" drives the ending. However, much of the middle is observational—he processes inheritance fragments—and the final choice feels inevitable rather than contested. Setup early, involved in two beats (bathroom, tree), shapes ending but with muted cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The pistachio shell cameo blank appears early ("turned... in his trembling palm"), is handled in the bathroom scene (pressed to forehead, carved with thought), and is used at the tree (placed against trunk, absorbed, triggers fruit). It evolves from "unspoken potential" to "glowing sigil" and its mechanics (memory-carving) constrain the method. Strong beat involvement, closure linkage, and specificity. One friction: the shell's properties are told more than tested.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Nonlinear inheritance shapes stakes and tactics throughout: fragments arrive out of order, some mornings he knows songs, other days forgets his name. It constrains the bathroom breakthrough ("reorder itself into a coherent sequence") and enables the final understanding. The concept drives the orchard-as-language revelation and the memorial-duty closure. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage, present in three beats (opening, bathroom, ending), with irreplaceable mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Simply complicated" is seeded early in orchard rules and returns at closure ("The knowledge was simply complicated"). It constrains his approach (tend without asking) and is dramatized when the inheritance completes. However, it reads more as thematic label than on-page tradeoff—no visible cost tied specifically to this attribute. Present in two beats but the mechanics remain abstract; closer to lyric reprise than causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Inquire" is seeded ("He needed to inquire, to ask the trees"), becomes the bathroom focus ("to pursue forbidden knowledge"), and drives the ending choice ("He would continue to inquire"). It shapes the dominant stake but the action itself—asking—is deferred until after the fruit. The actual inquiry moment (placing shell, biting fruit) uses different verbs. Present in setup and closure, but the exact action is elided at the peak beat.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Philosophical breakthroughs in bathrooms is signaled and used: the bathroom is "the only place where surveillance drones never ventured," and "philosophical breakthroughs came easier, as if the small space compressed thought." Evers retreats there to reorder the inheritance. The method shapes one key beat (bathroom breakthrough) and its mechanics (privacy, compression) are given. However, it's used once and doesn't recur or complicate; late arrivals can score solidly when transformative, but this feels more functional than indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The astral orchard is present from the title and opening line, pressures choices (rules forbid asking, trees absorb the shell, offer fruit), and charges the final image (branches sway, blossoms open like eyes, tree absorbs sigil). Its properties (silver branches, starlight fruit, memorial function) are irreplaceable and constrain tactics throughout. Strong setup, development (rules create forbidden knowledge stake), and payoff (tree interaction, final understanding). The orchard is the story's primary setting and meaning-carrier.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Between the first and last page" is seeded late ("accessible only between the first and last page of thought") and returns in the final line ("Between the first and last page of his own consciousness"). It reweights the temporal frame at closure but does not constrain middle choices or create urgency. Lyric reprise without causal pressure; present in setup (implicit in "nonlinear") and closure but not development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation to pursue forbidden knowledge is dramatized early ("forbidden knowledge had a gravity that pulled at his curiosity"), drives the bathroom breakthrough, and shapes the ending choice ("He would continue to inquire... no matter the cost"). Friction appears: orchard rules forbid it, the knowledge is "terrible," disquiet settles into his bones. Strong setup, constrains middle tactics (retreat to privacy), and is reaffirmed with cost at closure. The desire is embodied through the shell-carving and fruit-biting sequence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Brightened disquiet is coherent throughout: bewilderment, trembling, the "terrible beauty," and the final "disquiet settled into his bones, brightened by the luminous fruit." Tone modulates with pressure—compressed in the bathroom, expansive at the tree—and charges the final image. The oxymoron is earned through event (memorial revelation) rather than asserted. Present in opening, middle (bathroom pressure), and closure; the exact phrase appears late but the tonal elements (disquiet + luminosity) are seeded early.</comment>
