<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses. Her "unyielding compassion" is told at the start and never tested by a genuine on-page choice that costs her something. The bird-healing sequence unfolds without friction or doubt, making it feel procedural. Scars are repeatedly told to "sing" but never embodied in a physical micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors appear early (who, where), satisfying the test. However, no meaningful causal pressure tightens options: Maya arrives, sings, binds the wing, and departs without a reversal or cost that forecloses a path. The closure image (walking away with coin, thread, and song) is a summary statement rather than a decisive change or reconfiguration with visible price. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural, but the ending merely restates the opening premise without reweighting it through an on-page beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon, black sand, and driftwood log provide atmospheric detail, but they do not constrain a choice or charge the final image in a way that alters tactics. Sensory selection is present (kelp scent, warm sand, orange rays) yet remains decorative. The coin pressed into sand and the protective circle gesture toward micro-setting use, lifting the score slightly, but neither object changes what Maya can or cannot do at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>No on-page reversal or tightening occurs. Maya's dominant stake—proving scars can sing—is declared but never tested by opposition or cost. The bird's recovery is frictionless; no choice narrows options or forces a trade-off. The ending walk-away does not foreclose a path or show a price paid, leaving escalation absent under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme is overtly stated ("scars can sing," "unyielding compassion") rather than emerging from events. The final paragraph summarizes the theme ("She had proven that scars can sing") instead of letting the image resonate. The coin and red thread recur but function as symbols announced rather than particulars that shift meaning through action. No counter-reading or ambiguity complicates the stated moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic (migrating clouds, kelp-drift peace) and lacks character-specific bias. Diction is consistent but elevated without variation under pressure ("gracefully alert," "testament to survival"). No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("She imagined," "She felt," "She knew") stack in reflective passages without voice-motivated purpose, dulling immediacy in several beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "scars can sing" appears four times, "unyielding compassion" three times, "migrating clouds" four times, often in adjacent or nearby lines without added pressure. Template cadence runs dominate the second half ("She [verb]… She [verb]…" across eight consecutive sentences). Mixed metaphor: "scars…shimmer, as if the fire's memory had turned to music" conflates visual, thermal, and auditory domains. Stock phrases ("kelp-drift peace," "testament to survival") recur without fresh coloring. These artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering the elevated deduction and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The firefighter/arsonist's-daughter premise is familiar; the story does not transform it through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The bird-healing sequence and symbolic coin are well-worn redemption motifs executed without fresh inflection. Emotional arc (guilt → healing → peace) follows a predictable template. No bold structural or perspectival risk heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Maya's occupation as firefighter is mentioned once in exposition; it does not shape an on-page choice or tactic. Her father's arson legacy is told but never complicates a decision. Late introduction (after the lagoon and bird are established) and ornamental role cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Black sand appears in three beats: held in palm, scattered around the bird, pressed onto the coin. It constrains no choice and the "protective circle" is gesture without dramatized cost. Setup is early, but mid-development and closure use remain decorative rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Unyielding compassion" is stated three times as theme but never dramatized as a stake that conflicts with another want or fear. It does not change Maya's options on the page; the bird-healing proceeds without a compassion-versus-self trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Gracefully alert" is a label applied twice without visible tradeoff or enabling action. No beat shows this trait constraining a choice or costing Maya an alternative path.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Grafting the wing (binding a splint with red thread) occurs in one extended beat and drives the bird-healing sequence. However, it does not create a turn or cost; the action succeeds without friction. Setup and development are present, but the graft does not redefine options at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The foreign coin on red thread is introduced early, used as a weight on the splint, then pressed into sand. It appears in three beats but its mechanics do not shape attempts or outcomes; the coin could be replaced with any small object. Closure cameo (tucked in pocket) is passive.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon provides backdrop and is named in the opening and closing lines. It supplies no resource or constraint that alters Maya's tactics; the healing could occur in any quiet location. Early setup and closure mention lift the score slightly, but causal pressure is absent.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Migration of clouds" appears four times as atmospheric detail but imposes no time pressure or deadline. The timeframe is vague (sunset duration) and does not tighten decisions.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"To prove that scars can sing" is stated twice and drives Maya's presence at the lagoon. However, it is never conflicted by a competing want or tested by a choice that costs her. The motivation remains told rather than dramatized through friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Kelp-drift peace" is named three times and sets a static, tranquil tone. The tone does not modulate under pressure (there is no pressure) or charge the final image with tension. It remains a single-note mood rather than a tonal arc.</comment>
