<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to archive emotional patterns is established, and his accidental prophecy creates internal conflict. The character's embodied emotions (trembling hands, phantom itch, weight of prophecy "like a velvet shroud") are concrete. However, key choices feel contemplative rather than decisively enacted—he performs ritual actions but the stakes of sealing the vault versus alternative responses never face genuine internal conflict or visible cost that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early (rooftop orchard, Elias, post-foghorn). The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: sensory details and ritual actions build toward the sealed vault. Closure reads as Earned Stasis or Charged Poise—Elias seals the prophecy and accepts the "velvet disquiet"—but the cost remains atmospheric rather than a legible forfeiture of options or a concrete price paid. The final image reweights prior material, yet the stakes never visibly narrow.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The rooftop orchard, phonograph, reflecting pool, and vault are vividly rendered with purposeful detail. The wax shaving's immersion in water and the leaf mirroring the recorded hum charge the final image. Spatial choreography (rooftop to spiral stair to vault beneath roots) is coherent and the medlar's roots anchor the closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment shapes the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Elias's realization that his spoken prophecy maps the city's emotional currents—is signaled midway and deepens his role as archivist. One meaningful turn occurs when he discovers the prophecy's true nature ("not a warning of doom but a map"), yet no visible cost or narrowed option results. The resolution (sealing the vault) feels contemplative rather than a choice that forecloses alternatives under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete images: the wax recording, the reflecting pool, the leaf's veins echoing the hum. The piece resists moralizing; the final image of the sealed spindle and future scribes wondering "how a simple wax shaving could hold the heartbeat of a city" offers resonant ambiguity. The orchard's sigh and medlar roots ground the conceptual in the particular, and the prophecy-as-emotional-map reweights the premise without stating a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV distance is stable, and the prose carries a distinct, elevated register ("green testament to forgotten horticulture," "velvet shroud") consistent with Elias's vocation. Perceptual signature reflects his archival mindset. However, diction occasionally drifts into lyric abstraction under pressure ("quiet disquiet wrapped in velvet") where concrete embodiment would sharpen voice. No dialogue present; filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "realized") are used sparingly and voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and the prose is dense with sensory detail. Minor paraphrase loops appear: "the weight of the accidental prophecy" is restated as "velvet disquiet" without added pressure, and "quiet disquiet wrapped in velvet" echoes the earlier "velvet shroud" metaphor. Template cadence in the vault sequence ("placed… sealed… inscribed") slightly flattens momentum. Information density is high, but a few scaffold phrases ("he knew he must," "he realized") could be cut for propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of oath-scribe, rooftop orchard, wax phonograph, and accidental prophecy is specific and non-obvious. The premise—emotional patterns archived via dead languages and obsolete recording media—feels fresh. The field-trip memory anchoring the immersion method and the leaf's veins mirroring the wax hum are inventive particulars. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and lyric closure heightens thematic stakes without obscuring clarity, earning a modest bonus within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout, and his choice to seal the vault concludes the piece. However, his decisions feel ritual-bound rather than agonized; the vault-sealing forecloses no live alternative shown on the page. He shapes two beats (speaking the prophecy, sealing the vault) but lacks the causal agency or visible cost that would push higher.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The wax shaving is handled across multiple beats: retrieved, placed on the phonograph, immersed in water, wound onto a spindle, and sealed in the vault. Its use evolves from recording medium to prophecy vessel to archived emotional map. The object is indispensable to the closure image, though its causal pressure on Elias's choices remains indirect.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The accidental prophecy is signaled early (Elias unwittingly speaks the words) and reweighted at midpoint (not doom, but emotional map). It drives the decision to seal the vault and shapes the ending's thematic charge. However, the prophecy does not visibly narrow options or force a trade-off; it functions more as thematic capstone than causal stake.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias's fluency in dead languages enables him to recognize the Lycian oath-binders' dialect and unwittingly speak the prophecy. The attribute appears in two beats (recognition, utterance) and is essential to the accidental prophecy. Yet it does not constrain a later choice or bear visible cost; it functions as premise rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The immersion of the wax shaving in distilled water is the method that allows the phonograph to capture the ripples as a hum, pivoting the prophecy from spoken words to recorded pattern. It appears in the middle third, enables the archival act, and is recalled at closure ("reflecting pool" anchors the vault's conceptual charge). Swappable with another ritual, but the water motif ties to the field-trip memory and resonates with the final leaf image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The third-grade field trip is invoked early to explain the immersion method ("the teacher had shown them how sound could be coaxed from a silent medium"). It provides backstory justification and a phantom sensory anchor (wax flaking onto skin). Present in setup and method, but its mechanics do not constrain middle choices or return with reweighted meaning at closure. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The rooftop orchard frames the entire piece, supplies the workbench and phonograph, and the vault beneath the oldest medlar roots anchors the closure. The setting's ancient trees atop modern concrete mirrors the dead-language theme. It constrains the action spatially and charges the final image (leaf drifting onto the sealed case, branches bending as rain falls). Essential to the story's logic and tone.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The foghorn's final cry marks the opening beat and establishes the "after" frame. The silence that follows sets tone and prompts Elias's memory. However, time does not tighten decisions or track as a live constraint; the piece unfolds in contemplative sequence rather than against a closing window. Present in setup, absent in middle development and closure pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elias's desire to archive emotional patterns is stated early and drives his realization that the prophecy maps the city's heartbeats. This motivation informs the vault-sealing and the final thematic charge. However, it is not dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost; it functions as consistent professional ethic rather than stake tested under pressure. Present in two beats and closure framing, but not contested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Velvet disquiet is embodied throughout: the foghorn's "low moan," the "velvet shroud" of prophecy, the "quiet disquiet wrapped in velvet," and the final "velvet disquiet settle deeper." Tone modulates from stillness through ritual tension to resigned acceptance, cohering across turns and charging the final image. The repeated velvet motif risks over-reliance but successfully unifies atmosphere and thematic weight.</comment>
