<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The gravity defier remains an abstraction throughout—no embodied emotions, no contradictory impulses in scene, only declarative states ("Her motivation burned clear"). Interior is generic and label-driven ("periodic eternity," "fractured timelines") rather than specific to a mind under pressure. The final "surrender" is asserted rather than earned through prior micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values. Agency collapses into passive dissolution with no visible cost that forecloses a live option.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who, where, when arrive by line 4 (waived). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density of imagery meant to reweight the dominant stake—but no meaningful tightening occurs; the piece loops through synonym variations of "labyrinth = self" without a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration that alters options. The ending dissolves the protagonist into abstraction ("she had become its architect") with no on-page cost; the tablet "reconstitutes" and "runes rewrite," undoing any closure. Cost proof test fails: no exact sentence shows a felt or conceptual price at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The glowing viaduct supplies vivid anchor and recurs across beats, but it never constrains a choice or alters tactics—it remains scenic backdrop. The phosphorescent moss, rain, and crimson glow are consistent and sensory, yet the protagonist floats above consequence without spatial friction. Micro-setting exception: the tablet warms and cracks, but these states do not force a tactical shift. Falls short of the 9+ gate (environment must constrain choice or charge final image) and lacks integration with the dominant conflict.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("conquer the labyrinth of self") is signaled midway but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the protagonist moves through procedurally generated corridors without meeting resistance that forces trade-offs. The ending grants dissolution without prior cost: "surrender" is declared the "only victory" in summary rather than dramatized through a choice that forecloses a path. Coincidence (the raindrop, the tablet reconstituting) resolves rather than complicates, violating the core test.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme ("self as labyrinth") is stated repeatedly in prompt-like language rather than emerging from particulars: "You are the labyrinth," "she had become its architect." The final paragraph moralizes overtly ("the only victory possible: the acceptance of infinite recursion"), replacing scene pressure with thesis. Tablet and viaduct recur but do not shift meaning—each mention restates the same symbolic claim. Thematic Echo penalty (−0.6) applies for the final-paragraph articulation of thesis without embodied cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with no head-hopping; psychic distance is consistent. Voice leans toward elevated register throughout ("periodically eternal," "darkening brightness," "cognition's knot"), creating a uniform lyric texture that does not modulate under pressure. Perceptual signature is generic—no character-specific way of noticing. Diction stays within an abstract philosophical lexicon but lacks the specificity or rhythmic control that would elevate to high bands. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "fractured timelines folded," "timelines began to collapse," "timelines stitched themselves"; "procedural generation" appears six times with near-identical framing. Template cadence dominates ("She [verb]" openers across a dozen lines). Stock metaphors cluster without fresh vehicle ("knot of being," "blueprint of her dissolution"). Figurative density in most sentences of peak beats (lines 17–30) with no pattern-taught payoff triggers −0.7. Patterned-artifact penalty pack (paraphrase loops, template stems, stock strings) totals −1.4 in Q7; artifacts touch closure (final third), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Core premise (protagonist navigates self-as-labyrinth via procedural recursion) closely matches widely used metaphysical-quest templates without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. Derivative Premise Guardrail triggers −1.0. "Periodic eternity," "fractured timelines," and "procedural generation" function as prompt labels rather than integrated constraints. The dissolution ending and tablet-reconstitution loop echo familiar recursive-narrative patterns. No bold risk elevates; the piece retreats into abstraction rather than committing to specific stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Gravity defier is present throughout but makes no causal choices—she observes, touches runes, and "realizes" in summary. Setup present (line 1), but middle development lacks (no choice alters tactics), and closure participation is passive dissolution. Swappability high: "seeker" or "traveler" would require only minor edits. Late first functional beat (~line 13) and ornamental use (−0.8 combined) limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Ancient clay tablet with runes appears in setup (line 3), middle (lines 9, 14, 18, 23), and ending (lines 31, 40, 48). Three distinct beats: it warms, cracks and bleeds light, crumbles, then reconstitutes. The reconstitution undercuts closure cost, capping at mid-band. Causal pressure is weak—it "writes itself anew" without constraining protagonist choice. Present across beats but swappable with any magical artifact; no unique properties matter to tactics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Fractured timelines are mentioned eight times but remain thematic decoration—never do they change on-page options or force a tactical choice. Setup present (line 5), closure mention (lines 19, 33, 49), but no middle development that alters protagonist action. The concept could be replaced with "parallel realities" or "memory shards" with near-zero structural impact. Ornamental use and swappability combine for −1.0.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Periodically eternal appears in setup (line 4) and ending (lines 28, 45), but only as label—no on-page scene shows the trait constraining or enabling an action with cost. The "surge" (line 16) dilates time for observation, not decision. Missing middle development (no choice altered by the trait) caps at 3.4; ornamental use and label-only penalty (−0.6) push lower.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Retrace appears in setup (line 8) and middle (line 20: "retrace not her steps, but her thoughts"), shaping a conceptual turn. Closure participation weak—the final dissolution does not hinge on retracing. Functional in one beat (line 20 reframes the method) but swappable with "unwind" or "reverse" with minor edits. Missing strong closure linkage and causal irreplaceability limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.2</grade><comment>Through procedural generation appears six times but only as descriptive label for how corridors form, never as a method the protagonist employs or that alters her tactics. Setup present (line 7), but no middle development (she does not use or manipulate the generation), and closure mention (line 37) is passive. Summary-only and ornamental use (−0.8 combined); swappability high ("spontaneous creation" would fit).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Glowing viaduct after rain anchors setup (lines 1–2) and recurs across beats (lines 11, 19, 23, 28, 34, 46), providing spatial continuity. Development weak—it never constrains movement or supplies a resource that alters outcome; protagonist "floats above the arches, untethered." Closure participation: the viaduct "stood empty" and "stones slowly dimming," a charged image that reweights hope. Two gates (setup, closure reprise) allow ~6.0 eligibility; lyric reprise reweights the stake, lifting within band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Between the drop and the ripple is signaled in setup (line 6) and recurs (lines 16, 21, 30, 35, 44), framing the temporal window. Development: the timeframe allows movement "between cause and effect" but does not tighten decisions—she has infinite subjective time ("heartbeat took centuries"). Closure: "the raindrop touched stone at last, and the ripple spread," ending the window, but no live clock alters tactics. Functional presence without constraint caps mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>To conquer the labyrinth of self is declared in line 10 and restated in lines 25, 29, 42. The motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices—no friction between wanting conquest and fearing its cost is shown in action. Missing middle development (no on-page choice tests the desire with visible trade-off) caps at 3.4. Summary-only use and lack of friction (−0.7 combined).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Darkening brightness appears in setup (line 11: "brightening lie"), middle (line 19: "brightness dimming," line 26: "darkening brightness of the scene," line 28: "crimson, beautiful and terrible"), and ending (line 38: "darkening brightness was complete," line 46: "brightening and darkening eternally"). Tone modulates with pressure and charges the final image (the glow "was gone, but the darkness was not absolute"). Three gates met; causal role in reweighting the viaduct's symbolic load at closure. Strong lyric integration lifts within band.</comment>
