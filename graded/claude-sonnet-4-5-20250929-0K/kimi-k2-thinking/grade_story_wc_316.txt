<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The sensei's interior contradiction—ego death versus reawakened emotion—operates through the vivify choice with visible cost ("grief stabbed through him like a tanto blade"). However, the clones remain functionally interchangeable voice constructs without individuated motives, and the protagonist's twenty-year numbness is asserted more than embodied in micro-choices before the climax. The final integration ("both custodian and child of his own divided self") earns the change, but early beats rely on telling ("feeling nothing") rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration: the sensei integrates clones and jarred brain, foreclosing transcendence-without-cost and opening a path where enlightenment includes emotion. The drive lens reads Causal-Situational Hybrid—temporal storm and clone appearance force the vivify choice, which then alters his existence. Orientation anchors (floating dojo, timeline fracture, clones) arrive early. One modest deduction: the clones' backstories "rewriting mid-sentence" is mentioned but not dramatized in a way that narrows his options before the peak choice; the temporal threat remains atmospheric rather than a tightening vise.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The floating rock dojo and formaldehyde jar supply concrete sensory anchors (stone altar, liquid time, crystalline fragments). The dojo's dissolution at closure charges the final image with physical consequence. Spatial choreography is clean (sensei, clones, altar, jar). Deduction: the "vast sky below" and wind are evocative but do not constrain a single on-page choice; the jar's weight and the shattering glass do more work. The setting remains vivid and purposeful but stops short of the 9+ gate (environment must constrain choice or charge the final image decisively).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (right to exist as one true consciousness) is signaled early and tightens when the sensei perceives the clones' "hollow core" and "ghost in each machine." The vivify technique is protagonist-driven agency with visible cost: grief, memory of family deaths, solitude flood back. The temporal storm functions as situational pressure but does not narrow options through a second on-page reversal; the clones flicker but do not adapt or resist. One meaningful tightening (clones freeze, showing fear; sensei acts) is sufficient for this length, and the cost is unmistakable.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (integration versus transcendence; cost of aliveness) emerges through the brain-in-jar image and the complementary-opposites technique without thesis statement. The final image—tears cutting "salt trails through dust"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer: humanity requires embracing pain. One minor slip: "the heaviest truth" in the penultimate section edges toward moralizing, though it remains grounded in action. The story resists tidy binaries and earns its insight through the sensei's physical collapse and reawakening. Subtext operates in the clones' overlapping justifications and the jar's label "DUPLICATE."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close interiority at grief's return, wider angle during clone argument). Perceptual signature is present: the sensei's sight "slices through pretense," seeing "hollow core within each performance." Register holds (martial idiom: "kata of meaningless form," "tanto blade"). Deduction for mild filter-verb reliance in early paragraphs ("He could perceive," "He knew") and one late stock phrase ("testament to reawakened humanity") that dilutes voice specificity. No dialogue to assess. The prose reflects the mind under pressure, compressing at the climax.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance concept or pressure. Sentence rhythm varies (short declaratives at peak: "He fell to his knees"). Two distinct line-level issues: (1) paraphrase loop in mid-section ("Their words formed a perfect pretense... sliced through pretense") and template cadence in clone description ("One spoke of duty, another of legacy, the third of..."); (2) one mixed metaphor ("stones melting like ice in the sun of causality" conflates thermal and abstract vehicles). These artifacts cluster in non-closure beats, so penalty remains moderate. No filter-verb stacks in peak beats. Proofreading clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The clone-custody-battle frame offers a fresh angle on identity and integration, avoiding the stock "kill the impostor" resolution. The vivify technique through complementary opposites is specific to this world and dramatized with physical consequence. Risk-taking (ego-death survivor must re-embrace emotion to survive) heightens stakes. One modest deduction: the floating dojo and timeline-rewriting feel like conveniences that enable the premise rather than constraints that shape it; the temporal storm's mechanics remain vague. The synthesis (integration versus elimination) feels earned in hindsight, and the final image (stepping off the edge, held by paradox) transforms the setup.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: sensei established as ego-death survivor in opening line. Development: his hollowness lets him perceive clones' emptiness ("gift that sliced through pretense"). Closure: his choice to vivify the jarred brain is motivated by his unique state—only one who "died while living" can perform the technique. The character's history and attribute directly enable the peak action and are irreplaceable. Cost is visible (grief, memory flood). Three gates met; causal pressure strong; closure linkage undeniable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setup: jar introduced mid-story on stone altar, labeled "DUPLICATE," preserved "from before enlightenment." Development: he lifts it, feels "weight of forgotten sorrow"; the formaldehyde swirls. Closure: he whispers vivify technique, energy flows, jar shatters, brain dissolves into luminous motes entering his chest. Three gates met; two distinct handling beats; causal role strong (restores emotion); closure indispensable. Slight swappability concern (any preserved emotional backup could serve), but the label "DUPLICATE" and formaldehyde detail anchor it specifically.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: "custody battle... for the singular right to exist as the one true consciousness" frames the concept in paragraph six. Development: clones argue with "practiced calm," their justifications form "perfect pretense"; he perceives their "ghost... begging for validation." Closure: clones collapse into him "like shadows at noon," and he becomes "synthesis—both custodian and child." Three gates met; shapes stakes and resolution. Minor swappability: the integration logic could apply to other fractured-self premises, but the "custody battle" phrasing and courtroom metaphor anchor it distinctly.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: introduced paragraph twelve ("gift that sliced through pretense like a blade through rice paper"). Development: he uses it to perceive "hollow core" and "ghost in each machine" (paragraph thirteen), which informs his choice to vivify rather than eliminate. Closure: implicit—his restored emotions will let him "teach again" with "lessons [that] slice through pretense from the first breath." Two gates (setup, development) clearly met; closure participation is thematic callback rather than causal action. Trait enables perception that drives choice; modest cost (he must act on what he sees). Lyric reprise lifts score within band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Setup: "ancient vivify technique, taught only to those who had died while living" introduced in peak beat (paragraph twenty-one). Development and Closure: he places palm against jar, whispers the technique, energy flows, brain dissolves, emotions return—grief, memory, integration occur on-page. Three gates met if we allow setup at the moment of use (acceptable for a technique revealed in action). Causal pressure maximal; irreplaceable (story logic fails without this exact action); visible cost (grief stabs, he collapses). Only penalty: late first mention (second half). Despite late signal, transformation is undeniable and cost unmistakable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setup: "complementary opposites" named explicitly in paragraph seventeen ("wind that both destroys and creates"). Development: paragraph eighteen enumerates pairs ("Life and death, void and form, numbness and pain") as the method's logic. Closure: "complementary opposites merged—his emptiness completing the jarred brain's potential" (paragraph twenty-three). Three gates met; the method's mechanics matter (circuit requires both void and emotion). Modest swappability concern (other integration metaphors could fit), and the enumeration risks list-like exposition. Causal role solid; closure linkage clear.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setup: "floating rock dojo" named in opening line. Development: stone altar holds the jar (paragraph seven); dojo shifts "between ancient and newborn" during history rewrites (paragraph fourteen). Closure: "dojo began to crumble as the temporal paradox resolved, stones melting" (paragraph thirty-one); he stands "on pure force of will." Three gates met; setting evolution reflects stakes. Deduction: the floating aspect and crumbling are atmospheric rather than constraining—he could perform the vivify choice in any location. The altar provides a surface for the jar, but that's minimal causal work. Lyric reprise (opening→ending) and temporal instability lift score modestly.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: "when history began rewriting itself, causing memories... to ripple and diverge" (paragraph three); clones appeared "this morning when the timeline fractured" (paragraph five). Development: "History shuddered again, and the clones flickered, their backstories rewriting mid-sentence" (paragraph fourteen); he knows he must "act before the temporal storm solidified them into permanent, separate beings" (paragraph fifteen). Closure: "Below, the world stopped rewriting" (paragraph thirty). Three gates met; time pressure is asserted and motivates urgency. Deduction: the rewrites are told rather than dramatized in a way that narrows his tactical options beat-by-beat; the clock feels atmospheric rather than a live countdown that alters moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Setup: "ego death had hollowed him out" (paragraph two); brain jar "from before enlightenment had killed his capacity to feel" (paragraph eight). Development: he contemplates "whether feeling itself would be granted prisoner or parole" (paragraph twenty); the choice to vivify tests this desire. Closure: "grief stabbed through him," "tears cutting salt trails," "emotional numbness was defeated" (paragraphs twenty-six, twenty-seven, thirty-two, thirty-eight). Three gates met; desire dramatized in choice with contradictory cost (pain proves aliveness). Friction between want (to feel) and cost (suffering) is visible. Irreplaceable.</comment>
