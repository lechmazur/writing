<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The violinist remains a cipher throughout; her motivations are asserted ("She longs to unbind") rather than enacted through contradictory choices under pressure. Interiority consists of generic statements ("Her heart feels the weight of the unfinished") that could apply to any character. The final "smile" and understanding feel unearned—no prior causality forces this shift, and no visible cost forecloses a path. Embodied emotion and micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values are absent.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piece lacks a decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost. The "chronic hush" is declared weakened but no on-page action demonstrates this shift or its price. The violinist's ritual unfolds without obstacle or tightening; she collects wood, lights fire, plays violin, and decides to continue—a sequence without causal pressure or reversal. The orientation test passes (who/where/when anchored early), but the accumulative lens never crystallizes a felt cost at closure. The final paragraphs loop assertive future plans ("she will continue") without present stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The sunken greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks is vividly named and returns across beats, but it remains postcard description—no spatial constraint alters a choice. The driftwood is collected without friction, the fire simply "catches," and the shattered glass functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than a tactile problem. The mendicant's bowl sits near the fire but does not shape action. Sensory detail is present but ornamental, not purposeful.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("unbind the chronic hush") is signaled early but never tested. No obstacle complicates the ritual; the fire whispers, the violin plays, the hush weakens. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the protagonist's agency is assertion without cost. The final third shifts to future-tense plans ("She will share this ritual") that abandon present pressure entirely. Escalation is absent under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Beauty in the unfinished" and "chronic hush" are stated repeatedly but never emerge from concrete action. The final insight ("the story is never truly over") is delivered as philosophical summary rather than earned through specifics. The mendicant's bowl shifts from alms-holder to sound-vessel via declaration, not dramatized reweighting. Thematic echo in the final paragraphs ("magnificent simplicity," "unbinding the silence") replaces scene pressure with moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited, and the perceptual signature (acoustic focus) is consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("magnificent simplicity," "collective song," "testament to the power of listening") that reads as authorial rather than character-filtered. The voice lacks syntactic variety; many paragraphs open with "She [verb]" or "The [noun]," creating template cadence. No dialogue appears to test differentiation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn damage momentum: "chronic hush" appears eight times with minimal variation; "unfinished" recurs in adjacent lines without added meaning; "echo," "whisper," "silence," and "song" rotate mechanically. Template cadence dominates: "She [verb]" opens nine paragraphs, and "The [noun]" opens six more. Stock metaphors ("crack between silence and song," "thread that unbinds") and filter-verb stacks ("She feels," "She sees," "She imagines") dull immediacy in peak beats. The final third dissolves into summary ("she will continue," "they will gather") without propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise—lone musician performing ritual to heal post-apocalyptic silence—follows a familiar lyric-recovery template without transformation. The "echo-harbor violinist" and "sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks" are vivid labels, but the narrative treats them as atmospheric rather than causal. The unfinished-as-beauty theme is asserted rather than discovered through specific friction. No on-page choice or turn offers a non-obvious angle; the piece remains abstractly hopeful throughout.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The echo-harbor violinist is present throughout and performs the ritual, but her actions are observation and declaration rather than decision under constraint. She collects wood and plays violin without friction; no choice alters tactics or forecloses a path. Setup and payoff gates are met (she appears early and closes the story), but middle development lacks pressure. Ornamental use and swappability lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The mendicant's bowl appears in setup ("empty and waiting"), is placed near the fire mid-story, and returns at closure ("now brimming with the echo of flames"). Three distinct beats give it presence, but its function is passive container—it does not constrain choice or enable a tactic. The shift from alms-holder to sound-vessel is told rather than dramatized. Lyric reprise with modest reweighting places it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "chronic hush" is named early and returns frequently, but it functions as thematic backdrop rather than a force that narrows options. The violinist's ritual is said to "fracture" it, yet no on-page cost or tactical shift demonstrates this. Setup and payoff gates are met, but middle development is summary. The concept shapes atmosphere, not stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Acoustically perceptive" is mentioned in setup ("hearing the ghostly whispers") but never enables or constrains an action with visible cost. The trait is label-only; no scene tests her perception against a competing demand or environmental limit. Missing middle development and closure participation; ornamental mention.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Unbind" appears in the protagonist's stated goal and recurs in the closing image ("unbinding the silence one note at a time"), meeting setup and payoff gates. The ritual mid-story—lighting the fire, playing violin—arguably enacts "unbinding," giving it middle presence. However, the action is swappable with "heal" or "restore" without structural change, and no on-page cost or obstacle tests the attempt. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The family tradition of bonfire storytelling is remembered in setup, becomes the model for the violinist's solo ritual in the middle (collecting driftwood, arranging wood, lighting fire, telling tales), and returns in the final vision ("the story will be told again, around the bonfire"). All three gates are met. The method shapes her chosen tactic and charges the final image with memory, but the mechanics lack friction or cost. One solid causal beat and closure linkage place it in the upper 5s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks is named early, hosts all action, and returns in the closing vision. Setup, middle presence, and payoff gates are met. However, the setting remains scenic; no spatial constraint alters a choice, and the shipwrecks "sigh" and "hum" without causal role. Functional location, but could be replaced with "ruined cathedral" or "abandoned tower" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"After the rainforest burns" frames the opening and returns in the penultimate paragraph, meeting setup and payoff. The timeframe establishes post-catastrophe atmosphere but imposes no deadline or temporal pressure on the violinist's actions. She performs the ritual at her own pace with no clock. Missing middle development as a constraint; ornamental framing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"To find beauty in the unfinished" is stated as the violinist's longing in setup and returns in the closure insight ("beauty lives in the unfinished"). The ritual mid-story attempts to enact this, meeting all three gates. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting choices; no on-page friction tests her commitment or forces a trade-off. Functional presence without pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Magnificent simplicity" appears as a phrase late in the story but the tone—spare, lyric, hopeful—is established early and held across beats. The prose favors declarative sentences and restrained diction, modulating only slightly under the (low) pressure of the ritual. The tone supports the ending's quiet affirmation and reweights prior material through cadence rather than intensity. Coherent execution without dramatic modulation; solid mid-band fit.</comment>
