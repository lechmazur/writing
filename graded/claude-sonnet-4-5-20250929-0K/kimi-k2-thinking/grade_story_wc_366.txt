<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Caleb's interior is present but largely static: his reticence and observant warmth label rather than constrain on-page choices. The ghost's presence and the lamp's failure do not generate internal contradiction or embodied struggle—Caleb moves through prescribed actions (pick up glass, write note, relight lamp) without visible cost or foreclosed path. The motivation to "protect" is asserted more than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Emotional embodiment is thin: "luminescent ache" appears as a repeated phrase rather than a lived contradiction acting in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural (recurring images, pattern of cairn stones, glass-bottle motif). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration: Caleb reweights the lighthouse promise by bottling safety, relit lamp confirms the vow. Cost is conceptual (the promise preserved) but not deeply felt on the page—no live option is foreclosed, no visible price paid. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. One meaningful deepening occurs (lamp fails → Caleb acts → lamp relit), but the escalation is largely atmospheric rather than choice-driven under pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lantern room and cairn are established early and return at closure; the sea glass and bottle function as micro-setting that charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and mood-driven (salt crust, briny air, moss-covered rocks). However, spatial choreography is loose—cairn placement relative to the lighthouse is vague, and the ghost's "warmth" is atmospheric rather than constraining Caleb's moves. The setting supports tone more than it narrows choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (protect the lighthouse promise) is signaled early but remains abstract. The lamp's failure introduces complication, yet Caleb's response (collect glass, write note, relight wick) proceeds without visible trade-offs or foreclosed options. No reversal narrows his choices—each step is additive rather than costly. The ghost's presence hovers as atmosphere; it does not oppose or test Caleb's commitment. Escalation is tonal rather than causal, and the resolution (lamp relit, promise kept) arrives without felt sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme of fragile sanctuary and bottled safety emerges from recurring images (sea glass, bottle, lighthouse, cairn). The final image reweights the promise through the bottle's glow, but the note's explicit statement—"the feeling of safety, once bottled, never fades"—edges toward thematic summary. Luminescent ache recurs as a phrase rather than an earned resonance built from contradictory particulars. No on-page epiphany or hard-won insight; the ending restates the premise with gentle lyricism but minimal conceptual friction or non-obvious reprice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, lyric, and mood-driven with controlled diction ("warmly observant eye," "luminescent ache"). Distance is stable third-limited; no head-hopping. However, diction occasionally drifts into poetic abstraction ("quietly observing warmth," "fragment of the ocean's heart") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. The prose carries a textured rhythm, but Caleb's perceptual signature is generic—his way of noticing does not reveal character-specific bias beyond the label "reticent." No dialogue; internal voice is competent but not deeply individuated under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is solid, but the text carries noticeable scaffold and repetition. "Luminescent ache" appears five times across the story without evolving function—it becomes a refrain rather than a charged motif. Paraphrase loops: "the feeling of safety" recurs in similar constructions; "warmly observant" and "quietly observing warmth" echo without adding pressure. Template cadence in the cairn sequence: "He added… He placed… He stood back…" stacks identical stems. Figurative density ("smooth as a whisper," "fragment of the ocean's heart") in consecutive lines without causal payoff. Information density is low in several beats—description restates mood rather than advancing choice. Apply −0.8 for scaffold/loop patterns plus −0.3 for figurative muddle: cumulative −1.1 from a mid-6s base.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The haunted lighthouse, anonymous correspondence, and bottled emotions are familiar tropes executed competently but without fresh synthesis. The cairn-as-message system is specific, yet it functions as backdrop rather than transforming the core conflict. Caleb's arc (observe → act → preserve) follows a predictable path; no turn feels non-obvious in hindsight. Emotional particularity is thin—"luminescent ache" and "warmly observant" are elegant labels that could apply to many reticent guardians. The piece commits to its lyric premise but does not risk bold structural or perspectival choices that heighten stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Caleb is present throughout and his reticence is mentioned, but his choices (pick up glass, write note, relight lamp) are reactive rather than driving turns. His warmly observant trait is label-only; it does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost. Setup clear, middle choices functional but swappable, closure participation present (he relights the lamp). Two gates met; functional but replaceable. No strong causal pressure or irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sea glass appears in three distinct beats: found glowing in lantern room, placed in bottle, and its glow mingles with the ghost's warmth. It shapes the middle choice (bottling safety) and charges the final image. Setup, development, and closure participation all present. However, removing the glass and substituting another luminous object would not break story logic—its properties are atmospheric rather than uniquely necessary. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Anonymous letter chain is seeded early (ten years, cairn method) and returns at closure (new stone appears). It frames Caleb's motivation and the cairn ritual, shaping the bottling action. Setup and closure participation present; middle development is implicit (the chain sustains his purpose). However, the chain itself does not narrow options or generate friction on the page—it functions as backdrop rather than active stake. Two gates met; lyric reprise reweights meaning but causal pressure is modest.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Warmly observant appears as label in the opening and is mentioned once more ("quietly observing warmth" of the ghost). It does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost—Caleb's observation leads to prescribed steps without friction. Setup present, no middle constraint, no closure linkage. Ornamental trait; swappable with similar observant descriptors.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Protect is Caleb's stated motivation and drives the middle sequence (collect glass, write note, relight lamp). It appears in setup ("protect the fragile light") and closure ("protecting the same fragile light"). However, the action itself is generic—many lighthouse stories involve protection. No visible cost attached; removing "protect" and substituting "preserve" or "guard" would not alter story logic. Two gates met; functional across beats but moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Stacking stones as messages is introduced early ("method of stacking stones… his own invention") and used on-page at the cairn sequence. Caleb adds a flat stone as "signature move" and places the bottle. The method shapes his middle action and appears at closure (new stone reply). Setup, development, and closure participation present. However, the mechanics are not tested under pressure—any signaling method would serve the same function. Three gates met; solid beat involvement but moderate specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Haunted lantern room is named early and is the location for the glass discovery and lamp failure. The ghost's warmth recurs across beats and "seemed to follow him." Setup and closure participation present (ghost fades when promise kept). However, the haunting adds atmosphere without constraining Caleb's choices—he moves through the room without friction from the presence. Two gates met; setting pressures mood more than tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>After the lamp flickers out is the opening timeframe and anchors the story's urgency. The failure initiates the sequence, but the time window itself is vague—no clock tightens Caleb's decisions. He has leisure to write, descend, place the bottle, and return. Setup present, no middle tightening, closure participation indirect (lamp relit). One gate met strongly; time does not constrain tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>To bottle the feeling of safety is stated in the anonymous letters and enacted when Caleb places sea glass and note in the bottle. The motivation is told more than dramatized—Caleb's desire is asserted but not tested through conflicting wants or visible cost. Setup present (letters speak of safety), middle action (bottling), closure echo (bottle's glow). Two gates met; functional but friction between want and cost is thin.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Luminescent ache recurs five times across the story, establishing tone early and returning at closure ("luminescent ache, guarding both the sea and the secrets"). The phrase modulates with pressure (colder ache when lamp fails, settling into bones at cairn, full heart on descent). Setup, development, and closure participation all present. However, the repetition becomes mechanical—a tonal marker rather than a charged evolution. Three gates met; strong recurrence but moderate reweighting at the end.</comment>
