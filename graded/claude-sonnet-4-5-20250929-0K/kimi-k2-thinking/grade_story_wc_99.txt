<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's grief and search for understanding show embodied interiority through the compass handling and wire-wrapping practice. Her motivation evolves from raw severance pain to ritual acceptance across three seasons on-page. However, the final choice lacks sufficient on-page friction—the transformation to "rhythmically placid" teacher feels declared rather than tested against a competing impulse in the ending moment. Hideo remains observational without meaningful internal contradiction or cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when early (Mara, ferry, islet). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mara accepts that severance heals by "growing around the wound" and the compass now points to the juniper. However, the cost at closure is conceptual rather than viscerally on-page—we're told she spent three seasons learning patience but the final image shows settled acceptance without a visible price paid in that ending beat. The narrative jumps forward in time ("Years later") which diffuses the closure moment's immediacy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The islet, dock, courtyard, and conservatory are anchored with sensory economy (mist "like unspun silk," tide pools, cedar table). The compass, lace pattern, juniper, and pigment constrain Mara's wire-wrapping choice and charge the final image where the compass points to the tree. Micro-setting (the objects as tactile environment) successfully shapes ritual action. Light through lace revealing "hidden contours" provides a purposeful sensory moment that enables the teaching beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: understanding her sister's severance. The lace-guided wire-wrapping provides one meaningful deepening that narrows Mara's approach from wild compass-following to ritual patience. However, the escalation diffuses across "three seasons" in summary rather than tightening on-page. The ending reconfigures the stake (growth around wound vs. closure) but the cost is conceptual—no live option is foreclosed in the final image, just acceptance declared. Agency reads as endurance but the visible price in the ending beat is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of irrevocable loss transforming through ritual patience emerges through the lace technique, pigment color, and tree growth without direct statement. "The color of unspoken apologies...is not meant to be kept, but to diffuse into new growth" offers a resonant image-based answer. The compass shifting from wild spinning to steady pointing and Mara's voice becoming "rhythmically placid" show thematic transformation. However, "some severances heal not by closing, but by growing around the wound" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward overt thesis statement, slightly diluting the earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout. Perceptual signature is consistent (grief-colored noticing: "cerulean regret," sea-glass metaphors). Hideo's dialogue carries distinct rhythm ("cannot be forced; they must be diffused through ritual") but Mara's speech is absent, limiting voice distinction test. The time-compression across three seasons maintains narrative stance without head-hopping. Diction stays within contemplative register though "rhythmically placid" as descriptor appears repeatedly without varying the phrasing, creating minor template echo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("unspun silk," "ghost ship's compass," "spectral patterns," "lunar logic," "tide water") without clear pattern-teaching or payoff escalation at closure—the metaphoric register remains constant rather than modulating with pressure. "Rhythmically placid" appears three times with identical phrasing (template cadence). Paraphrase loop: "The tides of remembrance would continue...but now they would nourish instead of erode" restates the growth-around-wound concept without new pressure. These artifacts cluster but don't obscure the closure image, triggering −0.8 in this category per the patterned-artifact pack baseline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of bonsai technique, ghost compass, and color-of-apology is specific and memorable. However, the core arc—grief transformed through patient ritual instruction—follows a familiar template (wounded seeker, wise teacher, seasons of learning, acceptance). The lace-as-instruction and pigment-as-unspoken-emotion offer fresh inflections. Transformation test: the emotional arc could function with different crafts and objects without fundamental change to the grief-to-acceptance structure, indicating mid-band freshness rather than indispensable originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Hideo appears early (dock meeting), constrains middle action (teaches wire-wrapping via lace pattern, mixes pigment, explains color), and his instruction directly enables the closure (Mara becomes a slow-spoken tutor herself). His choices (producing the lace, showing the technique, placing compass beneath pot) create key turns. However, his own interiority and cost remain absent—he functions as catalyst rather than bearing visible stakes himself.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The compass appears in paragraph 2 (pocket, tugging), is placed on the table for study, grows cooler as Mara works, is buried beneath the juniper's pot, later points steadily to the tree, and hangs in the conservatory in the final image. It evolves from wild-spinning to settled, reweighting from severance-pointer to growth-anchor. Appears across at least five distinct beats and charges the ending. Cost connection: its "residual longing" is absorbed by the tree's growth.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The phrase "tides of remembrance" appears explicitly and the concept (cyclical return and retreat of memory) shapes Mara's realization that remembrance "would nourish instead of erode." It is signaled early ("cannot be forced; they must be diffused"), recurs at closure, and the final image (tide water moving through leaves) reprises it with reweighted meaning. However, it functions more as thematic lens than constraint on tactics—Mara's choices are shaped by the lace technique, not tidal mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Rhythmically placid" is applied to Hideo's voice (paragraph 4), his teaching patience (wire-wrapping), and Mara's eventual voice ("grown rhythmically placid with time"). It appears as descriptor rather than constraining action with cost—no on-page moment shows a tradeoff where placidity enables one choice and forecloses another. The trait signals character quality but does not drive a decision under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Diffuse" appears in Hideo's instruction ("must be diffused through ritual"), the technique that "diffused the tree's resistance," light diffusing through lace, pigment spreading on a leaf, color diffusing into new growth, and the tides "neither leaving entirely nor staying." It enables the wire-wrapping turn and charges the closure image. However, the action itself (spreading, distributing) could be replaced with "soften" or "transform" without breaking structure—its specificity matters but is not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lace pattern appears early (silk-wrapped bundle, paragraph 10), its mechanics matter (spirals show "where to bend the branch"), and Hideo demonstrates following its stitches to wrap wire in the key teaching beat. Light through lace reveals bark contours. Mara learns it "by heart" and it becomes a meditation. Present in setup, development (enables wire-wrapping), and thematically at closure (lace curtains in conservatory). The method's specificity (woven instructions) drives the technique beat.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The islet is named early ("breezy islet after rain," paragraph 2) and Mara stays there for three seasons. However, its breezy/rain qualities do not constrain choices—the courtyard, dock, and conservatory function as micro-settings but the islet itself remains atmospheric rather than tactical. The "after rain" detail appears only in the title phrase and does not recur to shape action. Present but replaceable with any quiet retreat location.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Three weeks after the severance" anchors the opening and "three seasons" of study structure the middle. "Years later" marks the final section. The timeframe signals urgency (severance is recent) and the passage of seasons shows transformation. However, time does not tighten decisions in individual beats—no clock pressures a choice. The severance as temporal anchor enables the quest but does not constrain tactics scene-by-scene.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Finding "the color of unspoken apologies" is stated explicitly as Mara's goal and drives her to the islet, through the teaching, and to the pigment-mixing beat where Hideo produces "the exact shade." Her trembling fingers tracing spirals and three seasons of learning show dramatized pursuit. The color appears in the ending (blue-green at juniper tips, moving through leaves). Friction between wanting resolution and accepting diffusion emerges on-page. Cost: she must let the color go rather than keep it.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Cerulean regret" appears in paragraph 14 ("colored every thought") and again in the final paragraph ("transformed into something that could live"). The blue-green pigment visually embodies the tone. Tone remains coherent (melancholy, contemplative) and modulates from raw grief to acceptance across the arc. However, "cerulean" as specific modifier appears only twice and does not charge the final image as strongly as the more general "blue-green" and "tide water" imagery. Present and consistent but not indispensable to the ending's resonance.</comment>
