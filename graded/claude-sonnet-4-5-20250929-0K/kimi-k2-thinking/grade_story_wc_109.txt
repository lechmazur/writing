<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The traveler and oracle remain generic vessels without contradictory impulses or embodied emotion. The traveler's motivation is declared ("seeking the pebble-shore oracle") but never tested on the page; he arrives, receives the map, and departs without a single micro-choice under pressure. The oracle's "mildly obsessed" trait is label-only, and her "task complete" satisfaction reads as summary rather than earned renunciation. No visible cost forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural by design, but the piece never deepens or tightens—it accumulates synonyms ("ambered hush," "marbled hush") without reweighting the stake. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. The ending offers no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing; the traveler "walked into the void" is told twice without visible cost or altered options. The closure unit is absent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The storm-tossed ridge fort, pebble shore, and narrow stair provide coherent spatial anchors. Sensory detail is selective ("cold stone walls," "wind screamed a hollow note") and the map's "surface cool as a tombstone" constrains the traveler's final choice to carry it against his heart. The fort's marbled hush charges the final image sufficiently to reach mid-6s, though the setting never limits tactics during the journey.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—navigating the endless night—is signaled early but never tested. The traveler faces no reversal, tightening, or forced trade-off; he requests the map, receives it, and departs. The oracle's work is summarized ("her task complete") rather than dramatized. No on-page cost alters tactics or forecloses a path; the map's "faint glow" is asserted, not earned through protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme—silence as language, map of quiet—emerges from recurring images (ambered hush, flaking gold leaf, pebble-shore whispers) rather than direct statement. The final image ("map flickered softly, a constellation of forgotten silences") reweights the premise modestly. However, the oracle's line "Thus the story was retold by summarizing silence" is explicit thematic echo in the final paragraph, triggering −0.6. The piece avoids moralizing elsewhere, lifting it to low-5s.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds stable throughout with no head-hopping. The perceptual signature ("flaking gold leaf," "ambered hush") recurs but does not shift under pressure. Diction is elevated and consistent, though recycled phrase stems ("ambered hush" appears six times, "marbled hush" four times) flatten rhythm. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains fixed; the narrator's voice is legible but lacks intensity modulation during the traveler's departure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "ambered hush" recurs six times with synonym variants ("marbled hush," "silence"), and "endless night" appears eight times without added pressure. Template cadence runs dominate ("The oracle… The traveler… The fort…" openings across 12 paragraphs). Filter-verb stacks ("felt the weight," "felt the hum") dull immediacy. Figurative language is dense but often mixed ("silence pressed like amber," "map a constellation of quiet"). Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering −1.7 and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The premise—oracle maps silence, traveler receives guide through darkness—reads as template mystical-quest. The "map of silence" concept offers mild freshness, and the flaking gold leaf booklet provides specific texture. However, the traveler's journey into "endless night" is generic, and the emotional arc (arrival, gift, departure) is entirely linear without reversal or non-obvious synthesis. The story does not transform the oracle-seeker trope beyond surface ornamentation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The pebble-shore oracle appears in four beats (chamber introduction, retelling, giving the map, final candlelit hum) but makes no choice that alters tactics. She "spoke softly, promising to retell" and later "nodded"—both passive. Her "task complete" is summary. The hum at the end charges the final image modestly, lifting the score above ornamental, but she does not constrain a live option or force a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The flaking gold leaf booklet appears in three beats (oracle's lap, "gold leaf fell like autumn dust," booklet closed and tucked into crevice). Its gold leaf "still flaking, still whispering" at the end reprises the image with slight reweighting. However, the booklet is never handled to alter a choice—it is described, closed, and stored. No cost is tied to its use; it remains atmospheric rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Ambered hush" appears six times as recurring image and metaphor ("hush had settled, thick and golden, preserving every echo"). It frames the oracle's explanation and the traveler's departure, but it does not shape a tactical choice on the page. The concept is present across beats and returns at closure ("ambered hush deepened, sealing the tale"), meeting the functional threshold but remaining thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Mildly obsessed" appears once as label ("Her eyes, mildly obsessed, traced the patterns of darkness") and again at the end ("her mild obsession had borne fruit"). No on-page action or visible tradeoff is tied to the trait. It is ornamental descriptor rather than constraint or enabler.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Retell" anchors the oracle's central action: "promising to retell the tale of the lost legion," "she would do so by summarizing silence," and the final line "Thus the story was retold by summarizing silence." The retelling shapes two beats (oracle's explanation of the battlefield hush, giving the map) and charges the closure. However, the act is summarized rather than dramatized; we are told she reweights silence, not shown a specific turn or cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"By summarizing silence" is signaled early ("she would do so by summarizing silence") and reprised at closure ("Thus the story was retold by summarizing silence"). The method constrains the oracle's approach—she uses gold leaf pages holding "a silence, pressed like amber"—but its mechanics do not alter the traveler's tactics. It shapes atmosphere more than choice, landing mid-5s for purposeful setup and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The storm-tossed ridge fort appears in opening, mid-story ("fort behind him stood as a silent sentinel"), and closing images. It provides spatial coherence and the narrow stair guides the traveler to the oracle. The fort's "marbled hush" charges the final image. However, it does not constrain a tactical choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it functions as evocative backdrop.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"When only one star remains in a dimming sky" opens the piece and closes it ("when only one star remains, the story will be told again"). The single star "flickered, a dying ember" and later "vanished, leaving only darkness." Time is present as lyric marker but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; no clock pressure shapes the traveler's moves. The reprise reweights the frame modestly.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The traveler's desire "to draw a map of an endless night" is implied when he seeks the oracle and realized when he receives the parchment. The motivation is functional but never conflicted or tested; he asks, she gives, he departs. No friction between want and cost appears on the page. The map's purpose is told ("would guide him through the coming dark") rather than dramatized through a micro-choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Marbled hush" appears four times and "ambered hush" six; together they establish a coherent tonal texture across the fort, the oracle's chamber, and the traveler's departure. Tone does not modulate with pressure—it remains static and elevated throughout. The final image ("marbled hush held the memory of her words") reprises the tone to charge closure modestly, lifting the score to mid-5s.</comment>
