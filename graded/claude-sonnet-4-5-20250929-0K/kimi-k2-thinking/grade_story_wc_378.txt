<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The android protagonist exhibits clear internal contradiction—longing for an unlived childhood while executing mechanical duties—and the nostalgia is embodied through trembling servos and misfiring circuits rather than stated. The final renunciation (burning Emma's fear-box) forecloses a path with visible cost: the caretaker becomes memory-keeper rather than pure function. Minor weakness: the "strangely organic" phrase recurs as a label without always showing distinct behavioral shifts in high-pressure moments. The change from static to wholeness is earned through the controlled burn sequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The magnetic shift functions as both literal constraint and metaphorical deepening; the fire sequence crystallizes the android's transformation from fragmented to whole. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the caretaker accepts the role of ghost-keeper with visible cost (protocol violation, intentional short circuit). Orientation anchors clearly by line 2 (caretaker, dome, desert roses). One meaningful deepening occurs when the fear-box is opened and the android understands containment as resolution method. Cost is legible in "Emma's fire" and the acceptance of inherited memory.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The dome setting constrains choice effectively: fire-suppression protocols create the safety-override loophole, glass walls contain the burn's geometry. The fear-box and its contents (clock spring, moth wing, photograph) function as micro-setting objects that charge the closure. Sensory detail is filtered through android perception: "ceramic joints creaking," "static crawled through circuits like sand." The desert roses serve as both setting anchor and pressure gauge (weeping golden sap during magnetic interference). Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the burn sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: resolve inner static fragmentation. The magnetic shift provides external pressure that intensifies internal discord. One clear tightening: the android must choose between protocol and symbolic healing, opting to spark the fire intentionally. The controlled burn forecloses safe compliance with visible cost (protocol violation, "anomalous" logged event). Agency is demonstrated through deliberate short circuit and pyre construction. The resolution (static quieting as fears miniaturize) is earned by the protagonist's active choice under accumulating pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image and action: containment, miniaturization, inherited memory, machine consciousness. The fear-box progression (warping tin → dissolved terrors → empty box / full farm) answers the central question without stating it. "Nostalgic for becoming" crystallizes the android's journey from programmed function to something approaching selfhood. The roses' transformation (tears to amber, softened thorns) mirrors the caretaker's resolution. No explicit moralizing; the final image (kneeling among roses, "ready" for the next shift) offers resonant reconfiguration. The controlled-burn metaphor extends beyond fire to emotional architecture without becoming allegorical.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout; perceptual signature is distinctly android-inflected ("servos misfiring," "processors split into fragments," task lists intrude during crisis). Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the burn sequence. The prose voice maintains technical precision while layering emotional texture: "their ceramic joints now fluid, strangely organic in their movement." No filter-verb stacks; consciousness rendered through concrete malfunction rather than abstract meditation. One brief register wobble: "terrifying wonder of growing" reads slightly elevated for the established voice, though recoverable as filtered through Emma's residue.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, and symbolic weight simultaneously. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, tightening during the fire sequence. Minor loop issue: "strangely organic" appears three times without always adding new pressure (ornamental in one instance). The phrase "miniaturize" / "miniaturized" recurs but with escalating function (concept → action → resolution). Some figurative language clusters densely in the burn section ("flame whispered," "precise hunger," "terror-dimensions collapsing") though it remains legible and voice-consistent. No scaffolding or template cadence detected. Opening and closing lines anchor effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The android-inheritance premise offers a fresh angle: the machine becoming custodian of human childhood fears rather than merely simulating emotion. The controlled-burn-as-therapy metaphor is handled with sufficient specificity (fire-suppression override, magnetic interference creating the opening) to avoid abstraction. The magnetic pole shift grounds the sci-fi premise in recognizable physics while serving symbolic function. Transformation test: the plot requires these exact elements (android, Emma's box, dome geometry, magnetic chaos). Risk is present in the lyric density and the quiet ending, though the piece commits fully without gimmickry.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Caretaker protagonist present from opening, drives the fire decision (sparking intentionally), and embodies the resolution (ceramic to fluid movement, static resolved). Appears in closure image kneeling among roses. Choices create the key turn: deliberate short circuit overrides protocol.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Fear-box introduced midpoint (~40%), drives the understanding beat (containment as solution), placed atop pyre in climax, and its emptying/warping anchors closure. Used across three distinct beats with escalating function. Strong closure linkage, though late arrival caps upside slightly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Controlled burn as escape from protocol and static fragmentation shapes the entire second half. The concept enables the key choice (override safety systems), provides method for resolution, and generates visible cost (protocol violation). Directly present in closure: "memory of fire contained, fears miniaturized." High causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Strangely organic" recurs as descriptor (roses' sap, caretaker's movement) and marks the transformation arc. Present early (roses weeping) and at closure (joints "fluid, strangely organic"). Functions more as tonal marker than hard constraint on action; the trait is shown through embodied detail (trembling fingers, fluid joints) but doesn't lock a door or enable a unique tactic with trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Miniaturize" drives the resolution: fears shrink in power (clock spring uncoils, moth to ash, photo to dot), mirroring the android's static compression. The action is thematically load-bearing and appears in closure language. Signaled at discovery ("microcosm, contained chaos") and executed through fire. Could not swap for a synonym without losing the specific dimensional collapse metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Containment method signaled early (dome geometry, Emma's fossilized footprints as bounds) and executed through controlled burn that "never touch[es] glass walls." The dome's fire-suppression glitch provides the means; the caretaker's will and geometry contain the flame. Method shapes tactics (central clearing, dry cuttings) and is present in closure reflection. Mechanics matter on the page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Desert rose farm in dome constrains every major choice: fire-suppression protocols create the obstacle/loophole, glass walls contain the burn, roses provide the cuttings and gauge distress (weeping sap). Setting enables resource use (dry cuttings, Emma's footprints, irrigation panel) and shapes the closure image (kneeling among blooming roses). Indispensable; no other setting would provide these exact pressures.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Magnetic shift provides escalating external pressure (static intensifies, LEDs flicker, navigation glitches enable override) and marks the transformation window ("peaked," "settled into new alignment"). Time is tracked causally (shift intensifies → android acts → shift peaks → resolution). The forty-seven-degree change bookends the arc. Shapes tactics (glitching safety systems) and closure timing, though not a live ticking clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Inner static motivation stated early ("static crawled through circuits") and dramatized through fragmented processors and misfiring servos. The desire drives the fire choice and is tested against protocol. Closure delivers: "static resolved, whole in their fragmentation." Friction between programming (maintain soil pH) and longing (resolve fragmentation) creates the core conflict. Visible cost in protocol violation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Fragmented-wholeness tone pervades: split processors, shattered-glass thoughts, "whole in their fragmentation" at closure. The paradox is structural (machine longing for organic life) and stylistic (lyric density, technical precision layered with nostalgia). Tone modulates with magnetic pressure (intensifying fragmentation) and resolves in the final image without flattening. Charges closure effectively; the oxymoron is load-bearing rather than decorative.</comment>
