<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The ghost's motivation (encore, recognition) is clear but operates almost entirely through told interiority and symbolic gesture rather than embodied micro-choices under pressure. The actress appears only in summary ("her heart heavy with despair," "ready to claim the stage once more") without on-page contradiction or friction that would make her transformation feel earned. The synesthetic gift is labeled repeatedly but never constrains a choice or forces a visible trade-off. Internal conflict is absent; the ghost simply executes his plan without obstacle or cost to himself, and the actress's shift from despair to readiness happens off-stage.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes a loose Accumulative/Textural lens (ghost drifts through spaces, memories accumulate, final image reweights the opening longing), and closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration: the ghost's solitary encore becomes "a shared anthem." However, cost is not legible on the page—the ghost smiles, purpose fulfilled, without forfeiture or visible loss, and the actress's transformation is summarized rather than dramatized. Orientation is present but delayed: who/where/when coalesce only after the hedge-maze reveal (~15% in). The fractured-timeline mechanics are declared but never constrain a choice or narrow options; echoes are produced, colors swirl, and the result simply happens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and layered (theater, backstage, hedge maze, orchard) with strong sensory specificity (petals that "chimed like glass bells," fruit glowing "like soft lanterns"). The orchard functions as more than backdrop: it houses the tarot coin toss and frames the final gesture. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—doors open without resistance, the maze is traversed without navigation, and the garden "folds back" without consequence. Spatial choreography is clear within each location, but the sequence of spaces feels more like a tour than a crucible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—offering the actress a glimpse of possibility to prevent her giving up—is signaled early and coherent. Yet escalation is minimal: the ghost senses, drifts, carries, raises, flicks, and succeeds without obstacle, reversal, or cost. No live option is foreclosed; the tarot coin and echo-producing work as intended on first attempt. The actress's transformation from "brink of despair" to "voice steady" happens in summary, robbing the moment of felt pressure. Under an Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is required; here the synesthetic storm and memory-merge gesture toward it, but the absence of on-page resistance or visible price keeps the tightening abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—encore as continuity, shared legacy, possibility rescued from despair—emerges through image and action (ghost's final bow merging with the actress's rehearsal, the orchard as secret promise). The closing lines attempt resonance: "shared anthem," "rising nostalgia that healed." However, the thematic answer remains largely asserted rather than dramatized; the actress "would carry his echo" is told, not shown through a micro-choice or embodied realization. The fractured-timeline motif recurs but functions as atmosphere rather than a constraint that forces a non-obvious thematic calculus. No overt moralizing, but the ending leans toward summary statement rather than image-driven implication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV anchored to the ghost is maintained throughout with no head-hopping. Voice is consistent, leaning lyric/elevated ("synesthetic shimmer," "luminous path," "tapestry of colors"), and the diction matches the ghostly, theatrical milieu. Psychic distance is stable. However, the prose sometimes drifts into explanatory mode ("He knew that the timeline had splintered," "She would never know the ghost's name") that flattens immediacy. Free indirect style is clean when present. No dialogue on the page, so naturalism and subtext bullets do not apply. Perceptual signature (sound-to-color) is declared but not deeply inhabited through micro-choices or stress-driven shifts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and paragraph structure breathes appropriately. Several strong images ("petals that chimed like glass bells," "moments like shards of a broken mirror") anchor the lyric texture. However, paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear: "fractured timeline" is restated in three adjacent paragraphs without added detail; "echoes" recurs in template cadence ("produce echoes," "producing echoes," "echoes of a thousand past ovations," "nostalgic echo," "final echo"). Filter-verb stacks cluster in the middle third ("He saw her teetering," "He wanted to lure," "She felt a sudden warmth"). Some sentences do double duty, but others rehash: the timeline-shard conceit is told twice in successive paragraphs. Momentum slows in the expository center before the coin toss.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—ghost uses synesthesia and a tarot coin to inspire a struggling actress across a fractured timeline—combines several fantastical elements into a single gesture. The orchard-within-maze and sound-as-color offer texture. However, the emotional arc (despair → inspiration via ghostly intervention) follows a familiar template, and the specific synthesis does not feel inevitable in hindsight; swap "tarot coin" for another mystical object or "fractured timeline" for "echoes of the past" and the beats function identically. The hedge maze, synesthesia, and timeline mechanics are present but ornamental rather than driving unique turns. No proximity echoes of famous lines, but the piece reads more as a competent assembly of prompt elements than a bold, risk-taking vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The ghost is present throughout and his goal (to offer his encore, to lure possibility) drives the sequence. He makes two key decisions: entering the orchard and flicking the coin. However, both choices occur without friction or visible cost to him—he drifts, carries, raises, flicks, watches, smiles. The actress's transformation is the story's hinge, but it happens to her rather than through her agency. The ghost observes and enables but does not face a dilemma or pay a price that would elevate his role to indispensable. Present in all three integration gates (setup, middle action, closure smile) and shapes two beats (entry, coin toss), but replaceable with another benevolent spirit.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The tarot coin is introduced early ("He carried a hand-painted tarot coin"), described with specificity ("painted face shimmered with shifting symbols"), and reappears in the climactic gesture ("raised the tarot coin… flicked it into air"). It participates in the key beat (producing echoes that reach the actress) and returns in the final paragraph ("clinked softly… winking out"). However, its unique properties (painted symbols, shifting facets of fractured timeline) are declared but never constrain a choice or enable a tactic that another object could not. The coin could be swapped for a locket or bell with minor edits. Two-beat involvement and closure participation earn mid-band score, but swappability and ornamental specificity cap higher range.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The fractured timeline is seeded early ("the timeline had splintered the night he died"), reiterated in the middle ("fractured timeline," "echoes that could be harnessed"), and mentioned twice at closure ("across the fractured timeline," "the fractured timeline mending just a little"). However, it functions as atmosphere and explanation rather than a constraint that alters tactics or choices on the page. The ghost's actions (clapping, flicking the coin) would work identically in a non-fractured reality; the timeline's fracture does not create obstacles, narrow options, or impose cost. Present in all three gates but ornamental, earning functional-but-replaceable range.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Synesthesia is introduced early ("synesthetic shimmer," "synesthetically blessed perception turned sound into color") and recurs ("synesthetic gift allowed him to hear the echoes as a tapestry of colors," "synesthetic symphony"). It colors the ghost's perception throughout and is involved in the key beat (colors swirling around the actress). However, the trait is label-only; it does not constrain a choice, force a trade-off, or enable a tactic unavailable to a non-synesthetic character. The ghost could "sense" or "feel" echoes without color translation and all beats function identically. Present in setup and middle, touches closure description, but ornamental use and swappability keep score low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Intertwine" appears explicitly in one sentence: "The ripples intertwine past and present, weaving his final bow with a young actress's hesitant rehearsal." It describes the story's central gesture—merging the ghost's memory with the actress's moment—and is echoed conceptually in "intertwined with her own." The action is present at the key turn and charges the ending ("shared anthem across the fractured timeline"). However, the action could be replaced with "merge," "blend," or "fuse" with no structural change. Present in middle and shaping closure, but near-synonym swappability and single explicit mention limit score to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The method is introduced in the middle section: "He began to produce echoes by clapping his ghostly hands" and "producing echoes that resonated through the orchard." The coin's hum also "produc[es] echoes." The mechanics matter: echoes are the vehicle for reaching the actress and charging her moment. The method is used in two beats (clapping, coin toss) and shapes the ending ("final echo faded," "she would carry his echo"). However, the mechanics are asserted rather than earned through trial or constraint; echoes work on first attempt without cost or refinement. Present in middle and closure, drives key beat, but lacks friction or irreplaceability (could be "sending visions" or "channeling memory").</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The orchard is introduced early ("At its heart lay a mystic orchard garden concealed within a hedge maze"), described with vivid detail (moonlight, glowing fruit, chiming petals), and houses the climactic coin toss. It is present in setup, middle action, and closure ("the garden folded back into the maze," "the orchard waited"). However, the orchard does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that affects outcome—any secluded, atmospheric space would serve identically. The fruit glows "brighter" at the moment of success but does not enable or resist the ghost's action. Vivid, present across all gates, but functionally ornamental and easily replaceable with a clearing, chapel, or rooftop.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The timeframe is anchored in the opening sentence ("After the theater's final curtain fell") and recurs ("after the business closed" appears twice, including the penultimate paragraph). It signals the liminal, secret window when the ghost and orchard are accessible. However, time does not tighten decisions or alter tactics—there is no ticking clock, no risk of discovery, no urgency imposed by dawn or audience return. The timeframe sets mood but does not shape choices or escalate pressure. Present in setup and closure as frame, but vague and untracked in the middle, earning low functional score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The motivation is stated explicitly in the middle: "He wanted to lure possibility from the brink of despair, to offer her a glimpse of the fire that still burned in the dark." It drives the ghost's actions (entering the orchard, flicking the coin) and is fulfilled at closure ("possibility could always be lured back from the brink"). The desire is coherent and shapes the sequence. However, it is told rather than dramatized through friction or conflicting wants—the ghost pursues his goal without obstacle, cost, or internal tension. Present in setup (implied by "encore-seeking"), middle (stated), and closure (fulfilled), but the absence of on-page conflict or visible price limits score to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Tone is signaled early ("restless hunger," "luminous path," "whispered legends") and modulates through the sequence: longing in the opening, atmospheric wonder in the orchard, warmth and fulfillment at closure ("rising nostalgia that healed"). The final image ("shared anthem… rising nostalgia") directly enacts the tonal directive. Tone is coherent through turns and charges the ending. However, "rising" is more asserted than earned—the nostalgia is present throughout rather than building through escalation, and the shift from solitary longing to shared anthem happens in summary. Present across all gates, participates in closure image, but the modulation is smoother than the "rising" label promises, capping score in upper-mid band.</comment>
