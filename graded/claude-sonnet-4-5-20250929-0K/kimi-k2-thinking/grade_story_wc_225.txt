<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The tutor's guilt is clearly established and his arc from exile to redemption is legible, but interiority remains abstract—"fierce repose," "quiet storm"—rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final acceptance of the girl's pawn earns some change, but the decision feels inevitable rather than torn. Diagnostic label-speak ("forgiveness was not a single act but a continuous winnowing of guilt") in the final third lowers the score. The character reads as a vehicle for theme rather than a mind under genuine pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (exiled tutor, village square, tapestry) arrive early. The causal spine—decode threads, find key, break stasis—holds, and the village's release is on-page. However, the closure lacks felt cost: the tutor lifts the key and time flows with no visible trade-off or foreclosed path. The girl's arrival offers a Charged Poise moment (teach again vs. refuse), but the choice is not dramatized; he simply accepts. The lens reads Causal, but the final image reconfigures theme more than options, suggesting Hybrid without clear dominance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The time-frozen village, platinum tapestry, and cobblestone square are vividly anchored. Sensory detail—"threads shimmered like platinum," "breaths misting in the suddenly crisp air"—grounds key beats. The tapestry constrains the tutor's method and charges the climax. Spatial choreography is clear. However, the setting does not pressure a difficult choice; the tutor's work is uninterrupted, and the village functions more as backdrop than crucible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—break the village's stasis and achieve self-forgiveness—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the tutor realizes the verse ("When the king's sacrifice is accepted") and resumes with renewed purpose. Yet the escalation is internal and told rather than shown through a forced trade-off. The key's discovery and the village's release arrive without visible cost or narrowed options. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does protagonist agency under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—forgiveness as iterative winnowing rather than single act—emerges through the tapestry metaphor and the tutor's task. The wooden pawn reprise and the girl's request create resonance. However, the final paragraph states the theme overtly: "forgiveness was not a single act but a continuous winnowing of guilt," reducing subtext to thesis. The ending image (dawn, peace, "fierce repose of a new day") gestures toward earned wisdom but feels summarized rather than enacted. Strong potential undercut by explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. The tutor's perceptual signature—chess-trained fingers, reading threads as "cryptic notation"—is legible. Diction elevates at times ("fierce repose," "woven hush," "temporal stasis") in ways that feel ornamental rather than voice-rooted. The girl's single line of dialogue is brief and functional. Psychic distance is consistent, but the prose occasionally drifts into essay register ("forgiveness was not a single act") that undercuts immersion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Clarity is generally high, but scaffold and paraphrase loops appear: "He realized that each loose thread...," followed by "By decoding the frayed threads..." restates method without added pressure. "Fierce repose" recurs four times, mostly as label. Stock metaphors—"stubborn shadow," "heavy shroud," "river after a broken dam"—stack without fresh angle. The final paragraph over-explains theme ("forgiveness was not a single act..."). Template cadence in places: "He [verb], [noun phrase]" appears in adjacent beats. Deductions total approximately −1.2 for loops, stock phrasing, and thematic summary in the closure third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The premise—chess tutor redeems himself by solving a magical puzzle—combines familiar redemption-arc and frozen-village tropes without a fresh synthesis. The tapestry-as-chessboard conceit is present but not deeply explored; decoding threads mirrors teaching games only in metaphor. Emotional specificity is low; guilt and hope remain generic. The transformation test fails: swap chess for music, tapestry for sheet music, and the arc holds unchanged. No bold risk elevates the material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Present early; his chess expertise enables decoding. He makes one key decision—resume work after the verse—but the choice is not forced by opposition or trade-off. The final acceptance of the pawn is more thematic echo than causal turn. Two gates (setup, closure participation) met, but middle development is passive. Swappable with "exiled scholar" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup by first third; tapestry is handled and decoded across multiple beats. Its properties (frayed threads, hidden verse, inner chamber) drive the central task. Returns in the final image ("platinum labyrinth...dissolved into a gentle glow") with reweighted meaning. All three gates met. Closure linkage is present but the object's role becomes ornamental after the key is lifted. Strong but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The phrase "woven hush" appears twice as atmospheric descriptor ("woven hush draped over the cobblestones"). It echoes theme (silence, stasis) but does not constrain on-page choices or alter tactics. Functions as motif without mechanical pressure. Ornamental use; setup and closure reprise earn mid-low band, but no development beat.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Signaled early: "fingers...began to fidget productively, tracing the frayed border." The trait enables the decoding action and appears again ("resumed his task, winnowing the threads"). Two beats, causally relevant. However, "productively" is label-only; no visible cost or trade-off tied to fidgeting. Functional but the specific attribute could be replaced with "worked methodically" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Winnowing threads is the central method across multiple beats: tracing border, discarding errors, plucking fibers. The process reveals the verse and the key's location. Present at closure as metaphor ("continuous winnowing of guilt"). All three gates met. Causal role is clear, but the action itself is generic—selection/elimination—easily swappable with "sorted," "chose," or "filtered." Strong integration but moderate specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setup early: "decoding the frayed threads in the tapestry's border" is both stated and enacted. The method shapes the middle sequence (mapping openings, discarding threads). Mechanics matter—each thread represents a move—and the method yields the verse and key. All three gates. However, the exact process is abstract; we see results (verse emerges) without close dramatization of how one thread differs from another. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Time-frozen village is setup immediately and pressures the entire task: breaking stasis is the dominant stake. The village's state constrains the tutor's options (no one can help) and supplies the puzzle (tapestry in the square). At closure, the village's release—people stirring, breathing—demonstrates success and charges the final image. All three gates strongly met. Essential to logic and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Distant thunder is mentioned in the opening and twice during the middle ("lull of distant thunder grew more pronounced," "synchronized with the beat of his own heart"). It fades at the end. Setup and closure participation present, but the timeframe does not constrain decisions or create urgency; the tutor works uninterrupted. Functions as atmosphere, not a live clock. Two gates, ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Self-forgiveness is setup in paragraph two (guilt "clung to his conscience") and drives the task: "he would not let another soul be lost." The hidden verse about sacrifice resonates with his past. At closure, teaching the girl enacts the desire, and the final line states he "finally forgave himself." All three gates met with causal pressure and visible cost (accepting the pawn, risking repeat failure). Strong integration; removing this motivation would hollow the arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Fierce repose" appears four times: as noun phrase in paragraph fourteen, again in paragraph twenty-one, and twice at closure ("quiet storm of fierce repose," "fierce repose of a new day"). The tone of calm resolve amid pressure is present and modulates with the tutor's emotional state. Setup and closure reprise are clear, but middle presence is mostly label. Lyric resonance partially redeems, but the phrase functions more as thematic tag than lived tonal texture.</comment>
