<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is established early and his choices shape the arc, but much agency occurs off-page across the six-week span. The grandmother's ghost provides external guidance rather than internal contradiction driving choices. Interiority leans poetic but occasionally drifts toward abstraction ("that thundering calm") without embodied sensation. The final choice to carve a spiral is dramatized, but the weeks of retracing lack moment-to-moment pressure that would force micro-decisions with visible trade-offs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors quickly (Kael, greenhouse, monarchs arriving). The piece accumulates through repeated evening walks and ribbon-reading to reach a conceptual repricing: the spiral form as collective grief's shape. However, the six-week ellipsis compresses all escalation into summary, and the cost—time, isolation, uncertainty—remains asserted rather than dramatized beat-by-beat. Closure lands with the finished stone and villagers' recognition, but the decisive moment (chiseling the spiral) lacks on-page resistance or surprise that would mark a true turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse is vivid and purposeful: glass corridors, corpse flower, orchid leaves with stone dust, monarchs bending light. Spatial choreography is clean across evening visits. The setting constrains Kael's search by creating a ritual space distinct from the village, and the monarchs' departure signals closure. Time of day (dusk) and seasonal migration frame pressure. The greenhouse functions as micro-setting that charges the final image when Kael traces empty flight paths, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: discovering the shape of collective grief for the memorial stone. The six-week migration provides a frame, but pressure remains diffuse—Kael retraces paths, reads ribbons, watches butterflies, without a single moment where failure or discovery feels imminent. The grandmother's mentorship offers guidance without opposition. The spiral solution arrives as insight rather than hard-won choice with visible cost. One tightening occurs (final night, "not in the stone but in the spaces between"), but it reads as revelation rather than a choice that forecloses another path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—grief as woven, spiral, communal—emerges through concrete images: ribbons, butterflies, the corpse flower, the spiral carving. The story resists easy moral and allows ambiguity (what poems matter, how grief holds). The final image of villagers touching the stone offers a resonant answer without stating it. Minor slip: "grief, like the butterflies, always finds its way home" edges toward thematic summary in the final line, though it remains image-anchored.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Kael. Perceptual signature is consistent—stone dust, glass, stitched verses—and voice modulates appropriately from work detail to meditative ritual. Dialogue with the ghost is sparse and purposeful. Minor register drift: "topography of communal mourning" and "spectral mentorship" feel slightly elevated for a gravestone carver's interior lexicon, though they could pass as free indirect reflection. No head-hopping; distance control is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and clarity is generally high, but several lines loop or paraphrase without advancing: "The greenhouse at dusk became his workshop, where stone dust settled on orchid leaves and chisels rang against silence" closely echoes prior greenhouse description; "the woven ribbon roll" appears as a repeated phrase across multiple paragraphs without functional variation. Template cadence appears in the list-like summary of ribbon discoveries ("Dickinson's hope, Neruda's sorrow"). Figurative language is controlled, though "thundering calm" recurs without clear payoff. No major artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of gravestone carving, spectral mentorship, butterfly migration, and woven poetry ribbons feels specific and non-obvious. The story transforms the mentor-ghost trope through the tactile work of ribbon-reading and stone-carving. Emotional specificity—collective grief rendered as spiral text—avoids generic templates. The risk of a quiet, accumulative structure succeeds in building resonance. Minor predictability: the mentor's final wisdom ("not in the stone but in the spaces between") arrives on cue at migration's end.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael's occupation frames the story and his choices (unrolling ribbons, retracing paths, chiseling the spiral) drive key beats. The role enables access to the commission and the greenhouse. However, much decision-making occurs off-page across six weeks, limiting on-page agency. Present in setup, middle retracing, and closure carving—meets all three gates. Causal pressure is moderate; the spiral choice feels like discovery rather than a hard trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The ribbon roll appears early (grandmother points to it), is unrolled and read in the middle (discovering repeated poems), and its content directly shapes the spiral carving at closure. Handled in at least three beats. The verses become the inscription, so it drives the ending. However, the ribbon itself is not physically present in the final stone-placing scene—only its content is referenced. Swappability: another record form (journal, wall inscriptions) could serve with minor edits, but the woven/threaded metaphor aligns strongly with the grief-as-woven theme.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Spectral mentorship is on the page: the grandmother's ghost appears on the third evening, guides Kael through the greenhouse, and delivers the key insight on the final night. The concept constrains Kael's method (following her path, reading ribbons her way) and enables the closure breakthrough. Present across setup, development, and payoff. However, the ghost mostly advises rather than creating friction or cost—Kael never struggles against her guidance or pays a price for the mentorship beyond time spent.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Fiercely meditative" is mentioned twice: at opening ("at dusk he became fiercely meditative") and near the end ("his fingers moving fiercely meditative through the air"). Both instances describe rather than dramatize—no scene shows the trait constraining a choice or enabling a breakthrough with cost. The descriptor colors tone but remains ornamental. Introduced early but never tested under pressure. Missing middle development and closure participation; fails two gates.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Retrace" structures the entire middle: Kael retraces his grandmother's path each evening for six weeks, discovering ribbon patterns. The action is specific (not "study" or "follow") and irreplaceable—the spiral form he discovers depends on repeated retracing that maps memory. Present in setup (first path), development (each evening loop), and closure (final empty flight paths). The action enables the breakthrough and charges the ending image. Causal pressure is strong, though the week-by-week repetition is summarized rather than shown beat-by-beat.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The custom is introduced early (paragraph 6–7), its mechanics explained (trade poems at dinner, weave into ribbon), and it supplies the material for the spiral carving. Kael continues it with his daughter, and the villagers recognize "fragments of their own dinner-table poems" on the stone. Present across all three gates. However, we never see a dinner-table scene where the trading occurs under pressure or with conflict—only the archived result (ribbons) and one brief continuation moment. The method shapes the ending but does not constrain middle choices or create visible friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ancient greenhouse at dusk is essential: Kael works there daily, the glass corridors and potting bench supply the ribbon's hiding place, the corpse flower marks a teaching moment, the monarchs cluster on glass. Time of day (dusk) is consistent and charges atmosphere. The setting enables the ritual retracing and provides spatial structure for the mentorship. Present in every section and central to the final image (empty flight paths, "silence so complete it felt like stone"). Without this exact location, the story's logic collapses. Specificity is high; another setting could not duplicate the glass, butterflies, and orchids convergence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The butterfly migration timeframe is signaled early and brackets the entire arc: monarchs arrive in paragraph 1, stay six weeks, depart at closure. The span allows repeated retracing and discovery. The "final night of the migration" triggers the grandmother's key insight. However, within the six weeks, time is vague—no day-by-day pressure or ticking clock that alters tactics. The timeframe frames rather than tightens; Kael's pace is contemplative, not urgent. Present in setup, development (six weeks noted), and payoff (departure), but does not constrain middle choices with deadlines or costs.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Kael's desire to discover collective grief's shape is stated early ("He wanted to discover the shape of collective grief") and drives his retracing and ribbon-reading. The motivation is tested through repeated attempts and culminates in the spiral form. On the page in setup (commission and desire), middle (searching), and closure (carving). However, the desire is told more than shown through conflicted choices—Kael never faces a moment where personal grief or doubt nearly derails the search, so friction between want and cost is muted. The motivation reads sincere but not agonized.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Thundering calm" appears twice: describing collective grief and the silence after monarchs depart. The phrase is specific and apt for the story's meditative texture. Tone is coherent—lyric, contemplative, elegiac—and modulates subtly (stone-carving detail, ghost dialogue, final quiet resonance). The tone charges the final image: "silence so complete it felt like stone." However, the phrase itself is not woven through enough beats to earn higher; it bookends rather than accumulating pressure. Coherent and purposeful, but not indispensable to the story's tonal architecture.</comment>
