<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and her goal to find resilience is signaled early. However, interiority remains thin—her emotional processing during the flight feels more narrated than embodied, and the leap to understanding "grow through dying, not around it" is stated rather than earned through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. The grandmother's arrow tip functions as a prop that pulses and guides, but Kael's internal conflict about risk, family duty, or the cost of discovery never materializes on the page with felt ambivalence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Kael launches, navigates through arches, encounters the seed cyclone, touches the key seed, and returns with new understanding. Orientation is clear by ~100 words. The closure is a Conceptual Repricing—Kael will plant the seed and teach workers to embrace die-off as part of resilience—but the cost is conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page. The final image of planting tomorrow and teaching backward growth is resonant, yet the price Kael pays (risk taken, old methods abandoned) is implied rather than dramatized in a visible forfeiture or renunciation beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The floating-arch planet, gravity inversion, and irrigation streams detaching into silver ribbons create a vivid, purposeful setting. Sensory detail is selective: temperature drop at the threshold, whirling silence as centrifuged sound, and the seed cyclone inside the arch. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout the glider flight. The arrow tip and seed function as micro-setting elements that constrain Kael's final choice—she must touch the scarred seed to access the archive—elevating the score into the 7+ band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the source of orchard resilience—is signaled immediately and drives the sequence. Kael's launch, navigation, and discovery form a single escalating arc under the Accumulative lens. However, the stakes never tighten into a trade-off or dilemma on the page; no moment forces Kael to choose between competing goods or risk a visible loss. The resolution (touching the seed, receiving understanding) arrives without on-page friction or cost, leaving escalation more structural than felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the premise: resilience is encoded in failure, and growth requires embracing damage rather than avoiding it. The arrow tip's fusion with the seed and Kael's realization about pruning diseased branches with reverence offer concrete particulars. The final line—"courage to grow backward into one's roots while reaching forward into unknown sky"—risks abstraction but is grounded in the orchard and inversion imagery. No overt moralizing, though the closing wisdom is told rather than purely implied by image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-person limited with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric—"whirling silence," "centrifuge of sound," "genetic grief"—which fits the speculative setting but occasionally drifts toward over-writing ("the courage to grow backward into one's roots") without grounding in Kael's lived idiom. Psychic distance is consistent. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she heard") appear but do not overwhelm. Voice remains distinct and purposeful, though the register is uniform across emotional peaks and calmer beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clear and propulsive, with varied sentence structures and vivid images (silver ribbons, stone loops humming with echoes). However, several metaphors pile up in quick succession ("whirling silence...centrifuge of sound," "genetic grief," "the silence between the whirling") without always clarifying sense, creating mild overwriting in the middle third. A few template stems recur ("The arrow tip...", "The seed..."). No paraphrase loops or major artifacts touch the closure beat. Information density is high, and the read-aloud rhythm supports momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The gravity-inversion orchard planet and arrow-tip dowsing rod offer a fresh synthesis of speculative elements. The central insight—resilience accelerates through damage, not despite it—transforms a familiar "find the magic thing" premise into a thematic reckoning about pruning and survival. Execution is competent but safe: Kael encounters no meaningful obstacle or friction during her flight, and the discovery arrives via touch rather than a choice that risks something personal. The premise is elevated by world-building specificity, but the arc follows a predictable retrieval template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael launches the glider, navigates by water flow, and touches the key seed—three distinct beats involving choice. However, her decisions are reactive (follow the arrow, drift with current) rather than forcing trade-offs or altering tactics under pressure. She is present throughout and drives the plot forward, but "intrepid" is not tested on the page by risk, hesitation, or visible cost. Mid-band: functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The arrow tip is pressed into Kael's palm in the opening, pulses warm during flight, glows brighter near the arch, and finally fuses with the seed at closure—four beats with escalating intensity. It guides navigation and validates the grandmother's cryptic advice, constraining Kael's final choice (she must follow it to the scarred seed). However, Kael never struggles with the arrow or uses it in a way that imposes visible cost; it functions as a reliable tool rather than a source of friction. Strong setup, development, and payoff earn it the 7–8 band, but lack of trade-off caps it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Gathering of echoes" appears as voices of past pilots in the arches, memories in seeds, and Kael's own voice at the end. It colors the atmosphere and ties to theme (resilience as accumulated memory), but it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. The concept is present across beats yet remains ornamental—an evocative label rather than a mechanism that narrows options or imposes cost. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Accelerated growth is the stated attribute inside the arch ("raw and directionless"), and Kael plans to plant the seed tomorrow, expecting it to teach the orchard. It is tied to the resolution but does not constrain Kael's actions during the flight or impose a trade-off. The attribute is causal in the backstory (why her orchards survive) and shapes the ending stakes, earning setup and payoff, but middle development is missing. One key turn (the seed will plant tomorrow's orchard), but the mechanics remain abstract.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Discover" is the story's spine: Kael discovers the seed cyclone, discovers the archive seed, and discovers the lesson encoded in failure. The action drives all three major beats and redefines her understanding of resilience, changing her plan from fighting die-off to embracing it. The discovery is not easily swappable—observation alone would not yield the tactile fusion or the commitment to plant. Essential across beats and ending, but the discovery arrives via passive reception (touching, listening) rather than active struggle, preventing a score above 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Kael signals "navigating by water flow" early and follows detached irrigation streams skyward toward the central arch. The method is visible in two beats (launch spiral, approach to arch) and shapes her route, constraining her path through the stone loops. However, the mechanics are not detailed—how she reads the water, why it leads to the arch—and the method does not impose a cost or force a mid-flight correction. Functional and present, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The floating-arch planet and gravity inversion structure every beat: Kael's launch timing, navigation by rising water, passage through the arch threshold, and the seed cyclone inside. The setting is not backdrop—it enables the discovery (seeds gather in the inversion), constrains tactics (sixty-minute window), and charges the final image (Kael lands as gravity normalizes). Environment is essential to plot logic, stakes, and closure. High score reflects strong causal integration and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The sixty-minute inversion window is announced at the start and closes at the end ("Gravity's hour ended with a soft sigh"). It frames the entire flight and enforces urgency, though the clock is not tracked beat-by-beat or used to force a mid-flight decision. Kael never races the timer or sacrifices something to meet it. The timeframe is essential to setup and payoff, shaping the premise and resolution, but middle pressure is missing. Solid integration but not indispensable to tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Finding the source of resilience motivates Kael's launch and drives her goal throughout. The motivation is declared early ("simple: find the source") and paid off at closure when she understands resilience as encoded failure. However, the desire is never dramatized in friction—Kael does not weigh the risk, fear failure, or sacrifice something personal to reach the arch. The motivation is causal and present but told rather than embodied in contradictory choices. Setup and payoff with weak development.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Whirling silence" is introduced early as "not the absence of sound, but a centrifuge of it" and returns in the final paragraph ("the silence between the whirling"). The tone is lyric, meditative, and consistent across beats, supporting the accumulative structure. However, it does not modulate under pressure—Kael's internal state remains calm throughout—and the phrase functions more as atmospheric motif than a tonal shift that charges the closure. Present, purposeful, but not essential.</comment>
