<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and the renunciation of prophecy with visible cost (trading foresight for innocence) provides earned closure. Interior life is present through his technical focus and final doubt, though embodied contradiction under pressure is muted—he executes methodically without strong competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The closing question about peace versus ignorance gestures toward complexity but arrives as reflection rather than dramatized tension in a peak choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</quarter><comment>Closure lands on-page: Elias rewrites the prophecy into "benign babble," an Earned Stasis/Conceptual Repricing hybrid with felt cost (the brook's lost wisdom, his lingering doubt). Orientation is clean by the first paragraph. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—density of crane placements and code imagery builds to a cadence shift when the hush becomes absolute—but the middle sags into repetitive descriptive loops (cranes placed, code described, hush spreading) without a sharp tightening that narrows options or raises immediate stakes before the final beat. Cost is legible in the ending doubt, though the prophesied flood remains abstract throughout, reducing urgency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The nocturnal brook setting constrains Elias's method (upstream placement, narrow log span) and charges the final image (the changed song). Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through his summoner's attention (moonlight on paper, water syllables, moss texture). The cranes function as micro-setting instruments that alter the environment's meaning. Spatial choreography is clean across all placements along the brook's course.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—hushing the prophecy to prevent memory-erasure—is signaled early and drives all action. One meaningful tightening occurs when the prophecy "fights back" and water quickens, forcing the final crane placement that produces absolute hush. However, the flood threat remains abstract and off-page throughout; no secondary pressure tests Elias's commitment, and his execution proceeds without adaptation or visible trade-off until the terminal doubt. The cost (lost wisdom) is conceptual and arrives in reflection rather than through a forced choice under duress.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: silence as erasure, the price of preventing catastrophe, peace versus ignorance. The cranes accumulate symbolic weight (keys, vessels, instruments) and the final image—collecting cranes that feel "cooler, heavier"—reweights prior material without stating a moral. The closing questions avoid tidy resolution. However, the middle third recycles thematic language ("terrestrially cosmic," "smoothed hush," "tranquil blaze") in near-identical constructions, reading as prompt-label scaffolding rather than earned progression, and late phrases like "what is lost when we quiet the voice of warning?" veer toward essay territory.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature (Elias notices water code, origami precision, frequency geometry). Diction is mostly controlled, though "terrestrially cosmic" and "tranquil blaze" repeat as ornamental labels without functional variation. Narrative distance is consistent. No dialogue present. Under peak pressure (the brook fighting back), syntax compresses appropriately. Minor register drift: phrases like "the essential geometry of his task" and "the benign babble of a stream" occasionally float above the established voice without clear motivational anchor in Elias's technical mindset.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade the middle third: multiple paragraphs restate "hush spreads," "code unravels," "cranes are keys" without advancing pressure. Sentence stems recur ("The smoothed hush…," "The tranquil blaze…," "The terrestrially cosmic…") across six beats, creating mechanical rhythm. Figurative language is dense (shadows as bridges, silence drinking sound, paper cutting veils) but mostly coherent. The final third tightens, but scaffolding artifacts ("some summoners worked with fire or blood, but Elias knew…") and synonym churn ("whispered secrets," "urgent whisper," "thoughtful murmur") dull momentum. Information density is uneven: the climax (final crane, absolute hush) is compressed to two sentences while crane placements stretch across redundant paragraphs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The premise—origami as sound-dampening ritual, prophecy as brook code—offers a fresh synthesis of familiar elements (lone mage, fate averted). The method (mapping silence via crane frequencies) is specific and non-obvious. Emotional territory (renunciation's cost, enforced ignorance) avoids generic templates. However, execution leans on stock imagery (willows weeping, moonlight casting shadows, cranes as vessels) and the prophesied flood never gains concrete stakes beyond abstraction, limiting thematic risk. The closing doubt is earned but predictable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Elias's choices drive all key turns: he places cranes methodically, responds to the brook's quickening, sets the final crane that achieves absolute hush, and collects them at dawn. His decision to rewrite the prophecy (not merely silence it) shapes the ending's moral weight. Present throughout; agency is clear.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The origami wing appears in at least six beats: first crane trembles, wings dip into water, final wing touches stream to trigger absolute hush, collected cranes feel "cooler, heavier" at dawn. Wings function as keys unlocking quiet frequencies and vessels holding back futures. The image charges closure (paper bearing "the weight of what had been unmade"). Strong causal role and reweighted meaning at end.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Smoothed hush" shapes the core tactic—Elias creates pockets of stillness to rewrite the code—and defines success (absolute hush at climax). It appears in five beats and drives the method. However, the concept is more atmospheric descriptor than active constraint; removing "smoothed" would leave "hush/silence" doing identical work. The specificity adds texture but not irreplaceable mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Terrestrially cosmic" appears as a recurring label (brook-to-constellation binding, realignment at hush) but never constrains action or alters tactics. It describes the puzzle's scale without generating on-page cost or trade-off. Swappable with "macro/micro," "earth-sky," or similar binaries. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Flow" governs the method: Elias arranges cranes "backward against [the brook's] natural direction," the flow quickens when the prophecy resists, and the final crane stops flow to create absolute hush. Present in setup, middle resistance, and closure. The action defines success and failure states; removing it would collapse story logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Mapping silence" is signaled early ("his method was older than memory: by mapping silence, he could rewrite…"), demonstrated through crane placement (each wing a frequency key, arrangement following upstream code), and restated at closure ("he had altered the terrestrially cosmic balance, trading one silence for another"). The method shapes all beats and differentiates Elias from other summoners. Causal backbone, though mid-section repetition ("listen deeper," "hear whispered secrets") dilutes specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The nocturnal brook setting supplies the prophecy medium, constrains crane placement (upstream, narrow log span), and provides the final sensory shift (water's new song). "Haven" frames Elias's isolation and the sanctuary/trap duality charges his doubt at the end. Willows, stones, moss-covered log all anchor spatial choices. Environment actively shapes tactics and closure image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Whispered secrets" describes the brook's code and Elias's lifetime of translation, establishing stakes. "Three nights" and "dawn threatened" provide temporal brackets. However, no live clock tightens decisions within the ritual; crane placement proceeds at Elias's pace without time pressure. The timeframe is present but does not escalate urgency or alter tactics mid-scene.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Hushing the coded prophecy drives every action: Elias folds cranes to unlock quiet, places them to rewrite the brook's message, and completes the ritual despite the prophecy's resistance. Motivation is dramatized through his technical focus and final cost (collecting heavier cranes, doubting the trade). The question "is peace worth the price of ignorance?" grows from the enacted choice. Clear friction between want (prevent flood) and cost (steal wisdom).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" appears as a label in four beats ("tranquil blaze of concentration," "tranquil blaze of his focus," "tranquil blaze faded") but functions as static descriptor rather than modulating tone. The piece sustains calm lyricism throughout; no sharp tonal shift at climax when the brook fights back or when absolute hush arrives. Coherent but uniform; does not charge the final image with dynamic pressure.</comment>
