<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Arin is described through poetic labels ("gentle radical," "heart forged in frost and flame") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The interior consists largely of abstract summary and retrospective claims about memory and empathy without embodied micro-choices that alter present options. The decision to rename the plaza is declared rather than earned through on-page struggle; no visible cost forecloses a path. Diagnostic label-speak pervades: "cradle empathy in arms of steel" repeats as a thematic slogan rather than a lived tension.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The orientation test is not clearly met—who Arin is, what he can do, and what immediate stakes he faces remain vague past 120 words; we learn setting and mood but not a legible goal or opposition. The "renaming" appears as an announced intention midway through and is executed without resistance or reversal. The ending recycles the naming and thematic phrases without a decisive change or visible cost that reweights prior material; the plaza "holds its breath" and Arin's mission is "fulfilled" by summary rather than an on-page turn. No clear drive lens emerges: the text oscillates between mood-painting and retrospective claim without coherent causal or accumulative pressure to closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "ancient plaza beneath a shattered sky" and "charred pillars" establish post-fire atmosphere early with selective sensory detail (ash, burnt spices). The mosaic stepping stone and tessera are handled on the page and constrain the renaming action. However, spatial choreography is vague—Arin's movement through the ruins and the relationship between pillars, stones, and the distant new minaret remain impressionistic rather than navigable. The setting provides mood but does not pressure a choice; Arin's actions proceed without environmental obstacle or resource scarcity.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Arin's intent to rename the plaza—is signaled around midpoint but never faces opposition or cost. No on-page reversal narrows options; the soldier's "aberrant mercy" is retrospective context, not a live complication. The act of carving the name unfolds without difficulty, and the ending declares success ("his mission fulfilled") without a trade-off or foreclosed path. Pressure is asserted through tone rather than dramatized escalation; coincidence does not complicate because nothing complicates.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Theme of "aberrant mercy" and "empathy cradled in steel" is stated repeatedly rather than emerging from specific on-page conflict. The soldier's act and Arin's response are told in retrospect without competing values or ambiguity tested in scene. The final image recycles the thematic phrases ("Plaza of Embers," "warm coldness") as mantras rather than reweighting prior particulars with earned cost. The piece gestures toward complexity (fire and forgiveness, radical and gentle) but resolves into a thesis statement rather than a non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains stable distance and a lyric register throughout. Diction is elevated and consistent ("retrocognitively trapped," "aberrant mercy") but risks convergence with the narrative voice—Arin's interior reads like the prose frame rather than character-particular thought. Perceptual signature is weak; sensory details (ash, sky, stone) feel uniform rather than filtered through a distinct mind. No dialogue appears. Purposeful compression and patterned recurrence (fire, steel, warmth/cold) are present but the repetition trends toward mantra rather than taught pattern with payoff.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound: the thematic phrases ("cradle empathy in arms of steel," "warm coldness," "aberrant mercy," "retrocognitively trapped") recur across paragraphs without added pressure or detail. Template cadence appears in runs of similar declarative constructions ("The plaza... The city... The mosaic..."). Figurative density is high but often generic or mixed ("heart forged in frost and flame," "sky like cracked glass," "tears were frozen, caught between warmth and cold"). Sentence openings vary minimally; many paragraphs begin with "The" or "And the." Information density is low—many lines restate mood or theme rather than advancing knowledge or choice. The final third consists largely of thematic summary rather than scene.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The post-apocalyptic renaming premise and "gentle radical" archetype are familiar; the execution does not transform them through specific, non-obvious choices. The mosaic tessera and stepping stone are concrete details, but their use (tracing patterns to find a name, placing the tessera as closure) reads as symbolic ritual rather than a synthesis that could only happen here. The "aberrant mercy" of the enemy soldier is backstory atmosphere rather than a causal or moral complication. The ending's multiple recapitulations of theme and phrase signal a desire for resonance rather than achieving it through earned surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Arin is present throughout and decides to rename the plaza, but the choice unfolds without opposition or cost; observation and retrospective framing dominate over on-page agency that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The tessera appears early (found among pebbles), is handled mid-story (cupped in palm, guides fingers), and returns at closure (placed on stone, glows, tucked in pocket). It shapes two beats (discovery, placement) and links to the renaming action, but the object's properties are largely symbolic rather than mechanically constraining—removing it would weaken atmosphere but not break plot logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Aberrant mercy" is named and reflected upon as backstory (the soldier sparing a child) and echoed thematically at closure, but it does not shape on-page stakes or tactics. It functions as a thematic claim rather than a force that constrains or enables Arin's choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Retrocognitively trapped" is labeled early and mentioned repeatedly, but the trait does not visibly constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. Arin walks and carves without friction; the retrospective pull is asserted mood rather than a mechanism that alters present moves.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The renaming is signaled midway, executed in the carving scene, and recurs at closure. It drives the middle beat and anchors the ending image. However, the act unfolds without resistance or complication; swapping "rename" for another symbolic gesture (planting, rebuilding) would require minimal structural change. The element is central but not indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "chipped patterns on a mosaic stepping stone" are introduced mid-story and guide the carving of the new name. The method is signaled and used, but its mechanics are vague—how the patterns "spell a name" or "guide his fingers" is told rather than shown. Present in two beats (discovery, use) but the stepping stone could be replaced with any inscribable surface with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The "ancient plaza beneath a shattered sky" frames the entire story, anchors sensory atmosphere (ash, burnt spices, charred pillars), and supplies the stepping stone that enables the renaming. It does not pressure Arin's choices—no environmental obstacle or resource scarcity alters tactics—but it is essential to the story's location and mood. The setting participates in closure (the plaza "holds its breath") and is present across all beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"After the great fire" establishes the temporal frame early and the post-fire condition pervades description, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. The fire is retrospective context; no urgency or deadline shapes Arin's moves. The element is present but does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"To cradle empathy in arms of steel" is stated as Arin's resolve and recurs thematically at closure, but the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or costs. No on-page friction tests the desire; Arin's actions proceed without struggle or trade-off. The phrase functions as a thematic slogan rather than a lived tension.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Warm coldness" is signaled early ("warmth flickered within," "coldness that gnawed") and recurs throughout ("warm and cold," "beacon of warm coldness"). The oxymoron is consistent and modulates with the narrative's reflective mood, charging the final image. However, the tone is static—no clear shift under pressure—and the phrase risks becoming a mantra rather than a dynamic register that responds to escalation.</comment>
