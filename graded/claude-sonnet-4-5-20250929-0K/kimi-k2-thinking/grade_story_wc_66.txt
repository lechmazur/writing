<comment>Mira's core motivation—to teach dust to tell stories—is established early and shapes her actions throughout. However, her interior life relies heavily on abstract declaration ("believed that dust could learn to sing") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final beats show her settling into hope rather than facing a genuinely difficult choice with visible cost; the work is complete, the broadcast received, no path foreclosed. Interiority remains consistent but leans toward poetic assertion over micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>

<comment>The piece opens with clear anchors (who, where) and operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Mira receives the broadcast, transcribes it, imagines the dust as audience, and closes on a note of completed ritual. The closure reads as Charged Poise—she has woven the message, the orchestra will perform tomorrow—but the cost remains conceptual and asserted rather than felt on the page. No on-page sentence makes the price of this defiance or the risk of discovery legible in a concrete image. The lens holds, but closure lacks the undeniable weight required for higher bands.</comment>

<comment>The ember alcove, mist, scarred desk, and radio dial glow are vivid and sensory. The setting provides mood and frames Mira's isolation, but it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics in a visible way—Mira works undisturbed, the mist presses but does not intrude, the alcove shelters without cost. The dial glow is handled multiple times and charges the final image, lifting the score, yet the environment itself remains backdrop rather than crucible.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—embedding the pirate's elusive lyrics to end the story famine—is signaled early and sustained. However, the piece offers no reversal, complication, or visible obstacle; Mira listens, transcribes, finishes, and waits for the orchestra with confidence. The broadcast arrives conveniently, the luminous ink works as hoped, and no on-page event narrows her options or forces a trade-off. Pressure accumulates texturally but never tightens into a moment where agency forecloses a live path with legible cost.</comment>

<comment>The theme of stories-as-survival and dust-as-audience emerges from concrete images (luminous ink, shortwave pulse, dust motes). The final image of dust as scribes and the coda "dust to tell stories, one elusive lyric at a time, forever" reweights prior material with intentional repetition. Yet the last two paragraphs edge toward thematic summary ("the story famine would finally end," "stories never truly die") rather than allowing resonance to arise solely from the image, and the pirate broadcast as cipher is introduced and resolved without friction or counter-reading.</comment>

<grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mira; diction is lyric and controlled with a consistent perceptual signature (dust as listeners, notes as ghosts). However, the prose leans heavily on repeated syntactic stems—"She believed," "She imagined," "She dreamed," "She whispered"—and the same metaphoric vehicle (dust) recurs across nearly every beat without evolving pressure. Under peak moments, the voice remains at a single lyric register without modulation, and filter verbs ("believed," "imagined," "prayed") stack in adjacent lines, dulling immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>5.7</grade>
<comment>The prose is clear and grammatically clean, with vivid images (cobalt pulse, shimmering staves, thistled calm). However, paraphrase loops and template cadence dominate: "She believed… She imagined… She prayed… She whispered" anchor consecutive paragraphs, and the dust-as-storyteller motif is restated across five separate beats without added pressure. Figurative density is high but repetitive (dust, glow, mist, cloak recur as static descriptors), and the final third doubles down on summary rather than propulsion. Information density is moderate; momentum flattens in the second half as the same images recirculate.</comment>

<comment>The combination of shortwave pirate broadcast, luminous ink, and dust-as-audience offers a fresh synthesis. However, the emotional arc—lone copyist preserving forbidden knowledge—follows a familiar template without transformation through lived complication or non-obvious moral calculus. The middle and ending beats recycle the same images and assertions (dust, glow, mist, cloak) without a turn or deepening that redefines the premise. The thistled-calm tone and elusive-lyrics method are evocative but remain ornamental rather than irreplaceable in the story's logic.</comment>

<grade>5.2</grade>
<comment>Mira's role as diligent orchestra copyist frames her actions (tracing, transcribing, weaving lyrics into the symphony) and appears in setup, middle, and closure. She makes micro-choices—listening, working beneath the cloak, embedding the cipher—but no choice alters tactics or forecloses a path with visible cost. The occupation is present across beats and shapes the method, but the decisions themselves are observational and sequential rather than turning pressure into agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The shortwave radio dial glow is handled in at least four distinct beats: hidden beneath the blanket, casting cobalt pulse, revealing luminous ink, pulsing as acknowledgment, and present in the final image ("dial glow flickering gently"). It enables the central action (receiving the broadcast, revealing hidden staves) and charges the ending. However, its state does not evolve under pressure or constrain a choice with cost; it functions reliably throughout. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage lift the score; lack of causal friction or irreplaceability caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>The pirate broadcast is signaled early, drives the transcription action in the middle, and reappears in the final image as "compass" and "faint hum." It provides the cipher that Mira embeds into the symphony, directly enabling her method. However, the broadcast arrives without complication, its contents are received cleanly, and it does not constrain or narrow her options—no interference, no risk of discovery on the page, no cost tied to its use. Setup, development, and closure presence are all met; causal pressure and cost connection are absent.</comment>

<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>The secretly luminous ink is introduced in the middle ("under the dial's glow, hidden staves appeared") and enables Mira's transcription method. It appears again in the final third as a future beacon for scribes. However, it is not signaled in setup, does not constrain a choice or impose cost, and could be replaced by any revelation device (invisible ink, coded notation) with minor edits. Present in two beats and functional but swappable; late arrival and lack of causal friction cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>4.1</grade>
<comment>The cloak appears in three moments: as shield against prying eyes during transcription, as heavy fabric at the end, and in the metaphor "notes would become a cloak of sound." The physical action of cloaking the radio and working beneath the cloak is present but does not drive a turn or redefine options—Mira is never discovered, the cloak functions passively as protection without cost. The final metaphoric use is thematic echo rather than causal payoff. Functional but ornamental; easily swappable with any concealment gesture.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>5.6</grade>
<comment>Elusive song lyrics are signaled in the setup ("sang elusive song lyrics, each verse a riddle"), shape the middle action (Mira transcribes them into the symphony's missing measures), and appear in the closure ("woven the pirate's elusive lyrics into the final coda"). The method is present across all three gates and drives the central action. However, the mechanics remain abstract—what makes them elusive, how they function as cipher—and the execution is summarized rather than demonstrated with visible cost or friction. Causal role is clear; specificity and irreplaceability are moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>The ember alcove in mist is established in the opening line, reappears as sanctuary and site of work throughout, and closes with "thistled calm" and the alcove as ongoing space. It provides sensory texture and frames Mira's isolation but does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—the mist presses but never intrudes, the alcove shelters without cost or breach. Present in setup and ending with strong lyric reprise ("In the thistled calm of the alcove"); lacks causal pressure or micro-setting constraint that would lift it above 6.5.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>5.0</grade>
<comment>The story famine is declared in the setup ("world beyond had suffered a story famine") and frames Mira's motivation throughout. It reappears in the middle ("narrative wasteland") and closure ("the story famine would finally end"). However, it remains thematic backdrop rather than a live constraint that tightens decisions or alters tactics on the page—no clock, no immediate threat, no cost tied to timing. Present across beats and shapes motivation but does not function as timeframe in the mechanical sense; more a historical condition than a pressure device.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>6.0</grade>
<comment>Mira's desire to teach dust to tell stories is signaled early ("believed that dust could learn to sing"), drives her transcription work in the middle, and anchors the final image ("Mira taught dust to tell stories"). It shapes her actions and provides thematic coherence. However, the desire is declared rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible friction—no moment where the cost of this belief is tested against another need. Present in setup, middle, and closure; causally central but told rather than dramatized with micro-choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>Thistled calm is named explicitly twice ("thistled calm" in setup and near the end) and reflected in the overall register: lyric, measured, serene yet purposeful. The tone is coherent through the arc and modulates only slightly as Mira finishes her work and settles into anticipation. However, the tone does not shift under pressure or charge the final image with new weight—the calm holds steady without tension or break. Coherent and consistent but static; lacks the tonal turn or intensification that would lift it above mid-band.</comment>
