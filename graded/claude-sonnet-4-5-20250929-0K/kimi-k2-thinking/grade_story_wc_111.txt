<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Silas's motivation to prove gardens know their gardeners remains asserted rather than tested through contradictory impulses. His interiority relies on stock metaphors ("dry rustle," "gnarled as the vines") and the climactic reveal feels like exposition rather than a wrenching choice with visible cost. The youngest heir exists solely to receive his explanation, flattening the relational crucible. Emotional progression is linear and didactic, with no genuine internal conflict driving the marble ritual beyond thematic necessity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (marble polishing as ritual deepening), but the closure dissolves into summary and thematic echo rather than a single charged image with cost. The wilted rosebush discovery (~40% mark) could narrow options, but Silas's decision to reveal the marbles lacks causal pressure—the heirs simply agree, erasing stakes. Orientation is clean. The ending rehearses the premise ("gardens know their gardeners") across multiple paragraphs instead of landing one resonant reconfiguration, and the cost of revelation never materializes on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The garden maze anchors space early and the cracked marbles function as micro-setting, constraining the reveal choice and charging the spiral arrangement. Sensory detail ("pale sun filtering through tall hedges," fireflies mirroring marble glint) is purposeful and filtered through Silas's familiarity. However, the maze's physical layout remains vague—no spatial choreography or tactical use of paths—and the luck gauge and soil additive remain ornamental world rules that never pressure a beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake (proving the garden-gardener bond to skeptical heirs) is signaled early but never tested with genuine opposition—the heirs accept Silas's explanation without friction, collapsing escalation. The wilted rosebush discovery is a problem Silas solves by exposition rather than action. No reversal forecloses a path; the resolution is delivered through agreement, not agency. The piece declares stakes ("they would replace him with a machine") but never dramatizes that threat, leaving pressure abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme (ritual, intention, and the bond between gardener and garden) emerges from the marble polishing motif, but the ending restates it explicitly across multiple paragraphs ("true measure of luck was not in numbers," "gardens truly know their gardeners") instead of trusting image. The mended deception concept is asserted rather than earned through contradictory choices. Subtext operates weakly; dialogue serves exposition. The final firefly image offers lyric resonance, but it arrives after thematic summary has already done the work, reducing its charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable in third-limited, and Silas's perceptual signature (vine-dresser idiom, attention to tendrils and blooms) is consistent. Dialogue from Silas and the youngest heir feels functional but lacks subtext—lines explain rather than pursue goals. Psychic distance is controlled, but voice flattens under pressure: "dry rustle" and "wisely pragmatic" repeat as labels without fresh embodiment. Free indirect style is clean, though diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("commemoration," "resonance") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Pervasive template cadence and paraphrase loops erode momentum: "Each cracked marble, he mused, was a broken promise" restates the established metaphor without new pressure; "The garden maze, with its intertwining paths, now held a story" summarizes closure instead of enacting it. Synonym churn ("withered," "fading," "waning") clusters without functional distinction. Stock phrases ("pulse of the garden match his own heartbeat") and filter-verb stacks ("he knew," "he mused," "he told them") dull immediacy in peak beats. The final third cycles through thematic restatements, violating the loop/scaffold screen and triggering artifact penalties that touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The premise (measurable luck and a gardener's ritual bond) offers a fresh angle, but execution leans on familiar tropes: the wise elder proves his worth to skeptical heirs through a gentle reveal. The marble-polishing ritual could be distinctive, but it functions as metaphor without tactical specificity—any commemorative object would serve equally. Emotional arc and plot work unchanged with generic replacements (coins, stones, seeds), signaling insufficient transformation. The ending's firefly image is evocative but arrives late and feels decorative rather than inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Silas is present throughout and his decision to reveal the marbles drives the final third, satisfying setup, development, and payoff gates. However, the choice lacks meaningful opposition or cost—the heirs immediately agree, so the element does not narrow options or foreclose a path. The vine-dresser occupation flavors description but does not constrain a tactic. Swappable with "gardener" or "caretaker" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The marbles appear early (polishing ritual paragraph ~8%), are handled in multiple beats (daily polishing, spiral arrangement, heirs' examination), and return in the final image with fireflies. They enable the reveal and charge the closure visually. However, their cracked state is described more than used—cracks never constrain a choice or shift meaning between beats. Specificity (constellation glint, broken promise metaphor) is present but largely ornamental. Gates met; causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The concept is named explicitly ("mended deception") late (~70% mark) and explained in dialogue rather than dramatized through contradictory choices. Silas's soil-additive lie is mentioned but never pressures a beat—no heir challenges it, no risk of discovery tightens tactics. The "mending" occurs offstage (polishing as ritual) and is summarized at closure. Present and thematically coherent, but swappable with "hidden truth" or "secret bond" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The phrase "wisely pragmatic" appears twice as a label but does not constrain an action or create a visible tradeoff. Silas's decisions (polishing marbles, arranging them, revealing them) proceed without friction that this trait enables or complicates. The attribute describes tone more than it shapes choice. Swappable with "patient" or "careful" with negligible impact.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Polishing appears in the early ritual description, recurs across beats (daily routine, commemoration logic), and is invoked at closure ("continued to polish each marble"). It frames the mended deception method and the heirs' understanding. However, the act itself is passive—no single polish drives a reversal or changes an option. The ending mentions polishing but does not enact it. Gates met; causal role present but diffuse.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The method is signaled early (marble polishing as elaborate commemoration of small victories) and explained to the heirs, shaping their final agreement. It provides the logic for the garden's vitality and Silas's bond. However, it is told more than shown—we see one marble polished, then the method is summarized. The elaborateness is asserted ("elaborately") rather than dramatized through ritual detail. Functional but replaceable with "honoring small victories" or "daily gratitude."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The garden maze anchors location early and the rosebush at the center provides a spatial goal. The stone table at the heart hosts the climactic spiral arrangement. However, the maze's paths and hedges remain descriptive—no choice depends on navigation, no tactical use of enclosure or visibility. Micro-setting (marbles, rosebush) charges the final image but does not alter a decision. Gates met; one beat (rosebush discovery) plus closure presence; moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The timeframe is mentioned in the opening line and referenced via the luck gauge, establishing the premise's speculative rule. However, measurable luck never tightens a decision—no gauge reading forces a tactic, no deadline pressures Silas. The "after" functions as worldbuilding flavor rather than a constraint that alters the plot. Present but ornamental; swappable with any era marker.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The motivation is stated early and drives the reveal sequence: Silas arranges the marbles specifically to prove the bond to the heirs. It shapes his goal and the story's through-line. However, the desire is never conflicted—no cost tests his commitment, no alternative want competes. The heirs' agreement satisfies the motivation without friction. Gates met; one key beat (reveal) plus closure; cost is conceptual (vulnerability of sharing the secret) but not felt on the page as a tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The phrase "blooming withering" appears twice, the second time in the penultimate beat, and the final image (fireflies as "blooming withering dance") attempts to charge it. The tone of cyclical vitality and decay is coherent and modulates with the rosebush discovery. However, the oxymoron functions more as a thematic label than a lived pressure—no choice embodies the tension between bloom and decay. Present in closure but ornamental; the story's emotional texture would hold with "cycles of growth and decay."</comment>
