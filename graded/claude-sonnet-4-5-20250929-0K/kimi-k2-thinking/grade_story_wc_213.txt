<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is present and her choice to withhold the alarm is rooted in her established trait of "credibly curious" precision, but the internal conflict lacks simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene—she moves from doubt to certainty in a linear path without genuine ambiguity at the decision point. The motivation for trusting the instruments over protocol is clear, yet the cost of her decision (villagers might have fled for "false fear") is told rather than embodied through a micro-choice that visibly forecloses a path. Embodied emotion is thin; phrases like "curiosity, that other compass" and "her credibly curious nature" label rather than dramatize the felt pressure of the zero-hour dilemma.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening lines, so no penalty applies. The piece follows a single POV in one continuous scene (observation deck to bell chamber), meeting the 600–800 word default. However, closure reads as Earned Stasis (she chooses not to sound the alarm), yet the cost is asserted rather than dramatically paid: "They would have fled their homes" is hypothetical, not an on-page consequence that alters her later options. The inferred lens is Causal (her reading of the instruments narrows her choice), but the final reversal—deciding the storm will pass—lacks a prior on-page moment when she genuinely believed it wouldn't, weakening the because/therefore linkage at the climax.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The windblown sanctuary, observation deck, instruments, and bell rope are vividly anchored with selective sensory detail (frost-kissed stone, frayed hemp, clouds churning below). The bell rope's glue-stiffened state constrains her choice in the middle beat, and the observation window frames the decisive moment when she sees the gap in the clouds. Spatial choreography (spiral stair, bell chamber, observation deck) remains clear throughout, and the setting's altitude and isolation subtly amplify the stakes of a false alarm. The final image—shutters open, solstice hush deepening—charges the ending without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (sound the alarm or trust the data) is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the instruments show a pressure stall, forcing Elara to choose between protocol and observation. Yet the escalation is muted: the rope's readiness by the final scene ("she tested it gently. It held.") removes the initial constraint without narrative cost, and the storm's retreat happens off-page, leaving the choice consequence hypothetical. Agency is present (she decides not to act), but the cost is conceptual rather than visceral—no villager reaction, no professional repercussion, no embodied price paid within the text.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the listening-versus-noise motif and Elara's final journal entry ("Zero hour is not when we sound the alarm, but when we choose not to"). However, the story edges toward stating the theme rather than embodying it: "Humility, she thought, was knowing when not to raise your voice" and "data without wisdom was just another noise" are direct articulations that replace scene pressure. The recurring motifs (solstice hush, windblown sanctuary, instruments' song) are vivid, but their final recurrence reiterates rather than reweights the central question. The ending offers a resonant image but borders on moralizing with the journal's explicit thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent and carries a distinct lyric texture ("prayer frozen mid-breath," "curiosity, that other compass"), though several phrases edge toward purple prose without serving peak pressure. POV remains stable in third-limited; no head-hopping. Psychic distance is controlled, with free indirect access to Elara's reasoning. However, perceptual signature is weak—her "way of noticing" does not shift distinctively under stress, and the prose maintains the same elevated register throughout. The repeated descriptor "credibly curious" and the phrase "windblown sanctuary" recur without evolution, reading as template anchors. No dialogue is present, so those bullets are not applicable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Overwriting is pervasive: nearly every sentence in the opening and closing thirds carries figurative language ("prayer frozen mid-breath," "winds that had forgotten how to whisper," "knife-edge moment," "instruments' quiet song"), creating a steady hum of lyricism that flattens rather than modulates pressure. Paraphrase loops appear: "The solstice hush pressed heavier than usual, a silence that swallowed echoes" is revisited multiple times without added pressure. Template cadence is visible in the final third with parallel "she thought" and "The glue would..." constructions. Informational density is low in several paragraphs that restate the same choice (switch vs. bell vs. wait) without advancing causality. Clarity remains high, so the harm is momentum drag rather than opacity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core premise—storm-watcher chooses silence over alarm—is familiar (the cry-wolf inversion, the expert-trusts-instinct trope). The piece does not transform these through lived detail or a non-obvious moral calculus; instead, the resolution is telegraphed early and Elara's choice feels inevitable without genuine surprise or synthesis. The "solstice hush" and mountaintop isolation provide atmospheric particularity, but the emotional arc (patient expert prevails over mechanical protocol) follows a template without fresh inflection. The final journal aphorism ("Zero hour is not when we sound the alarm, but when we choose not to") reads as a thesis statement rather than an earned discovery. No bold structural or perspectival risk heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara appears throughout, making the key decision not to sound the alarm. She is signaled early (setup), her instrument-reading drives the middle beat (development), and her choice frames the ending (payoff). However, her role is more observer than agent under pressure—the instruments do the causal work, and she ratifies their conclusion rather than making a trade-off with visible cost. Swappable with "cautious meteorologist" or "hesitant watchman" without major structural change. Score: setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, cost connection weak +0.2, swappability −0.6, ornamental framing −0.3 → baseline ~6.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The cathedral bell rope is introduced early (first third), tested mid-scene ("she tested it gently. It held"), and returned to at closure when she chooses not to pull it. Three beats, but the rope's causal role is limited: the glue constraint is resolved without cost, and her final restraint is motivated by the instruments, not the rope's state. The rope is more symbolic than mechanically necessary—she could have chosen the electronic siren and ignored the bell entirely. Score: setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, causal pressure weak +0.3, swappability −0.5 → ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Zero hour" is named explicitly and frames the stakes ("zero hour approached, that knife-edge moment when warning must become action"). It shapes tactics (she must choose before the storm arrives) and reappears in the journal entry ("Zero hour is not when we sound the alarm, but when we choose not to"). However, the concept is more thematic than mechanical—the actual deadline is vague, and no on-page consequence punishes delay. Score: setup +0.6, one beat +0.4, closure linkage +0.9, causal pressure modest +0.5, cost connection weak +0.2, swappability with "critical moment" −0.5 → ~5.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Credibly curious" is labeled twice ("curiosity, that other compass," "her credibly curious nature") but rarely enacted through a micro-choice with cost. Her decision to wait and observe is consistent with the trait, yet the trait itself is told rather than embodied in a moment of friction (e.g., curiosity versus protocol creating a visible trade-off). Score: setup +0.4, one beat +0.4, closure linkage +0.7, cost connection weak +0.2, label-only −0.6, swappability with "cautious" or "patient" −0.5 → ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The switch is introduced early ("The electronic siren waited below, its switch a plastic promise of surety") and returned to twice: she places her hand on it, then withdraws. The final image notes "The switch remained untouched." The switch frames her choice, but the actual turn is driven by the instruments' data stall, not the switch's presence—she could have made the same decision with only the bell. Score: setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure modest +0.6, swappability with "alarm button" −0.6 → ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Tracking microclimate variations is signaled early ("For seven years she had been tracking...charting how pressure danced") and drives the middle beat when the instruments show a pressure stall. The method shapes her tactics (trust the data over protocol) and charges the ending ("listening to the faint ping of her instruments marking the storm's retreat"). Score: setup +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure strong +1.0, specificity +0.5, swappability with "weather monitoring" −0.4 → ~6.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The windblown sanctuary is named in the opening line and recurs throughout ("The windblown sanctuary trembled as gusts tested its walls," "In the windblown sanctuary above the clouds"). It provides isolation that raises the stakes (no second opinion) and altitude that frames the observation window's view. The setting's remoteness constrains her choice (villagers depend on her alone) and charges the final image ("the windblown sanctuary settled into its deepest solstice hush"). Score: setup +0.8, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, causal pressure +0.9, specificity +0.6, repeated phrase as anchor +0.4 → ~7.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the glue dries" is mentioned early ("she must wait until after the glue dries before the rope could hold her weight") and returns at the end ("The glue would cure by morning"). However, the timeframe does not tighten tactics—she tests the rope mid-scene and it holds, removing the constraint. The glue-curing clock is ornamental rather than causal. Score: setup +0.5, one beat +0.4, closure mention +0.5, causal pressure weak +0.2, resolves without cost −0.8, swappability with any waiting period −0.6 → ~4.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To favor listening over noise" is dramatized through her refusal to use the electronic siren and her reliance on the instruments' data. The motivation is signaled early ("Elara had never trusted its mechanical scream, preferring to favor listening over noise") and shapes the climactic choice. It appears in the ending journal entry ("listening was the only warning that mattered"). Score: setup +0.7, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.1, causal pressure strong +1.1, cost connection modest +0.4, some telling −0.3 → ~6.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Solstice hush" is introduced in the opening paragraph ("the solstice hush pressed heavier than usual") and recurs at key beats ("The solstice hush deepened," "the windblown sanctuary settled into its deepest solstice hush"). The tone is coherent and modulates subtly as pressure rises and resolves, charging the final image of silence as the correct warning. Score: setup +0.7, three appearances +1.0, closure linkage +1.0, tone modulation +0.6, charges final image +0.8, repetition as device +0.4, some static reuse −0.4 → ~6.1.</comment>
