<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The poet's monthly molt is label-only until the final third, where he "chose to keep the poet's voice"—a renunciation that arrives without prior dramatized contradiction between selves. Cora receives concrete action (teaching him silence-reading, convincing him to rebuild) but her interior remains opaque. The coffee tin's "dangerous lines" and the seed-poem exist as props rather than choices under pressure; we never see him wrestle with whether to share them. Embodied emotion is thin: "heart swelled" and "hands shake" are generic physiology without character-particular texture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural (poetry-resistance metaphor accretes through library rebuilding). Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the passed coffee tin and Cora's final reading, but cost is conceptual rather than felt—no on-page trade-off for his release or her continued imprisonment. The Orientation Test passes (vagrant poet, city streetlights, judge/prison anchored by ~10% of text). One tightening occurs when the molt approaches and he chooses continuity, but the choice lacks prior dramatized stakes. The mosaic structure (22 shards) teaches its pattern early and transitions remain legible, qualifying under Track B, yet the closure image ("somewhere under the same stars, Cora reads...") displaces present pressure to an off-page future.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The rusted library under stars recurs purposefully: roof peeled back, moonlight casting "silver ribbons across rust," final image as "rusted cathedral." The setting constrains action (scavenging nails, painting walls with quotes) and charges the closure metaphor. Spatial choreography is clear within the library; the coffee tin's false bottom is tactile and functional. Sensory detail leans visual ("luminous fracture," "shimmered with fractured light") with less texture from sound, touch, or smell during high-pressure rebuilding beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: sustaining poetic voice/resistance within prison constraints. One tightening: the approaching molt forces a choice to anchor or drift. Agency appears in "chose to keep the poet's voice" and passing the tin to Cora, but these acts lack visible cost—he leaves prison regardless, and we don't see what he sacrifices to stay the poet. The library transformation (inmates whispering verses, notes through ventilation) happens off-stage or in summary. Escalation is additive (more inmates join) rather than a narrowing turn that forecloses options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of beauty-from-anarchy emerges through concrete library rebuilding (nails from crates, quotes on rust) and the seed-poem metaphor. Subtext operates in "quiet fire," "wildflowers cracking pavement," and the coffee tin's hidden verses. However, the final paragraph moralizes: "the greatest verse was not written in ink but in the quiet act of rebuilding a broken world" states the thesis rather than trusting the image. The molt-as-identity fluidity remains abstract; we never see two selves in contradiction. Resonance is mid-range: the rusted-cathedral image reweights prior material, but the off-page Cora epilogue dilutes present charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to the poet; psychic distance remains consistent. Perceptual signature is visible in "luminous fracture," "blooming resistance," and poetic diction ("silver ribbons," "cathedral"), though these recur as ornament rather than stress-responsive modulation. Diction stays within a lyric register but flattens under pressure: "heart swelled" and "hands shake" lack character-particular syntax. No dialogue on the page (Cora and the poet "spoke in shorthand, trading titles" is summary). The molt mechanism is told rather than shown through shifts in sentence rhythm or perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "blooming resistance" appears four times; "luminous fracture" twice; "rusted library under stars" or close variants seven times without reweighting. Template cadence in the opening four paragraphs: "He was... He molts... A dented coffee tin... This month he was..." Stock metaphors: "wildflowers cracking pavement," "garden of stories," "cathedral." Filter-verb stack in paragraph 18: "believed," "taught," "taught" across three lines. The mosaic structure creates 22 micro-paragraphs, many of which paraphrase (e.g., paragraphs 12 and 23 both describe the coffee tin's false bottom). Information density is low: paragraphs 22 and 23 recapitulate backstory without altering present stakes. These artifacts touch the closure third (final five paragraphs repeat "blooming resistance," "luminous fracture," "rusted"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The vagrant-poet-in-prison frame is familiar; the molt mechanism offers a fresh angle but remains label-only until the end. The coffee tin with false bottom is a specific object, yet its function (hiding dangerous poems) is convenience rather than character-driven ingenuity. The library-as-sanctuary transformation is earnest but predictable. The luminous-fracture tone is consistent and purposeful, lifting the piece above template execution. Risk is present in the mosaic structure and poetic compression, but the closure retreats to a safe epilogue rather than a live confrontation or renunciation with on-page cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Setup: present by paragraph 1. Development: judges him (paragraph 5), assigns library work (paragraph 6), spills hidden verses to Cora (paragraph 9), chooses to keep the poet voice (paragraph 18), passes the tin (paragraph 28). Closure: leaves prison with notebook and certainty (paragraph 30); Cora reads his poem (paragraph 32). The poet's choices (sharing verses, choosing continuity, passing the tin) create turns, but most key developments (inmates requesting poems, the molt decision) are summarized rather than dramatized. Two-gate lyric reprise (vagrant beneath streetlights → leaves with notebook) reweights stakes. Causal pressure is mid-range: the molt choice arrives without prior on-page contradiction. Swappability: his vagrant status and poetic identity are essential to the premise but do not constrain tactics under stress. Apply +0.8 early signal, +0.9 two beats, +0.7 closure linkage, +0.5 causal pressure; subtract −0.4 summary-only molt, −0.3 swappable tactics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 3 (dented tin, secret false bottom, dangerous lines). Development: paragraph 12 (sits in cell, holds seed-poem). Closure: paragraph 28 (passes tin to Cora, shows false bottom). The tin appears in three spaced beats and carries the seed-poem metaphor to closure. It enables hiding and transmission but is not handled under stress—no guard shakes it, no choice between revealing or concealing. Specificity: the false bottom and coffee-grounds layer are concrete. Cost: passing the tin to Cora is renunciation but lacks visible consequence for him (he is released regardless). Apply +0.8 early signal, +0.9 two beats, +1.0 closure linkage, +0.4 specificity; subtract −0.5 ornamental middle use, −0.4 low cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 3 ("dangerous lines"), paragraph 10 ("spark of blooming resistance"). Development: paragraph 16 (inmates whispering verses, "quiet network"), paragraph 17 ("anarchy of despair... reshaped into garden"). Closure: paragraph 27 ("threading stories... blooming resistance"), paragraph 32 ("words blooming into quiet resistance"). The concept frames stakes (poetry as resistance) and recurs through metaphor ("wildflowers cracking pavement," "garden of stories"). However, it operates primarily as theme rather than altering on-page tactics: we do not see the blooming resistance change his or Cora's options under pressure. The library rebuilding enacts the concept but in summary (inmates "began to linger," word "spread"). Apply +0.8 early signal, +0.9 two beats, +1.0 closure linkage; subtract −0.8 theme-only role, −0.5 summary development.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 2 ("molts personalities monthly"). Development: paragraph 4 ("this month he was quiet"), paragraph 11 ("monthly molt approaching, tangling thoughts"), paragraph 21 ("last month... firebrand; month before... monk"). Closure: paragraph 18 ("chose to keep the poet's voice"), paragraph 26 ("molt finally came... new name"), paragraph 31 ("each month he still molts... carries thread of library"). The trait appears across six paragraphs and shapes the climactic choice (continuity vs. drift). However, molting is label-only: we never witness two selves in contradiction or see the "tangling thoughts" dramatized in decision. The choice to "keep the poet's voice" lacks on-page cost (no path foreclosed). Apply +0.8 early signal, +1.4 three beats, +1.0 closure linkage; subtract −1.0 label-only execution, −0.6 low cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 13 ("convinced him... rebuild"), paragraph 14 ("began to rebuild... scavenged nails, straightened brackets, painted walls"). Development: paragraph 15 (inmates linger, network spreads), paragraph 17 ("anarchy... reshaped into garden"), paragraph 19 ("library, now rusted cathedral"). Closure: paragraph 29 ("rusted library... secret garden"), paragraph 30 ("beauty forged from shattered places"). Rebuilding is the central action that transforms the library into sanctuary and earns the closure metaphor. It involves on-page tactics (scavenging, painting) and drives the accumulative pressure (inmates joining). However, key developments (inmates requesting poems, the network spreading) are summarized rather than dramatized. The action is irreplaceable: removing rebuilding would collapse the plot. Apply +0.8 early signal, +1.4 three beats, +1.6 causal pressure, +1.2 closure linkage, +0.6 specificity; subtract −0.6 summary-only spread.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 8 ("sorting books beside him... woman named Cora"), paragraph 9 ("spoke in shorthand, trading titles... spilling lines"). Development: paragraph 10 ("Cora saw... recognized spark"), paragraph 13 ("Cora convinced him... rebuild"), paragraph 24 ("Cora taught him... he taught her"). Closure: paragraph 28 ("passed coffee tin to Cora"), paragraph 32 ("Cora reads his seed-poem to new inmate"). The friendship is signaled early and enables key turns (convincing him to rebuild, teaching silence-reading, receiving the tin). However, most interactions are summarized ("spoke in shorthand," "began to rebuild together") rather than dramatized. The method matters but its mechanics (how sorting books sparked trust) remain vague. Apply +0.8 early signal, +1.4 three beats, +0.9 causal pressure, +1.0 closure linkage; subtract −0.8 summary-only interactions.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 6 ("prison library, rusted metal shack... roof peeled back... stars exposed"), paragraph 7 ("worked each night as moon cleared skyline, painting silver ribbons across rust"). Development: paragraph 14 ("scavenged nails... painted rusted walls"), paragraph 19 ("library, now rusted cathedral under stars"), paragraph 23 ("rusted walls shimmered with fractured light"). Closure: paragraph 29 ("rusted library under stars... secret garden"), paragraph 30 ("beauty forged from shattered places"). The setting recurs across seven paragraphs, supplies resources (nails, brackets), and charges the final image (rusted cathedral, fractured light). It constrains action (roof open to stars, water-damaged pages) and anchors the accumulative metaphor. Irreplaceable: the exposed-sky detail is essential to "luminous fracture" tone. Apply +0.8 early signal, +1.4 three beats, +1.0 causal pressure, +1.8 closure linkage, +0.7 specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 7 ("worked each night as moon cleared skyline"). Development: paragraph 18 ("night his personality would molt, moon cleared skyline"). Closure: paragraph 32 ("under the same stars"). The timeframe recurs in three beats and ties the molt to lunar rhythm, creating atmospheric consistency. However, it does not tighten decisions or alter tactics—no deadline pressure, no live clock that forces a choice. The moon "clearing the skyline" is descriptive rather than causal. Lyric reprise (night moon → same stars) reweights mood but not stakes. Apply +0.8 early signal, +0.4 one beat, +0.7 closure linkage; subtract −0.6 ornamental use, −0.4 no time pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 3 ("dangerous lines"), paragraph 12 ("seed-poem that called for beauty to be forged from anarchy"), paragraph 22 ("believed... single line of poetry could be seed that cracks concrete"). Development: paragraph 13 ("convinced him library could become sanctuary"), paragraph 17 ("anarchy of despair... reshaped into garden"). Closure: paragraph 20 ("greatest verse... not written in ink but in quiet act of rebuilding"), paragraph 30 ("beauty forged from shattered places"). The motivation is signaled early and recurs through metaphor (seed, garden, cracking concrete). It drives the rebuilding choice but is articulated more in reflection than dramatized conflict—no on-page friction between want (forge beauty) and cost (risk, exhaustion, missed escape). The final paragraph states the motivation as thesis. Apply +0.8 early signal, +0.9 two beats, +1.0 closure linkage; subtract −0.8 told-only friction, −0.5 thesis statement.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setup: paragraph 7 ("painting silver ribbons across rust"), paragraph 18 ("luminous fracture across library, silver light splitting rust"). Development: paragraph 23 ("rusted walls shimmered with fractured light, as if night sky had shattered and settled into cracks"), paragraph 31 ("luminous fracture of hope through cracks"). Closure: paragraph 29 ("rusted library under stars... secret garden"), paragraph 32 ("blooming into quiet resistance"). The tone of beauty-within-brokenness (luminous, fractured, rusted, shimmered) is consistent and modulates with pressure: calm opening, intensifying at molt, resolving in the cathedral image. It charges the final reconfiguration (shattered → sanctuary). The metaphor recurs without becoming formulaic and supports the accumulative lens. Irreplaceable: "luminous fracture" is the story's perceptual signature. Apply +0.8 early signal, +1.4 three beats, +1.2 causal pressure (shapes perception under stress), +1.5 closure charge, +0.6 specificity.</comment>
