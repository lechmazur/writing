<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The scribe's interiority remains abstract and label-driven throughout ("lonesome splendor," "geography of healing"), never grounded in embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Her actions—tracing the thread, binding leaves, whispering names—read as ritual gestures without visible cost or competing impulses. The final decision to drop the thread feels unearned; no prior choice forecloses a path or tests commitment. Emotional states are asserted ("a sad smile") rather than shown through perceptual degradation or contradictory impulse.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (lyric patterning, recurrent images), but no meaningful cadence shift or density increase reweights the dominant stake at closure. The ending ("she turned toward the horizon") offers neither Decisive Change nor Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost; the thread's release is symbolic gesture without on-page consequence. Orientation is present early (garden, autumn, palace), so no penalty there. The "geography of healing" remains conceptual metaphor never dramatized as a stake that narrows options or alters knowledge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Autumn garden anchors early with concrete sensory detail (moss-covered statues, dark fountain, golden leaves). The weft thread recurs across multiple beats but remains decorative; it does not constrain a choice or charge the final image with new meaning—merely dropped as symbolic offering. Setting provides atmosphere but does not pressure decision or supply resources that affect outcome, limiting the score despite vivid description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>No dominant stake is tested on the page. The scribe's stated purpose ("understand the geography of healing") remains abstract exposition; no reversal, tightening, or deepening narrows options or forces a trade-off. She writes, binds leaves, whispers names, and walks away—all action without opposition or visible cost. Escalation is absent under any lens; the final release of the thread is untested gesture, not earned choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Theme ("geography of healing," presence/absence, memory as weaving) is stated repeatedly in near-identical phrasing rather than emerging from concrete events. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "she understood that healing was a geography drawn not in lines but in the spaces between," a thesis statement that replaces scene pressure. The weft thread and garden could charge theme, but their recurrence does not reweight prior material—only decorates it. No earned epiphany from struggle on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Voice maintains consistent lyric register with controlled diction and rhythm. Perceptual signature is present (notices "echoes of explained absences," "lonesome splendor") but remains abstract and generic rather than character-specific. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance is stable, and no head-hopping occurs. However, peak moments rely on stock elevated phrasing ("the thought was a weight, but a release") and therapy-adjacent metaphor ("geography of healing") that flattens specificity under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops across adjacent paragraphs reduce momentum: "geography of healing" appears in paraphrase four times; "lonesome splendor" echoes three times; "thread as story/lifeline" recurs without added pressure. Template cadence in the middle third: "She [verb]... She [verb]... She [verb]..." runs across seven consecutive paragraphs without variation. Figurative density is high but often mixed or vague ("seeds of memory could sprout," "tapestries hanging like frozen breath"). Line-level clarity is adequate but momentum drags due to synonym churn and repetitive stems. Apply −0.8 for loops and template cadence under the Non-closure Accumulation Cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Core premise (obituarist for the living, writing presence into absence) offers modest freshness but executes through familiar lyric meditation tropes: autumn garden, symbolic thread, whispered names. Emotional arc and plot function unchanged if setting shifts to any reflective natural space or symbolic object swaps for another fiber/keepsake. No transformation of trope; the scribe's journey reads as writerly exercise in metaphor rather than lived particulars. Middle-ground hedging avoids bold stakes or irreversible choice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Traveler/scribe is present throughout but makes no choice that alters tactics or options. She observes, writes, binds leaves, whispers, and walks—all gestures without opposition or cost. Her role as obituarist frames theme but does not drive a beat. Present, functional, but replaceable with any reflective observer.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Weft thread appears early (paragraph 3), recurs in middle beats (tracing, binding leaves), and is released in the final third. It accumulates symbolic weight (connection to vanished lives, story/lifeline) and the final release reweights its meaning as offering rather than keepsake. However, it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure; its use is decorative and swappable with any symbolic object. Meets two gates (setup, payoff) with lyric reprise, reaching mid-5s, but lacks causal pressure to climb higher.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Explained absences" appears once as thematic echo ("echoes of explained absences, the reasons people gave for leaving") but does not shape stakes or tactics. The concept remains abstract background rather than live conflict. Missing setup, development, and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Vividly descriptive" modifies the scribe's writing style and the narrator's prose but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. The trait is label-only ("vivid details: the scent of rain on stone") without dramatized tradeoff or consequence. Present as atmospheric claim but functionally ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Intimate" appears as label ("intimate gesture," "act felt intimate") twice in adjacent paragraphs but does not define a major turn. The gestures described (tracing thread, binding leaves) could be performed with equal narrative effect as "careful" or "reverent." Swappable modifier without causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Projecting presence" is mentioned once late ("each step she projected presence into the empty spaces") as theme claim but its mechanics are never signaled or dramatized. Does not shape attempts or tactics. Missing all gates.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Shadowed garden in autumn is established early with concrete detail (moss statues, dark fountain, golden leaves falling). Setting provides atmosphere and frames all action; the garden's "quiet splendor" modulates tone and the final release of the thread occurs within its bounds. However, the garden does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it remains backdrop. Meets setup and closure participation but lacks middle development pressure, capping mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"After the last ship sails" anchors timeframe early (paragraph 4) and recurs near the end as reminder of departure. The temporal marker sets a post-exodus atmosphere but does not tighten decisions or create urgency; no live clock alters tactics. Present as atmospheric frame but functionally replaceable with "after the evacuation" or any post-event marker.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"To understand the geography of healing" is stated as purpose (paragraph 5) and repeated in paraphrase three times, but never dramatized as conflicted desire that forces a choice. The scribe pursues this goal through observation and writing without friction, cost, or competing want. Told-only motivation without on-page test.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" recurs four times as phrase or paraphrase, establishing coherent tone across the piece. Tone modulates subtly (quiet reflection → wistful release) and charges the final image of the thread glinting "like a promise." The tone is maintained under light pressure and contributes to closure atmosphere, though it does not shift decisively at a turn. Meets setup, development (sustained), and payoff, reaching low-6s.</comment>
