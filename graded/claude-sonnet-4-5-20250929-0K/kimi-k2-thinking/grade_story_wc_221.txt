<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist is physically embodied through details like the compass rose on the cuff and the act of sketching, but motivation relies heavily on poetic declaration rather than contradictory impulses tested under pressure. The decision to step through the hatch feels inevitable from the opening rather than a choice earned through visible internal conflict. Interiority leans toward abstract philosophizing ("true north was not a place but a decision") rather than character-particular perception that degrades under stress. The final act lacks visible cost that forecloses a legible path; drifting into the void reads more as lyric gesture than a choice with consequences.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens with the recurring compass rose and sketching ritual building toward the final drift. Orientation is delayed—who, where, and when coalesce slowly across the first third without deliberate disorientation that pays off, triggering a −0.3 penalty. Closure offers Charged Poise (protagonist poised at threshold, drifting with supplies and compass), but the cost remains oblique: no visible forfeiture of a live option or tangible price paid on the page. The "new glimmer" functions more as abstract beacon than a dramatized complication that narrows tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The observation deck's time-dilation property is vividly rendered ("seconds into minutes," "stretched time"), and spatial anchors like the glass ring and outer walkway provide coherent choreography. However, the environment primarily serves as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraining a choice or supplying a resource that alters the final move. The compass rose (object-as-micro-setting) does charge the closure image but does not impose a visible tactical constraint. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the protagonist's stargazing focus.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—escape versus remaining—is present but never tightens into a live trade-off with visible cost. The "glimpse" of the new light offers a conceptual pivot, yet no on-page reversal forces the protagonist to weigh competing goods or pay a price. The final decision to drift away feels preordained rather than wrung from contradictory pressures. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is sufficient, but the escalation here is atmospheric rather than a causal narrowing of options or a felt forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the compass rose, sketching ritual, and the "true north of the heart" motif, avoiding overt statement until the penultimate lines. The recurring image of anniversaries and star charts shifts meaning across the piece, from memory-tether to hope-map. However, the closing lines edge toward thematic summary ("direction is a choice, not a destiny") that replaces scene pressure with assertion. The final image of sketching "one star at a time" offers resonance but is slightly undercut by the explanatory tag about "new anniversaries yet to be drawn."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and lyric, with elevated diction ("blessed pariah," "cruel stretch of time") that fits the solitary, reflective stance. Psychic distance remains stable in close third. However, the prose occasionally drifts into poetic abstraction that dulls immediacy ("the echo of the deck's silence following me like a shadow"). Perceptual signature is stargazer-specific but lacks the bias or blind spots that would reveal internal contradiction. The final paragraph's register ("blessed pariah in a gilded compass rose") is awkward—one cannot be "in" an appliqué—suggesting a minor syntactic slip under the lyric mode's pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and mostly coherent, but several beats suffer from paraphrase loops: paragraphs 6–7 restate temporal stretching without advancing pressure, and paragraphs 22–23 recycle "silence" and "echo" in near-identical frames. Template cadence appears in the mid-section (repeated "I [verb]" stems across paragraphs 11–14). Mixed metaphor in the final line: one cannot be "in a gilded compass rose" (the appliqué is worn, not inhabited), breaking physical logic. Applying −0.6 for loops, −0.4 for template runs, and −0.3 for the closure-adjacent metaphor slip totals −1.3 in Q7, with an additional small penalty for the artifact touching the final third, disqualifying 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The combination of time dilation, heirloom compass, and sketching ritual offers a specific synthesis, though the "lone survivor on a derelict station" frame is familiar. The piece commits fully to its lyric, introspective mode and the stargazing POV is character-particular. However, the emotional arc—from isolation to resolve—follows a predictable template without a turn that surprises in hindsight. The "blessed pariah" label and the "true north of the heart" concept lean toward poetic commonplace rather than fresh synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "blessed pariah" status is signaled early and frames the isolation premise, but the character's choices (consulting compass, sketching, stepping through hatch) do not hinge on the pariah attribute specifically. A generic castaway would make identical moves. The trait is ornamental rather than a constraint that alters tactics or enables a key turn.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The gilded compass rose appears in paragraph 4, is consulted in paragraph 12, gleams approvingly in paragraphs 19–20, pulses in paragraph 24, and is named in the final line. It participates in the closure image and is handled across multiple beats, though its "magnetic tug" and alignment mechanics are asserted rather than dramatized as a tactical constraint. Swapping it for any symbolic heirloom would require only minor edits; the compass function is metaphorical, not mechanical.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"True north" is thematized in paragraphs 9, 13, and 24, shaping the protagonist's resolve to "keep moving forward." However, it operates as a motivational metaphor rather than a concept that constrains options or changes tactics on the page. The idea of direction as internal choice is present but does not force a visible trade-off or test. It shapes stakes thematically but does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Temporally stretched" is introduced in paragraph 6 and recurs in paragraphs 15 and 21, where the station's rotation shift offers "a brief window of escape." The attribute enables the final move, though the mechanics remain abstract. The trait does not impose a visible cost or constraint that alters earlier tactics; it functions more as atmospheric condition than a pressure that forces trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The "glimpse" of the unfamiliar glimmer in paragraph 10 ignites the urgency and motivates the protagonist to consult the compass and mark a new destination. It drives the turn from passive observation to active exploration. However, the glimpse could be replaced by any anomalous signal (sound, data ping) with minimal narrative restructuring. It is purposeful but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The family custom of sketching the night sky is seeded in paragraph 5, becomes the protagonist's compass in paragraph 8, and is enacted in paragraphs 18–19 and 27. The method shapes multiple beats and charges the closure image ("sketching my own night sky"). However, the mechanics of the custom (anniversaries, tethering memory) are asserted rather than tested under pressure; the protagonist sketches whenever needed, without visible cost or constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "time dilation observation deck" is named in paragraph 15 and provides the spatial anchor for the protagonist's vigil and final departure. The deck's rotation offers "a brief window of escape," but this constraint is told rather than dramatized as a tactical pressure. The setting is vivid and atmospheric but does not force a choice or supply a resource that alters the outcome in a way a generic derelict station would not.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the shutdown" is established in paragraph 2 and frames the protagonist's isolation. The timeframe is static backdrop rather than a tightening clock; no deadline or temporal pressure shapes the decision to leave. The "brief window" in paragraph 21 hints at urgency but is not developed into a live constraint that alters moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The motivation "to turn confusion into exploration" is explicitly stated in paragraph 11 and recurs in the final lines. The desire is declared and the protagonist acts on it by stepping through the hatch, but the motivation is not dramatized through conflicting wants or a visible cost. The "confusion" is asserted rather than embodied in contradictory impulses that the protagonist must navigate under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Echoed silence" is introduced in paragraph 1, recurs in paragraphs 7, 17, 22, 26, and 29, and modulates from oppressive ("deep… silence") to companionable ("my own, no longer echoed"). The tone is coherent and charges the final image of solitary drift. However, the modulation is smooth rather than pressured; the tone does not tighten or break under the protagonist's decision, remaining lyric and introspective throughout.</comment>
