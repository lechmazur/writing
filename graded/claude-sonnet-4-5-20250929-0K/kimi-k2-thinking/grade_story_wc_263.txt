<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist remains an abstraction throughout—"moonstruck dreamer" is label-only, with no embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Interiority consists of stock poetic phrasing ("the voice of creation had been locked away") rather than character-particular thought. The journey and return are summarized in elevated register without dramatized struggle or visible cost that would distinguish endurance from convenience. No meaningful change is earned; the final creative flow is declared rather than shown through a foreclosed path or trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation remains vague: "beneath her window" and "the attic" never anchor a specific dwelling or locale, and "the edge of the world" is pure abstraction. The journey north is summarized in one sentence with no causal linkage or motivated ellipsis. Closure reads as assertion—"her creativity… now flowed"—without an on-page decisive change, visible cost, or reconfiguration that makes a before/after legible. The sextant's use is described but never constrains a choice or alters options; the falling star is a single passive observation, not a turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The aurora and archway are vivid but static—postcard description without constraining a choice. The sextant appears twice (attic, then placed on ice) but is handled ceremonially rather than as a tool that shapes tactics. Spatial choreography is loose: the attic's location, the journey's terrain, and the archway's physical relationship to the ice block remain unclear. The body and the ice are present at the ending but do not charge the final image with cost; the protagonist simply "woke" and returned.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—freeing trapped creativity—is declared but never tested by a meaningful tightening or reversal. The journey introduces no complication; the archway grants passive access. The protagonist traces a falling star, rests, and wakes "cured" without a choice that forecloses a path or visible price paid. Coincidence (finding the archway, the star's appearance, the dawn timing) resolves the problem the protagonist did not help create. No escalation occurs under any lens; the piece presents a wish-fulfillment arc without agency or cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme is stated overtly—"creativity is simply the universe remembering itself"—rather than emerging from dramatized events. The trapped-creativity metaphor is repeated in multiple registers ("cocoon," "veil of ice," "star behind a veil") without variation in meaning or pressure. The ending's thematic claim ("flowed like a river of stardust") is asserted in the same voice that opened the piece, with no reconfiguration or ambiguity. Subtext is absent; every motif (aurora, stardust, archway) is explained within the same paragraph it appears.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent but generic, relying on stock poetic constructions ("silken shadows," "whispered secrets," "luminous scar") that could fit any mystical-journey template. Distance is stable third-limited but offers no perceptual signature—the protagonist's way of noticing is indistinguishable from the narrator's tour-guide descriptions. Psychic distance never modulates; the prose maintains the same elevated register in crisis ("let the silence enfold her") and resolution ("each line a meteor's streak"). No dialogue appears to test voice distinction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "unspoken words" / "silent language," "trapped creativity" / "block," "stardust" / "remembered stardust" / "memory of stardust" recur without added pressure. Template cadence appears in runs like "She heard… She sought… She decided… She set… She felt… She lay… She dreamed… She lifted… She thought…" across the piece. Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating density without clarity. Mixed metaphors: "silent language that curled like smoke" and "creativity… trapped like a star behind a veil of ice" then "flowed like a river." These artifacts touch the closure paragraph, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise—artist's block cured by mystical journey—is a widely used template executed without transformation. The sextant, aurora, and stardust are stock symbols of cosmic connection; no specific detail (the grandmother's story, the journey's hardship, the archway's stone texture) alters stakes or worldview. The resolution is frictionless wish-fulfillment; no choice or renunciation personalizes the arc. The piece reads as a checklist of provided elements (moonstruck dreamer, astronomical instrument, aurora archway) arranged in predictable sequence without fresh synthesis or risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The "moonstruck dreamer" label appears in the opening line and is described throughout but never makes a choice that creates a turn. The protagonist observes, travels (summarized), rests passively, and wakes cured. Decisions are narrated in past tense without on-page deliberation or visible cost: "She decided to travel north" arrives without conflict or foreclosed alternative.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The sextant appears in two beats: found in the attic (paragraph 6), placed on ice and aligned with a star (paragraph 12). Its use is ceremonial—alignment does not constrain a choice or reveal new information. The final beat mentions polishing and boxing it, a cameo without causal work. The object is present across setup, middle, and ending but remains decorative; removing it would require only minor substitution (a compass, a star chart) without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Remembered stardust" is introduced as theme (paragraph 17: "creativity is simply the universe remembering itself") and echoed in the ending paragraphs. It does not shape stakes or tactics on the page; no choice hinges on understanding or rejecting this concept. The phrase functions as metaphorical decoration rather than a rule or constraint that alters options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>The attribute "hears unspoken words" is declared in paragraphs 2–3 but never enables or constrains an on-page action. The protagonist does not use this ability to make a choice, and no cost or trade-off is dramatized. It remains a label without mechanical or emotional consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Rest" is signaled as goal ("promised rest"), enacted on the page (paragraph 15: "finally allowed herself to rest"), and credited in the resolution (the block broken after waking). The action participates in setup, middle, and closure. However, it is passive—lying down and sleeping—and easily swappable with meditation, contemplation, or any receptive state. The cost is not visible; no trade-off or foreclosed path is dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The method "tracing the path of falling stars" appears in paragraph 12 (aligning the sextant with a falling star) and is credited in paragraph 23 ("her pen moved as if guided by the falling stars she had traced"). It is present at setup (implied by sextant) and closure (metaphorically), but the mechanics are vague—one star is mentioned, and "tracing" is described as feeling "the quiet rhythm" rather than a specific procedure that shapes attempts.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The "aurora-lit archway" is introduced at paragraph 10, reached at paragraph 10, and remains the location through the rest/dream sequence to the ending. It appears in setup, middle, and closure, but functions as backdrop. The archway's stone, the ribbons of light, and the ice block are described but do not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. The protagonist could have rested under open sky with the same result.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The "unwritten calendar" appears in paragraphs 8 and 26 as metaphor; it does not function as a tracked timeframe. The journey duration is summarized as "long," the rest/dream cycle has no clock, and the return is instantaneous. Time does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; the element is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"To free trapped creativity" is stated in paragraph 5 and drives the journey premise. It reappears in closure paragraphs (24–25: "Her creativity… now flowed"). The motivation is present across setup and ending, but it is told rather than dramatized through friction between wants and costs. No on-page choice weighs creativity against another value; the goal is simply granted after rest.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Shadowed rapture" is announced in paragraph 14 ("a shadowed rapture over the ice, a dance of light and dark") and echoed in paragraph 24 ("sang with the shadowed rapture of the aurora"). The tone is coherent—mixing melancholy and wonder—and returns at closure, but it does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image with cost. The effect is static mood rather than tonal shift that reweights stakes.</comment>
