<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lin's motivation is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The "quiet courage stir beneath the fear" moment reads as therapeutic self-awareness rather than embodied struggle. The dog's recovery involves no meaningful choice from Lin—the animal simply waits in a cove. The ferry guides' role as external wisdom-givers prevents Lin from earning the shift internally through on-page pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—who Lin is, why they came, and what the leash break costs remain vague past 120 words. The closure unit (finding the dog) lacks visible cost: Lin runs, reunites, and walks away enriched by a lesson delivered by others. The star-stamped ticket is introduced, marked, mentioned again, then dropped into sand without altering any choice. No meaningful tightening occurs; the ferry crossing and ridgeway traversal are transit, not pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sensory texture is present—salt, pine, mossy stone, fireflies—but remains postcard description. The ridgeway and cove do not constrain or enable Lin's choices; the dog is simply waiting. The ferry and lantern anchor the scene visually, yet spatial choreography across multiple locations (shore, boat, opposite bank, ridgeway, cove) blurs without clear distances or thresholds.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (finding the dog) is signaled early but never tightened. Lin decides to traverse the ridgeway, rides the ferry, walks more ridgeway, and arrives at the cove where the dog sits unharmed—no reversal, no foreclosed option, no price paid. The ferry guides' permission and the ticket punch are procedural, not pressure. Coincidence resolves the central problem without agency or cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Unused courage" is stated four times but never tested in scene—Lin does not face a choice that requires courage, only patience. The shoreline lullaby and star-stamped ticket recur as symbols without constraining action or reweighting meaning at closure. The final paragraph moralizes the theme overtly: "courage is always there, waiting to be used." The resolution offers no non-literal answer, only restated premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, and the perceptual filter (fog, twilight, lantern glow) is consistent. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("threshold," "persistence of their steps," "talisman of courage") that abstracts rather than grounds. The ferry guides' dialogue ("Sometimes the courage we haven't used is the brightest star we carry") reads as authorial wisdom rather than character-specific speech. Free indirect style is clean but lacks distinct rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Template cadence pervades: "The air smelled of salt and pine, and the wind hummed…" / "The boat slipped across the water, the oars making soft plashes…" / "Lin's heart swelled, and they ran…" Paraphrase loops cluster in the final third—"quiet courage," "gentle persistence," "shoreline lullaby" recur without added pressure. Stock phrases ("held its breath," "world seemed to exhale") and synonym churn ("gentle, persistent" appears six times) dull momentum. The closure beat is touched by scaffold: "the journey, though indirect, was theirs to traverse."</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise—lost pet, symbolic journey, wise guides, return—follows a familiar template without transformation. The star stamp, ridgeway, and lullaby are ornamental rather than lived-in. The emotional arc (fear → patience → reunion → insight) resolves predictably. No bold risk or non-obvious synthesis; the piece hedges toward safe symbolism and gentle resolution without stakes or surprise.</comment>
