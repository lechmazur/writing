<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kaelen's motivation to understand sound's texture is clear and drives her experiment, but her interior remains largely declarative rather than embodied under pressure. The interaction with Mara introduces genuine friction—"You're wasting time... 99.7% accuracy"—yet Kaelen's response feels abstractly confident rather than conflicted. The final beat where Mara touches the lens and whispers "It feels warm... Like it breathes" hints at change, but the cost of this discovery for either character is largely implied rather than forecloses a visible path. Interiority trends toward thematic exposition ("the proof that being heard meant being changed") instead of concrete contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when by the opening paragraph (laboratory, post-power-grid, Dr. Kaelen) and pursues an accumulative lens: the experiment deepens through setup, lens adjustment, prism-song refraction, and Mara's touch. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration—the laboratory becomes a cathedral, "the space between them, textured and golden and impossibly alive"—with conceptual cost legible in Kaelen's acknowledgment that her data will be "dismissed as corrupted data." However, the cost feels more asserted than dramatized; no on-page consequence visibly forecloses a tactical or relational path. The accumulative pattern holds, but the final image reweights meaning more through declaration than through a charged physical or relational shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The laboratory is richly detailed—salvaged acoustic panels, holographic grid reconstructions, centrifuge modified to whisper-speed—and these elements ground the action. The carbide lens suspended in the centrifuge constrains Kaelen's experiment and charges the final image when Mara touches it. Golden shadows function as micro-setting, thickening the air and becoming "a landscape she could climb." Spatial choreography is clean (lens on workbench, then suspended, then touched), and the environment shapes the peak choice: the one-degree off-center adjustment that reveals hidden harmonics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering "the texture of connection"—is signaled early and pursued through Kaelen's experimental adjustments. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mara challenges her ("99.7% accuracy") and Kaelen responds by deliberately introducing flaw, which transforms the prism-song. However, the reversal feels more conceptual than causal; Mara's skepticism doesn't materially narrow Kaelen's options or raise cost, and the "corrupted data" consequence is anticipated rather than felt. The piece deepens understanding but lacks a visible price that alters tactics or forecloses a path on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme—connection requires imperfection—emerges from the carbide lens's "scarred" quality and the 0.3% "error" reframed as "the entire point." The final image of golden shadows "pulsing softly like a remembered heartbeat" offers resonance, but arrives through overt statement: "the beautiful imperfection that makes connection real." The prism-song and texture motifs recur, yet the conceptual architecture often declares rather than dramatizes: "being heard meant being changed" and "the only relic was the space between them" read as authorial summary. The piece invites reflection but leans on thematic echo in place of earned particulars at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third around Kaelen; perceptual signature is present in her focus on acoustic detail and light refraction. However, diction drifts into elevated register during peak beats: "the grain of wooden pews worn smooth by desperate prayer" and "the space between them, textured and golden and impossibly alive" feel more like authored prose than Kaelen's urgent thought under pressure. Dialogue with Mara is purposeful and goal-driven ("What if the 0.3% isn't error, but the entire point?"), yet both characters' speech shares a similar philosophical cadence. Free indirect style is mostly clean, though the final paragraph's meta-commentary ("After the power grid stabilized, people wanted certainty") reads as narrator intrusion rather than character perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense throughout—"golden shadows pooled beneath it like molasses," "sound became a landscape she could climb"—but coherence holds. Template cadence appears in several runs: "Each panel preserved... laughter from... whale songs from... the creak of wooden doors" and "The sound didn't just fill the room; it became..." Minor paraphrase loops occur: "artificial pilgrimage" is explained twice (paragraphs 3 and 6). The final third stacks thematic declarations—"texture of connection," "the proof that being heard meant being changed," "the beautiful imperfection"—that reduce propulsion. Information density is high early, then dips into conceptual restatement at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The laboratory-of-lost-sounds premise and prism-song technique offer a fresh frame, and the carbide lens as imperfect focusing tool is specific. However, the emotional arc—older expert validates intuition against younger skeptic—follows a familiar template, and the thematic payoff ("imperfection is the point") is signaled early and restated rather than transformed. The acoustic-heritage worldbuilding (whale songs from dead oceans, collapsed cities) reads as evocative set-dressing without shaping choices. Risk-taking in the holographic pilgrimage concept is present but underexploited; Mara's conversion feels inevitable rather than earned through friction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaelen is present throughout, her prism-song technique drives the setup and climax (ringing the bell, adjusting the lens off-center), and her role shapes the closure image. She makes the key choice to introduce flaw and interprets the result, altering Mara's stance. The bell-ringer identity constrains her method and charges the final beat when she "ring[s] the bell once more."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The carbide lens appears on the workbench in paragraph 2, is suspended in the centrifuge in paragraph 4, adjusted off-center in paragraph 5, and touched by Mara in the final beat ("It feels warm... Like it breathes"). Its scarred, imperfect curvature is the story's central mechanism—"bend not just photons but the very echo of sound"—and the one-degree flaw enables the hidden harmonics. Removing it would collapse the experimental logic and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Artificial pilgrimage is introduced in paragraph 3 (holographic reconstructions of sacred spaces) and returns in paragraph 6 as a conceptual realization: "never meant to replace the real journey... a map whose true purpose was to show where the trail disappeared." It shapes the thematic question but does not constrain an on-page tactical choice or narrow options during the experiment. Its role is primarily metaphorical anchor rather than causal stake.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Powerfully gentle" is applied twice as a direct label: Kaelen's smile in paragraph 5 and the bell's sound in the final paragraph. Neither instance dramatizes a visible tradeoff or cost; the trait functions as descriptor rather than constraint. No on-page action hinges on gentleness preventing force or power requiring restraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Propel" appears four times, often in the phrase "questioning assumptions... propelled her forward" and "propel them both through assumptions." The lens adjustment that "propel[s] the experiment forward" triggers the harmonic transformation, a key turn. However, the action is somewhat generic—"advance" or "drive" could substitute with minor edits—and its mechanical specificity is limited. It shapes multiple beats but lacks irreplaceable texture.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Questioning assumptions is signaled early ("Her method, questioning assumptions, propelled her forward") and enacted when Kaelen asks "What if the 0.3% isn't error, but the entire point?" This question prompts the deliberate flaw introduction that reveals hidden harmonics. The method is stated and demonstrated, shaping the climactic choice. Slight deduction for the label-only phrasing "questioning assumptions" repeated across paragraphs without varied embodiment.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The laboratory is established in the opening line and detailed with acoustic panels, holographic grid, centrifuge, and workbench. The space supplies the tools (lens, bell, sensors) and the "lost sounds" archived in panels pressure the thematic question. The golden shadows that "thicken the air" and Mara's entry with atmospheric-sensor data root the experiment spatially. The lab's function—preserving auditory heritage—directly enables and constrains Kaelen's research.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "three weeks after the power grid stabilized" anchors the opening and returns in the penultimate paragraph: "After the power grid stabilized, people wanted certainty." It establishes context—equipment waking from slumber, a post-crisis recovery—but does not tighten on-page decisions or create a live clock. The experiment unfolds without time pressure; the stabilization is backdrop rather than tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Discovering "the texture of connection" is stated in paragraph 2 as Kaelen's core motivation and pursued throughout the experiment. Friction appears in Mara's challenge (digital models vs. physical artifacts) and in Kaelen's awareness that her findings will be dismissed. The motivation drives the lens adjustment and interpretive choices, though the cost—professional dismissal—is anticipated rather than dramatized. The desire shapes the ending's conceptual repricing.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Golden shadows appear in paragraph 2 (lens creates them), paragraph 4 (they pool and thicken), paragraph 5 (they dance around Mara), and the final image (they pulse "like a remembered heartbeat"). The tone is consistent—warm, soft, breath-like—and modulates with the experiment's intensity. The shadows function as recurring visual motif that charges the closure. Slight deduction: the shadows are described more than they constrain action, trending toward atmospheric accent rather than tactical pressure.</comment>
