<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and her psychometry ability drives action, but interior experience leans abstract—"spatially imaginative mind mapping each wire as constellation memory" tells rather than shows through specific micro-choices under pressure. The final choice to absorb the Rialto's archive is legible but arrives through passive reception (the map "tattooed itself") rather than a difficult decision that forecloses alternatives with visible cost. Embodied emotion is sparse; peak moments ("wept as map settled") summarize rather than dramatize contradictory impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: fragments accumulate toward a final density shift when Mira becomes the archive. Orientation anchors arrive late—who/where/when are clear by ~250 words, but "crystal gazer" and "psychometry" remain opaque until the method is demonstrated, creating mild disorientation debt (−0.3). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (she carries the love-storage map forward), but the cost is asserted ("soul migrated") rather than shown through a foreclosed path or visible trade-off. The incubation sequence loops conceptually without escalating pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The projection booth is vividly rendered with purposeful detail—carbon arc housing, Simplex projector, Maltese cross movement—that grounds Mira's work and charges the final image. The crystal and film strip function as micro-setting elements that constrain psychometry action. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mira's professional focus (mechanical heartbeat, amber sludge hum). The booth's architecture as "storage unit" directly shapes the thematic closure, meeting the 9+ gate for constraint/charge.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—find where unused love is stored—is signaled early but pressure remains static through the incubation vigil. The "map" arrival is granted rather than earned through escalating attempts or trade-offs. No meaningful reversal or tightening occurs; Mira's agency is passive reception. Cost is declared ("carried Rialto's stored love") but not dramatized as a foreclosed alternative or burden that alters tactics. Under the Accumulative lens one deepening is sufficient, but the density does not perceptibly increase until the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—love unused changes address, never disappears—emerges organically from the projection booth as vault and the goodbye letters as transfer protocol. The concept avoids didacticism and the final image (map glowing through clothes, "next palace") offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Mira's personal unused love for Elena is woven in without forcing symmetry. One slip: "recipients were every wall" edges toward thematic echo but recovers quickly into image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-close with a distinct lyric texture—"celluloid ghosts," "neutron star matter," "hushed thunder"—that matches the archival, incantatory subject. Diction is elevated but consistent, though "spatially imaginative" and "psychometry reading" repeat as labels without fully inhabiting Mira's perceptual signature. Filter verbs ("saw," "felt," "understood") cluster in the revelation sequence, dulling immediacy. No dialogue present; interior voice is coherent but leans abstract under pressure rather than fragmenting or sharpening with stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—"coiled like sleeping snake," "compacted, became dense as neutron star matter," "lullaby for love"—but metaphors occasionally clash (love as both neutron star and storage node) and the register never modulates with urgency. Paraphrase loops appear: "unused love" and "stored love" cycle across adjacent lines without added meaning. Template cadence: "She saw unused love stored... It nested in angles... It compacted..." (three parallel constructions in succession) flattens rhythm. Information density is uneven; the incubation vigil repeats conceptual ground. Artifacts touch closure ("map settled into skin" is told, not shown), triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise—psychometry reader preserving a theater's emotional archive—synthesizes archival nostalgia and love-as-artifact in a fresh frame. Execution transforms the trope through specific mechanical detail (Maltese cross, silver nitrate) and the goodbye-letters-as-film conceit. Risk-taking is moderate: the lyric register and abstract stakes limit immediate tension. The piece commits fully to its metaphysical premise but the safe ending (Mira walks toward the next vault) avoids harder costs. Transformation test passes; emotional specificity (Elena, pit cellist) grounds universals.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and her psychometry drives the incubation action, touching setup (finds film), development (places strip in tank), and payoff (receives map). However, her choices are passive—decisions made for her by the crystal's revelation rather than active problem-solving under constraint. No visible cost tied to her agency; the map "tattooed itself" rather than requiring sacrifice. Two beats (find strip, incubate) but low causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Film strip appears in setup (found coiled), development (incubated in chemical bath), and payoff (dissolves into map). Handled across three beats with purposeful evolution—static artifact → psychometry conduit → dissolved cartography. The strip's sprocket holes and frames hold the goodbye letters, tying it to the core concept. Swappable with another archival object (newsreel, ticket stub) without major structural change; specificity is moderate. Closure linkage is strong but the strip itself does not constrain a choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Goodbye letters shape the central mystery (what they are) and the revelation (transfer protocols for unused love). Present in setup (frames hold sentences), development (letters "began to speak" as geometries), and payoff (letters delivered to walls/seats). The concept narrows Mira's interpretive work and charges the thematic closure. Causal pressure is moderate—letters guide rather than constrain. Cost connection: letters carry the weight of unspoken feeling that Mira now archives, a conceptual burden made legible in the ending.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Spatially imaginative" is introduced early and recurs as a label but never demonstrates a constraint or enables a tactic with cost. It describes Mira's perceptual mode (mapping wires, seeing molecular structure) but these remain ornamental—no choice hinges on this trait versus another. The attribute could be swapped for "intuitive" or "sensitive" with minor edits. Missing middle development; no visible trade-off tied to this specific capability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Incubation is signaled in the motivation and executed on-page: Mira suspends the film strip in the chemical bath with the crystal beneath. This action structures the middle vigil and produces the map at closure. Two beats (decision to incubate, night vigil) with purpose. However, the mechanics are passive—Mira waits rather than adjusting method under pressure. Swappable with another ritual (burning, projecting) without breaking logic. Causal role is functional but not indispensable; no felt cost during the act itself.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Psychometry reading is introduced early ("her method was psychometry reading"), demonstrated in the first action beat (pressed glass against film strip, images came as letters), and shapes the incubation payoff (hand on tank, "psychometry reading incubation as it unfolded"). The method enables Mira's access to the archive and constrains her to touch-based interaction. Three beats with mechanical consistency. Cost: she must absorb the archive bodily, a burden tied directly to the method. Strong integration; the story's logic depends on this exact means.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The projection booth is present throughout: setup (carbon arc housing, Simplex projector, fire shutter), development (booth as "central node, distributor of all unspent affection"), and payoff (booth "stood empty behind her, work finished"). The setting supplies the film strip, the chemical tank, and the architecture-as-storage metaphor that drives the thematic revelation. Mechanical detail (Maltese cross movement, motor drive squeak) stores Elena-love, linking setting to personal stake. Environment constrains action (must work in the booth to access archive) and charges closure. Indispensable to logic and tone.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Forgotten lyrics search for tune" is introduced early as ambient sound and recurs at the closure beat ("forgotten lyrics below suddenly found tune, final verse ringing clear"). The timeframe is poetic but vague—night falls, vigil occurs, morning arrives—without pressure. The lyrics' resolution coincides with Mira's map but does not constrain her timing or tactics. Lyric reprise reweights mood but adds no cost. Missing middle development as a live clock; functional but replaceable with any duration marker.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mira's motivation—find where unused love is stored—is declared early ("motivation burned clear") and drives the incubation choice. Present in setup, development (vigil to locate storage), and payoff (she becomes the archive). The desire is consistent but not conflicted on the page; no friction between want and cost until the ending asserts burden. Two beats with purpose but the stakes remain abstract rather than visceral. Causal role is solid; the story's arc depends on this exact question. Cost connection is conceptual ("soul migrated") rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Hushed thunder" appears three times: early setup ("hushed thunder of revelation built in her chest"), midpoint ("humming hushed thunder of ninety years' unspoken weight"), and final line ("crystal in pocket pulsed...humming hushed thunder"). The tone is coherent—quiet intensity, compressed power—and modulates slightly (builds → passed through → pulses) to charge the ending. However, the phrase itself is a label rather than an embodied tonal texture; the prose does not consistently deliver that oxymoronic tension outside the tag. Functional reprise with moderate closure charge but swappable with another paradox (silent roar, heavy whisper).</comment>
