<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's interior journey from euthanasia tourist to volunteer is present but executed through summary and abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. The shift "no longer felt the need to grip reality loosely; it held her firmly now" arrives as assertion without the micro-choices under pressure that would earn it. Interiority relies heavily on poetic label-speak ("fold in patience," "grips reality loosely") that remains ornamental rather than constraining action. The grandmother's parasol functions more as symbolic furniture than a concrete object that shapes a choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive quickly (drift-ice marina, volunteer context), and the accumulative/textural lens is signaled early through recurring images. However, the closure unit—her decision to continue volunteering and accept "windborne solace"—lacks a legible cost that forecloses a path; she arrived seeking death and leaves choosing life, but the transition occurs through poetic summary rather than a dramatized tightening or renunciation with stakes on the page. The "euthanasia tourist" frame is dropped rather than paid off with visible consequence. The middle trawling beats feel ornamental rather than narrowing options toward the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (ice groaning, pale gold light, creaking pilings), and the cold environment pressures the protagonist's physical experience. The recurring lace parasol tip appears in multiple beats but remains largely decorative; it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics. Spatial choreography is clear throughout (dock, ice, boathouse), and the frozen setting charges the final moonlit image, though the effect is more atmospheric than causal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—seeking an ending versus finding continuation—is signaled early but never tightens through a concrete dilemma or trade-off. The ice crack at midpoint ("the sound of approaching endings she had been seeking") could serve as a pressure point but deflates into contemplation rather than forcing a choice. Her shift to volunteering occurs off-stage; we see her already working with supplies rather than witnessing the decision's cost. The accumulative design requires a cadence shift or pattern break that reweights the stake; instead, the ending restates the thematic premise without visible forfeit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The central question—can endings be gentle continuations rather than violent breaks—emerges clearly from imagery and the protagonist's arc. The lace parasol and ice sounds recur purposefully, building a pattern of "graceful endings." However, the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "every ending could be a beginning" and "keeper of small mercies" state the theme rather than letting the image carry it. The phrase "euthanasia tourist...would leave as" explicitly articulates the transformation, replacing earned resonance with summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct lyric register; perceptual filtering is consistent (ice as mirror, wind as chorus). However, elevated diction pervades even high-pressure beats without variation: "windborne solace," "fold in patience," "grips reality loosely" repeat as formula rather than modulating under stress. The prose maintains poetic compression throughout but sacrifices embodied immediacy; the narrator observes the protagonist's transformation from a poeticized distance rather than inhabiting her visceral uncertainty. No dialogue appears, appropriately for the solitary frame.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Recurring phrases and template constructions accumulate: "She [verb]" sentence stems dominate, and figurative language ("lace tip a ghost," "ice groan...a deep resonant sigh," "wind...a chorus of whispers") appears in nearly every paragraph without pattern-teaching or payoff. Multiple paraphrase loops: "the sound of approaching endings" appears four times with minimal variation, and "windborne solace" recurs as decorative refrain. The final third stacks these motifs mechanically rather than charging them with new pressure, triggering the high-density artifact penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The "euthanasia tourist finds life through disaster relief" premise follows a familiar redemptive arc without fresh transformation; the lace parasol and ice marina dress the concept but do not alter its emotional or moral calculus in a non-obvious way. The protagonist's journey from seeking death to accepting life proceeds without complication or counter-pressure that would render the outcome less predictable. Lyric compression offers textural interest but does not compensate for the template emotional trajectory.</comment>
