<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's role as "dynasty ender" remains abstract; interiority consists largely of stock receptive states ("his heart a drum," "breath caught") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The grandmother's whispered tales and the discovery of the true heir are told rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. The final shift from "ender" to "keeper" arrives as assertion without visible cost or foreclosed path on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, sepia reading room, evening) appear early, but causality is weak: the gramophone's standing waves conjure a visual silhouette and whispered name without prior setup of how sound creates images or why this particular melody unlocks genealogical truth. The closure unit—realizing his role is to remember rather than end—lacks visible cost; he simply leaves carrying the melody, with no on-page foreclosure of options or trade-off. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural (density of golden-shadow motifs), but the final reconfiguration is asserted rather than earned through pattern break or cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The sepia reading room is vividly rendered with cracked spines, amber lamplight, and mahogany gramophone, and the gramophone's physical presence (tarnished crank, mahogany shell) constrains the protagonist's ritual. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. However, the room functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop; no environmental feature (locked door, missing tool, fading light) alters tactics or charges the final image when he departs into the night.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—uncovering the hidden truth to sever lineage threads—is signaled early, but escalation is minimal: he finds the crank, turns it, hears the melody, sees the silhouette, and learns the name in a smooth sequence without reversals or trade-offs. The final realization that his role is to remember rather than end arrives without visible cost (no renunciation of revenge, no stamina loss, no social price paid on the page). Under the Accumulative lens, one tightening or deepening is sufficient, but here the texture simply accumulates decorative motifs rather than narrowing options or forcing a choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme—memory as preservation versus destruction—emerges from the central reversal, but the shift from "ender" to "keeper" is told in the line "he understood now" rather than dramatized through a non-literal image or action that reweights prior material. The golden-shadows motif recurs frequently yet remains ornamental; no particular shadow constrains a choice or charges the closure. The piece avoids overt moralizing but also lacks the specificity to generate a resonant, ambiguous aftereffect.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV distance is stable and third-limited, but the narrative voice is generic literary-sepia without perceptual signature: "his heart a drum," "eloquent silence," "bridge of intuition" read as imported diction rather than the protagonist's idiom under pressure. Repeated phrases ("golden shadows" ×7, "first yawn of evening" ×4, "eloquently silent" ×3, "bridge of intuition" ×3) create template cadence rather than purposeful variation. Filter-verb stacks ("he felt," "he listened," "he stared," "he smiled") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats without voice motivation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dense phrase recycling pervades the text: "golden shadows" (7×), "first yawn of evening" (4×), "eloquently silent" (3×), "bridge of intuition" (3×), "standing waves" (4×), "sepia reading room" (3×), creating paraphrase loops and synonym churn that obscure causality at closure ("the golden shadows of memory"). Mixed metaphor: "turning pages into a symphony of light" conflates tactile and auditory vehicles. Template cadence runs ("He lifted… He approached… He turned… He listened… He stared… He smiled…") across multiple paragraphs. Applying the patterned-artifact penalty pack: baseline −1.2 in Q7 for spread across beats including closure; artifacts touch the final third, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core premise—hidden genealogical truth revealed via standing-wave acoustics—offers a surface novelty, but the emotional arc (revenge-seeker becomes keeper) follows a familiar template without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The gramophone, standing waves, and whispered ancestor function as genre furniture rather than organically necessary elements that grow from character need. The protagonist's realization is asserted rather than earned in hindsight from prior particulars, and the closure image (walking into twilight carrying melody) reads as stock poetic exit.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The "dynasty ender" appears throughout but makes no key choices: he searches, finds the crank, turns it, listens, and departs. The shift to "keeper" is asserted rather than decided with visible cost. Present in setup and ending but swappable with "genealogist" or "last heir" with minor edits. Ornamental use without causal pressure: −0.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The gramophone crank handle appears in three beats: discovered in hollowed pages (mid), inserted and turned to release sound (mid-late), and rests gleaming as talisman at closure. It enables the standing-wave ritual but does not constrain choice (no broken handle, no stamina cost to turn). Present in setup, middle, and ending; lyric reprise reweights meaning slightly. Functional across beats but lacks irreplaceable specificity or visible cost tied to its use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Bridge of intuition" is mentioned four times as label-only theme claim without shaping on-page tactics or altering options. The protagonist does not choose intuition over evidence, nor does intuition fail or exact a price. Ornamental phrase that could be cut without changing plot or closure: −1.0.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Eloquently silent" appears three times as descriptor ("his presence eloquently silent," "her silence had always been eloquent," "his silence a song") without constraining or enabling action. No trade-off shown between silence and speech; no beat where silence forecloses an option. Label-only trait: −0.9.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Muse" appears in one sentence ("Musing on the past, he recalled…") as synonym for "recall" and once more ("He mused on each note…") without driving a turn. The protagonist's reflection does not alter tactics or create a reversal. Swappable with "reflect" or "consider"; summary-only use: −0.8.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Standing waves" are mentioned four times and described as forming visual patterns that reveal the ancestor's silhouette. The method is signaled mid-story and present at closure, but its mechanics are asserted rather than dramatized (why does sound create a visual echo? how does the protagonist know to look for it?). Introduced after the 40% mark, cap 4.6. Resolves the genealogical mystery it did not help create, cap 3.0. Lowest cap wins: 3.0. Slight closure linkage lifts slightly within band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The sepia reading room is established early, described vividly, and frames the entire action. It provides the gramophone and creates atmosphere but does not pressure choices (no closing library, no intruder, no fading light that forces haste). Present in setup and ending; setting as backdrop rather than constraint. Two-gate presence (setup, ending) with lyric reprise eligible to ~6.3, but lacks causal pressure: mid 5s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"First yawn of evening" recurs four times as poetic marker without tightening decisions or tracking elapsed time. The protagonist's ritual unfolds at indefinite pace; no clock pressure alters tactics. Timeframe is static mood rather than constraint. Present in setup and ending but ornamental: cap 4.6 for late integration, further reduced for no causal work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to uncover a hidden truth" is stated early and drives the search for the journal and crank. The protagonist's years-long quest is summarized rather than shown in conflicted micro-choices, but the goal is present across beats and the closure pivots on discovering the erased heir's name. Setup, middle presence (finding crank), and ending participation; functional but lacks on-page friction between want and cost during key beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Golden shadows" recurs seven times as consistent visual motif, establishing sepia-lit melancholy. Tone remains static throughout without modulating under pressure (discovery and departure carry identical lyrical register). Present in setup and ending but does not charge the final image with new meaning or shift cadence to reflect the protagonist's transformation. Lyric reprise without reweighting: mid-4s.</comment>
