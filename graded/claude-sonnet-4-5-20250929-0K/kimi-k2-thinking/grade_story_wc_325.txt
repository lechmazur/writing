<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marek's claustrophobia and mission to honor dead colleagues are clearly embodied through "compressed spaces where bulkheads pressed like closing fists" and the tactical choice to return despite panic. Interior contradictions—wanting to honor the dead while fighting physical terror—drive consistent micro-choices (kneeling in water, syncing with traces). The seven-second witness act forecloses the safer option of merely documenting, and the cost is visible in the panic-driven ascent. Minor: backstory on the incident is extensive but anchors present choices sufficiently.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Marek stands witness for seven seconds, fulfilling the mission with conceptual cost—the names remain erased, yet the human price is acknowledged—then retreats as the tide forces withdrawal. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density increases through phase-transition language and cable-relay imagery, culminating in the charged codex-closing beat. Orientation anchors (submersible, facility, Marek, tidal window) land within the opening ~100 words. One tightening: water rising forces the exit, narrowing options and charging the final ascent.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The flooded facility, tidal window, and phase-transition chambers constrain every move: Marek must sync entry with the forty-seven-minute air pocket and retreat before drowning. The codex (gold flecks warming, then cooling) tracks invisible residues and charges the closure image. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through Marek's augmented perception ("electromagnetic ghostprints," "glaciers calving"). Spatial choreography remains coherent across moon pool, corridors, and server cradle. The undersea-cable setting informs world logic but does not directly shape a peak choice beyond serving as the data repository.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—bearing witness to the erased colleagues—is signaled immediately and tightens as water rises and claustrophobia grips. One meaningful escalation: reaching the relay room and syncing with the traces narrows options (stay and drown, or leave now), forcing the seven-second act that forecloses easier memorialization. Agency is clear: Marek chooses to kneel and sync rather than record or salvage. The rising tide adds urgency; cost is legible in the panicked ascent and the dimming codex. No antagonist required; situational pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—corporate erasure versus human witness—emerges through concrete particulars: severed cables, scrubbed names, and the act of standing present without analyzing. The codex's gold flecks function as a charged motif, warming during the witness act and cooling afterward, reweighting the premise. The final image (inert flecks, ascent, ongoing cable traffic) offers a non-literal answer: acknowledgment does not reverse erasure, yet the cost of bearing witness is honored. No thematic echo or explicit moralizing; the closing juxtaposition (cat videos above, ghostprints below) carries resonance without stating a thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV with tight focalization through Marek's augmented perception remains stable. Voice is distinct: technical diction ("quantum superposition," "photon," "fiber optics") anchored by visceral images ("bulkheads pressed like closing fists," "glaciers calving"). Psychic distance tightens appropriately under stress (short clauses in the moon-pool transition, longer cadences during reflection). No dialogue; interiority stays concrete. Minor: some filter verbs ("feeling the phase transition") are acceptable within voice but slightly dull immediacy in one beat. Perceptual signature—electromagnetic traces, phase-transition language—is consistent and character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create visual and aural momentum. Information density is high: most lines do double duty (world-building + emotional charge). Minor loop: "invisible things" recurs three times across paragraphs without evolving meaning each instance, costing ~−0.3. Phase-transition metaphors are dense but coherent; no mixed vehicles. Propulsion is strong in the ascent sequence. One register note: "quarterly reports and profit margins" reads slightly editorial but remains within an embittered focalization. Zero typos or mechanical errors. High density and clear propulsion keep this in the strong band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—claustrophobic spelunker + undersea data-ghost retrieval + corporate erasure—feels specific and non-obvious. The codex as electromagnetic tracker and the phase-transition framing transform familiar "returning to the wreck" templates. Emotional particulars (syncing with Chen's surprise, Petrov's laughter-to-static) ground the concept. Risk: the piece commits fully to its technoscientific premise without hedging into metaphor-only territory. Swappability test passes: remove the exact cable-relay logic and the closure image loses charge. Fresh inflection in the seven-second witness act, which grows from prior setup without late rule changes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marek (claustrophobic spelunker) is established early, drives the return decision, and chooses to kneel and sync at the server cradle despite rising water and panic. Claustrophobia constrains movement ("throat tightened," "panic lending speed"), and the choice to remain for seven seconds rather than retreat immediately alters the mission's outcome. Present in all three gates: setup (opening paragraphs), middle development (navigating corridors under pressure), and closure (the sync act and ascent). The trait is indispensable to the tension architecture.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The codex appears in three distinct beats: strapped to chest in the submersible (setup), gold flecks warming as Marek passes neural-pattern coordinates (middle tracking function), and closing/dimming at the end after the witness act (closure charge). Its mechanics—tracking electromagnetic residues via engineered gold-fleck illuminants—enable the core mission and reweight meaning when the flecks go inert, signaling the traces' final acknowledgment. Swapping it for a generic tracker would lose the charged "trapped stars" / "compass needle" imagery that ties to the theme. Strong causal and lyric integration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Undersea cables shape world logic (neural patterns fused with fiber optics during the accident) and supply the repository for the ghostprints Marek tracks. They constrain the mission's method and inform the thematic contrast (ongoing traffic vs. forgotten dead). Present in setup (cables converging "like neural pathways"), middle exposition (cable terminus loops), and closure juxtaposition (cat videos above, facility below). The concept enables the premise but does not directly alter a tactical choice on the page; the relay room visit would occur regardless of cable-specific mechanics. Solid integration, mid-high band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tracking invisible things (electromagnetic ghostprints) is Marek's core capability, introduced early and invoked in multiple beats: augments pulse at the moon pool, gold flecks map positions in the relay room, and Marek syncs with residual traces at the terminal. The trait enables the mission's success and charges the closure when the traces "finally had an audience." Cost is visible: the act of witnessing without recording forecloses any salvage or documentation path. Removing this attribute would collapse the story's logic. Strong causal and thematic integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Return is the inciting action, seeded in the opening (submersible sealing) and motivating every subsequent beat: the descent, navigation through corridors, the witness act, and the ascent. The decision to return despite trauma and corporate erasure defines the stakes and forecloses safer memorial options. The entire narrative arc traces from this choice; swapping "return" for "initial survey" would strip the earned-stasis closure of its weight. Present in all three gates and causally indispensable. Very strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Phase transitions appear in four moments: the tidal drainage system reversing (setup/world rule), the moon-pool airlock shuddering (sensory detail), Marek's consciousness syncing with traces (method at closure), and the facility exhaling its last air pocket (final image). The concept is signaled early and used as both literal mechanism (water/air/memory shifts) and metaphoric frame. It shapes the method of witness (syncing = phase transition) and charges the ending. Moderate causal role; the seven-second sync could be rewritten as direct neural link with minor edits, but the phase-transition language is woven through enough beats to resist easy swap. Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The forgotten research facility supplies the entire spatial and thematic crucible: flooded access tunnels, narrowing corridors that trigger claustrophobia, the server cradle where Marek kneels, and the tidal-window constraint that forces retreat. It is established in the opening, pressures every navigation choice, and houses the cable relays essential to closure. The setting's state (abandoned, flooded, erasable) embodies the corporate abandonment theme. Removing this exact setting would require a complete premise rewrite. Strong spatial and thematic integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The forty-seven-minute tidal window is introduced early (paragraph 3) and functions as the mission clock: air bleeds into tunnels, Marek descends, witnesses, and must ascend before water reclaims the facility. It tightens the final beats ("tide shifted; water began rising") and drives the panicked ascent. The timeframe is tracked loosely—no second-by-second countdown—but its pressure is legible and shapes the witness act's brevity (seven seconds, then retreat). Causal role in middle and closure; solid integration, though a vaguer "limited time" constraint could serve with moderate edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>To stand by the unremembered is stated early and enacted throughout: Marek insists on returning, navigates through panic to the relay room, and chooses the seven-second sync over recording/salvage. The motivation is dramatized with cost (physical terror, no data retrieved, names remain erased). Internal conflict—honoring the dead vs. personal safety—drives micro-choices at every beat. The phrase "stand by the unremembered" recurs at closure, but the act itself (kneeling, syncing, bearing witness) is shown in scene. Strong desire-cost friction, though the phrasing edges toward prompt echo. High integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Crashing hush is seeded in the opening ("crashing hush of deep water") and modulates across beats: pneumatic sigh, glaciers calving, water lapping, facility exhaling. Tone coheres as muted urgency with dense technical-poetic diction. The oxymoron charges the ending juxtaposition (relentless cable traffic / silent custody). Tone supports pressure and shifts appropriately (contemplative in the relay room, frantic during ascent) without static monotony. Solid tonal control, though "crashing hush" as exact phrase appears only twice; the effect is sustained more than the label. Mid-to-upper band for coherent modulation and closure charge.</comment>
