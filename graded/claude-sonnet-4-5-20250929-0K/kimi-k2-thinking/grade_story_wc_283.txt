<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The hourglass turner is given interiority through her cataloging obsession and the transformation from "mere archival duty" to urgent purpose, but her motivation arrives mostly through summary rather than embodied micro-choices under pressure. The final revelation—laying down glass prisons—reads as an epiphany declared rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting in scene. No secondary character appears to test her stance, and the emotional arc remains largely internal and reflective without visible cost that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (the turner) and where (amber warehouse) within the opening lines, meeting the test. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: decades of button cataloging accumulate toward the prophecy's assembly on "the seventh day of the seventh month," and the final image—echo shared in amber walls—reweights the opening isolation into communal resonance. However, the closure unit (Resonant Reconfiguration via the prophecy's question and her decision to cork the jar) lacks visible cost on the page; she completes her task and the echo "remains," but no tactic is altered, no path foreclosed, no price paid in the moment. The lens holds, but cost is conceptual and diffuse rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The amber warehouse, petrified sap glowing with trapped fireflies, and the mason jar all supply vivid, purpose-driven images that anchor the accumulative design. The buttons' "unique pattern of wear" and their resonance with sound fragments give the cataloging a tactile, material presence. The final image—pressing an ear to petrified sap—charges closure by transforming the warehouse from a solitary vault into a resonant vessel for shared wisdom, meeting the 9+ gate for setting constraining choice or charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unscrambling the prophecy—is signaled early and pursued across decades of button cataloging, meeting the "one meaningful tightening" standard when the final button assembles clarity. However, the prophecy's question arrives without prior risk or trade-off; the turner places the button, the echo assembles, and no live option is foreclosed or cost paid. Pressure accumulates through time and cataloging density but does not narrow her tactics or force a choice that alters the outcome. The prophecy invites but does not demand, leaving stakes conceptual rather than felt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The theme of shared wisdom versus solitary possession emerges through the prophecy's structure—"deliberately scattered like seeds"—and the final question reweights the hourglass metaphor from constraint to open-handedness. The prophecy asks rather than commands, offering a resonant, non-literal answer that does not moralize. The recurring image of sand flowing through glass versus open hands charges the closure without stating a thesis, and the transformation from archival duty to urgent possibility feels earned by the cataloging particulars. Minor thematic echo: "shared wisdom" appears as a label in the penultimate paragraph, but the image work in the final lines mitigates the slip.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The narrative voice maintains a distinct lyric texture—"time pooled like resin," "phonetic shards that rattled"—and the compression and patterned diction feel purposeful for an accumulative design. POV remains stable in third-person limited with no head-hopping. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("syntax of possibility itself," "raw possibility") that feels more prompt-aligned than character-particular, and the perceptual signature does not shift under pressure; the turner's way of noticing remains consistent and calm even at the climactic assembly. Psychic distance stays controlled, and no dialogue is present to judge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and figurative density is high but purposeful for the lyric mode—"epochs past," "prison of light," "geode of chance"—with most metaphors coherent and rooted in the amber/sand/glass motif. Minor template-cadence runs appear: "She'd found buttons in river mud, behind dresser drawers, in the pockets of ghosts" uses parallel structure without variation, and "She worked...she began...She quietly inspired...She'd found" clusters "she" openings in adjacent paragraphs. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks touch the closure beat, and information density is high throughout. Applying −0.4 for template stems (not touching closure) under the Non-closure Accumulation Cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The premise—cataloging lost buttons to unscramble a canyon echo—offers a fresh synthesis of archival obsession and prophecy, grounded in the specific tactile work of button wear patterns resonating with sound fragments. The prophecy's question-form ending avoids the template fate-versus-free-will binary and reweights the hourglass metaphor with specificity. However, the emotional arc (solitary duty → urgent inspiration → communal sharing) follows a familiar transformation template, and the final image of "shared wisdom for anyone who pressed an ear" feels more allegorical than inevitable. Risk-taking is present in the accumulative structure and the prophecy-as-question turn, but the execution does not fully escape the archetype of the lone scholar discovering universal truth.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The hourglass turner is present throughout and her decades-long cataloging project frames the story, meeting setup and development gates. Her decision to cork the jar at closure participates in the ending but does not alter it—the echo "remained" regardless. Her choices (cataloging, arranging, placing the final button) enable the prophecy's assembly but do not narrow options or impose visible cost; the cataloging succeeds as intended. Two distinct beats (cataloging across paragraphs, placing the final button) with closure linkage earn mid-band placement, but swappability (another archivist could perform the same function) and the lack of a trade-off or renunciation limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The canyon echo jar appears in the opening third ("mason jar that hummed"), recurs across middle beats as the target of button cataloging ("held to the jar's surface"), and is central to closure ("she placed the final button...the jar finally assembled itself" and "She corked the jar, but the echo remained"). The jar's evolving state—from scrambled prophecy to assembled clarity—drives the cataloging work and charges the final image when the echo becomes "a permanent resonance within the amber walls." Three gates met, causal pressure evident, closure linkage strong. The jar's specific property (resonance with button wear patterns) is irreplaceable, earning high-band placement. Minor friction: the jar is described and handled but not physically manipulated in ways that impose cost or risk; its role is more catalyst than contested object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Shared wisdom is named explicitly in the setup ("the prophecy wasn't meant for a single mind to possess but for many to share") and returns at closure ("shared wisdom for anyone who pressed an ear"). The concept shapes the turner's motivation to "spin this prophecy into raw possibility for a world" and alters her stance from archival duty to urgent dissemination. However, the sharing occurs after the cataloging succeeds; no on-page choice tests the tension between hoarding and sharing, and no cost is paid to make the wisdom available. The concept influences theme and final image but does not constrain tactics or force a mid-story trade-off, placing it in the mid-band for one key turn (her realization) and closure linkage without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The attribute "quietly inspired" appears once in mid-story ("She quietly inspired herself each dawn with the thought that her lonely task might one day crack open the future") but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. The phrase describes her emotional state in summary rather than shaping a choice or tactic. It does not recur at closure and could be removed without altering the story's logic or outcome, marking it as ornamental. Late appearance (second third), label-only treatment, and no beat involvement or cost connection place it below functional.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Unscrambling the prophecy is the story's central action, signaled in the opening third ("to unscramble it, she'd spent decades cataloging"), developed through button cataloging in the middle, and resolved at closure ("the canyon echo in the jar finally assembled itself into clarity"). The action drives at least three beats (discovery of the jar, cataloging process, placing the final button) and the final prophecy's question reweights prior material. Removing this action would eliminate the story's causal spine. Strong setup, beat involvement, and closure linkage with irreplaceability earn high-band placement. Minor friction: the unscrambling succeeds without setback or cost, reducing felt stakes slightly.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Cataloging lost buttons is signaled early ("she'd spent decades cataloging lost buttons"), detailed in the middle ("arranged by valley origin, by the age of their thread-holes, by the pitch"), and its mechanics matter to the prophecy's assembly (each button "resonated with a specific sound fragment"). The method drives two distinct beats (the cataloging taxonomy and the final button placement) and enables the closure transformation. The specificity of button wear patterns and their resonance with sound fragments makes the method irreplaceable. Setup, development, and closure gates met with causal pressure and beat involvement justify mid-to-high band. Minor friction: the cataloging is described more than dramatized, with most work occurring off-page across "decades."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The amber warehouse beneath sandstone cliffs is established in the opening line and recurs throughout ("narrow aisles," "deepest vault," "warehouse rafters," "amber walls"). The setting supplies the petrified sap that holds the fireflies and becomes the resonant surface at closure, charging the final image when "anyone who pressed an ear to the petrified sap" can access the shared wisdom. The warehouse constrains the turner's solitary work and its transformation from prison to vessel participates in closure. Three gates met with closure linkage and a causal role (the amber's resonance enables sharing). The setting is essential to the final image but does not alter tactics mid-story, placing it solidly in the essential-across-beats band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The timeframe "as the truth unravels" is embedded in the text ("As the truth unravels, she began to understand") but functions more as a thematic marker than a tightening clock. The story spans "decades" of cataloging, compressing time until "the seventh day of the seventh month" when the final button is placed. The seventh-day marker supplies a ceremonial cadence that charges the closure moment, meeting closure participation. However, no on-page urgency or ticking countdown alters the turner's tactics; time accumulates rather than pressures. One key turn (the final assembly) and closure linkage with early signal (though vague) place it in mid-band, but the lack of tactical constraint or live clock limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to spin a prophecy into raw possibility" is articulated in the middle third and linked to her transformation from "mere archival duty" to "something more urgent." The desire drives the cataloging action and shapes the closure decision to share the prophecy. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting choices; no on-page moment tests whether to hoard or share, and no cost is paid to pursue this goal over another. Setup (implied through her decades of work), development (named explicitly), and closure (the prophecy becomes "shared wisdom") gates are met, but the lack of friction or trade-off between wants and costs limits high-band eligibility. Mid-band for one key turn and closure linkage without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tone of "unearthed silence" is established in the opening ("time pooled like resin," "her name had been forgotten by all but the wind") and sustained through imagery of isolation, petrified stillness, and careful cataloging ("She worked in unearthed silence, the only sound her own measured breath"). The tone modulates at closure when silence transforms from empty to "filled...with the quiet inspiration of a truth finally unearthed and given voice to sing through the stone," reweighting the opening loneliness into resonant stillness. Coherence across turns, purposeful modulation under pressure, and a charged final image that echoes the setup justify high-band placement. The tone is indispensable to the story's accumulative design and lyric closure.</comment>
