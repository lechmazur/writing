<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior contradiction is embodied through physical sensation ("pins-and-needles," pressing the bolt until nerves scream) and her hierarchy of values emerges clearly: position over collective safety, then vigilance as penance. The climactic choice to report the rust stain feels earned by eighteen months of present-tense observation and bodily cost. Minor slip: the precentor and Milo function primarily as backstory pressure rather than on-page resistance, slightly flattening the present crucible.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (cobalt fortress, east wing, bellhop role) land within the first ~80 words. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration via Charged Poise: Elara's final sign-language report and acceptance of ongoing vigilance reconfigures her stance from exiled ghost to integrated watchkeeper, with visible cost (she will not rejoin the choir, privilege lost). The cost is felt in "she would remain, and she would watch" and the bolt she carries. One meaningful deepening: the discovery of the new rust stain forces the choice between silence and speech again, crystallizing the life-long price of vigilance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress, snow, spiral staircase, and bolt are concrete and constrain choice: the staircase is her assigned penance route, the bolt in her pocket a tactile reminder that charges the final beat when she gestures toward "the tools." Sensory economy is strong (three feet of snow, moisture seeping through stone, cold heavy bolt). Does not quite reach 8.5 because the fortress interior remains somewhat generic (east wing, refectory, music room) beyond the staircase and the snow functions more as atmosphere than tactical constraint at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understand the cost of safety, earn partial redemption through vigilance) is signaled early and coheres throughout. The rust-stain discovery meaningfully tightens options: report and remain in the fold with loss of choir status, or stay silent and declare nothing changed. Agency is clear—Elara descends, forms signs, accepts the tool work—and the price (ongoing penance, permanent exclusion from choir) is legible on the page. One tightening is sufficient for this length under Accumulative lens; entering 8.5+ would require the foreclosed path to carry sharper relational or bodily consequence in the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (safety as unending cost, vigilance as life rather than moment) emerges from the bolt, the staircase penance, and the rust stain without overt moralizing. "Seraphically mundane" reweights the ordinary as celestial when consecrated by service, and "frostbitten hope" charges the ending. The final image—hands forming signs, gesturing toward tools—resonates without stating a thesis. Slight drag: "some silences could never be pardoned" and "the cost of safety was this: that you never stopped paying" edge toward thematic summary rather than pure implication, keeping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited; perceptual signature (nerve sensation, sign-language habits, "divine purpose when viewed through the lens of service") is distinct and character-specific. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the rust-stain discovery and the descent to report. Diction remains controlled ("seraphically mundane," "unpardonable silence") without register drift. No dialogue on the page; the precentor's nod and gesture serve as silent exchange consistent with the silent-choir setting. Compression of thought ("She stopped. She could report. She should report.") reads purposeful under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, information density is high, and no loops or scaffold mar the closure beat. Minor text-pattern issue: "She understood that now, understood how the ordinary became celestial" repeats the stem "understood" in adjacent clauses without added pressure (paraphrase-loop check: −0.2). "The cost of safety was this: that you never stopped paying. That vigilance was not a moment but a life. That hope could survive even when frozen at the root" stacks three parallel declarations in quick succession, edging toward template cadence but remaining voice-motivated. Propulsion is strong; every sentence advances. No artifacts touch the closure unit.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The silent-choir monastery and sign-language penance offer a fresh synthesis; "seraphically mundane" and the charged bolt avoid stock redemption-arc beats. Emotional specificity (pressing bolt until nerves scream, "slightest discoloration... three shades darker") grounds the premise. Risk: the vow-of-silence frame combined with nerve-injury backstory and staircase inspection could feel checklist-assembled, but the integration (sign language as both profession and penance, the bolt as relic and tool) transforms the tropes. Does not quite reach 8.5 because the monastery itself and the music-room collapse echo familiar structures without a final conceptual surprise beyond "vigilance is ongoing."</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara (silent-choir bellhop) drives every key turn: initial silence eighteen months ago, daily staircase penance, rust-stain discovery, final decision to report via signs. Her observation becomes decision at closure when she descends to the precentor, forms the words she withheld before, and accepts the tools. Setup (bellhop role, sign language) in paragraph 4; development (penance climb, bolt-carrying, nerve regeneration enabling signs again); payoff (she forms signs, gestures toward tools, commits to remain and watch). Causal pressure is unmistakable; her choices narrow and redefine her role. Cost: exclusion from choir, lifelong vigilance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The piano bench bolt appears in backstory (sheared bolt caused collapse), becomes pocket talisman ("cold, heavy, utterly without beauty"), pressed against palm until nerves scream, and frames the ending ("the bolt in her pocket warming," "the fortress needed another bolt replaced"). Setup via backstory anchor; development through tactile ritual (pressing against palm); payoff when she accepts tools to replace the new rust-indicated bolt. The object is irreplaceable: removing it would sever the material link between past failure and present vigilance, and the closure image ("another bolt replaced") would lose resonance. Specific cost tied to the element: physical pain as penance, permanent reminder of failure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Unpardonable silence" shapes the dominant stake (report the new discoloration or repeat the sin) and alters options: remaining silent again declares nothing changed, reporting accepts lifelong vigilance. Setup in paragraph 5 ("the unpardonable silence was... the moment... when she had seen the cracked support beam and said nothing"); development (penance climb, exclusion from choir, nerve regeneration enabling speech again); payoff (the choice to report via signs rather than stay silent). The concept changes tactics: she must form signs to remain in service. Not quite 8.5 because "unpardonable" functions partly as thematic echo rather than a rule or resource the plot manipulates across multiple beats.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Seraphically mundane" is signaled in paragraph 11 ("each simple chamber pot and iron rivet glowed with divine purpose when viewed through the lens of service") and reprised in paragraph 19 (bolts as relics without beauty yet consecrated). Setup mid-story; no clear middle development beat; payoff implicit in the closing acceptance of tool work. The attribute reweights ordinary objects (bolt, staircase, tools) as charged with meaning, enabling the thematic closure. Does not reach 7.0+ because it appears primarily as a realization rather than constraining an on-page action with visible cost; the insight does not force a tactical choice distinct from the rust-stain report itself.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Remain" is the story's hinge: Elara will not rejoin the choir (paragraph 24, "she would not rejoin... that privilege was lost"), yet she chooses to remain in the fortress and continue vigilance (final line, "she would remain, and she would watch"). Setup via exclusion and penance assignment; development through daily staircase climb and nerve regeneration nearing completion; payoff when she descends to report and commits to stay rather than leave or demand reinstatement. The action redefines her role from exiled to chosen watchkeeper. Removing "remain" would require rewriting the entire closure stance. Cost: permanent exclusion, lifelong penance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Via the slightest discoloration on a dusty spiral staircase" is the method of discovery for both past failure (paragraph 6, "the stone three shades darker where moisture seeped through") and the new rust stain (paragraph 26, "a faint rust stain, no larger than a thumbprint, on the iron railing"). Setup in backstory; development when daily penance climb trains her eye; payoff when the new discoloration forces the climactic choice. The method matters: her trained observation skill becomes both her failure and her redemption tool. Does not reach 8.5 because the mechanics (moisture seeping, rust forming) are not detailed enough to constrain multiple attempts or shape tactical friction; discoloration functions as trigger rather than multi-beat resource.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress under snow provides the setting throughout; snow pressure ("three feet of new snow," "snow pressing against the windows like a mourner's hands") reinforces tone. Setup in opening line; development via east wing, music room, spiral staircase (her assigned route), precentor's study; payoff when descent to the study completes the choice. The fortress supplies the staircase (constraint: daily penance route) and the tools (resource for repair). Does not reach 7.0+ because the fortress and snow function more as consistent backdrop than as evolving tactical pressure; winter deepens but does not alter her options at closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"During nerve regeneration" (six months in, eighteen months post-injury) tightens the decision window: sensation returns "in cruel increments," and regeneration is "nearly complete" by paragraph 23, meaning she will soon be able to make signs again. Setup in paragraph 3; development tracks her recovering ability to feel and sign; payoff when she forms the signs she withheld eighteen months ago. The timeframe shapes tactics: her imminent capability to rejoin forces the choice whether to remain excluded. Visible cost: she uses the recovered skill not to rejoin the choir but to report maintenance needs, foreclosing reunion.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"To understand the cost of safety" (paragraph 15) is the stated motivation, dramatized through daily staircase penance, pressing the bolt until nerves scream, and the rust-stain choice. Setup via injury and assigned penance; development through bodily self-punishment and reflection on Milo's crushed hands; payoff when reporting the new stain enacts the lesson ("the cost of safety was this: that you never stopped paying"). The motivation is conflicted: understanding alone won't restore the choir or Milo, yet she persists. Cost is felt in permanent exclusion and ongoing vigilance. Not quite 8.5 because the motivation is articulated more than it generates internal friction between competing wants in the final beat.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Frostbitten hope" appears explicitly in paragraph 19 ("the frostbitten hope that she might one day be forgiven") and charges the ending: hope survives ("hope could survive even when frozen at the root") but remains constrained by winter and permanent loss. Tone modulates from hushed penance (early paragraphs) to crystallized choice (rust-stain beat) to quiet commitment (final lines). Setup via snow and "perpetual hush"; development through injury recovery and exclusion; payoff in the understated final image (nod, gesture toward tools, commitment to remain and watch). Coherent across turns; the hope is neither extinguished nor fully warmed, maintaining tonal integrity.</comment>
