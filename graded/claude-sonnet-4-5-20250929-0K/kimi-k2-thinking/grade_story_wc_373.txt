<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation is clear and drives her choices through multiple attempts. Interior experience remains consistent, and her micro-choices (warning pirates, snuffing the lantern, rewiring the device) reflect her hierarchy of values. However, the "curiously steadfast" resolve feels asserted rather than shown through genuine internal contradiction; the progression from laughed-at daughter to lone operative lands cleanly but without the friction of competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final renunciation—leaving the market unwarned, carrying the secret—has cost but the emotional embodiment remains somewhat generic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure is Earned Stasis with Charged Poise: the protagonist chooses to preserve the truce by capturing evidence rather than direct intervention, foreclosing confrontation and carrying the fragile sound alone. The causal chain is legible—two failed attempts teach her to target the betrayer's own words—and the orientation anchors (rotting pier, pirate market beneath, midnight arrival) arrive promptly. The inferred lens is Causal with lyric texture; because/therefore linkage holds. One minor slip: the hidden compartment and recording device feel conveniently positioned, though the watch-fob mechanism partially earns the discovery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rotting pier and subterranean market create vivid, purposeful constraint: the protagonist must navigate between "those who lived below the pier and those who sailed above." Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered—slick timbers, salt, moonshine lanterns, wet planks—and the antique watch fob's match to the hidden lock charges the final image by making setting an active puzzle element. The spatial choreography (beneath boards, slipping back, vanishing into shadows) remains coherent. The "final hour before sunrise" functions as both time anchor and pressure device, elevating the setting's causal role.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve the truce of hush—is signaled early and drives all three attempts. The two false starts create genuine escalation: laughter forces tactical shift, the relit lantern teaches her that force won't work, leading to the rewiring solution that targets betrayal's sound itself. Agency is clear in each choice and the final cost (carrying the secret alone, the market "none the wiser") forecloses direct solidarity. One gap: the stranger's vulnerability (leaving his device in a compartment the fob unlocks) feels under-motivated, softening the earned reversal slightly.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—trust as measurable fragility, silence as currency—emerges through concrete particulars: the watch fob ticking against crisis, the recorder capturing "each word a crack in the truce," the protagonist holding "the sound of trust breaking like a splintering mast." The final image offers resonant reconfiguration without moralizing: "trust, once broken, can be measured in the smallest of sounds." The "comforting unease" and contradiction between preservation and secrecy charge the ending. No thematic echo or late sermon; the antique object and its dual role (maternal token, mechanical key) anchor the question without stating it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The narrative voice is consistent, lyric, and carries a distinct perceptual signature: "rotting pier stretched into the black water like a forgotten promise," "Time pressed against my ribs like a second heartbeat." Psychic distance remains stable in first person; no head-hopping. The diction occasionally drifts elevated ("clandestine footsteps," "truce of hush") but remains within a literate young woman's plausible register under duress. Minor slip: "curiously steadfast" and "comforting unease" feel more authorial than character-particular. Free indirect handling of reflection is clean; filter verbs ("I realized," "I discovered") are voice-appropriate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled and purposeful, varying sentence structure and paragraph length to support tension. Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Two pattern issues lower the score: repeated "My [noun] was [noun]" constructions ("My father's trade was silence," "My first attempt was a false start," "My second false start left me") create template cadence across key beats; figurative language is dense and occasionally stacks without clear payoff ("slick with salt and the memory of old fish" pairs concrete and abstract vehicles unevenly). The paraphrase loop "I could not stop him with force; I needed to capture the moment" → "I realized I could not stop him with force" recurs within adjacent paragraphs. No major clarity breaks, but these artifacts prevent entry to high bands.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—daughter of a moonshine runner preserving an underworld truce by recording a betrayer—offers a non-obvious synthesis of noir stakes and mechanical ingenuity. The watch fob functioning as both heirloom and literal key is a fresh inflection that integrates motif with plot mechanics. However, the "hidden recorder in a secret compartment" and the stranger's convenient carelessness feel closer to familiar heist templates than inevitable particulars. The emotional truth (carrying betrayal's evidence alone, the cost of silence) is specific and avoids stock sentiment. Risk-taking in the lyric texture and the Earned Stasis closure elevate within band, but the core mechanics remain partially derivative.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The moonshine runner's daughter is introduced in the opening third, drives all three tactical attempts (warn, sabotage, record), and her final choice to withdraw with the evidence constitutes the closure action. Her role as cultural intermediary ("raised on the rhythm of clandestine footsteps") motivates her unique access and the stakes. Causal pressure is clear: each decision narrows options and the ending would fail without her specific position and agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The antique watch fob appears early (paragraph 6), is handled in at least three beats (clutching it, discovering the lock match, withdrawing it to seal the compartment), and charges the final image ("the faint tick of the fob, each second a reminder"). Its dual function—maternal token and mechanical key—creates irreplaceability; no generic object could serve both roles. The cost (using her mother's gift to preserve a truce her mother vanished from) is implicit but legible. Strong integration across setup, middle, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The "truce of hush" is named early, defines the dominant stake (preserve silence between pirates and authorities), and shapes all three tactical choices. The protagonist's goal is explicitly to prevent the stranger from "scribbl[ing] away the truce." However, the concept itself remains somewhat abstract; the mechanics of the truce (who enforces it, what breach looks like beyond one ledger) are under-dramatized. It drives options but does not impose visible constraint on tactics beyond the protagonist's self-imposed mission. Present in closure as the preserved outcome.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Curiously steadfast" appears once as a label attached to resolve after the second false start. It does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action; the trait is asserted rather than demonstrated through contradictory impulses or visible tradeoff. The protagonist's persistence is shown through repeated attempts, but the "curiously" qualifier (suggesting tension or surprise) is not dramatized. Functional mention without causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Thwart" is signaled early ("I decided to thwart his plan") and structures the entire narrative: three escalating attempts to stop the stranger define the beats. The rewiring of the recording device is the thwarting mechanism that pays off at closure. Major turns trace directly to this action; the resolution (capturing betrayal without confrontation) hinges on thwarting via misdirection rather than force. The action is irreplaceable to the story's logic and present across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Through false starts" is signaled explicitly ("My first attempt was a false start," "My second false start") and the method shapes all three tactical beats: warn/laugh, sabotage/relit flame, rewire/success. The mechanics matter—each failure teaches a lesson that alters the next approach, driving causal escalation. The method is present in the story's structure and essential to the earned resolution. The protagonist's learning curve depends on the false-start pattern, making it indispensable to both pressure and closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The pirate market beneath the rotting pier is introduced in paragraph 2, provides the spatial stakes (preserve the hidden bazaar), and supplies the setting for all action. The hidden compartment in the pier's support beam is a setting resource that enables the resolution. The dual-layer geography (below/above) creates the "truce of hush" tension and the protagonist's unique access. Spatial constraint (slipping beneath boards, vanishing into shadows) affects tactics. Essential to stakes and closure, though the market itself remains lightly textured beyond "stolen silks and moonshine."</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "until sunrise" is anchored early ("just after midnight," "final hour before sunrise") and creates visible pressure: "Time pressed against my ribs like a second heartbeat, counting down the minutes until dawn." The clock tightens the rewiring attempt and the protagonist's withdrawal as "the sky began to blush." The sunrise marks closure (she vanishes as light spills). The time constraint is causal—she must act before dawn—and shapes the ending image. Solid integration across beats and payoff, though the middle development could track elapsed minutes more precisely.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to capture the sound of trust breaking" is stated explicitly mid-story ("I needed to capture the moment he broke the truce, to hold the sound of betrayal in my hands") and drives the final tactical choice (rewiring the recorder). It appears in the closure image ("I carried the captured sound with me"). However, the desire is more told than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices; the friction between wanting to warn the pirates versus capturing evidence is under-explored. The motivation is functional and present at closure but lacks visible cost or internal contradiction that would elevate it.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The tone "comforting unease" is embodied in the opening ("rotting pier stretched...like a forgotten promise"), sustained through contradictions ("silence felt brittle," "the truce of hush remained intact" even as trust breaks), and crystallized in the final line ("comforting unease in the stillness, like a lullaby that hums just before a storm"). The tone modulates with pressure—lyric dread during approach, tense clarity during action, elegiac quiet at closure—without breaking coherence. It charges the final image by making ambivalence (preservation via secrecy) feel inevitable rather than evasive. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>
