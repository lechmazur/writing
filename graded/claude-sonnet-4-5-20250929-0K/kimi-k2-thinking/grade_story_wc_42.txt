<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear (harness dying starlight) and his core trait (patient listener/repairer) shapes the solution, but his interiority reads generic—"heart a quiet drum," "bittersweet symphony"—rather than character-particular. The decision to align the escapement to the leaf's cadence is shown on the page, yet the emotional stakes feel asserted ("luminous ache") more than embodied through contradictory impulses. The ending gesture (whispered thanks) lands as sentiment rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers images (spinning clock, falling leaf, captured starlight) toward a cadence shift when the clock hand "matched the leaf's fall." Orientation anchors arrive early (lunar observatory, Kael's workshop, shaking foundations). Closure effect is Resonant Reconfiguration—the observatory steadies, the star's light is preserved—but the cost remains abstract; no on-page sentence shows what Kael forfeited or what path closed. The final leaf-fall whisper ("promise that nothing ever truly vanishes") attempts conceptual repricing but restates theme rather than reweighting prior pressure with undeniable expense.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Spatial anchors (lunar observatory, workshop, sensor plate, back panel of chronometer) are present and the leaf functions as micro-setting, triggering the shutter at a precise instant. The sensor plate and escapement gears guide the solution, elevating setting beyond postcard. However, the broader lunar environment (clouds, black sky, gravitational whispers) remains decorative; no environmental constraint visibly narrows Kael's options or alters his tactics during the adjustment beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: preserve the dying star's light before the observatory tears free. The tightening occurs when Kael aligns the escapement to the leaf's rhythm, steadying the foundations—a meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. Yet the escalation is thin: no reversal or second complication forces a trade-off, and the leaf's success arrives without visible cost (no stamina drain, no tool failure, no social or moral price paid on the page).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme (ephemeral versus enduring, listening as synthesis) emerges from the leaf/clock pairing and the captured starlight image. The final line attempts non-literal resonance ("the next ephemeral moment awaited his careful ear"), but the piece repeatedly states its thesis: "luminous ache," "changelessly constant," "ephemeral harnessed," "time is both constant and fleeting." The closing paragraphs moralize rather than letting the sensor-plate beat and steadying observatory reweigh prior material without summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Single-POV third-person remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (auditory focus: "metallic hiss," "faint rustle," "whisper") but diction drifts into elevated register—"luminous ache," "bittersweet symphony," "timeless shard"—that exceeds a repairer's lexicon during peak pressure. Recycled sentence stems ("The leaf fell," "Kael realized," "Kael knew") and phrase loops ("luminous ache" appears five times) flatten voice texture and trigger template-cadence penalties.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "foundations shook"/"foundations no longer shaking," "clock hand spun wildly"/"clock hand still spun"/"clock hand rested," "luminous ache" recycled across five beats without evolving pressure. Template cadence runs: "Kael knew" × 3, "The leaf" × 3, "He knew" × 2. Stock metaphors ("heart a quiet drum," "canvas for…dying suns") and abstract intensifiers ("changelessly constant," "ephemeral whisper") reduce clarity at peak beats. Artifacts touch the closure sequence (final three paragraphs), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The synthesis (repairing time via sound-triggered sensor and escapement alignment) is specific and non-obvious. The auditory solution—using a leaf's whisper to regulate a chronometer—offers a fresh angle on the "listening as mastery" trope. However, the lunar-observatory premise and "capture dying starlight" frame trend toward familiar science-fantasy templates, and the piece does not transform them through lived occupational detail or a surprising moral calculus; the resolution arrives without visible cost or ethical friction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Kael (sage camera repairer) is present throughout and his decision to adjust the escapement drives the resolution beat. However, his occupation as *camera* repairer is mentioned once and never constrains his options—he works on clocks and sensors with no friction. His choices are present but lack the cost or trade-off that would elevate integration: he succeeds without forfeiting tools, time, or alternative paths. Early signal (+0.5), two distinct beats (listening, adjusting escapement +0.9), closure linkage (+0.7), but swappable with "clockmaker" (−0.6) and label-only "sage" trait (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The spinning clock hand appears in three beats: workshop opening (symptom of escape velocity), mid-story reminder ("still spun, relentless"), and resolution (slowed, then matched the leaf's fall). It signals the problem early (+0.6), constrains Kael's attempt (he must regulate the spin +1.0), and returns at closure with reweighted meaning (steadied observatory +1.2). However, the hand's mechanics are vague—why does aligning escapement teeth stop the symptom of gravitational stress?—reducing irreplaceability (−0.4). Solid causal work but some swappability with another failing mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Escape velocity is mentioned once as backstory diagnosis ("the planet's escape velocity tugging at the Moon's crust") and never shapes on-page tactics or choices. It provides world logic for the shaking foundations but does not narrow Kael's options, impose a cost, or return at closure. Present and logically consistent but ornamental; swappable with "tidal stress" or "seismic instability" without structural change. No middle development or closure participation; cap 3.4 per missing-development gate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Changelessly constant" is used twice: first as exposition about the speed of light, second restated near the end ("The changelessly constant speed of light ensured..."). Both instances are label-only assertions; the attribute does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. The crystal lattice preserves photons, but the story does not dramatize how constancy matters to the preservation mechanism or alters Kael's tactics. Ornamental theme claim (−0.6); late repetition without causal work. Cap 4.6 per missing-development gate.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Restructure" is seeded early ("needed to restructure time itself"), repeated at the decision beat ("the only solution was to restructure the underlying chronology"), and executed on-page when Kael adjusts the escapement. The action defines the resolution and cannot be swapped for "repair" or "recalibrate" without losing thematic charge. Early signal (+0.7), two distinct beats (+0.9), closure linkage (+1.4), causal pressure (alters tactics +1.1). Minor cost ambiguity—what did restructuring foreclose?—prevents 8.5+.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The method (sound of a leaf falling) is seeded when Kael places the leaf on the sensor plate, triggers the shutter ("its whisper a soft tick"), and is invoked again when he aligns the escapement to "the cadence of the falling leaf." It shapes the attempt and provides the specific mechanism for success. Early signal (+0.6), two beats (sensor trigger, escapement alignment +0.9), closure linkage (+1.0), irreplaceability (+0.5). However, the mechanics remain vague—why does the leaf's rhythm steady the observatory?—and the method resolves a problem (gravitational spin) it did not help create (−0.9), limiting the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The lunar observatory is anchored early (above the clouds, trembling foundations, workshop interior) and the setting frames the stakes (preserve starlight before the structure tears free). The sensor plate and back panel of the chronometer are handled on-page. However, the observatory itself does not constrain Kael's choices—he adjusts the clock inside, unaffected by low gravity, vacuum, or resource scarcity. Postcard elements (black sky, canvas of dying suns) are decorative. Early signal (+0.5), one functional beat (sensor placement +0.4), but swappable with any isolated workshop (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The timeframe ("when foundations shake") is present at the opening and resolved when "the observatory steadied, its foundations no longer shaking." It brackets the story and signals urgency. However, the shaking does not tighten Kael's tactics—he works at his own pace, places the leaf, waits, adjusts the escapement—without a live countdown or escalating physical threat. Early signal (+0.5), closure participation (+0.9), but time pressure is told rather than tracked on the page (−0.5); no moment where running out of time forces a compromise.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation ("to harness the ephemeral") is stated early ("His motivation was plain") and drives the sensor-plate setup and escapement adjustment. The desire is present in three beats: stated goal, capture attempt, final reflection. Early signal (+0.6), two beats (+0.9), closure linkage (+1.0). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or on-page friction—Kael never weighs the cost of preserving the star's light against another desire, and his success arrives without visible sacrifice (−0.8). Mid-band ceiling.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Luminous ache" appears five times across the story and is reinforced by "bittersweet symphony" and similar phrases. The tone is present and consistent but static—no modulation under pressure; peak beats (escapement adjustment, observatory steadying) carry the same lyric register as the opening. The final image attempts to charge the tone ("luminous ache would never fade, but it would guide his hands"), yet repetition without evolving intensity reduces impact. Early signal (+0.5), closure participation (+0.7), but decorative recurrence without causal pressure or reweighting (−0.6); template phrasing (−0.3).</comment>
