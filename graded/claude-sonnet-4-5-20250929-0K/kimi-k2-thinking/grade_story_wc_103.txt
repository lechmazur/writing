<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation crystallizes into obsession clearly enough, but her interior life is dominated by poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. The great-grandfather reveal arrives through exposition rather than earned dramatization. Her final choice—to hold the fragment aloft—lacks visible micro-decisions under pressure; disintegration happens *to* her rather than through a decisive renunciation with felt cost. Embodied emotion is scarce; we get "hands stained with chlorophyll and light" but little visceral struggle in the months of work.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when adequately by ~120 words (Elara, garden, midnight pruning). Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: layers of memory and geometry build density until the final disintegration. Closure is present—Elara becomes part of the garden's memory—but the cost is asserted rather than shown in a decisive image; "understood too late" and "began disintegrating" tell the transformation rather than letting a concrete final action or sensation land it. The lens holds, but the closure unit lacks sharp on-page proof of felt cost at the exact moment of change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The living bridge garden is vivid and specific: cedar arches, willow-bark pathways, hyperbolic corridors. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's designer eye. The garden constrains her final choice—she stands at the hyperbolic center, the bridges absorb her—so it participates in closure. Spatial choreography is coherent. The setting earns its role without resort to generic placeholder description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering the texture of time to escape retrocognitive entrapment—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through months of mapping, but the escalation is summarized ("worked for months") rather than shown in distinct beats with rising cost. The halo fragment traps her, she theorizes, she calculates, she completes—but no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options with visible agency. The disintegration resolves the trap but reads as consequence, not protagonist-driven turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—time as texture, memory as medium—emerges from imagery (fading photographs, sap rings, bark ridges) rather than statement. The final image of Elara blending with her great-grandfather in photographs offers resonance without overt moral. However, "understood too late that to discover it fully was to become it" edges toward thematic declaration. The piece invites reflection, but the conceptual answer is articulated more than it is *felt* through a non-literal closing action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single third-person POV with stable focalization on Elara. Diction is consistent and elevated ("quaking reverie," "fibrous as mycelium networks"), though occasionally it drifts toward poetic abstraction that obscures immediacy. No head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—Elara sees geometry and temporal decay—but under peak stress the prose remains ornate rather than compressing to match urgency. No dialogue on the page to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, but several beats loop conceptually: "texture of time" appears four times, "fading photograph" six times, "hyperbolic geometry" thrice—often without added pressure. "The halo fragment" and "living bridges" are restated in adjacent lines with synonym churn. High figurative density in every paragraph obscures momentum; metaphors occasionally mix ("opened like a wound" followed by "retrocognitively trapped" feels register-adjacent but not coherent). Paraphrase loop: "treating each fading photograph as a coordinate" is immediately followed by "align the garden's growth patterns with the fragment's temporal frequency"—both describe her theory without new information. Template cadence in the disintegration sequence: "Her body began disintegrating... each cell unfolding... The living bridges absorbed... her memory becoming... Fading photographs now included..." Baseline −0.6 for loops and churn; −0.4 for template stems; total −1.0 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of hyperbolic geometry, living architecture, and temporal photography is specific and non-obvious. The great-grandfather's parallel arc adds a fresh fold. However, the core template—artist discovers mystical object, becomes trapped in her obsession, dissolves into her art—is familiar from many speculative-literary pieces. Transformation is present in the geometry and photographic decay details, but the emotional arc (obsession → too-late realization → dissolution) follows a well-worn path. Elara's final understanding arrives through exposition rather than a surprising concrete choice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Elara is established early as hedge maze designer and her profession shapes her perception (hyperbolic curves, sculpted space). She makes one key choice—holding the fragment aloft at the garden's center—but this choice is more ritual than turning point; disintegration follows as consequence. Her months of mapping are summarized, not shown as distinct decisions. Two beats (receiving fragment, final stance) but weak causal pressure. Early setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, summary-only middle −0.8, swappability −0.4. Starting at 3.0 + 0.9 = 3.9; round to 5.4 for profession-driven perception that charges the ending image even though her decision is passive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Halo fragment appears in three beats: midnight discovery, pressed to temple (traps her), held aloft at closure. It enables the retrocognitive trap and shapes her final disintegration. Setup early +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (narrows her perception) +0.8, closure linkage (she holds it aloft, it falls inert) +1.0. Starting 3.0 + 3.7 = 6.7; round to 6.8. Cost is present but the fragment's final role is ornamental—it falls after she disintegrates, not driving the transformation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Fading photographs dominate the narrative: they materialize in her vision, age in real-time, serve as coordinates for her mapping, include the great-grandfather, and finally include Elara herself. The concept shapes her method (mapping temporal decay) and the ending image (her face blending with ancestor's). Setup early +0.5, three+ beats +1.4, causal pressure (she maps them to escape) +1.0, closure linkage (final photographs include her) +1.2, specificity +0.5. Starting 3.0 + 4.6 = 7.6; −0.5 for summary-only middle use. Final 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Retrocognitive trap is established early ("suddenly Elara was retrocognitively trapped") and constrains her entire arc—she sees the past superimposed, cannot escape. It shapes her months-long project and drives the ending transformation. Setup early +0.6, two beats (initial trap, final dissolution) +0.9, causal pressure (she must map time to navigate backward) +1.0, closure linkage +0.8. Starting 3.0 + 3.3 = 6.3; −0.6 for label-only descriptor without embodied moment-to-moment cost in middle beats. Final 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Disintegration is the story's climactic transformation: "Her body began disintegrating through hyperbolic geometry, each cell unfolding... becoming another layer of sap." It is the decisive change (though it happens *to* her). Setup via prior dissolution imagery (photographs fading), single major beat at closure, specificity (through hyperbolic geometry, into sap) +0.7, closure definitive +1.8. Starting 3.0 + 2.5 = 5.5; the act redefines all prior material and is irreplaceable, lifting to 7.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry is introduced early ("sculpted space itself through hyperbolic geometry") and recurs throughout: corridors appear longer over shoulders, infinite surface within finite boundaries, living bridges twist into impossible knots, she maps curves onto temporal decay, stands at hyperbolic center, disintegrates *through* it. Setup +0.6, three+ beats +1.4, causal method (her mapping depends on it) +0.9, closure linkage (disintegration occurs *through* hyperbolic geometry) +1.0. Starting 3.0 + 3.9 = 6.9; −0.7 for the mechanics remaining abstract (we never see *how* alignment works on the page). Final 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Living bridge garden is the setting and active agent: it sprawls, breathes, responds to Elara's theory, its tendrils twist, its bridges absorb her essence. Setup in opening lines +0.7, three+ beats (midnight pruning, months of work, final center) +1.4, causal pressure (garden structure enables her mapping, hyperbolic center is the convergence point) +1.2, closure linkage (bridges absorb her, she becomes sap and heartwood) +1.4, specificity +0.6. Starting 3.0 + 5.3 = 8.3; −0.7 for the middle "months" being summarized rather than showing the garden altering tactics beat by beat. Final 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation—"to discover the texture of time"—is stated explicitly and drives her mapping project. "Her motivation crystallized into obsession" tells rather than shows friction. She wants escape (from retrocognitive trap) and understanding (texture of time); the two align rather than conflict. Setup +0.5, two beats (crystallization, final attempt) +0.9, causal drive +0.6, closure linkage +0.8. Starting 3.0 + 2.8 = 5.8; +0.6 for the desire charging the final image even though the cost (becoming time's medium) is told. Final 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Tone—quaking reverie—is established through diction ("misty chasms where time seemed to pool," "ghostly summers," "phantom camera," "emerald light") and sustained throughout. The tone modulates slightly (midnight pruning is eerie, months of work gain urgency, disintegration is dreamlike dissolution) but remains coherent. Setup early +0.6, coherence across turns +0.8, closure linkage (final line: "quaking reverie in their bones") +1.0. Starting 3.0 + 2.4 = 5.4; +1.3 for the tone charging the final image and being named on-page at closure without becoming static. Final 6.7.</comment>
