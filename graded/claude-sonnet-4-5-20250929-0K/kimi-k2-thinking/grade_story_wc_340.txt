<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kai's motivation is dramatized through concrete choices—lifting the goggles, reading the diary—rather than merely stated. The interiority flows from specific observations (steam curling, map folding) and the final beat earns its affectionate detachment through accumulated evidence of mutual recognition. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between professional distance and devotion, though the warmly inquisitive trait is largely label-only until the impulse to lift the goggles. The captain remains off-page yet vivid through diary entries, though some observations ("steam from morning tea curled like spirits") edge toward precious over-specificity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases as the elevator climbs and diary entries deepen, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (affectionate detachment settling with visible emotional cost). Orientation anchors early (frozen spire, glass elevator, servant ascending). The optical-encryption conceit is elegant and causally motivated by the goggles and ice-refracted light. The reversal at floor nine—where the captain's hidden joy is revealed—reweights prior anguish with clear emotional stakes, though the final paragraph's meta-commentary ("stories unfold not through force, but through attention") weakens the earned image by stating what the goggles-on-desk gesture already shows.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The frozen spire is vividly rendered with purpose: ice walls scatter light to enable the encryption, altitude matters for refraction, and the elevator's climb structures the revelation. Sensory detail is filtered through Kai's professional attention (geometric precision, brass polish). The goggles function as micro-setting, constraining Kai's ability to read until the impulse to wear them at the fifth floor. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The final image—goggles on the empty desk—charges the closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting constrain choice or shape the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Kai's need to understand the captain's final words and confirm their service mattered—is clear and tightens as each floor reveals deeper intimacy. The reversal at floor eight (captain noticed Kai's humming, map-folding) narrows the question from "did I matter?" to "how much joy did I give?" The goggles enable rather than complicate, and Kai's agency is largely receptive (reading, realizing) rather than forced to choose under pressure. Cost is emotional and subtle—grief tempered by knowledge—fitting the Accumulative lens, though a stronger trade-off or renunciation would elevate the stakes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the optical metaphor: scattered light resolving into meaning, joy hidden beneath anguish. The goggles and ice-refraction conceit embeds the premise in physicality rather than abstraction. The ending avoids moralizing until the final paragraph's metafictional coda ("stories unfold not through force, but through attention"), which articulates the thematic question rather than letting the image resonate. The penultimate beat—Kai removing the goggles and setting them on the desk—offers a stronger, non-literal answer than the prose that follows. Subtext operates effectively in the diary's double-layer ink and the affectionate detachment framing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited stays anchored to Kai's perceptions with consistent psychic distance and no head-hopping. Diction is elevated but remains coherent and voice-motivated ("fractured into prismatic arrays," "filigree," "encryption was optical"). Perceptual signature is clear: Kai notices geometric precision, brass polish, steam curling—details reflecting their role and inquisitive nature. The captain's voice in the diary entries contrasts effectively with the framing narration. Filter verbs ("seemed to shift," "half expecting") fit the cautious, observant stance. The final meta-commentary shifts briefly into narrator-commentary rather than Kai's focalized thought, a minor distance slip that does not obscure the ending.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, supporting the ascending structure without algorithmic patterning. Information density is high: most lines advance revelation, world detail, or emotional nuance. A few constructions edge toward overwriting ("spears of light through the ice walls where they fractured into prismatic arrays") and some phrases feel template-shaped ("the weight of understanding," "the echo of memory"). The final paragraph's scaffold phrasing ("In this way, stories unfold...") is expository and tonally divergent from prior texture, reading as authorial summary rather than scene conclusion. No significant loops or redundancies; clarity and momentum hold throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The optical-encryption premise is fresh and purposeful, integrating goggles, ice-refracted light, and altitude into a unified conceit that enables the diary's revelation. The frozen-spire setting and elevator-as-structure avoid generic templates. The emotional arc—servant discovering their service was seen and cherished—is familiar but executed with specific, grounded detail (steam curling, map-folding precision). The transformation is earned in hindsight: the goggles' function and the captain's hidden joy both resolve from prior particulars. Risk-taking is moderate; the piece commits fully to its premise but does not push unconventional structure or moral ambiguity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kai is present throughout and makes on-page choices: lifting the goggles (impulse at floor five), reading the diary, removing the goggles at the end. The character's arc—from seeking understanding to achieving affectionate detachment—shapes the story's closure. Setup is immediate (paragraph one), development occurs across the climb (goggles impulse, reading progression), and payoff lands in the final room (removing goggles, settling into detachment). The role is essential but somewhat passive; Kai receives revelation rather than forcing a harder choice under pressure. Causal pressure is moderate; the choices enable discovery but do not narrow conflicting options with visible cost until the final acceptance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The goggles appear in paragraph one, are handled at floor five (Kai lifts and wears them), enable the diary decryption across multiple beats (floors 5–9), and return with reweighted meaning in the final image (removed and set on the desk). The object is irreplaceable: its polarized glass is the encryption key, and its final placement embodies closure. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The goggles constrain Kai's ability to read (requiring the impulse to wear them) and charge the ending gesture. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; high specificity (brass-rimmed, polarized lenses the captain wore while navigating storms).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The encrypted diary is discovered in paragraph four, drives the central mystery, and its decryption unfolds across floors 5–9, shaping every major revelation and the final emotional resolution. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The concept alters tactics (Kai must wear the goggles and tilt the diary toward light) and enables the joy-beneath-anguish revelation that delivers closure. High causal pressure and closure linkage; irreplaceable (the optical encryption and double-layer ink are specific and essential). The diary's mechanics (shifting script, polarized-light requirement) constrain Kai's ability to access the captain's meaning until the precise conditions align.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "warmly inquisitive" trait is stated in paragraph five but remains largely label-only until the impulse to lift the goggles at floor seven. That impulse—"on impulse, Kai lifted the brass-rimmed goggles"—is the trait's primary dramatization, enabling the decryption and all subsequent revelations. Setup occurs mid-story (late but functional), development is minimal (one key choice), and payoff is indirect (the curiosity leads to understanding, which enables closure). The trait constrains one on-page action with visible cost (curiosity drives the decision to wear the goggles, which reveals painful intimacy). Moderate causal pressure; the element is functional but could be replaced with a less specific trait (e.g., "curious," "devoted") without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The diary's unfolding structures the entire narrative: each floor reveals entries in reverse chronology, and the act of reading/decrypting is the story's continuous action. Setup occurs in paragraph four (diary discovered), development spans floors 5–9 (progressive revelation), and payoff is the final entry's reweighting of Kai's service. The action is dramatized across multiple beats and shapes every major turn. Causal pressure is high; without the unfolding, the story has no revelation or closure. Specificity is moderate: "unfold" is somewhat generic (could be "decipher," "reveal"), and the reversal mechanism (reverse chronology, hidden ink) does more work than the verb itself. Strong integration but not fully irreplaceable as phrased.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The scattered-light method is signaled in paragraph six (sunlight breaking through clouds, fracturing through ice), demonstrated in paragraphs seven–eight (polarized glass transforms scattered light, revealing hidden layers), and its mechanics matter for the decryption. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The method constrains Kai's access (requires altitude, ice, goggles, and specific angle of refraction) and enables the entire revelation. High causal pressure and closure linkage; the mechanics are irreplaceable (the story's physics depend on this exact optical principle). The final paragraph's thematic echo ("scattered light to reveal what lies hidden") reinforces rather than introduces the method, and the goggles' removal in the ending image charges the element's payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The icebound spire is established in paragraph two and its translucent ice walls enable the scattered-light decryption (paragraph six onward). The setting constrains choice: Kai must be at this altitude, in this structure, with these ice walls, for the optical encryption to work. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The spire's frozen, light-scattering properties are irreplaceable for the mechanics; the captain's empty quarters at floor ten provide the closure space. Moderate causal pressure; the setting enables rather than complicates. Specificity is high (ancient ice, translucent walls, thousand-meter elevation above clouds). The final image (cold room, empty desk) charges the ending with spatial resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The ten-floor climb is announced in paragraph three and tracked continuously: floors five, seven, eight, nine, and ten are marked with narrative beats. The timeframe tightens revelation (each floor deepens intimacy) and structures the story's escalation. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The elevator's ascent is irreplaceable: the altitude enables the scattered-light decryption, and the climb's progression mirrors Kai's emotional journey from duty to understanding. High causal pressure; the constraint shapes every beat. The final floor's arrival delivers closure in the captain's quarters. The live clock (elevator climbing) alters tactics (Kai must read during ascent) and charges the final image (reaching the top, stepping into the empty room).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation—to seek joy beneath anguish—is stated in paragraph fifteen and dramatized through Kai's reading of the diary's double-layer ink (fainter words revealing the captain's joy). Setup is late (mid-story) but functional; development occurs across floors 8–9 (Kai discovers the captain's joy in observing Kai's hands, humming, presence); payoff is the final realization that "their quiet devotion had been seen, had been the joy beneath another's pain." The motivation is irreplaceable for thematic closure; it reweights Kai's service and the captain's anguish. Moderate causal pressure; the desire is more received than pursued under conflicting pressures. The friction between curiosity and grief is implied but not deeply dramatized as competing costs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Affectionate detachment is stated in the opening (paragraph three: "respectful distance of their station") and the ending (paragraph nineteen: "settled over them like a familiar cloak"). The tone modulates across the climb: professional observation (early floors), growing intimacy (floors 8–9), and final equilibrium (grief present but tempered). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The tone constrains Kai's choices (no presumption, warm curiosity within boundaries) and charges the final image (goggles removed, set gently on the desk, rather than kept). Moderate causal pressure; the tone is coherent and purposeful but does not force a harder emotional trade-off. Specificity is high; the paradox of affection and detachment is specific to the servant-captain dynamic and shapes the ending's emotional register.</comment>
