<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara remains an observer throughout, wandering and sitting without making choices that alter her situation. Her "brittle awakening" and decision to "become a bridge" are asserted through exposition rather than dramatized through conflicted action. Interior states are told via abstract labels ("isolation presses," "yearns to translate") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The final stance—"weaver of time"—arrives as declaration, not earned shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is ambiguous: the piece gestures toward accumulative texture but lacks a coherent pattern or cadence shift that reweights stakes with cost. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) appear but the "reincarnation memory" timeframe and the library's mechanics remain vague past the setup. No on-page decisive change occurs; Mara's transformation from isolation to "independence" is narrated summary without visible forfeiture or a final image that reconfigures prior material. The ending offers thematic assertion ("she has become independent") rather than closure with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The tidal library, stone circle, and brass sundial are vividly described with striking imagery (clouds, celestial tides, atomic reflections). However, these elements function as backdrop rather than constraining choices or supplying resources that alter outcome. Spatial choreography is coherent but the environment does not pressure Mara's actions in any decisive beat. The micro-setting allowance is not met; no tool or recurring object shapes a choice or charges the final image with consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—translating isolation into independence—is signaled early but never tested through a choice that narrows options or imposes visible cost. Mara walks, touches, sits, and learns without facing opposition or a trade-off. The sundial's "conduit" function and the stone circle's hum enable her goal directly, with no escalation or reversal. Agency is absent; the narrative moves by discovery and declaration, not protagonist-driven turns.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme of isolation versus independence and the legacy of the extinct is stated overtly ("independence does not mean solitude") rather than emerging from concrete action. The sundial and stone circle are deployed as symbolic props without transforming through specific choices. The final paragraph moralizes ("true independence demands the courage to hold multiple truths") instead of offering a resonant image. Subtext is minimal; every thematic claim is spelled out on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Mara with consistent psychic distance. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout, matching the speculative-mythic frame. However, perceptual signature is generic: phrases like "brittle awakening," "resilient truth," and "weaver of time" could apply to any contemplative protagonist. Syntactic patterns repeat (she + verb constructions) without purposeful variation. Voice texture is present but not character-particular under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops and thematic redundancy pervade the text: "brittle awakening" recurs without reweighting; "isolation into independence" is restated across multiple beats; "contemporary of extinct species" appears in setup and close without transformation. Template cadence dominates (She + action, each paragraph opening similarly). Figurative language ("atomic dance," "temporal tides," "neural pathways merging") clusters densely without pattern-teaching or payoff. Information density is low; many sentences restate prior claims. Final third loops key concepts ("hum," "reflection," "bridge") without advancing momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The premise—last human in a sky library preserving extinct species—is visually striking and the combination of reincarnation memory, sundial, and stone circle offers fresh texture. However, execution follows a familiar arc of mystical realization without specific grounding in lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. Emotional beats and the protagonist's inner conflict are generic (isolation → connection). The tidal library and spectral species remain ornamental rather than integral to causality. Synthesis shows craft but lacks bold risk or transformation that would make removal of any element break the story.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Mara is identified as "contemporary of extinct species" in the opening and this label recurs throughout. However, her choices do not hinge on this identity; she observes and records ghosts without the role creating a key turn. The attribute is thematic backdrop, not a constraint or enabler of plot moves.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The brass sundial appears in the setup (discovery behind scrolls), is touched to trigger a realization, and later "acts as a conduit" projecting ghosts. It spans three beats but remains a passive device; Mara does not use it to make a tactical choice or face a cost. Swappable with any mystical artifact. Late closure mention is ornamental, not causally active.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Brittle awakening" is invoked twice: once when Mara touches the sundial and again near the climax. The phrase labels her realization rather than shaping on-page stakes or constraining options. The concept is thematic echo, not a driver of action or escalation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"Atomically reflective" is applied to the sundial's surface and described ("atomic dance of ancient sunlight," "atomic light on fragments"). The trait enriches imagery but does not enable or constrain an action with visible cost. It is ornamental specificity, not functional.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Coexist" is the verb governing Mara's relationship with the spectral species. She learns to coexist by the hum, sits among stones, and merges rhythms. This action defines the middle and ending stance, but no turn traces to it; she achieves coexistence without conflict or trade-off. The verb is integral to theme yet does not redefine options through pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The hum of the ancient stone circle is signaled early, appears in multiple beats (guides translation, rewrites neural pathways, recorded onto scrolls), and is present at closure. However, the mechanics are vague; the hum enables Mara's transformation without cost or constraint. It is a mystical given rather than a means that shapes tactical choices.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The tidal library is introduced in the opening and recurs throughout (shelves shifting, tides drawing memories, clouds parting). It provides vivid backdrop but does not pressure choices or supply resources that alter outcome. Spatial features are described rather than used; the setting is postcard-level, not micro-setting that constrains action.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the reincarnation memory" anchors the timeframe in the opening beat and the memory is revisited ("she hears the whisper of her own past life"). The timeframe establishes mood but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. It is a static backstory frame rather than a live temporal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The desire to translate isolation into independence is stated explicitly in the opening and repeated across multiple beats ("she yearns," "she decides to become a bridge," "she has become independent"). The motivation is central to theme and drives the ending stance. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices; no friction between want and cost is enacted on the page.</comment>
