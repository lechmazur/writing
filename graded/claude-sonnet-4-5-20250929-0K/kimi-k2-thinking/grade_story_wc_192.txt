<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The shadow keeper remains a cipher; her choices are narrated in abstract ("burned bridges carefully," "tended the shadows") without embodied micro-decisions under visible pressure. The visiting man appears only as a passive recipient of teaching; his agency is told rather than dramatized through resistant choices. Internal contradiction is absent—both characters flow through the text in agreeable gestures without conflicting impulses acting simultaneously. Therapy-speak and diagnostic language ("suffocating to breathe," "reconcile loss," "loaded emptiness") saturate interiority without grounded sensation or choice-driven cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed well past 120 words; who the keeper is, where the sanctuary exists physically, and when this occurs remain vague throughout—applying the Orientation Test penalty of −0.4. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, but no decisive change or resonant reconfiguration lands on the page; the final paragraph restates the opening premise without reweighting cost or foreclosing a path. "She burned bridges carefully, but she also built them, one breath at a time" is thematic summary, not closure with felt consequence. The man's departure and return promise is a micro turn, but the keeper's situation remains unchanged with no visible price paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "ashen charcoal sanctuary under starlight" recurs but never constrains a tactical choice—it functions as atmospheric backdrop. Spatial choreography is unclear: walls, corridors, altar, and threshold appear without coherent layout or distances. The doorknocker ring is placed on an altar, but no prior mention of the altar exists, breaking continuity. Sensory detail defaults to visual abstraction ("loaded emptiness," "shadows dancing") without haptic, auditory, or olfactory grounding that would anchor the POV's professional or survival priorities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—teaching the man to breathe again—is declared but never tested by a competing need or visible price. No on-page reversal narrows options; the man arrives desperate, she teaches him, he leaves promising return, all without friction or trade-off. "Breathing is a bridge we build" offers thematic assertion, not a choice that forecloses a path. The sanctuary's "loaded emptiness" shifts to "quiet, shared life" via summary rather than a dramatized escalation, and no cost alters later tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme is stated overtly: "Breathing is a bridge we build," "shadows are the only breaths that remain when the world turns to ash," and the final two paragraphs summarize the keeper's role as "to teach suffocating to breathe." The doorknocker ring and threshold are token recurrences without constraining a choice or reweighting prior material through action. The ending offers no resonant image or non-literal answer; it cycles back to the opening premise with a new visitor in a static loop. Thematic Echo in the penultimate and final paragraphs triggers the −0.6 deduction for prompt-language summary in place of earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on the keeper, but psychic distance is inconsistent—early paragraphs offer close sensation ("calloused hands"), while later beats drift into distant summary ("She realized," "She decided"). Dialogue appears in two brief exchanges; the keeper's "Because shadows are the only breaths..." and "Breathing is a bridge we build" sound like thematic placards rather than goal-driven speech with subtext. Diction repeatedly uses "loaded emptiness" and synonym variants ("tender," "careful," "fragile") without distinct perceptual signature. Filter verbs cluster in the middle third ("she recognized," "she knew," "she realized") without voice motivation, but the spread does not reach the stack threshold for the global 9+ disallow.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "She burned bridges carefully" (line 5) / "She burned bridges carefully, but she also built them" (line 45); "loaded emptiness" appears three times without reweighting; "threshold" and "fading" recur in template cadence. Template sentence stems dominate the second half: "She taught him to breathe again," "She taught him to sculpt his breath," "She taught them all to breathe." Mixed metaphor: "threshold itself was fading, its edges blurring like a breath in winter"—thresholds have edges, breath does not blur edges. Stock phrases ("quiet desperation," "fragile hope," "rare crack in her stoic facade") appear in peak beats without fresh embodiment. Cumulative artifact penalty of −1.2 applied; artifacts touch the final third, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise—isolated healer in an ashen sanctuary teaching the suffocating to breathe—closely matches archetypal "wounded healer" and "threshold guardian" templates without transformation through verifiable world logic or specific lived detail. The doorknocker ring, scars as silent language, and shadows as memory are symbolic conveniences introduced without prior grounding. No fresh inflection or non-obvious synthesis emerges; the final image of a new visitor arriving repeats the opening cycle without reweighting. The transformation test fails: plot and arc function identically with different names and setting.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The tender shadow keeper is present throughout but makes no on-page choice that narrows options with visible cost. She "decided to keep the doorknocker ring close" (summary) and "welcomed" new arrivals, but these are narrated states, not dramatized decisions under pressure. Setup and closure participation gates are met (present first paragraph, present final paragraph), but middle development—a choice that constrains or enables—is absent. Swappable with "healer" or "guide" without structural loss. Late penalty (no mid-scene development) −0.5, ornamental use −0.7, summary-only −0.5; cap at 4.6 for missing middle development applies, final score 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The doorknocker ring appears in three beats: introduced (paragraph 6), placed on altar (paragraph 34), and held close as talisman (paragraph 40). Setup gate met; middle development weak (placing it on altar is passive staging, not a choice under pressure); closure participation met (talisman for future). However, the ring's mechanics or cost never constrain a choice—it is a symbolic token, not a causal lever. Swappable with any relic. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.9; ornamental use −0.8, swappability −0.6. Net 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The fading threshold frames expectation (paragraph 3), recurs in middle beats (paragraphs 20, 30, 39), and shapes the final image (paragraph 50: "the threshold, though fading, remained a doorway"). It signals that connection is fragile and constrains the keeper's bridge-burning/building tension. Setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, causal pressure (it "pulsed with possibility" alters the keeper's stance) +0.8. Swappability −0.5 (could be "door" or "portal" with minor edits). Net 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Burns bridges carefully" appears as a label (paragraph 5) and is restated thematically (paragraph 45: "She burned bridges carefully, but she also built them"). No on-page scene dramatizes her burning or rebuilding a bridge with visible cost or tactical constraint. The man's arrival and departure do not hinge on this trait. Setup gate met; middle development and closure participation are label-only, not action. Late (label restated at end) −0.4, ornamental −0.8, summary-only −0.6, swappability −0.5. Cap at 3.8 for swappability; final 2.9.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Encroach" appears once (paragraph 9: "a figure who had begun to encroach upon her sanctuary") to introduce the man's arrival. It does not shape middle beats—he arrives, she teaches, he leaves—without the encroachment generating conflict or cost. Setup gate met; middle development and closure participation absent (the man's presence is cooperative, not encroaching, after the initial label). Introduced early +0.6, one beat +0.4; ornamental −0.7, summary-only −0.6, resolves a problem it did not help create −0.9. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle; final 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Linking through scars" is introduced (paragraph 13: "She knew the method") and used once (paragraph 14: "When she touched his scarred hand, the shadows...trembled" and paragraph 31: "linking through the old wounds"). Setup met (paragraph 13); middle development weak (the touch is passive, not a choice that alters tactics); closure participation absent (not present in final image). Two beats +0.9, early signal +0.5; ornamental −0.6, summary-only (the method is told, not shown with mechanics) −0.7, swappability −0.5. Cap at 4.6 for missing closure; final 3.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The "ashen charcoal sanctuary under starlight" recurs in opening, middle, and final paragraphs but never constrains a choice or supplies a tactical resource. It is atmospheric postcard description. Setup +0.7, three beats +1.4; ornamental −0.9, swappability (could be "cave," "temple," or "chamber" without loss) −0.7. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development (no choice shaped by setting); final 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"After cutting off all contact" (paragraph 2) establishes the timeframe but no live clock tracks duration or tightens decisions. The man leaves "at dawn" (paragraph 42), the only temporal marker; night deepens (paragraph 28) and starlight fades (paragraph 44) without affecting tactics. Setup gate met; middle development absent (time does not pressure choices); closure participation absent (no clock at ending). Early signal +0.5, one beat +0.4; ornamental −0.7, summary-only −0.6. Cap at 3.4 for missing middle development; final 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"To teach suffocating to breathe" is stated (paragraph 21: "her motivation was not merely to teach suffocating to breathe, but to reconcile loss") and demonstrated in action (paragraphs 16–17, 26–27). Setup met; middle development present (teaching the man across multiple beats); closure participation weak (paragraph 48: "Her role as shadow keeper was to teach suffocating to breathe" is summary, not a choice under pressure). Two beats +0.9, early signal +0.6, causal pressure +0.7; told summary in closure −0.5, swappability −0.4. Net 4.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Loaded emptiness" appears verbatim three times (paragraphs 15, 24, 37, 47) without modulation. Tone is static melancholy throughout; no cadence shift under pressure or charge in the final image beyond repetition. Setup +0.6, four beats +1.4; static mood (no modulation) −0.8, ornamental recurrence (label-only) −0.7, template repetition −0.4. Net 4.4.</comment>
