<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to measure his father's confession is clear, but his interior life leans heavily on abstract metaphors ("truth had mass," "silence grew heavier") rather than embodied contradiction. The decision to twist the valve and release the ghosts arrives without visible internal conflict—no competing impulse or cost that forecloses another path. The final choice to call the historical society feels more summary than dramatized struggle, reducing agency to a calm post-crisis plan.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: beads, ghost shift, radio psychic fragments layer toward a final release. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Elias releases the trapped souls and commits to speaking the confession aloud. Cost is legible (he shoulders the memory's weight, ends the silence), but the valve-twist moment lacks friction; no on-page obstacle resists the turn. The causal link from father's confession to Elias's present探索 is clear, but the middle sequence (radio calls, ghost materialization) accumulates atmosphere more than it tightens options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned train tunnel and rusted rails anchor locale early; "damp concrete breath," "phantom looms," "spectral cotton dust" are vivid and voice-consistent. The valve wheel constrains the climactic choice (twist to release), satisfying the micro-setting gate for 9+. Spatial choreography (junction, sub-basement door) is coherent. No major setting errors, but the ghost-shift looms could have been more tactilely grounded in how Elias moves among them.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Elias's need to measure and release the weight of his father's confession. The valve-twist at the climax narrows options (release the souls or seal them forever), but Elias faces no meaningful opposition or trade-off—he simply turns the wheel and the ghosts dissolve. Cost (carrying the memory forward, calling the historical society) is stated but not dramatized as a difficult choice. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure coheres but does not escalate sharply; the final act reweights but does not tighten.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—truth's measurable weight, silence heavier than fire—emerges organically from the beaded valve and the ghost shift. The final image (wheel with "confession booth shuttered and opened at last") reweights prior material without a stated moral. No overt sermonizing. The thirty-seven beads = thirty-seven souls device borders on tidy symbolic arithmetic, but it avoids abstraction by anchoring in the concrete count and Elias's embodied understanding.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Elias's perceptual signature—appraisal vocabulary, religious skepticism—colors the narration ("beaded like rosary beads he didn't believe in," "appraising the hysteria"). Psychic distance is consistent. However, several phrases drift into elevated register ("phantom looms and ghost shifts," "memory's mass") that feel more authorial than character-particular. No dialogue, so subtext and voice distinction tests do not apply. Compression and rhythm are controlled, but the lexicon sometimes outpaces Elias's established blue-collar texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("truth had mass," "silence grew heavier," "swallowed truths clogging his chest," "confession booths," "memory's mass"), creating a cumulative lyric texture but verging on overwriting in peak beats. Several paraphrase loops: "swallowed truth" recurs in slight variations across five paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence in the middle section ("The radio shrieked… Elias's fingers found… He twisted slowly…") flattens momentum. No major grammar or clarity breaks, but the metaphor load and repetitive stems merit −0.6 under the artifact screen.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The ghost-shift premise and beaded valve as confession-counter offer a fresh synthesis of industrial-gothic and embodied metaphor. The thirty-seven beads = thirty-seven souls device is inventive but borders on mechanical tidy-ness. Elias's arc (from skeptical appraiser to witness and speaker) feels earned in hindsight. The radio-psychic framing device adds texture but remains ornamental—it does not constrain Elias's choices. Overall, a specific angle on haunting and historical guilt, but the closure mechanism (twist valve, ghosts vanish) resolves too smoothly to feel risky.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias is present from the start and drives the key turn (twisting the valve). His exploration frames the narrative. However, his decisions feel more determined than reckless—he proceeds methodically without visible internal debate or consequence that tests his commitment. "Reckless" is asserted in the final third ("reckless explorer") but not dramatized in choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The beaded valve wheel appears early (paragraph 1), is handled in multiple beats (carried, appraised, twisted), and its properties (thirty-seven beads) directly enable the climactic release. The wheel's glass eyes and midnight-turning lore charge the atmosphere. Removing it would collapse the closure mechanism. Strong integration, though the wheel's mechanics (why twisting it releases souls) are asserted rather than earned through prior rule-building.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The factory ghost shift shapes the dominant stake (releasing trapped workers) and materializes on the page in the sub-basement scene. It alters Elias's understanding and drives the final release. Present in setup (father's confession), middle (radio calls describe it), and payoff (ghosts dissolve). Solid integration, but the shift's manifestation is more atmospheric than tactically constrained—Elias does not navigate competing ghost demands or risks.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Religiously skeptical" is labeled early ("rosary beads he didn't believe in," "dismissing the whispers") but does not constrain a choice with cost. Elias's skepticism does not prevent him from twisting the valve or believing the ghost shift when it appears. The trait colors voice but remains ornamental to the action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Appraise" recurs as a verb and lens throughout (appraising the mill's legacy, the valve's worth, the hysteria, the scene). It colors Elias's stance and final decision ("appraising its worth not in dollars but in gravity of confession"). Present in setup, middle reflection, and closure framing. However, the act of appraisal does not itself turn the plot—twisting the valve does. Swappable with "assess" or "measure" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The radio psychic appears in two middle beats, offering thematic echo ("truth had mass," "beaded wheel that turned backward time") but does not shape Elias's method. He does not interpret the calls to solve a puzzle or alter his approach; the radio is atmospheric backdrop. The frantic callers describe the ghost shift, but Elias already knows the history from his father. Present but largely ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned train tunnel anchors every beat, provides the junction fork that Elias navigates, and houses the sub-basement door that the valve opens. The setting's "damp concrete breath" and "warmer" left fork guide Elias's choices. Spatial pressure is clear; the tunnel is indispensable to the action. Strong integration across setup, middle navigation, and closure space.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"During the hush that follows a sudden confession" frames the timeframe as post-father's-confession (thirty years later) and the immediate silence after Elias releases the ghosts. The "hush" recurs in the final third ("the eternal hush after confession") and charges the ending. However, urgency is not tracked—no live clock tightens Elias's moves. The timeframe is more thematic bracket than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"To find the weight of a swallowed truth" is stated early and drives Elias's exploration and final release. The motivation is dramatized in his carrying the valve, counting the beads, and twisting the wheel. Present in setup, middle reflection, and closure (he "found the weight and released it"). However, the motivation does not face friction—no competing desire or cost that forces a hard choice. Solid but not indispensable; the plot could pivot to "honor the dead" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Drowsy alertness" is introduced early ("sleep-deprived yet hyperaware") and recurs at closure ("drowsy alertness finally tipping into exhausted peace"). The tone modulates from tense observation to spectral encounter to quiet resolution, supporting the accumulative lens. The paradoxical vigilance colors Elias's perceptual signature. Present in setup and payoff; contributes to atmospheric coherence but does not constrain a choice.</comment>
