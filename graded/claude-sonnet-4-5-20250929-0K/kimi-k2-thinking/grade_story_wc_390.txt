<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The engineer's trait as "logically emotional" is label-only; the text tells us she "parse[s] fear as frequency and love as amplitude" but this never constrains an on-page choice with visible cost. Her weeping for the creature's hunger is embodied, but the interior voice relies heavily on elevated abstractions ("forced silence," "crushing weight of drowned prayers") that feel imposed rather than lived. The final choice to use sonic absolution is motivated by Guild training rather than internal conflict between competing impulses. Micro-choices exist (striking the key, humming at 7.8 Hz) but they execute a plan without visible struggle or contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors appear by line 5 (engineer, drift-ice marina, sunset, whalebone flute). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered sensory and metaphorical density until the climactic harmonic chord dissolves the creature. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the creature released, the engineer's heart "still tuned to 7.8 hertz, its rhythm changed") with felt cost visible in her altered state. One structural issue: the creature's demand for the flute and the engineer's response via key+voice feel under-motivated; we learn the key can "unbind souls" but not why striking it against her coat buttons at that moment creates the decisive overtone.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina constrains her planned escape ("the marina's ice had shifted, locking the boats"), forcing adaptation. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "frozen kelp," "crystalline fist," "rose-gold glass." The key's bronze teeth and the whalebone flute function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image when their "duet of protection" forms the harmonic solution. The setting's sonic properties (ice singing, floes as "frozen tongues") are integrated into the climax and coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: protect the sacred artifact from the shadow-creature. The ice locking the boats creates one meaningful tightening (no escape route), forcing the engineer to confront rather than flee. The climax—using vibrational matching to dissolve the creature—shows agency, but the cost is abstract: her heart's rhythm changes, yet we don't see how this forecloses a path or what she loses. The creature's dissolution feels resolved by technique rather than trade-off; there's no visible price paid (stamina, voice damage, loss of the key's future function) that alters her options afterward.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme of sonic absolution and the duality of engineer/keeper emerges through imagery: "tactile precision" vs. "transcendent empathy," frequency as both science and spiritual tool. The final image of her walking toward the lighthouse with coat "heavy with salt and sound" offers resonance, but the closing lines over-articulate the theme ("The fleshly ethereal world demanded both… forever balanced"). The drowned keeper's whispered gratitude and scattering into stars is effective, yet the piece edges toward explaining its own meaning rather than letting the particulars speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited throughout. Perceptual signature exists: the engineer's sensory world is filtered through acoustic and vibrational terms. However, elevated diction pervades even high-pressure moments ("sonic absolution," "frequency parasite," "sympathetic resonance," "duet of deliverance") that feel more authorial than character-bound. The phrase "logically emotional creature" and "no third option in her engineer's lexicon" read as external framing rather than lived voice. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Overwriting is pervasive: nearly every sentence carries stacked metaphor or elevated abstraction ("sorrow's geometry," "vibrational matching," "ethereal hand pressing against her ribs"). In the climactic beat, density obscures propulsion: "Together they formed a chord of sonic absolution, forgiveness made not of words but of perfect resonance that rewrote the creature's code" is a three-part metaphor cascade. Paraphrase loops appear: paragraphs 31–32 repeat the closure idea (artifact fulfilled, prayers answered). Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "The [noun]" or "She [verb]." These artifacts dull momentum and touch the closure image, triggering the lower penalty tier. Filter verbs ("felt," "saw," "knew") cluster in peak beats without voice motivation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise—lighthouse engineer uses sonic tools to dissolve a grief-bound spirit—offers a fresh synthesis of occupational detail and metaphysical conflict. The "crypt keeper's key" as tuning fork rather than physical lock is a strong inflection. However, the execution leans on familiar beats: lone protagonist, frozen escape route, spectral guardian demanding artifact, final harmonic battle. The "logically emotional" engineer and "fleshly ethereal" tone feel more like prompt responses than inevitable character logic. Risk-taking in the metaphorical density is ambitious but reduces clarity without heightening stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Azure-coat lighthouse engineer present throughout and her choices (strike key, hum at 7.8 Hz, create overtone) drive the climax. Setup clear (paragraph 1), development constrained by ice (paragraph 8), payoff in the harmonic resolution (paragraphs 23–25). However, her decisions execute Guild training rather than forcing a values conflict; swapping her for another trained engineer would not alter the plot structure. The coat's azure color recurs but does not carry causal weight beyond visual motif.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Crypt keeper's key appears in paragraph 1 (tasted), paragraph 10 (struck against piling), paragraph 18 (grows warm), paragraph 23 (struck against coat buttons), and paragraph 33 (warm, humming with memory). Three distinct functional beats: tuning/testing (para 10), sympathetic resonance (para 18), harmonic overtone creation (para 23). Its bronze teeth being "tuned for sonic absolution" (para 11) is crucial exposition. Present at closure with reweighted meaning ("two freed souls"). Strong integration across setup, development, payoff with visible causal role. Cap at 7.2 due to slight convenience: the key's exact mechanical function (why striking against buttons creates the decisive overtone) is under-dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sonic absolution introduced as concept (para 11: "frequency that could unbind souls from sorrow's geometry"), enacted in climax (para 25: "chord of sonic absolution"), and reflected in closure (para 29: "prayers answered through her voice"). It shapes the protagonist's method—using matched frequency rather than physical force—and defines the creature's release mechanism. However, the concept is more thematic frame than tactical constraint; the engineer never debates whether to use it, test it, or adapt it under pressure. Present in all three gates but more architectural than choice-altering.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Logically emotional" stated in paragraph 5 as Guild training descriptor ("trained… to parse fear as frequency and love as amplitude"). Paragraph 16 echoes: "Logically, it could be undone; emotionally, she wept." This is label-only exposition; no on-page choice shows the trait constraining her options or enabling a tactic. Her weeping is embodied but generic; her logic is summary. The attribute does not shape a visible trade-off or cost. Introduced early, mentioned twice, absent from closure work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Adapt" signaled in paragraph 9 ("Adapt or surrender: there was no third option"), enacted when ice locks boats and she must confront rather than flee (paragraphs 8–10), and reappears in final paragraph ("She had adapted… She would adapt when ice groaned with new threats"). The action redefines her options from escape to confrontation, driving the plot's major turn. Present in setup (para 9), precipitates the climax (no skiff → must use key/voice), and charges the closure image. Strong causal role and irreplaceable; removing "adapt" would require rewriting the core choice. Minor friction: the second closure mention (para 37) is slightly redundant.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vibrational matching introduced in paragraph 17 ("Through vibrational matching, she began to hum, her vocal cords vibrating at exactly 7.8 hertz"), executed across paragraphs 17–25 (hum → key warms → ice sings → chord forms), and reflected in closure (heart "still tuned to 7.8 hertz"). The method is specific and its mechanics matter: matching the creature's frequency is the tactical linchpin. Setup slightly late (para 17 is ~40% in), but development and payoff are strong. The earlier mention of 7.8 Hz in paragraph 6 primes it. Causal pressure is clear; removing this method would break the resolution.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina anchors the opening (para 1), traps the boats (para 8: "ice had shifted, locking the boats in a crystalline fist"), and transforms into a resonant surface during climax (para 21: "The ice beneath her boots began to sing in harmony"). Setup immediate, development constrains escape route, payoff integral (ice as harmonic bridge). The setting's acoustic properties enable the resolution and are irreplaceable. Strong integration across all three gates with visible causal role and cost (no escape forces confrontation). The marina's final state (para 28: "mirror of rose-gold glass") charges the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Fleeting golden sunset appears in paragraph 3 ("fleeting golden sunset dripped across the sky") and paragraph 30 ("The fleeting golden sunset slipped beneath the waves"). It frames the scene temporally and tonally but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; the engineer's actions unfold without reference to the setting sun's pressure. The word "fleeting" implies urgency but is not dramatized—no "light fading, must act now" moment. Present at setup and closure (lyric reprise) but absent from middle development. Ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Motivation stated in paragraph 4 ("sacred artifact thrummed, a whalebone flute") and paragraph 14 ("It screamed… demanding the whalebone flute"). The artifact's protection is the nominal stake, but the engineer never debates surrendering it or weighs its value against another cost. She simply defends it via her training. The flute participates in the climax (para 24: "its own ancient melody rising unbidden") but the motivation is told rather than conflicted. Setup present, payoff present (flute used), but development lacks friction between desire and competing cost. Functional but replaceable with any "protect X" stake.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Fleshly ethereal tone established early through paradoxical sensory detail: "tasting bronze," "flesh felt the sound as a physical pressure, an ethereal hand," "copper and salt on her tongue, a fleshly ethereal sensation" (para 20). The tone modulates with pressure—tactile specificity intensifies during the confrontation—and charges the final image (coat "heavy with salt and sound," para 33; "fleshly ethereal world demanded both," para 36). Coherent throughout, but the closing articulation (para 36) edges toward explaining the tone rather than sustaining it through image alone. Strong setup and consistent execution; minor slip at closure.</comment>
