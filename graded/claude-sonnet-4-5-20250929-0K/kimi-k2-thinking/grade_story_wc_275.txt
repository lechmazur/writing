<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation is consistent (peace-keeping against chaos) and her perceptiveness is demonstrated in concrete moments (reading the deserter's tremor, noticing petal curl). However, her arc lacks genuine internal contradiction or cost—she never faces a meaningful dilemma that tests her pacifism against survival pressure. The stranger's arrival and departure occur without forcing Lyra into a choice that would foreclose a path or reveal competing impulses acting simultaneously. Her endurance feels static rather than earned through dramatized conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clear early (Lyra, glass dome, post-collapse desert). The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: ritualized actions layered with symbolic objects (sandbag scrap, engraved disc, roses) building toward a thematic reconfiguration. The ending image—disc on altar, sandbag beside it, roses blooming as "silent vow"—attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost remains abstract and asserted rather than felt on the page. No single beat narrows Lyra's options or changes her stance; the stranger's visit is a micro-episode that doesn't tighten the dominant stake (maintaining peace/continuity). The closure unit lacks the sharpness required for high-band entry.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The glass dome, desert roses, and sand filters create a vivid micro-setting that constrains Lyra's world (she must clear clogged filters using the sandbag scrap as counterweight). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (perfume as "quiet fire," burlap texture, dust storm rattling glass). The sandbag scrap's physical use to clear filters demonstrates that objects constrain choice, elevating this above pure description. However, the desert beyond the dome remains generic ("fractured mosaic of warring factions") without specificity that would ground the threat or make the enclosure feel more urgent.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—maintaining peace and continuity inside the dome against external chaos—is signaled early but never truly pressured. The stranger's arrival offers a complication but resolves passively (he leaves a thank-you note); the dust storm is weathered without tactical cost. No beat forces Lyra to choose between competing goods or pay a visible price that alters later options. The story accumulates atmosphere but lacks escalation under the Accumulative lens: no pattern break, no cadence shift that reweights the stake with felt cost. Agency is observation and ritual rather than decision with consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme of peace versus chaos emerges through concrete particulars (roses, engraved disc, sandbag as "counterweight to memory") rather than stated thesis. The final image attempts to distill this without moralizing. However, the ending drifts toward thematic summary ("a silent vow that the quiet would endure") that borders on overt statement. The engraved "quiet" hums with potential but remains more metaphor than dramatized cost. Lyra's arc doesn't wrestle with a genuine thematic question—she begins committed to peace and ends the same, with no earned complication or repricing of her values.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Lyra; no head-hopping. Voice is distinct with lyric texture ("petals thick like parchment," "perfume a quiet fire") and the prose modulates with scene pressure (shorter syntax during the storm). However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels imposed rather than character-filtered ("inculcating plants with values," "fractured mosaic"). Free indirect style is mostly clean. The deserter's interiority is read through observation, which maintains distance appropriately. Rhythmic control is evident but some figurative density ("quiet fire" appears twice) feels recycled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally good. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "Each morning she walked... singing hymns" restates "inculcating plants with values" without added pressure; "quiet fire" repeats as descriptor for both perfume and the disc's presence. Template stems recur ("She [verb]" opens multiple beats). Stock metaphors populate peak moments ("quiet fire," "threads in the tapestry"). The final paragraph stacks summary lines that restate rather than advance ("Together, they anchored her world, a world where..."). These artifacts dull closure momentum and trigger accumulated line-debt penalties.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The glass-dome rose farm in a post-collapse desert offers visual freshness, and the pairing of pacifist daughter with bounty hunter father has narrative potential. However, the execution follows a meditative-vignette template: rituals, a passing stranger, symbolic objects, a reaffirming ending. The emotional arc is linear without genuine risk—Lyra's peace is tested only by weather, not by a choice that might fail or cost her something irreplaceable. The "engraved quiet" as talisman reads as concept-first rather than emergent from lived particulars. Transformation test: swap "roses" for another crop and "dome" for another shelter, and the arc remains unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lyra is present throughout and her pacifist stance is consistent (inviting the stranger, offering tea, no violence). However, her choices do not create key turns—she observes, tends, and endures without facing a dilemma that alters tactics or costs her something on the page. The stranger's arrival could force a decision (risk versus safety) but she invites him in without hesitation or visible consequence. She is focal but not decisively active at closure; the roses bloom and the disc rests on the altar as static symbols rather than outcomes of her choices. Functional but replaceable as a decision-maker.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sandbag scrap appears in multiple beats: kept in a wooden box as talisman, pressed to chest during storm, used as counterweight to clear filters, placed beside the disc on the altar at closure. Its burlap texture is handled on the page. The filter-clearing use (middle beat) demonstrates functional constraint. However, its meaning does not evolve—it remains "balance" and "reminder" from first mention to last without reweighting under pressure. Present across setup, development, and payoff, but the causal work is modest (one mechanical use) and the closure reprise is ornamental rather than charged with new cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Engraved quiet" is introduced early (father's parting gift), handled mid-scene (held to lamp, slipped into pocket, fills her mind during storm), and appears in the final image (placed on altar, reflecting last light). It shapes Lyra's internal stance ("quiet could be a shield") and the stranger carries it away as a gift. However, it does not constrain a tactical choice or force a tradeoff on the page—its function is symbolic/atmospheric rather than plot-driving. The concept is woven through but remains more thematic echo than active pressure. Two-gate participation (setup, closure) with mid-scene touches, but swappable for another calming talisman without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Senselessly perceptive" is demonstrated early (notices petal curl, scent of rain, reads the deserter's tremor and story). This enables Lyra to offer targeted care (tea, cot) without asking his name. However, the trait never constrains her or imposes a cost—there's no moment where her heightened perception leads to a mistake, overwhelms her, or forces a difficult choice. It functions as competence flavor rather than a double-edged attribute. Label is activated through observation but does not create visible tradeoff or complicate her path. Functional but one-dimensional; no on-page price paid for the gift.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Sheathe" appears once: Lyra checks pruning-knife cuts after the storm and sheathes the blade as "ritual, a promise that violence would not take root." The action encapsulates her pacifist stance and is tonally apt. However, it does not create a turn—no option is foreclosed, no cost paid. The knife never threatened use; sheathing is symbolic confirmation rather than a decision under pressure. Introduced late (final third), it performs thematic work but is easily swappable for another non-violent gesture. Purposeful but not causally essential; cap applies for late intro and ornamental function.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Inculcating plants with values" is signaled early ("singing hymns of peace into the soil," teaching roses patience/resilience/compassion) and mentioned again mid-story ("told them stories... In this way, she inculcated"). The method frames Lyra's daily ritual and thematic mission. However, the mechanics never matter on the page—there is no beat where this practice enables or constrains a choice, no moment where it succeeds or fails under pressure. It remains told rather than shown affecting outcome. Setup present, development thin (repeated mention but no test), no payoff where the plants' "values" alter events. Thematic garnish without plot function.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The glass-domed desert rose farm is introduced in the opening paragraph, provides the spatial frame for all action, and supplies concrete constraints: filters clog with sand (requiring the sandbag counterweight fix), the dome trembles under wind, glass panels rattle in the storm. Lyra's work—walking rows, clearing filters, standing at center during the storm—is embodied and location-specific. The enclosure's fragility against external chaos charges the final image (dome glowing as sanctuary). Setup, development (filter problem), and closure all hinge on this setting. Its physical properties shape tactics and amplify thematic pressure. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"After the tower falls" is mentioned in the opening line and alluded to later ("stories of the tower that once stood tall, of peace after the fall"). It establishes post-collapse context but does not function as a live timeframe that tightens decisions. No clock pressure, no ticking deadline. The tower's fall is backdrop mood rather than a temporal constraint that alters Lyra's tactics or shapes the ending. The stranger's overnight stay and "weeks passed" are vague durations without urgency. Present as setting color; absent as a pressure mechanism. Ornamental historical marker.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To weave continuity through chaos" is Lyra's explicit motivation, stated early ("weave continuity through the chaos outside") and restated near the end ("she spun a quiet continuity, one petal at a time"). Her daily rituals (singing to roses, tending them, inviting the stranger) dramatize this desire. However, the motivation never faces genuine friction—no moment where continuity and another need conflict, no cost that tests her commitment. The want is consistent and shown through action but not complicated by fear or competing impulse. Desire is present and drives behavior; lack of on-page conflict with cost keeps it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" manifests in recurring imagery: "perfume a quiet fire," "colours shimmering like embers," "dome glowed," "engraved quiet," final image of "tranquil blaze of the setting sun." The tone pairs stillness with intensity and is coherent across beats. During the storm, urgency enters ("breathing slowly") but the underlying calm-amid-fire mood holds. The final image ("dome glowed like a sanctuary") directly charges closure with this exact tone. However, the tone does not modulate meaningfully with pressure—it remains uniform rather than tightening or breaking under the stranger's arrival or the storm. Coherent and purposeful, but static rather than dynamic. Present in closure image; modest escalation.</comment>
