<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's dual allegiance is clearly established and embodied through concrete gestures (tracing the stone chip, watching corporate logos). Internal conflict operates through simultaneous pulls rather than alternating summaries. However, the emotional arc feels smoothly calibrated rather than contradictory under peak pressure—no genuine mistakes compound before resolution. The final smile and determination read as resolution without visible cost foreclosing a prior path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. The story teaches a pattern of encoded messages building community resistance, but closure lacks decisive on-page cost. Mira's final determination ("hopeful desperation turning into determination") is asserted rather than earned through a visible forfeit or crystallized trade-off. The phoenix mural and community readiness function as setup for future conflict rather than a closure unit that reweights prior stakes with felt price. Orientation is clear early; causality holds within the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The floating carnival setting is vivid and specific (blackwater, raft city, strobing Ferris wheel). The foundation stone chip constrains Mira's choices as a tactile anchor and charges the final image when she slips it back into her pocket. Spatial choreography across the raft city remains coherent. Sensory detail is purposeful but leans visual; the turpentine-and-hope moment stands out as embodied specificity that shapes a beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserving the carnival's spirit against privatization—is signaled early and sustained. The graffiti sequence shows Mira's agency reshaping community tactics, and the storm washing away some murals provides one meaningful pressure point. However, the corporation's arrival the next morning does not test Mira's choices with visible cost; agents see "only a vibrant carnival" without on-page consequence or trade-off that narrows her options. Escalation is coherent but closure cost remains implied rather than legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of resistance through encoded art emerges organically from Mira's actions. The foundation stone chip shifting from memory anchor to embodied determination functions as a charged motif. However, the final phoenix mural and "hopeful desperation turning into determination" verge on overt symbolic summary. The piece resists moralizing but does not offer a resonant, non-literal answer—it stops at setup for future struggle rather than reweighting prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited anchored in Mira's perceptual filter. Diction remains consistent and voice-specific ("liquid sky," "orderly intuitive"). The piece maintains appropriate psychic distance and no head-hopping occurs. The child's understanding glance and Mira's embodied handling of the stone chip demonstrate clean focalization. Minor: some lines approach elevated register ("defiant roar against the tide of privatization") that slightly exceeds the established voice texture under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Prose is clear and propulsive with strong opening and closing images. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. The "turpentine and hope" sensory blend is concrete and fresh. Minor artifact: "hopeful desperation" appears as a label in the opening and then again in the final paragraph as "hopeful desperation turning into determination," which edges toward thematic echo rather than embodied shift, but does not obscure closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The floating carnival and graffiti-as-resistance code offer a specific synthesis. Mira's dual allegiance and culture-shock-absorber role provide character particularity. However, the privatization-versus-community-spirit frame follows a recognizable template (gentrification resistance, coded messages, phoenix-rising symbolism) without transforming it through non-obvious moral calculus or a turn that redefines the premise. The transformation test is weak: swapping carnival for another threatened space would leave the emotional arc largely intact.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira as culture shock absorber is signaled early, frames her dual allegiance, and enables her role as community organizer. She makes key decisions (painting murals, encoding messages) that shape two beats and the ending. However, "culture shock absorber" itself is a job title rather than a trait that constrains or costs her—any organizer role could serve similarly. The specificity of the role does not create irreplaceable pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The foundation stone chip appears in three distinct beats: mid-story tactile anchor, storm-scene reminder, and final pocket gesture. It carries thematic weight (memory, fragility) and charges the closing image. Early seed and closure reprise with reweighted meaning are clear. However, the chip does not constrain a choice with visible cost—it serves as symbolic anchor rather than tactical object. Strong lyric integration but falls short of indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dual allegiance to carnival and corporation is stated early and motivates Mira's covert methods. It shapes her tactics (encoded graffiti to avoid open speech) and appears in two beats (corporate logo moment, final determination). However, the allegiance does not produce an on-page trade-off or cost at closure—Mira's final stance favors the carnival without visible forfeit of the corporate tie. The concept frames stakes but does not alter options decisively at the end.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Orderly intuitive" is mentioned once as a label describing how Mira sees patterns. It does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. The attribute could be replaced with "perceptive" or "pattern-minded" without structural change. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Reorganize" is signaled early and motivates the graffiti murals and resource-gathering timetable across multiple beats. The action drives the middle sequence and connects to the ending community readiness. However, the reorganization itself is complete before closure—the final image is Mira's smile and determination, not a reorganization choice with cost. The action is essential to the plot but does not redefine options at the last beat.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Messages encoded in graffiti art are introduced early, shape three distinct beats (compass rose, clock face, phoenix map), and drive Mira's tactics throughout. The mechanics matter: only carnival children can read the code, which creates selective community participation. The method is indispensable to the plot and charges the closure (agents see "secrets hidden in plain sight"). Strong causal integration and closure linkage; one step short of irreplaceability due to swappability with other encoded-message methods.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The perpetual carnival afloat on a raft city is established in the opening and provides vivid setting detail across beats (floating boardwalk, Ferris wheel, main tent). The raft city's fragility (rotting wood, rusted steel) underscores stakes. The setting enables the graffiti surfaces and supplies the spatial stage for all action. However, the carnival does not constrain a key choice with visible cost—Mira could organize resistance in any threatened neighborhood. Strong atmospheric integration but the floating-carnival specificity does not alter tactics decisively.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "before privatization" is stated early and motivates urgency. The corporation's deadline and next-morning arrival create a loose clock. However, the timetable does not tighten Mira's decisions on the page—she paints murals over several nights without visible time pressure altering her tactics. The timeframe frames stakes but does not function as a live clock that narrows options at closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Navigating gentrification is Mira's stated goal and motivates all actions (community organizing, graffiti encoding). The motivation is dramatized through choices rather than told-only. However, the friction between wants and costs is muted—Mira's dual allegiance to the corporation does not produce on-page conflict at closure. She sides with the carnival without visible forfeit. Motivation shapes the arc but lacks the cost-friction required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Hopeful desperation is coherent and modulates across beats: the turpentine-and-hope blend, the storm's threat, the child's spark of understanding. The tone charges the final image (smile, determination, stone chip in pocket). However, "hopeful desperation" is explicitly named twice, which edges toward label rather than embodied modulation. The tone supports closure but the direct naming in the final paragraph slightly flattens its charge.</comment>
