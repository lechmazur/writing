<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's interior life is rendered through concrete actions (collecting bugs, releasing them) and the retrospective pattern of his giving establishes character particularity. However, the pivotal realization—"transformation wasn't a texture you could touch, but a vibration you joined"—arrives as unearned epiphany rather than through embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure. The prophetic frame positions him as vessel rather than agent, which diffuses the cost of his final act of release. Interiority drifts toward lyric abstraction ("carving him hollow so he could be filled with this moment") without the embodied friction that would ground the shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors adequately (Kael, black sand beach, volcanic setting, celestial alignment) within the opening lines. The closure unit—releasing the bugs, understanding saving and being saved as one motion—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis), but the cost is conceptual and felt rather than concretely foregrounded; the village waking to clean water is told aftermath, not on-page consequence that Kael witnesses or trades against. The causal chain from dislodged stone → pig → bird → fish → clogged filter is mechanical coincidence that solves a problem Kael did not know existed, undercutting agency at closure. The inferred lens is Hybrid (causal setup, accumulative/textural lyric resolution), but the coincidence machinery weakens the earned quality of the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Black sand, sulfur, volcanic steam, and tidal pools are vividly rendered and filtered through Kael's practiced attention ("thirty years of collecting"). The crimson bug's unusual light and the synchronized pulse of the collection charge the final image, and the bottles function as micro-setting that constraints the release action. Spatial choreography is clear across the beach, treeline, and village below. The celestial bodies remain atmospheric rather than tactically constraining, but the volcanic seeps and black sand pressure Kael's path inland, meeting the 9+ gate of environment shaping choice and charging closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding transformation's texture—is signaled early and pursued through the bug-collecting ritual. However, escalation lacks a meaningful tightening under protagonist agency: the crimson bug pulls him inland, the dislodged stone triggers the coincidence chain, and the village's salvation occurs off-page without Kael's knowledge. The final act of releasing the bugs is framed as realization rather than a choice that forecloses a live option with visible cost. One micro-turn (the crimson bug's appearance) shifts his attention, but the resolution is delivered by prophetic fulfillment rather than earned agency, and the cost—his "destitution complete"—is lyric assertion rather than on-page forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme of transformation-as-participation emerges organically from the bug collection, the pattern of Kael's unintended consequences, and the final synchronized release. The ending image—bugs rising in a spiral mirroring the planets—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without overt moralizing. However, the penultimate paragraph's explicit articulation ("saving and being saved were the same motion") edges toward thematic statement rather than trusting the dramatized release to carry the weight. The prophecy frame enriches ambiguity (is transformation his or the island's?) but also introduces a safety net that softens the cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Kael; psychic distance is controlled and the narrative voice carries distinct lyric texture ("sandals whispered," "hush that vibrated with subsonic thunder"). Perceptual signature is consistent—Kael notices light, rhythm, causality—though under peak pressure the prose remains lush rather than compressing to match urgency. Free indirect style is clean. However, phrases like "the weight of realization settling into his bones" and "carving him hollow so he could be filled with this moment" drift toward poeticized abstraction that slightly undermines embodied immediacy. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent ("living ember," "constellation of small sacrifices"). However, the piece exhibits mild overwriting: elevated diction in almost every sentence without pattern-teaching ("subsonic thunder," "phosphorescent insects," "celestial bodies in rare conjunction") and occasional mixed metaphor (sand "whispered" but also created "hush that vibrated"). Paraphrase loop appears: "he gave his time" and "he gave his attention" restate the same idea across paragraphs. The scaffold phrase "Kael knew none of this, busy as he was" is expository summary that could be cut. Template cadence in the retrospective section ("He'd given… He'd given…") is purposeful parallelism but borders on formulaic. Information density is high, but the lush register slightly dulls propulsion in the middle third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of destitute philanthropist, bug collector, and accidental prophet offers a non-obvious premise, and the detail of crimson versus golden bugs adds specificity. However, the prophetic fulfillment frame and the mechanical coincidence chain (stone → pig → bird → fish → filter) lean on familiar "everything happens for a reason" scaffolding. The lyric meditation on transformation is executed with craft but does not transform the underlying template. The ending's resonance arises from established particulars (the bugs, the bottles, the synchronization), lifting the piece into solid territory, but the derivative prophetic structure and lack of fresh moral calculus keep it from higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael is present throughout and his final decision to release the bugs drives the closure image. However, his role is more vessel than agent: he is "drawn" by the crimson bug, the stone dislodges accidentally, and the prophecy positions him as fulfillment rather than architect. The retrospective examples of his giving (school, house) establish pattern but are summary. His on-page choice to release the bugs is earned by the synchronization realization, meeting two gates (setup, payoff) with moderate causal pressure, but the middle development is passive observation rather than constrained decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lightning bug collection is handled across multiple beats: initial capture, addition of the crimson bug, synchronized pulsing, and the climactic release. The bottles function as constraint (the bugs "would soon die if not released") and the collection's light charges Kael's face and the final image. Early signal is clear, middle use shows the crimson addition altering the collection's meaning, and the release shapes closure directly. Removing the bottles would collapse the story's tactile center and the closure mechanism. Reaches high band through three-gate presence, beat involvement, and closure linkage with visible cost (the collection dispersed).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "whispering hush" appears in the opening line and recurs twice ("the whispering hush deepened," "the hush vibrated with vibrant silence"), but functions primarily as atmospheric motif rather than stake-shaping concept. It does not constrain Kael's choices or alter his tactics; instead it underscores tone. The reprise at the end reweights the opening mood but lacks causal pressure. Present in setup and payoff with lyric resonance, eligible for mid-band, but the absence of middle-beat constraint and swappability (other atmospheric descriptors could serve similarly) cap it below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Kael is described as orchestrating "generous impulses that always seemed to multiply beyond his control," and the retrospective examples (school → spring, house → burial site) illustrate this trait. However, the on-page action (dislodging the stone) is accidental rather than orchestrated, and the trait is label-only in the present scene. The attribute is signaled early and its past effects are causally linked to current setting (the preserved beach, the village), meeting two gates, but it does not visibly enable or constrain a present-tense choice with cost. The label "orchestrates coincidences" vs. the reality (passive fulfillment) creates conceptual friction that lowers integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Kael's detour inland toward the crimson bug is the pivot that leads to the stone dislodgment and, ultimately, the coincidence chain. The detour breaks his "usual" path around tidal pools, signaling a deviation with potential cost. It appears early-middle and drives the key sequence, but the detour itself is passive (he is "pulled" by the bug's light) rather than an effortful decision against competing pressures. Removing the detour would require restructuring the inciting sequence, demonstrating essentiality, but the swappability of the trigger (any anomaly could pull him inland) and the lack of visible trade-off limit the score to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The prophecy is introduced at the story's quarter mark and establishes the frame for Kael's role, but the "accidentally" mechanism is summary-only: past examples are told, and the on-page fulfillment (stone → chain) is unconscious. The method is present in setup and payoff (the final line confirms "a prophecy fulfilled"), but Kael never knows he is fulfilling prophecy, so the mechanics do not shape his attempts or constrain his choices. Functional but swappable with other fate-vs-agency frames, and the absence of on-page dramatized "accidental" cost limits integration to the functional band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The black sand beach at the foot of the active volcano is anchored immediately and filters all sensory detail (sulfur, steam, volcanic breath, ash). The setting provides the crimson bug (a mutation tied to the volcanic environment), the treeline where the detour occurs, and the spatial relationship to the village below. The volcanic seeps and tidal pools guide Kael's path choices, and the black sand's "perfect darkness" and scent are embodied repeatedly. The beach's preservation (a result of Kael's prior gift) closes a causal loop. Early signal, middle constraint (detour inland), and closure participation (bugs drift toward village) with irreplaceable specificity push this into high band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The celestial conjunction (Venus and Mars) is mentioned in the opening and tied to the prophecy's activation ("during planetary alignments, these words became physical"). It casts "elongated shadows" and the final bug spiral mirrors "the planets above," creating lyric bracket. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create a deadline; Kael is unaware of the alignment's significance. Present in setup and payoff with thematic resonance, but the lack of middle pressure or tactical constraint (no clock forcing urgency) limits integration. The alignment is atmospheric enabler rather than driver, capping the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Kael's desire to understand "the texture of transformation" is stated in the third paragraph and pursued through the nightly bug-collecting ritual. The question "consumed him" and the final realization ("transformation wasn't a texture… but a vibration you joined") directly addresses it. However, the motivation is mostly interior monologue; it does not create on-page friction between competing wants (he faces no pull to stop collecting, no cost to continuing). The retrospective giving establishes pattern, but present-tense dramatization of conflicted choice is thin. Early signal, thematic payoff, but limited middle friction lower the score to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The tone is established immediately ("whispering hush," "subsonic thunder") and held through lyric description and quiet intensity. The prose modulates slightly as pressure rises (the crimson bug, the synchronized pulse, the release), and the final line—"the hush vibrated with vibrant silence"—charges the closure image by reprising and inverting the opening's "whispering hush." Tone is coherent and purposeful, supporting the accumulative/textural lens. However, the lush register remains nearly static across emotional beats, missing an opportunity for cadence shift under peak pressure. Present throughout with closure charge, eligible for mid-high band.</comment>
