<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The pianist's interiority is present but often abstract ("steely longing," "wistful"), leaning on label-speak rather than embodied contradiction. His motivation—to "surprise fate with an unplanned encore"—remains a conceptual claim; we see him play but the cost of the journey (bleeding fingers) arrives suddenly without prior physical struggle or trade-off dramatized in choice. The broken clock is handled twice but functions as static symbol rather than a decision point that forecloses options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece assembles atmospheric fragments (station, film archive, airship ascent, arbor arrival, final performance) and signals closure through the encore and the compasses finding peace. Cost is implied—he leaves the station, plays until his fingers bleed—but the decision to depart and the stakes of that departure are told rather than tested in a moment of friction. The orientation anchors (station, pianist, storm approaching) land early; the closure image (encore complete, compasses still, arbor as refuge) reweights the opening longing, qualifying as Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost, though the cost arrives in summary.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The station's skeletal glass-and-steel frame, the battered upright piano, the film archive, and the tidal arbor are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (yellowed keys, rusted strings, silver branches, moss-covered platform). The arbor's "bark humming with a low, resonant frequency" and the storm raging below establish a micro-setting that charges the final performance. Spatial choreography across the airship ascent and arbor landing remains clear, and the environment constrains the protagonist's refuge, meeting the 9+ gate for setting pressure on closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding refuge and completing the unplanned encore—is signaled early and pursued across beats (film search, airship journey, final performance). Escalation occurs through atmospheric accumulation (storm intensifies, arbor appears, performance persists) rather than causal reversal, fitting the Accumulative lens. However, the cost (bleeding fingers, imagined reconciliation) is compressed into the ending without prior tactical friction or a moment where the protagonist weighs continuing versus stopping. One meaningful deepening is present but the price lacks on-page dramatization in a choice beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—steely longing as defiance against fate and the possibility of rewriting broken time—emerges through recurring images (broken clock, flickering compasses, encore as bridge). The final image (compasses at peace, music etched into wind) offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. However, phrases like "a challenge to the predetermined silence" and "fate had been surprised" nudge close to thematic echo; the piece resists full abstraction but leans on conceptual vocabulary where a sharper particular would heighten resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature (music-theory diction, atmospheric attunement). The prose modulates from thin urgency at the station to velvet stillness at the arbor, fitting the emotional arc. However, register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("a living cradle above the clouds," "the promise of another encore") that feels authorial rather than character-particular. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled and purposeful throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but mostly coherent (ghost of a waltz, cloud stuff, silver threads). Line-level clarity holds across spatial moves. Paraphrase loops appear: "The horizon invited night" recurs three times with minimal variation; "flickering compasses" and "steely longing" are repeated formula rather than evolved motif. Template cadence in the ending third ("He played until…," "He closed…," "He smiled…," "He would play again…") stacks identical stems without taught pattern, triggering −0.6 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack. Information density is high but scaffold phrases ("as if," "a reminder that") pad several beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The synthesis—pianist as mapmaker, film archive hiding coordinates, floating arbor refuge—is specific and non-obvious. The tidal arbor and hidden-film mechanic offer fresh inflection on the refuge quest. However, the emotional arc (longing, departure, solitary performance as defiance) follows a familiar template without transformation through lived friction or an unexpected moral calculus. The piece commits fully to its premise but the protagonist's journey unfolds without surprise; the encore is declared rather than earned through on-page resistance or cost that reshapes his stance.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Setup present (opening paragraph). Development: he decodes the film and pilots the airship (two beats). Closure: he performs the encore at the arbor. His choices—threading the reel, copying coordinates, stepping onto the airship, playing until fingers bleed—advance the plot. However, many actions are procedural; the key turn (deciding to leave versus staying) is elided. Two gates strong, closure participation moderate; causal pressure present but swappable protagonist actions lower irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Setup: pocket, second paragraph. Development: "a cold weight against his chest" (airship scene), "opened the broken anniversary clock" (arbor platform). Closure: "the broken clock still silent" (penultimate paragraph). Handled in three beats but remains static symbol of lost love; its silent gears do not constrain a choice or alter tactics. Lyric reprise reweights the opening but without causal pressure or cost tied to the object itself. Late first detailed use (arbor) and ornamental function cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup: "flickering compasses swung erratically" (paragraph 6), framing indecision. Development: he watches them, they spin wildly during the storm (two beats). Closure: "the flickering compasses, now at peace, pointed toward a new direction" (final paragraphs). The concept shapes the protagonist's internal state and the ending image reweights prior uncertainty. However, the compasses do not constrain a tactical choice or narrow options; they function as atmospheric correlative rather than actionable stake. Two strong gates, closure linkage clear, but lacks causal pressure on protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Setup: "His strategically creative mind saw a puzzle where others saw only static" (paragraph 11). Development: scanning frames for anomalies, copying coordinates onto sheet music (one beat). Closure: not mentioned. Label-only trait in one sentence; the puzzle-solving is functional but the attribute itself does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost. Swappable with "clever" or "resourceful" without structural change. Missing closure participation caps at 2.8; single middle beat with modest causal work lifts to 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: "Seeking refuge" (paragraph 9) signals the action early. Development: the film search, airship journey, and arbor landing are all refuge-seeking (three beats). Closure: "a refuge in the sky" and "sanctuary above the turmoil" (final third). The action drives the plot and shapes the ending image. However, "refuge" is broad; the specific means (film decoding, airship) could be retooled with minor edits. All three gates present, strong causal involvement, but moderate specificity and no unique cost tied to "refuge" versus "escape" lower irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setup: "archives, where reels of black-and-white film lay coiled" and "hidden sections, frames that held a map" (paragraphs 9–10). Development: threading the projector, scanning frames, marking anomalies, copying coordinates (paragraphs 12–18, four beats). Closure: the map enables the airship route; the method's mechanics (wave hint, silhouette sequence) shape his tactics and solve the refuge problem. All three gates strong, high causal pressure, specific and irreplaceable mechanics. Cost: time spent searching under storm pressure. Strong integration across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: rumors of "a tidal arbor above the clouds" (paragraph 10). Development: the arbor appears through mist, he lands on a sturdy bough, the bark hums, the arbor sways and cradles the airship (paragraphs 23–27, 37). Closure: "The tidal arbor held him, a refuge in the sky" (paragraph 43). The setting provides the sanctuary that resolves the storm threat, supplies the platform for the encore, and charges the final image. All three gates met, high causal necessity, setting pressure decisive. The arbor's floating, resonant nature is irreplaceable; another refuge would lack the symbolic and physical specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Setup: "Tonight, the horizon would invite night, and with it a storm" (paragraph 8). Development: "the horizon began to bruise, inviting night" (paragraph 20), "The horizon invited night, draping the arbor in velvet darkness" (paragraph 34). Closure: "let the horizon claim the last light" (paragraph 41). The phrase recurs across four beats and the storm's approach creates urgency. However, the timeframe is atmospheric rather than tactical; no on-page moment shows the protagonist racing a clock or altering plans because night arrives. Lyric reprise strong, but lacks causal pressure on choices. Two gates (setup, closure) plus poetic development; moderate integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Setup: implied in opening longing and "broken anniversary clock" context. Development: not explicitly named until "He played an encore, unplanned, a surprise for fate" (paragraph 33). Closure: "fate had been surprised, and that an unplanned encore could reshape destiny" (paragraph 42). The motivation appears late (past 50% mark) and is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choice. We see him play but not wrestle with whether to perform or the cost of surprising fate versus accepting loss. Late arrival, summary-only, label-driven; caps at 4.6 for late intro, further lowered by lack of friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: "a longing that cut through the mist" (paragraph 3), "steely longing" (paragraphs 32, 38). Development: tone modulates from thin urgency (station) to velvet stillness (arbor), maintains coherence through atmospheric diction. Closure: "His steely longing softened into something like hope" (paragraph 38), "a steely longing etched into the wind" (final line). Tone charges the final image and reweights opening mood. However, "steely longing" is repeated as label rather than embodied through varied sensory or syntactic texture. All three gates met, strong closure linkage, but static repetition and moderate modulation lower the score below 7.0.</comment>
