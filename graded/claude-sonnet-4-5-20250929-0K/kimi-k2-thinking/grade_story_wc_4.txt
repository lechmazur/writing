<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The archivist exists as a static vessel for theme rather than a character under pressure. No internal contradiction or embodied struggle appears; she moves through prescribed gestures ("perceptively calm" repeated as label) without micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. The widow and young man who contribute photographs arrive as abstract representatives, not individuals with distinct motives. Interiority is generic ("believed in collective healing") and the final child interaction offers wisdom-dispensing rather than friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural, but no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with visible cost lands on the page. The archivist begins arranging photographs and continues without alteration; the ending ("one last photograph in the arc, completing the circle for now") is a continuation, not a closure unit. The piece summarizes years of gradual transformation ("slowly, imperceptibly at first, the town began to heal") rather than dramatizing a before/after with felt stakes. Orientation Test penalty applied: who/where/when anchors emerge cleanly, waiving −0.3 to −0.5.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Lavender field and factory ruins are vividly rendered ("rusted factory ruins," "corroded steel," "purple rows"), but setting remains postcard description rather than constraint. The flat stone altar and dove gray map case are handled across beats, qualifying as micro-setting, but neither object alters a tactic or charges the closure image with new pressure. Spatial choreography is coherent; sensory detail is present but not filtered through urgency or character-specific professional bias.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake ("transmute pain into a masterpiece") is signaled early but never tested or tightened. No reversal or deepening occurs; the archivist's method works without complication, and visitors add photographs in frictionless accumulation. The piece offers gradual accretion over years without a single on-page choice that narrows options or forecloses a path. Agency is observational arrangement, not decision under pressure, and no visible cost appears at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme (collective healing through rearranged grief) is stated repeatedly ("collective healing," "transmute pain into beauty") rather than emerging from dramatized particulars. The child's question and the archivist's answer ("a map of how hurt becomes beauty") are direct thematic summary. The dove gray map case and arcs recur but without accumulating pressure or reweighting prior material; they illustrate the theme rather than complicating it. Final image ("completing the circle for now") restates the premise without resonance or felt cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited with a consistent, elevated register. Perceptual signature exists ("she could almost hear the machines humming") but is generic across the field rather than character-particular. Psychic distance is controlled, though the narrator occasionally drifts into omniscient summary ("the town began to heal"). One brief dialogue exchange with the child is functional but does not advance plot or carry subtext. Diction is uniform and somewhat abstract ("topography of memory," "cartography of sorrow") without modulation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "The arcs in black-and-white photographs told stories" / "arcs in black-and-white photographs that resembled the lavender's own flowering patterns" / "via arcs in black-and-white photographs." Template cadence runs through summary blocks ("It was then she would linger," "In this way, collective healing became," "And so the subtle puzzle archivist continued"). Stock metaphors cluster without fresh vehicle ("topography of memory," "weaver at a loom," "cathedral of remembrance"). Filter-verb stacks ("could almost hear," "would linger") dull immediacy in peak moments. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: baseline −0.8 in Q7 for loops, template runs, and stock phrasing; −0.6 additional for presence in final third, total −1.4.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Core premise (archivist arranging grief photographs in a lavender field) has lyric potential but executes without transformation. The piece follows a template healing-through-art arc with no fresh inflection; the archivist's method works as declared, and visitors contribute in predictable sequence. Emotional progression is generic and could transfer unchanged to different names and places. No bold risk-taking or non-obvious synthesis; the story explains its thesis rather than dramatizing it. Derivative Premise Guardrail: template healing narrative without lived-detail transformation triggers −0.8 within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Subtle puzzle archivist is present throughout but makes no key choices that alter tactics or stakes. She arranges photographs in prescribed patterns without friction, complication, or reversal. Observation and thematic labor dominate; no on-page decision forecloses a path or shifts the story's pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Dove gray map case appears in opening, middle ("dove gray map case held not just photographs"), and final paragraph ("dove gray map case a talisman of transformation"). Handled across three beats, but use is static description; it carries items without constraining choice or being reweighted at closure. Swappable with any container without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Collective healing is the stated theme and appears repeatedly as label ("collective healing," "the practice of collective healing"), but it does not shape on-page stakes or tactics. The concept is told and illustrated through summary rather than tested in a choice that changes options. Echoed thematically without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Perceptively calm is repeated four times as label ("perceptively calm presence," "perceptively calm, a still point," "The archivist, perceptively calm") without dramatizing a cost or enabling a specific action. No on-page moment shows the trait constraining a choice or creating friction; it functions as static descriptor.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Linger appears in five beats ("linger among the purple rows," "she would linger longest," "lingering in the spaces between," "Each visitor who lingered"). The action is present but ornamental; it describes contemplative posture without creating a turn or redefining options. Easily swappable with "remain" or "stay" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Via arcs in black-and-white photographs is signaled early and described in middle passages ("arcs in black-and-white photographs told stories," "arcs in black-and-white photographs that resembled the lavender's own flowering patterns"). Method is explained but not shown shaping a failed or successful attempt; it is the medium of thematic illustration rather than a constraint that affects outcome.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Lavender field tucked behind rusted factory ruins is established in the opening line and recurs throughout. Setting provides atmosphere and symbolic resonance but does not pressure choices or supply resources that alter outcome. The field is stage rather than obstacle or tool; no micro-setting detail constrains a tactic at a key beat.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>As vines climb appears in opening ("vines climbed the corroded steel"), middle ("vines climb higher each year"), and closing ("as vines climb and lavender swayed"). Timeframe is present as backdrop indicating years passing but does not tighten decisions or create urgency. No live clock alters moves; time is summary gloss rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>To transmute pain into a masterpiece is stated early ("made it her life's work to transmute pain into a masterpiece") and repeated in final section ("turning rust into perfume and grief into grace"). Desire is told, not dramatized through conflicted choice. No on-page friction between want and cost; the archivist pursues the goal without obstacle or tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Earnest whimsy is present in diction ("subtle puzzle archivist," "ghost-laughter of lunch breaks," "earnest whimsy of her task") and maintains coherence across the piece. Tone does not modulate with pressure—there is no pressure to respond to—and the final image restates the established mood without charging or complicating it. Static mood throughout; no tonal shift that reweights stakes.</comment>
