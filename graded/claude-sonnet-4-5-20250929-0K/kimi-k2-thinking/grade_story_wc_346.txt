<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The adjuster is single-POV with interior access, but her interiority leans heavily on label-driven language ("beautifully flawed" x4, "bruised awe" x2) rather than embodied contradiction. The boy's memory provides motivation, yet the adjuster's micro-choices feel abstract—touching spirals, placing the head—without visible trade-offs or genuine risk on the page. The closure involves dissolution of the puppet head and her smile, but no foreclosed path or felt cost emerges; she achieves her goal without complication. Pervasive therapy-speak ("beautifully flawed," "bruised awe") in peak beats triggers −0.5 under the anti-pattern rule.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive slowly: "doomsday clock adjuster," "hidden lighthouse," "dusk" establish who/where/when by ~50 words, acceptable. However, the piece offers no legible closure under any lens. Causal: no because/therefore linkage tightens options—she arrives, performs her task, succeeds without obstacle. Accumulative: density does not increase or break pattern; the prose remains uniform throughout. Situational: no stance crystallization under pressure; she enacts her plan unopposed. The puppet head dissolves, the clock stops, she smiles—no decisive change, no cost, no path foreclosed. Closure form is absent; applying Q2 baseline penalty for missing on-page closure with cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse, spiral stairs, circular room, and ocean-as-mirror provide spatial anchors and vivid sensory detail (sunset bleeding, ocean forgetting waves). The "pane of hush" recurs but functions as metaphor rather than constraint; it does not alter a choice or tactic. The puppet head is handled across multiple beats (pocket, spindle, dissolution), meeting the micro-setting test for object-as-setting, which lifts the score into the 6-band. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—vouchsafe a lullaby as pattern—is signaled early but never tested. The adjuster faces no opposition, makes no trade-offs, and encounters no reversal or complication. She places the head, traces spirals, the head glows and dissolves, mission complete. No tightening, no escalation, no cost legible on the page. Under any lens, pressure is static; coincidence (the head's glow, the clock's transformation) resolves without protagonist agency forcing a difficult choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of mercy-through-brokenness and silence-as-love emerges from the puppet head's cracks and the lullaby-as-geometry conceit. However, the final paragraphs drift into overt moralizing: "brokenness that had made salvation possible," "mercy into the geometry of endings," "silence answered with grace"—all stated rather than dramatized. The nested-pattern motif recurs but does not constrain choice or charge closure; it remains decorative. Thematic Echo penalty (−0.5) for thesis-like phrasing in the final third: "endings could be merciful," "what could never be heard."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. However, the prose recycles stock constructions: "beautifully flawed" appears four times, "bruised awe" twice, "nested patterns" nine times, "pane of hush" seven times—template cadence without taught pattern. Perceptual signature is present (geometry, spirals, light refraction) but voice modulation under pressure is absent; diction remains uniformly elevated and abstract throughout. Filter verbs ("she saw," "she felt," "she imagined") cluster in the climax without voice motivation, adding line-level drag.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "nested patterns" x9, "beautifully flawed" x4, "pane of hush" x7, "bruised awe" x2. Adjacent sentences restate without added pressure: "The adjuster's bruised awe deepened" / "she was the curator of endings, yet this ending felt like a gift." Template cadence runs: "She [verb]" / "The adjuster [verb]" across multiple beats. Figurative language in most sentences (spirals, seashells, dandelion seeds, monument) without pattern-teaching creates density without clarity. Applying Q7 artifact penalty pack: paraphrase loops + template stems + filter stacks = −1.4, plus final-third presence disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The doomsday-clock-as-nested-geometry and lullaby-as-silence premises are conceptually ambitious but executed through abstraction rather than specific lived detail. The adjuster's occupation and the boy's timeline remain generic; no fresh synthesis emerges from their interaction. The puppet head's transformation (glow → dissolve → become clock heart) follows familiar metaphysical-object logic. Recycled phrasing (nested patterns, beautifully flawed) and stock imagery (spirals, seashells, dandelion seeds) reduce originality. No bold risk or non-obvious moral calculus; the ending's mercy is asserted rather than earned through particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The adjuster is present throughout and her action (placing the puppet head, tracing spirals) drives the middle and ending. However, her choices lack friction or cost; she enacts her plan unopposed. Setup clear, development present (spindle placement, spiral tracing), closure participation (she smiles, watches). Two-beat involvement (placement + tracing) +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, but no causal pressure (no narrowed options) −0.8, swappable with "keeper" or "curator" −0.4. Band ~5.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The puppet head appears in the opening (pocket), middle (spindle placement), and ending (dissolution into light). Three distinct beats +1.4, closure linkage (becomes clock heart) +1.2, specificity (cracked smile, missing eye) +0.5. However, it resolves a problem (the lullaby) without creating prior friction −0.7, and its properties (glow, dissolve) are convenient rather than earned. Band ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Pane of hush" recurs seven times but functions as metaphor (translates motion into memory, serves as lens) without constraining a choice or altering tactics. Setup present (opening), development (lighthouse lens mention), closure participation (she watches through it). Two-beat involvement +0.9, but ornamental use without action pressure −0.9, swappable with "veil" or "barrier" −0.6. Band ~4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Beautifully flawed" appears four times as a label attached to the adjuster, the puppet head, and "everything that mattered." It never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost; it remains thematic assertion. Setup clear, closure participation (final smile attributed to flaw), but label-only use −0.8, no causal pressure −0.8, swappable with "imperfect" −0.4. Band ~3.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Vouchsafe" appears three times: the task statement, the pattern-touch moment, and the final summary. It frames the dominant stake +0.6 and appears at closure +0.8, but the action itself (touching spirals to vouchsafe the pattern) lacks mechanics or cost; swappable with "bestow" or "grant" −0.6. Two-beat involvement (task statement + enactment) +0.9. Band ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Nested patterns" recurs nine times, shaping the clock's structure and the lullaby's encoding. Setup clear (clock face described early), development (tracing spirals, folding iterations), closure participation (patterns unwind, hold lullabies). Three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, but mechanics remain abstract (how does tracing encode a lullaby?) without cost or friction −0.8. Band ~5.6.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The hidden lighthouse at dusk provides spatial anchor and recurring imagery (spiral stairs, circular room, ocean view). Setup immediate, closure participation (she sits, watches). However, it supplies no pressure or resource constraint; the setting is postcard-descriptive rather than tactical. Two-beat involvement (arrival + ending vigil) +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, ornamental use −0.9. Band ~4.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Across the hush of time's final ripple" recurs three times as a phrase marking scope, but elapsed time is untracked and no clock tightens decisions. The adjuster performs her task without urgency or deadline pressure. Setup (opening mention), closure participation (final-paragraph reprise), but vague time without tactical impact −0.9, swappable with "at the end of time" −0.6. Band ~3.7.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The desire to whisper a lullaby is stated early (boy's request) and motivates the adjuster's task. However, it is told rather than dramatized in choice; no friction between want and cost appears—she succeeds without complication. Setup clear +0.6, two-beat involvement (boy's memory + enactment) +0.9, closure linkage (lullaby delivered) +0.8, but summary-only motivation without on-page conflict −0.8. Band ~5.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Bruised awe" recurs twice and the prose maintains an elevated, melancholic register throughout. Tone is static—no modulation with pressure, no shift at climax—and does not charge the final image beyond continuation of the same mood. Setup present (early mention), closure participation (deepened awe noted), but single static mood without escalation −0.7, ornamental repetition −0.5. Band ~4.4.</comment>
