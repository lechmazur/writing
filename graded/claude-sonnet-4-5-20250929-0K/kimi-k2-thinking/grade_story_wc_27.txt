<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kai's interiority operates through concrete perceptions—bare feet reading the floor's memory, teeth aching from the hum—and her awkward confidence crystallizes into action. The motivation to find meaning drives micro-choices (raising opera glasses, kneeling, singing), though the final stance feels more intuitive discovery than wrenching internal conflict. Embodied detail is strong, but the arc from stargazer to singer lacks visible cost or contradictory impulses that would complicate the choice. The label "awkward confidence" appears as telling rather than enacted contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kai breaks silence by singing through the stone circle, awakening dormant systems and summoning possibility rather than victory. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through sensory intensification (beacon pulse, hum, syncopated rhythm) until her voice becomes a tide. Cost is conceptual and felt: the lull ends, but the beacon will fade by morning, leaving only patient potential. Causality within the single scene is clean; the beacon-to-stone synchrony feels slightly convenient but the lens accommodates patterned coincidence that complicates rather than resolves.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport is vivid and purposeful: corroded hulls, metal grating underfoot, dust of failed uprising, launch pad seven. Kai's bare feet supply micro-setting constraint (tingling against grating, pressing stone monoliths) and sensory filter is consistent—stargazer priorities shape what she notices. The stone circle provides the resource (amplification) that enables the ending action. Spatial choreography across repair bay, observation deck, and stone circle remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering meaning in the wreckage—is signaled early and tightens through accumulative pressure: beacon pulse matches stone hum, Kai sings, systems awaken. One meaningful deepening occurs when her solitary voice becomes amplified tide, reweighting the lull into breakable silence. Agency is present (she chooses to sing), and cost is legible (the effect is temporary, "fade by morning"). The escalation operates under Accumulative lens—density and syncopation build to the broadcast moment—though the stone circle's mechanics arrive without prior struggle or failed attempts.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: silence as disease of waiting, frequencies versus tactics, bare feet reading memory. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—lulls can end, storms can be summoned—without moralizing. The opera glasses and stone circle return with reweighted meaning (vision shifts from sky to earth, ancient hum becomes current action). "Thunderous serenity" charges the closure image without abstraction, though "simple truth that silence could be broken" skirts thematic statement rather than pure image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Kai; perceptual signature is consistent (stargazer mind seeing patterns, frequencies over tactics). Diction carries purposeful compression ("margin of daylight," "thunderous serenity") and lyric density that fits the accumulative mode. Some register drift occurs: "reigniting the beacon's pulse with each note" and "defiant meaning" lean slightly elevated for the focalizer's idiom under stress. Free indirect style is clean, though one brief venture into collective rebel/occupier reactions ("frowned at the inexplicable signal") widens the lens without full POV break.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high and rhythm modulates purposefully, accelerating through the singing sequence. Minor artifacts appear: "The lull in rebellion" repeats across two sentences in the opening with slight paraphrase; "awkward confidence" is named twice without dramatized contradiction; "meaning" recurs frequently as abstract anchor. The final third avoids loops and the closure image is clean. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent, though "violent peace and silent storm" toggles to paradox without clear vehicle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of barefoot stargazer, stone-circle amplification, and abandoned spaceport in a rebellion lull offers specific, non-obvious grounding. The shift from observatory to underground monument, frequencies to song, reframes the familiar "spark of resistance" trope through sensory archaeology rather than tactical heroism. Risk-taking in the accumulative/lyric mode heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Some elements (twin suns, pre-colonial monument) feel lightly sketched rather than deeply inhabited, but the core vision coheres.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kai is present throughout, and her choices (moving to the stone circle, pressing palms, singing) create the ending turn. Setup is immediate, development includes the opera-glass search and barefoot reading, payoff is the song that awakens systems. Causal pressure: her stargazer's mind drives the pattern recognition, and the final act is hers. Swappability is low—remove "barefoot" and the tactile grounding weakens; remove "stargazer" and the frequency-vision logic blurs. Cost is conceptual (temporary effect) rather than visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Opera glasses appear in two beats: salvaged and raised in the opening, then lowered at the end. Use is observational (watching the beacon, not the sky), and the final lowering marks completion. The object does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; Kai could trace the beacon-hum synchrony with naked eyes. No cost tied to the glasses themselves. Closure participation is ornamental—"lowered" signals rest, not causal reweighting. Mid-band for dual beats but limited causal work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The lull in rebellion is signaled early ("three cycles," "disease of waiting") and shapes stakes on the page: leaders argue while Kai acts, rebels stir when the song broadcasts, occupiers frown. The lull frames the problem (silence, passivity) and the ending breaks it with summoned meaning. Development: the lull's weight drives Kai's search for frequencies over tactics. Payoff: "lulls could end" and "storms could be summoned" reweight the stasis into charged possibility. Cost is conceptual (beacon fades, hum remains) but the stake is transformed.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Awkwardly confident" is named twice but not enacted as contradictory impulses in a single choice. The trait is told ("moved through the debris with an awkward confidence") and later summarized ("her awkward confidence crystallizing into certainty") without visible tradeoff. No moment shows hesitation and boldness colliding to narrow options or impose cost. Present and thematically consistent, but swappable with "intuitive" or "untrained certainty" without structural loss. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Reignite" drives the major turn: Kai's song reignites the beacon's pulse, which then broadcasts and awakens dormant systems (ventilation, coolant, loudspeaker). Setup: the beacon is "solar-powered, somehow still alive" and pulses early. Development: Kai matches her lullaby to the pulse. Payoff: the amplification turns solitary voice into tide, stirring rebels and occupiers. The action is causally central and irreplaceable—"activate" or "awaken" would lose the image of rekindling dying light. Cost is temporal (fades by morning). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The hum of the ancient stone circle is signaled early (traced to launch pad seven, "older than the port"), and its mechanics shape the ending: amplification turns Kai's song into broadcast. Setup by first third. Development: Kai feels the hum intensify through her bones, and she matches it with song. Payoff: the stone circle's amplification is the causal engine of the climax. Mechanics are legible (resonance, broadcast) and matter to outcome. Cost is conceptual (ancient patience vs. temporary flare). Indispensable to closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport repair bay provides spatial grounding (corroded hulls, metal grating, observation deck, launch pad seven) and one resource: the loudspeaker that broadcasts Kai's song. Setup immediate, development includes traversal from bay to stone circle, payoff uses the port's dormant systems to amplify. The bay supplies the infrastructure for the ending effect. Swappability is moderate—another ruined site with tech could serve, but the pre-colonial monument beneath the launch pad ties setting to method. Mid-to-upper band for resource constraint and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Margin of daylight" (twin suns between rose and amber) frames the opening and is reprised at closure ("twin suns dipped lower, painting everything in bronze"). The timeframe provides atmospheric charge but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics—Kai's actions proceed without clock pressure. No urgency tied to nightfall, no missed window. Lyric reprise reweights tone (waiting for night, for what comes next) but imposes no cost. Functional mood element, minimal causal role. Mid-low band for bookend presence without escalation work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The motivation to discover meaning in the mess is dramatized early ("Kai alone wondered if the stars themselves had gone quiet") and conflicted through action: she searches not for tactical victory but frequencies. Development: "not a plan or a victory, but the simple truth that silence could be broken." Payoff: her work discovers meaning below rather than above. Friction is present (frequencies vs. tactics, stargazer vs. soldier priorities) and the final image pays off the desire. Cost is conceptual (meaning is temporary, ephemeral). Strong thematic integration; slight cap for "simple truth" telling.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Thunderous serenity" is named once midpoint ("feeling the hum rise through her bones, a thunderous serenity that was both violent peace and silent storm") and reprised at closure ("the thunderous serenity of the moment settled over her like a cloak"). Tone is coherent—quiet intensity, contradiction held in balance—and charges the final image (quiet before the storm, certainty that storms can be summoned). The oxymoron fits the accumulative lens and modulates with pressure. Swappability is moderate; "charged stillness" could substitute. Mid-upper band for purposeful reprise and closure mood, but limited constraint on choice.</comment>
