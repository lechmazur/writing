<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation ("to protect vulnerable voices") is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. The shift from ghost-hunter to emergency responder reads as coincidence rather than character-driven choice, undermining agency at the climax. Embodied emotion is present in moments like "heart hammering" and "trembling hands," but the introspection leans heavily on abstract constructions ("curiosity flares like a struck match") rather than character-particular thought. The ending choice to continue listening feels inevitable given the setup but lacks visible cost that would elevate it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a situational lens early (tracking voices in liminal space) but pivots mid-story to a causal rescue without sufficient groundwork—the hearing aid tracking a living heartbeat contradicts its established ghost-seeking function. Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately by the opening lines. The closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (continuing the cycle), but the cost remains abstract ("ready to follow the thread again") rather than legible in a concrete forfeiture or stance shift. The reveal that the pulse belonged to the living man, not Lila, creates a reversal, but it arrives via coincidence rather than protagonist choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium is vividly rendered through sensory detail ("pillars loom like ghostly sentinels," "surfaces slick with dew") and the hearing aid functions as both tool and micro-setting, constraining the protagonist's perception. The photograph on the bench and the broken window anchor spatial choreography clearly. The atrium atmosphere modulates with pressure, supporting the tonal shifts from eerie curiosity to medical urgency. However, the hearing aid's mechanics—how it distinguishes or confuses living and dead pulses—remain vague when they should constrain the protagonist's interpretation at the key turn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (finding and assuring lost voices) is signaled early but remains abstract until the medical emergency forces a concrete action. The crash and the man's collapse provide one meaningful tightening, yet this turn arrives via external coincidence rather than protagonist agency. The protagonist's CPR and assurance carry visible cost in "trembling hands" and the paramedics' arrival, but the stakes never test a harder trade-off—curiosity leads seamlessly to heroism without friction. The final image restarts the cycle without foreclosing a path or deepening the original question.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme (the boundary between living and dead, listening as care) emerges through image and action, but the final paragraph's meta-commentary ("this is my purpose: to listen, to protect, to assure") states the thesis rather than letting it resonate. The photograph's return in the ending ("the child's smile seems to widen, as if she knows") gestures toward thematic depth but lacks the specificity to reweight prior material. The piece flirts with a richer question—whether the protagonist's curiosity serves the vulnerable or merely satisfies their own need—but never dramatizes that tension in a concrete choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Voice is lyric and consistent, with a distinct perceptual signature ("contact tracer for hearts," "reeling hush") and purposeful compression that suits the liminal atmosphere. Psychic distance remains stable, and the hearing aid's mediation of perception is voice-motivated. However, the prose occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("looming like ghostly sentinels," "fragile thread in the reeling hush") that feels more authorial than character-particular under stress. Dialogue is minimal but functional; the protagonist's spoken lines ("Lila, I am here," "Help is coming") advance goal and subtext without excess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is generally strong, with vivid images ("mist curling like a shroud," "lights painting the fog in brief, bright strokes") that advance atmosphere and action. However, the piece suffers from paraphrase loops and template cadence in the opening third: "The air hung thick with a reeling hush" is immediately echoed by "voices thin as fog," and the repeated construction "I [verb]" appears in consecutive beats without variation. Stock metaphors ("curiosity flares like a struck match," "time slowing to a crawl") dull peak moments. The final third accelerates cleanly, but the density and propulsion are uneven across the arc.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise (using a hearing aid to track ghostly pulses, then discovering it's a living heartbeat) offers a twist on contact-tracing metaphors, but the execution leans on familiar liminal-space tropes without transforming them through specific detail. The "incidental heroism" angle—stumbling into a rescue—feels more like a plot convenience than an earned synthesis of character and world logic. The emotional arc (curiosity to protective action) follows a predictable path, and the final image of cycling back into the search mode does not offer a non-obvious reconfiguration. The story reads competent but derivative, lacking the risk or specificity to stand apart.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "contact tracer for hearts" label is present throughout and frames the protagonist's role, but it functions more as metaphor than causal driver. The character observes and reacts rather than making choices that create key turns—the crash and rescue happen to them. The final decision to continue listening is consistent but does not foreclose a path or alter tactics with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The photograph appears early on the bench, returns in the protagonist's hand mid-story, and is referenced again at the end ("the child's smile seems to widen"). It carries thematic weight (memory outliving its owner, vulnerability) and the image of Lila reappears in the closure paragraph. However, it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic—it remains symbolic rather than causally active. The reprise reweights meaning slightly but lacks the specificity to charge the final image decisively.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Incidental heroism" shapes the story's central turn: the protagonist's ghost-hunting leads accidentally to saving a living man. This concept drives the key beat (the CPR and paramedic arrival) and is present in the ending reflection ("incidental heroism blooms"). It alters the protagonist's understanding of their role, though the cost remains abstract. The concept is more than thematic echo—it generates the plot's pivot—but the protagonist's agency in that pivot is minimal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Persistently curious" is asserted multiple times ("my curiosity flares," "persistently curious," "curiosity had led me to him") but functions as a label rather than a trait that constrains choice with visible cost. The protagonist follows the pulse because curiosity directs them, but no trade-off or friction is dramatized—curiosity aligns seamlessly with the rescue. A higher score would require a moment where curiosity costs something concrete (time, safety, another obligation) on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The action "assure" appears in the protagonist's spoken line ("Lila, I am here"), the narration ("to protect vulnerable voices, I must assure this child"), and again with the dying man ("I assure him, 'Help is coming'"). It drives two distinct beats and frames the protagonist's motivation. The ending restates the purpose ("to listen, to protect, to assure"), tying the action to closure. However, the act of assuring does not itself create a major turn or redefine options—it expresses the protagonist's goal rather than altering the conflict's trajectory.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The hearing aid is introduced early, described as "decades-old" with "circuits humming," and used to track the pulse. Its mechanics matter at the key reveal (it tracked a living heartbeat, not a ghost's), which shapes the story's central turn. However, the device's function is asserted rather than demonstrated through specific properties—how does it "translate grief into sound" or distinguish pulses? It appears in the ending ("the hearing aid picks up a faint new pulse"), contributing to closure, but the method remains abstract. Stronger integration would show the protagonist adjusting, interpreting, or being constrained by the device's limits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The "mist-clad atrium at twilight" is established immediately and sustained throughout. The setting provides the spatial stage (pillars, bench, broken window) and atmospheric pressure (fog, dying light, dew-slick surfaces). The mist "curling like a shroud" and "breathing around us" in the climax heightens tension, and the final image ("mist curling around my shoulders like a guardian's cloak") charges the closure. The atrium does not constrain a tactical choice directly, but it pressures perception and tone across all beats, shaping how the protagonist moves and interprets signals.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"When the dead call" frames the opening and is referenced in the closure ("The dead call, the living answer"), but it functions more as atmospheric premise than a time constraint that tightens decisions. Twilight is mentioned, yet no clock or urgency tied to this hour pressures the protagonist's choices. The timeframe sets mood but does not alter tactics or force trade-offs. A higher score would require the protagonist racing against the hour's end or the voices fading, creating a live ticking element.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to protect vulnerable voices" is stated explicitly ("My motivation surges") and drives the protagonist's actions in two beats: speaking to Lila and rushing to save the man. It frames the ending reflection and coheres with the character's role. However, it is told rather than dramatized through a conflicted choice—no moment shows the protagonist weighing this desire against a competing cost or fear. The motivation aligns with all actions seamlessly, reducing friction and felt complexity.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Reeling hush" is named in the opening line and repeated in key moments ("a fragile thread in the reeling hush"). The tone is sustained through lyric diction, mist imagery, and the quiet-then-urgent modulation from eerie stillness to the crash and medical urgency. The atrium's breathing and the final image of mist as a "guardian's cloak" extend the tone into closure. The tone is coherent and modulates with pressure, though it occasionally leans on stock atmospheric gestures ("dying light," "ghostly sentinels") rather than voice-specific texture.</comment>
