<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The son's interior is painted with "polished calm" labels rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. His motivation to "understand why some paths circle back" reads as philosophical pose rather than urgent stake with cost. Leo appears only to receive symbolic warnings, never applying counter-pressure that would test the son's choices. The final "curtain call" insight feels delivered rather than earned through on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: symbols accumulate, Leo notices, the son steps from shadows, they exchange one conversation, Leo leaves with the bill. No reversal or tightening narrows options—Leo's shift from ambition to acceptance happens off-page between "flickering like a dying spotlight" and his whispered line. The Resonant Reconfiguration relies on Leo's unearned epiphany rather than visible cost or a decision that forecloses a path. Closure form is present but the cost remains asserted, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The circus train supplies vivid recurring images: rusted rails, broken windows, sawdust floor, faded posters, popcorn scent. The foreign bill placed between them functions as micro-setting that charges the final exchange. The train's spatial details (caboose, car, shadows) anchor the conversation clearly. However, the environment does not constrain a choice—Leo could refuse or accept the son's plea anywhere—so Q3 remains mid-band despite strong atmospheric work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—dissuading Leo from restarting the failed venture—is signaled early. But the son never faces a live on-page tightening: he paints symbols off-page, Leo arrives, the son speaks one metaphor, and Leo capitulates without resistance or counter-offer. Coincidence (Leo's dusky visit, his immediate receptiveness) resolves the conflict. No trade-off or visible price shapes the outcome under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme of circular paths and inherited legacy emerges through the train's imagery and the father's heist methods. The foreign bill and territorial markers accrue symbolic weight. Yet the son's final insight—"some circles are meant to be understood, not escaped"—arrives as articulated wisdom rather than a non-literal image that reweights prior material. The ending tells its thematic answer instead of showing it through a charged particular.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-close on the son; no head-hopping. The prose carries a consistent elevated register ("polished calm," "dusky harmony") that matches the reflective stance. Dialogue is sparse: the son's single metaphor and Leo's whispered reply feel purpose-built rather than natural speech. Filter verbs ("believed," "thought," "understood") stack in reflective passages but remain voice-motivated. Perceptual signature is generic—"traced the rust patterns"—without character-specific bias.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "polished calm" appears nine times, often restating the same interior state across adjacent lines. Template cadence runs: "He [verb]" openings and "the son [verb]" stems recur without variation. The middle passage summarizing the startup's rise, market shift, and fall compresses necessary backstory but uses stock startup clichés ("tech empire," "market shifted like a trapeze artist"). Figurative language clusters in non-peak beats without taught pattern. Artifact density in the final third (−1.0 in Q7) disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The core premise—son of a thief uses inherited territorial-marking methods to dissuade a friend from a doomed venture—synthesizes intriguing elements, but the execution leans on familiar startup-failure and legacy-burden templates. The circus train setting and foreign currency offer texture yet remain ornamental; swapping them for another atmospheric ruin would not alter the emotional arc. The son's discovery that "some circles are meant to be understood" resolves into a tidy epiphany without bold risk or non-obvious moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The highway robber's son is present throughout and his choices (painting symbols, stepping from shadows, speaking the metaphor, placing the bill) frame the story. However, these actions do not create reversals—Leo's shift happens off-page—and the son's observation dominates over decisive turns. He enables the ending but does not drive it through contested agency. Present in closure; causal pressure weak. Setup +0.3, one beat +0.4, closure linkage +0.7, swappability −0.5, summary-only for key turn −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The foreign paper money appears in the opening pouch, is handled as the son places a single bill between them, and Leo pockets it at departure. Three touches across beats. The bill functions as a token and territorial marker but does not narrow options—its symbolic charge is told rather than shown to alter Leo's stance. Setup +0.3, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, specificity (foreign script) +0.3, swappability −0.6 (any memento would serve), ornamental description −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"A polished calm" recurs as label throughout but never constrains a choice or shifts tactics under pressure. The son's stillness is described, not tested by an on-page dilemma that would cost him his composure. It shapes the tone and theme but remains inert as a stake-driver. Present in final paragraph; no mid-scene causal work. Setup +0.3, ornamental use −0.8, label-only trait −0.3, swappability −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Perceptively calm" appears twice as a descriptor ("perceptively calm gaze") but does not enable or constrain action. The son's perception traces rust patterns and recognizes Leo's "reckless spark," yet these observations do not force a costly trade-off or alter his approach. The attribute is told, not dramatized with visible consequence. Setup +0.3, one beat +0.4, label-only −0.3, no cost connection −0.5, swappability −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The action "dissuade" is the story's central task. The son paints symbols, speaks a metaphor, and places the bill—all in service of dissuasion. Leo's departure with changed intent shows the action succeeded. However, the means of persuasion (symbols and one line of dialogue) feel under-contested; Leo capitulates without on-page resistance. Major turns trace to dissuasion but the process lacks friction. Setup +0.3, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, causal pressure +0.8, swappability −0.4 (any gentle argument could work), cost legibility weak −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Through territorial markers" is signaled early (the son paints symbols on posters) and the method echoes the father's chalked X's. The mechanics appear: tilted hat, broken trapeze, coin with hole. Leo notices them and they prime his receptiveness. But the markers do not visibly constrain his choice—he responds to the son's spoken metaphor, not the symbols alone. The method matters but is not indispensable. Setup +0.3, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, specificity +0.4, swappability −0.6, ornamental layer −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The abandoned circus train anchors every beat: opening walk on rusted rails, the son's symbol-painting, Leo's dusky visit, the final exchange on the sawdust floor. Setting supplies sensory details (popcorn scent, lion's roar echo, rust patterns) and frames the stakes (resurrection of failed venture). The train's atmosphere charges the ending when the son watches Leo leave. However, the train does not constrain tactics—the conversation could occur elsewhere. Setup +0.3, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.5, micro-setting (foreign bill on floor) +0.3, no tactical constraint −0.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "across a startup's rise and fall" appears in backstory summary (paragraph four) and establishes why the son wants to dissuade Leo. But the main scene is a single dusky evening; the rise-and-fall arc is recounted, not tracked with live pressure. Time does not tighten present decisions. Present in setup; no middle or closure pressure. Setup +0.3, one beat +0.4, summary-only −0.6, no tactical clock −0.8, late middle arrival −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The motivation "to discover why some paths circle back" is stated early ("not to stop Leo out of spite, but to understand") and the ending offers an answer ("some circles are meant to be understood"). The desire frames the son's reflective stance. However, it is not dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost—understanding arrives as insight, not through a choice that sacrifices another goal. Setup +0.3, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, told-only desire −0.8, no friction between wants −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Dusky harmony" appears explicitly three times (opening dusk context, "dusky harmony of the evening," final twilight walk) and the tone—elegiac, meditative, soft-edged—pervades the prose. The mood matches the reflective stakes and modulates slightly when Leo's ambition "flickers" and the son's calm "spreads like twilight." Coherent through turns; charges the final image as the train "exhaled a sigh." Static mood trends mid-low, but purposeful modulation and closure linkage lift it. Setup +0.3, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, modulation +0.5, static baseline −0.6.</comment>
