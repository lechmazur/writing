<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The poet remains purely observational across 32 paragraphs with no meaningful choice under pressure. Interiority consists of abstract epiphanies ("beauty often resides in what is left unfinished") delivered as therapy-speak rather than embodied contradiction. The final "whispered a new verse" is told-only; no on-page action forecloses a path or reveals competing desires with cost. "Warmly attentive" functions as a static label never tested by an opposing impulse.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No closure unit is legible. The poet walks to the lagoon, gathers debris, writes in a notebook, walks away, then sits on dunes—a circular tour without decisive change, renunciation with visible cost, or conceptual repricing that reweights prior material. The kite string snap (paragraph 7) promises a turn but leads only to more meditation. Orientation is present early (cobalt lagoon, shoreline, after rain) so no Orientation Test penalty applies, but causality is absent: because/therefore linkage never tightens options. The piece reads as a 32-paragraph mood essay rather than a story with escalation and closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The cobalt lagoon, wet sand, dunes, and driftwood are consistently anchored and sensory (iridescent feather, damp pages, gulls' cries). However, the environment never constrains a choice or alters tactics—the poet moves freely without spatial friction. The recurring driftwood shrine (paragraph 13) and the feather placed inside the notebook (paragraph 26) are symbolic gestures, not pressure points. Micro-setting potential exists but remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The stated stake—"to discover beauty in the incomplete"—never faces on-page opposition or cost. No reversal, tightening, or deepening narrows options; the poet's reflections accumulate but do not escalate. The kite string snap could serve as a complication but instead becomes another contemplative prompt. Agency is absent: the poet observes, imagines, realizes, but never chooses under competing pressures. Resolution is delivered by assertion ("he walked on... always seeking beauty") rather than earned through a decision that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme of incompleteness and beauty-in-brokenness is stated explicitly and repeatedly ("beauty often resides in what is left unfinished," "each broken thing he encountered was a verse waiting to be written") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The drake's feather and kite are symbol tokens that announce their meaning instead of earning resonance through action. Paragraph 20's meta-commentary ("he realized that his role was not to finish the poem") is thematic echo rather than dramatized insight. The final whisper (paragraph 32) restates rather than reweights.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds without head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("harmonizing discord," "burnished hush," "woven dawns") that clashes with embodied perception. Psychic distance remains static—no modulation under pressure. Repetitive sentence stems plague the text: "He [verb]" opens 18 paragraphs, and "The [noun]" opens seven more, creating template cadence across the entire piece. Perceptual signature is generic poetic rather than character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and synonym churn: paragraphs 2/17 restate "beauty in the incomplete"; paragraphs 6/20 repeat "harmonizing discord into burnished hush"; paragraphs 10/31 recycle "fragments/broken things as poetry." Template cadence ("He [verb]" x18) creates drumbeat monotony. Stock metaphors ("tapestry of light and shadow," "threads," "stitching") accumulate without fresh vehicle. "Burnished hush" appears six times as a phrase-object rather than an earned image. Artifacts touch closure (final paragraph repeats "burnished hush" and "woven dawns"), triggering −1.7 baseline plus pattern spread.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The solitary artist contemplating fragments premise is familiar; transformation through specific lived detail is absent—this could be any shoreline, any poet. The kite as freedom metaphor and feather-as-quill are stock symbols. No bold structural risk or non-obvious synthesis; the piece layers safe poetic images without tension or surprise. Emotional specificity is replaced by abstraction ("burnished hush," "woven dawns") that could apply to any reflective mood piece.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Character present throughout but makes no key turn. Observation and meditation dominate; the only quasi-decisions (placing the feather on driftwood, tucking it in notebook) lack competing pressures or visible cost. Setup present, no development choice, ornamental closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Feather found (paragraph 4), imagined as thread (paragraph 5), mentioned in poem (paragraph 10), left on shrine (paragraph 13), placed in notebook (paragraph 26), held in hand (paragraph 32). Six touches across beats, but all are symbolic gestures—the feather never constrains a choice or enables a tactic under pressure. Setup, weak development, decorative closure presence earn mid-band, but swappability (any natural object could serve) and lack of causal cost cap at 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Woven dawns" appears as metaphor (paragraphs 5, 10, 18, 31) but never shapes stakes or tactics on the page. It remains a poetic phrase describing the poet's aesthetic rather than a concept that alters options or creates friction. Ornamental throughout.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Warmly attentive" appears once in paragraph 1 and is never tested, constrained, or traded off. No visible cost tied to this trait. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Tend" appears in paragraphs 3 (tending shoreline as wound), 20 (role to tend words as they rise), 31 (continue to tend the shoreline). Present across beats but as metaphor, not action that drives turns. The poet gathers debris (paragraph 3) but this does not create pressure or redefine options. Swappable with "observe" or "honor" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Harmonizing discord" stated in paragraphs 6, 11, 20, 31 as the poet's method, but mechanics never matter on the page—no demonstration of how discord is harmonized or what cost that incurs. Summary-only, no causal participation in choices.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Cobalt lagoon anchored early and recurs across paragraphs (1, 12, 18, 28, 31). Consistent sensory detail (still water, wet sand, shoreline debris). However, the setting never pressures a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome—postcard backdrop rather than active constraint. Setup strong, no development pressure, decorative closure reprise.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Kite string snap occurs in paragraph 7, is reflected upon in paragraphs 8, 10, 22–23, and mentioned in paragraph 27. Present across beats as metaphor but does not function as a time constraint or deadline that tightens decisions. No live clock; the "as" framing is atmospheric rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"To discover beauty in the incomplete" stated in paragraph 2 and echoed throughout (paragraphs 8, 16, 23, 28, 31). Present as thesis but never dramatized through conflicting choices—the poet's desire faces no friction, cost, or opposing pull. Told motivation without on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Burnished hush" appears six times (paragraphs 6, 12, 20, 25, 31, 32). Tone is static—quiet, meditative, elegiac throughout with no modulation under pressure. Coherent but one-note; does not shift with escalation (there is none) or charge the final image with new meaning. Setup present, no development tension, repetitive closure use trends mid-low.</comment>
