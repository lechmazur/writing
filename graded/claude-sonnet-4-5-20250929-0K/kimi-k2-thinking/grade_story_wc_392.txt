<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's investigator role is clear and her choice to defy Voss by uploading evidence shows agency under pressure. However, the internal conflict feels programmatic rather than embodied—her "watchfully calm demeanor never wavered" tells us stability rather than showing contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The grandmother's Underground Railroad connection and the present-day worker death feel thematically parallel but emotionally flattened; Mara's stakes remain abstract (break free from control) without visceral personal cost that would elevate the renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The piece establishes a causal chain: worker reports loose bolts → ignored → death → Mara finds sabotage evidence → uploads to oversight. The closure is Earned Stasis with visible cost (defying Voss, turning off phone, accepting future battle), and the drought-ending/silence-breaking frame provides conceptual repricing. Orientation anchors who/where/when early. The lens reads Causal with thematic accumulation; the final image reweights prior material. Cost is present but muted—Mara's decision feels inevitable rather than wrenching, dampening the closure's felt weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The subway tunnel is vividly rendered with rust patterns, dripping water, scuff marks, and loose bolts that directly enable Mara's discovery. The lantern's chipped glass and the Underground Railroad etching ground the space in historical specificity. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The environment constrains choice (evidence is physical, located) and the final image of water rising charges the political metaphor, meeting the 9+ gate test for this category.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—expose the preventable death and break Voss's control—is signaled early and tightens when Mara finds sabotage evidence and must choose whether to sign or upload. One meaningful pressure point (Voss's call while she examines bolts) narrows her options with visible cost (career risk, turning off phone). The worker's ignored report adds moral weight. However, the escalation feels procedural rather than agonizing; Mara's resolve never wavers on the page, so the tightening lacks the felt trade-off that would push this into high-8 territory.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the lantern-as-legacy motif and the drought/silence frame without overt statement. The final image—"the truth would rise like water"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer linking past (Underground Railroad escape) and present (worker safety) through the lantern's continuity. "Some sacrifices must never be forgotten" skirts moralizing but stays grounded in Mara's tactile clutch of the iron frame. The concept of entangled memories is asserted more than it shapes live choice, and the parallel between historical and contemporary oppression feels thematically neat rather than complexly interrogated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV third-limited with stable distance and a noir-investigator register ("watchfully calm gaze," "fortified vulnerability"). Perceptual signature is consistent but leans on stock phrases: "entangled memories," "tight leash," "reverberate." Voss appears only via phone, so dialogue is minimal and functional. The prose modulates with pressure (short beats when Mara uploads evidence) but falls into templated cadence in reflective passages ("She felt…," "She knew…"). Free indirect style is clean, though the lexicon occasionally drifts into essay register ("controlling influence," "complicity") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Clarity is high and spatial choreography tracks cleanly. However, the prose suffers from paraphrase loops ("break the controlling influence" / "sever the leash" / "pull her back under his control") and templated sentence openings ("She carried," "She recorded," "She uploaded," "She left," "She clutched"). Figurative language clusters without pattern-teaching: "slow breath," "chains," "tight leash," "beacon," "tide of complicity." The mixed metaphor of truth rising "like water" after ending a drought contradicts the premise (water already returned). These artifacts dull the closure image and trigger the patterned-artifact penalty pack, preventing 9+ eligibility globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The investigator-defying-commissioner premise is familiar, and the Underground Railroad lantern offers a fresh historical anchor. Mara's empirical method (measuring rust, photographing bolts) grounds the procedural beats in specific action. However, the emotional arc and moral calculus remain on-rails: Mara never doubts, Voss is purely obstructive, and the sabotage discovery slots neatly into the thematic frame. The piece commits to its noir-resistance stance but does not transform the template through unpredictable character choice or a non-obvious turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Present from the opening and drives two key beats: examining the tunnel with empirical tools and choosing to upload evidence. The decision to defy Voss narrows options (career cost) and the investigator role enables her method. Early signal, causal pressure, and closure linkage are strong. However, the choice feels procedurally inevitable rather than agonizing, and the specificity of "preventable death investigator" (an unusual job title) is asserted more than it shapes distinct tactics or worldview.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The lantern appears in five beats: carried into the tunnel, flickering on the etching, acknowledging her decision, guiding her out, and clutched as a "tangible link" in the penultimate line. It bridges past (Underground Railroad) and present (Mara's resistance) thematically and its "chipped glass but steady flame" recurs with reweighted meaning. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. However, its function is largely symbolic; Mara never uses it tactically (e.g., light fails at a crucial moment), and the final clutch is more descriptive than causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The phrase "entangled memories" appears twice, framing grandmother's tales merging with the present case. It functions as theme claim rather than on-page constraint—Mara's memory of the Underground Railroad etching informs her resolve but does not alter her investigative method or create a tactical fork. The concept is told ("entangled memories surged") rather than dramatized through a choice where past and present knowingly collide with cost. Lyric reprise is present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Watchfully calm" is named three times but never tested under pressure—Mara's demeanor "never wavered" even when defying Voss. The trait enables her methodical evidence-gathering but does not constrain a choice or impose visible cost (e.g., calm prevents her from confronting Voss face-to-face, foreclosing a path). It functions as label rather than embodied tradeoff. Present across beats but static, landing it in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Reverberate" appears four times: water drips echo a heartbeat, the phone's ring reverberates unanswered, a drop reminds that "even the smallest truth echoes," and implicit in the sound-layered tunnel atmosphere. It shapes mood and the theme of accumulated pressure but does not drive a major turn—Mara's choice to ignore Voss's call is motivated by the sabotage evidence, not by the reverberating sound itself. The action is more metaphorical accent than causal lever, placing it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Empirical observation is signaled early (measuring rust depth with a gauge, photographing fracture lines and scuff marks, cross-referencing the maintenance log) and these concrete methods generate the sabotage discovery that drives the climax. The method matters mechanically and distinguishes Mara's approach. However, it appears primarily in the tunnel-investigation beat and does not recur at closure—the final image is thematic (lantern, water, legacy) rather than procedural. Two beats, causal pressure, but no closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The subway maintenance tunnel is established immediately and supplies the physical evidence (rust, loose bolts, etching, scuff marks) that enables Mara's discovery. Spatial details constrain her movement (narrow passage, cracked pipe, rusted rails) and the tunnel's Underground Railroad history charges the final political metaphor. Present in setup, middle investigation, and thematic closure. The setting is indispensable to plot logic and stakes, meeting all three gates with strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"After the drought ends" frames the opening line and closing metaphor ("the truth would rise like water"), providing thematic bookends. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—Mara's three-day investigation window is mentioned once but never pressures her pace, and Voss's "sign before the weekend" deadline is noted without on-page urgency. The drought's end is conceptual setup rather than a live clock altering tactics. Lyric reprise without middle development, capped by missing escalation role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Breaking free from Voss's control is the dominant stake, signaled early ("tighten the chains") and tested when Mara chooses to upload evidence and turn off her phone. The motivation drives two key beats and shapes the closure (leaving the tunnel as a "beacon for those who would follow"). Visible cost is present (career risk, future battle acknowledged). However, the internal conflict is shallow—Mara never doubts or weighs competing goods—so the friction between want and cost remains abstract. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage keep this in mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Fortified vulnerability" is named once and the tone attempts to balance resolve (methodical investigation, defiant upload) with exposure (weight of history, threat of retribution). The lantern's "steady flame" and Mara's unshaken demeanor embody fortification; her acknowledgment of "the real battle" gestures toward vulnerability. However, the tone remains uniform—Mara never cracks or reveals raw doubt—so the vulnerability half feels asserted rather than embodied under pressure. Setup and thematic closure presence, but static modulation keeps it mid-band.</comment>
