<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael's interiority is presented through poetic abstraction rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The crisis-actor backstory is told, not embodied in micro-choices under present pressure. The prisoner emerges as a plot function without genuine friction; handing over carved pawns feels symbolic rather than a costly renunciation that forecloses a path. Emotional states are labeled through metaphor ("luminous absence," "benevolently ruthless") instead of embodied perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the story builds through layered images and walking pattern rather than causal linkage. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Kael commits to remain as historian, turning the gallery into a sanctuary. Cost is conceptual—he stays while the penumbra moves on—but the final paragraphs dilute this with repetitive thematic assertions ("quiet testament," "small gestures") that feel scaffolded rather than crystallized in a single charged image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The whispering gallery is vividly named and its acoustic properties ("echoes of a thousand voices") are invoked repeatedly, but spatial choreography remains vague—arches and alcoves are mentioned without clear layout. The chessboard on its plinth is a static motif; it does not constrain Kael's walking pattern or alter his tactics. The interregnum setting ("pale, expectant light") provides atmospheric color but does not pressure his choices on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: unbind the prisoner by walking a pattern. The task is presented early, executed without complication, and succeeds immediately when the panel opens. No reversal, tightening, or deepening occurs; Kael faces no friction or cost during the walk itself. The conceptual cost—staying behind—arrives only in summary after the mission succeeds, and the prisoner's emergence adds no new pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Theme of memory and "small gestures" is stated repeatedly in near-identical phrasing ("historian of small gestures," "quiet vow to never forget," "spelled hope in his wake") rather than emerging from concrete particulars. The final paragraphs function as thematic summary, delivering multiple declarations instead of one resonant image. The chessboard motif recurs but does not shift meaning—it remains a static symbol throughout.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and elevated, with purpose-driven figurative language ("ghost who had learned to cast a shadow"). POV distance is stable and Kael's perceptual signature (poetic, memorial) is maintained. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract register ("benevolently ruthless," "luminous absence") that feels concept-driven rather than character-specific. The prisoner has no distinct voice or interior access, which is acceptable for single-POV, but his few quoted words carry no subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade the final third: "small gestures" appears in five paragraphs, "luminous absence" in four, and synonym churn cycles through "quiet," "whispered," "soft percussion." Template cadence appears in the closing beats ("For the sake of," "Thus the story ends," "And somewhere in"). Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching payoff—metaphors accumulate ("nomadic penumbra," "chessboard of power," "archive of memory") but do not constrain action. Applying patterned-artifact penalty: baseline −1.0 for loops and template stems that dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise synthesizes familiar elements (memory keeper, ritual walking, symbolic chessboard) without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious calculus. The interregnum and gallery setting provide atmospheric novelty, but Kael's mission and the penumbra's philosophy are presented as abstractions. The walking-pattern mechanic is introduced and executed without friction or surprise. Risk is minimal; the story hedges toward lyric safety rather than dramatizing a charged choice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kael's identity as crisis actor and survivor is told in the opening but does not create key turns. His choice to stay at the end is summary rather than a dramatized decision that alters tactics. The trait is present and coherent but does not drive beat-level pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The chessboard appears in three beats: opening description, handed pawns to prisoner, closing image. It is handled on the page (carved pawns) and returns at closure, but its meaning does not shift—it remains a static symbol of loss. The object does not constrain or enable Kael's walking pattern or alter his tactics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The nomadic penumbra sent Kael and will move on, shaping the mission premise. However, it does not constrain choices on the page or alter tactics during the gallery sequence. Its philosophy ("benevolently ruthless") is told rather than dramatized in action with cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Benevolently ruthless" is quoted as the penumbra's creed and echoed in Kael's final role, but no on-page action demonstrates the tension between kindness and ruthlessness with visible tradeoff. The attribute is label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Unbind" is the mission verb, signaled early and executed as the central action. The panel opens when the pattern completes, a causal turn. The prisoner's release drives the closure—Kael stays to guard memory. The action is essential but proceeds without complication, limiting its pressure across beats.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The walking pattern is introduced, described step-by-step (r, e, m, b), and completes the unbinding. Its mechanics matter—each letter is a deliberate stride. However, the method faces no friction; Kael executes it without error or cost during the walk itself. Early signal, middle use, closure linkage present; causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The whispering gallery is named and used throughout, with its acoustic echoes invoked. The walking pattern occurs within it, and it becomes Kael's "sanctuary of memory" at closure. However, the gallery does not constrain or complicate his movement; its architecture is vague, and it supplies atmosphere more than tactical friction.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The interregnum frames the premise ("throne vacant," "silence between rulers") and closes the story ("the next era"). It provides political context but does not tighten decisions or impose a ticking clock. Time pressure is absent on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Kael's desire "to become the historian of small gestures" is stated and enacted when he stays to document. The motivation shapes his final choice but is not conflicted or tested—he simply accepts the role. Friction between wants and costs is minimal; the decision is frictionless summary.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Luminous absence" appears in four passages, charging description of the gallery and the interregnum's mood. Tone is consistent and poetic, modulating slightly from movement to closure. However, the phrase is repeated without evolving meaning, and the final paragraphs layer thematic declarations that flatten rather than intensify the tone.</comment>
