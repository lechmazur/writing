<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The inspector's interiority remains thin throughout—her "purposefully curious" stance is labeled rather than embodied in contradictory impulses. The piece tells us she carries "dawnlit melancholy" but never dramatizes competing desires or a hierarchy of values under pressure. Her decision to trigger the flare feels predetermined rather than earned by on-page struggle, and the final turn (standing, storing the image, turning away) lacks visible cost or a choice that forecloses a live alternative.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers moonlit imagery and chemical preparation toward a flare-bloom moment. Orientation anchors (crater inspector, lunar summit, nightwatch) arrive early. The hourglass grain falling triggers the flare, which illuminates the bloom—this is a tightening, but the cost remains abstract ("a moment that would never come again") rather than a forfeited path or altered option. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the bloom captured, then wilted), yet the felt price is more asserted than dramatized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The moonlit summit, regolith crunch, and crystalline bloom are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (violet petals refracting light, the faint tremor underfoot). The camera tripod and hourglass function as micro-setting that enables the flare action, and the bloom's placement "in the shadow of eternal night" constrains the inspector's window. Spatial choreography is clear, and the setting participates in the closure image (sunlight erasing the bloom).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—photograph the bloom before sunrise—is signaled early and maintained throughout. Pressure accumulates as the hourglass grain trembles, then falls, triggering the chemical flare; this is one meaningful tightening. However, the inspector's agency is passive observation rather than a choice with trade-offs. No live option is foreclosed, no competing good or unavoidable harm sharpens the peak moment, and the cost (the bloom wilts) is inevitable rather than a consequence of her decision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the premise: impermanence, the space age's tools versus nature's fragility, the futility of preservation. The final image (bloom fading, inspector turning away) reweights prior material without overt moralizing. Yet the thematic resonance leans on stock meditation ("what the universe could not preserve," "a moment that would never come again") rather than earned contradiction or a non-obvious synthesis. The bloom functions as a clear but conventional symbol.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, with consistent psychic distance and no head-hopping. Diction remains lunar-pastoral throughout ("regolith," "stardust," "dawning hush"), though register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("the weight of the space age in the stillness"). Perceptual signature is present but not character-particular; the inspector notices the bloom, hourglass, and horizon, yet her way of seeing does not reveal idiosyncratic bias or hierarchy of values under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies, and clarity is generally maintained, but template cadence appears in repeated "She [verb]" stems across the middle third (five consecutive paragraphs open with "She [action]"), creating a mechanical march. Several paraphrase loops dull momentum: "The hourglass grain hung, suspended" followed by "with a silent slide, it fell" restates waiting-then-falling without added pressure. Stock lunar imagery ("blue-white gem suspended in the void," "speck of stardust") and elevated diction ("dawnlit melancholy," "the dawning hush finally broke") reduce specificity at peak beats. Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty (chemical setup, bloom description), but scaffold phrases ("She felt the weight," "She knew") pad interiority.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The premise—timed chemical flare to photograph a light-sensitive lunar bloom—offers a fresh synthesis of hard-SF procedure and lyric ephemerality. However, the emotional arc (solitary witness to fleeting beauty, melancholy acceptance) is familiar, and the story does not transform it through unexpected moral calculus or a non-obvious cost. The bloom's wilt is pre-scripted by nature rather than a consequence of the inspector's choice, reducing ingenuity at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Crater inspector is present throughout and performs all on-page actions (ascends, anchors camera, checks vial, adjusts exposure, turns away). Yet her choices are procedural rather than decision-driven; no key turn requires her to weigh competing goods or forgo a live alternative. Setup, development (multiple beats), and closure participation are all met, but causal pressure is low—she executes a pre-planned sequence without cost-laden adaptation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The hourglass grain is seeded early ("last grain of sand poised to fall"), handled in two distinct beats (trembling on the brink, then falling to trigger the catalyst), and its fall drives the chemical flare that illuminates the bloom. Setup, development, and closure linkage are all present. The grain is specific and irreplaceable (its fall is the timer), but its mechanical function is more tool than charged symbolic reprise—it enables rather than reweights.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Dawning hush" appears as a repeated label ("the dawning hush settled deeper," "the dawning hush finally broke") but does not shape options or tactics on the page. It functions as atmospheric description rather than a constraint that narrows the inspector's window or forces adaptation. Setup and closure participation are met (the hush "breaks" at sunrise), but middle development is absent—the concept is echoed thematically without altering choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Purposefully curious" is mentioned twice as a descriptor ("Her purposefully curious gaze traced the rim," "purposefully curious, and knelt") but never constrains or enables a concrete action with visible cost. The trait is label-only; no on-page beat demonstrates curiosity driving a choice or foreclosing an alternative. Setup is met, but development and closure participation are absent.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Outlast" is signaled early ("whispered a quiet promise to outlast the night") and the inspector does remain on the summit until sunrise, capturing the bloom before it wilts. The action is thematic backbone, but no major turn traces distinctly to it—removing "outlast" and substituting "witness" or "document" would leave the plot unchanged. Setup, development (she endures the night), and closure (she succeeds) are met, but swappability is high and causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The chemical-timed-flare method is signaled early ("mixed the compounds in a small vial," "the grain… would trigger the chemical reaction"), dramatized at the climax (grain falls, catalyst meets reagent, blue glow blossoms), and its mechanics matter—the flare's precise interval and brightness are essential to capturing the bloom's true color. Setup, development (she checks the vial, confirms dormancy), and closure (flare illuminates, shutter clicks) are all met. The method is specific and shapes the peak beat, though it arrives as planned rather than through adaptive struggle.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The moonlit summit provides the spatial frame and the crater's "shadow of eternal night" is where the bloom grows, constraining the inspector's target location. The summit's exposure to sunrise creates the time pressure (first rays will wilt the bloom). Setup, development (she kneels at the crater rim), and closure (sunlight crests the summit, bloom wilts) are met. The setting enables and times the action, though it does not force tactical adaptation beyond the initial approach.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Space age" is mentioned twice as thematic color ("The space age had brought her here," "the weight of the space age") but does not tighten decisions or shape tactics. The timeframe is ornamental—replacing it with "the exploration era" or "the lunar colony age" would not alter the story's logic. No live clock tied to "space age" narrows the inspector's window; sunrise is the operative timer, not the era.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The desire to photograph the bloom's "last fleeting beauty before the sun erased it forever" is established early, drives the chemical-flare preparation, and governs the inspector's actions across all beats. At closure, the shutter clicks and the bloom is "safely stored in the camera's memory," fulfilling the motivation. Friction between want and cost is present but muted—she succeeds without forfeiting a live alternative. Setup, development (adjusting exposure, shielding eyes), and closure are all met, and the motivation is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Dawnlit melancholy" is named at the end ("her purposefully curious heart now filled with a dawnlit melancholy") but the tone throughout is more solemnly lyric than melancholic—wonder and procedural focus dominate until the final paragraph. The tone does not modulate with pressure or deepen through turns; it arrives as a summary label rather than an accumulated emotional charge. Setup is weak, development is absent, and closure participation is told rather than embodied.</comment>
