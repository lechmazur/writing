<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sam's interior life is specific and embodied—the "honest child of a con artist" tension drives contradictory impulses that crystallize in the final transaction with the director. The micro-choice to offer the ink pot rather than expose the con demonstrates earned character shift rooted in the prep-room discoveries. Minor slip: the father remains largely offstage, reducing relationship pressure that could have sharpened Sam's final stance. Emotional progression from rigid honesty to "ethical algebra" reads credible, though the phrase "ethical algebra" flirts with diagnostic abstraction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Sam's transaction with the director represents a Decisive Change—accepting complicity in exchange for survival paperwork—with visible cost (seven more lies calculated on-page). Drive lens is Causal with situational elements; the ink pot discovery narrows options and the final exchange reweights Sam's moral framework. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the first three paragraphs. One meaningful tightening occurs when Sam finds the ledger instead of letterhead, forcing tactical improvisation that pays off in the director negotiation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The prep room functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: the embalming machine's wheeze marks time, the steel counter stages the ink pot discovery, and the chemical atmosphere charges the final metaphor. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"chemical persistence of memory" ties environment to theme. The funeral home's dual function (death commerce and refugee smuggling) creates spatial pressure that makes Sam's choice legible. Minor gap: the director's office geography is sketched quickly without the tactile specificity of the prep room.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (asylum for the father) is signaled early and tightens when Sam discovers the ledger reveals a $47,000 price rather than free letterhead. The breach action and ink pot discovery narrow options with causal pressure, forcing Sam to negotiate from a discovered secret rather than simple theft. The final transaction forecloses innocence with visible cost: "seven more lies" calculated on-page. Agency is decision under situational constraint; the director's recognition of Sam as "an equal" registers the power shift and closes the deal with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme (fairness as negotiation with fate, honesty as luxury) emerges from the prep room discoveries and final transaction without thesis statements. The embalming fluid metaphor—"liquefies rigid thinking"—does thematic work but borders on over-articulation; the final line "counted the notes like currency" lands more cleanly. The ink pot's shift from artifact to bargaining chip charges the closure image. Minor weakness: "mathematics of equivalency" and "ethical algebra" repeat the concept in slightly different wrappers, risking redundancy rather than deepening.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with tight focalization through Sam's perceptual signature: "breach of pure geometry," "deathly vitality," "chemical persistence of memory" establish a voice balancing adolescent precision with metaphorical reach. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Sam's "My family too" and the director's response carry subtext and shift power. Minor register wobble: "ethical algebra" and "ratio that kept a soul intact" feel slightly elevated for a fourteen-year-old's real-time thought, though the voice-motivated intellectualism mostly coheres. Psychic distance remains controlled throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Prose demonstrates strong rhythm control and concrete imagery in peak beats: "breach of pure geometry," "cracks now maps of necessary fractures." Two paraphrase loops weaken mid-section: the "liquefies rigid thinking" concept appears three times with minor variation (embalming fluid metaphor, Sam's own rigidity dissolving, tissue compliance), and "deathly vitality" recurs without reweighting. Template cadence in the 2:47 AM heist paragraph: "Sam moved...finding...traced...understood" stacks actions without varied syntax. Information density is high overall, but the thematic repetitions cost momentum. No line-level opacity mars closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The funeral home as refugee smuggling conduit offers a fresh synthesis, and Sam's discovery that the con artist father is actually a documented survivor transforms the opening frame with earned irony. The ink pot containing documents rather than ink is a purposeful twist rooted in prior particulars. Risk: the closing calculation ("seven more lies") crystallizes consequence. Moderate weakness: the coming-of-age-through-moral-compromise arc is a familiar template, and while the funeral home setting and asylum stakes add specificity, the emotional trajectory follows well-worn YA moral-awakening patterns without fully transcending them.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sam (con artist's honest child) drives every key turn: the decision to case the joint, the improvisation after finding the ledger instead of letterhead, and the final offer of the ink pot to the director. The character's contradiction between honesty and survival necessity generates the central pressure and the ending transaction. Present from line two, shapes at least three distinct beats, and the final choice (complicity over exposure) would collapse without this exact character premise.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The vintage ink pot appears in at least four beats: initial description on the steel counter, Sam's instinctive pocket-theft, the discovery of documents inside, and the final offering to the director. Its evolution from misplaced artifact to container of father's hidden history to bargaining chip charges the closure negotiation. The director's claim "it's been in the family for years" and Sam's echo "My family too" make the transaction legible only through this object. Strong integration with slight cap: introduced at ~15% rather than opening paragraph.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Political asylum is the driving stake from paragraph three and shapes every tactic: the need for a judge's letterhead, the discovery of the refugee ledger pricing safety at $47,000, and the final negotiation for "paperwork ready Tuesday." The father's fabricated proof and Sam's closing understanding that "asylum was purchasing the right to exist" tie concept to theme. Present across all three structural sections (setup, discovery, closure) with moderate causal force. Could score higher with more direct pressure on Sam's choices in the breach sequence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Liquefies rigid thinking" is developed through the embalming fluid metaphor and Sam's own transformation from moral rigidity to "ethical algebra." It constrains the ending choice: Sam's acceptance of complicity flows from dissolved certainty. However, the mechanism is largely metaphorical rather than a visible trait with on-page tradeoffs. The phrase recurs three times with minor variation, establishing thematic presence but not forcing a specific tactical choice distinct from general character arc. Functional but somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The breach occurs at the structural midpoint and generates the key discovery: no letterhead, only the ledger that reprices the stakes at $47,000 and reveals the funeral home's smuggling operation. This action enables Sam's improvisation (offering the ink pot's secret rather than stolen goods) and sets up the final negotiation. Signaled early via the casing mission and "three-minute window at 2:47 AM." The breach itself is compressed but its consequences—ledger discovery and tactical pivot—shape closure. Strong integration with room for deeper tactical specificity during the act itself.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Waiting actively" is named in paragraph four and demonstrated through Sam's prep work: mapping the director's rounds, measuring the three-minute window, "fingers flexing, breathing measured." It reappears at closure: "life was an active waiting." The method shapes the heist beat structurally but does not constrain a specific choice or create visible friction. The phrase functions more as thematic label than mechanical tactic—Sam's improvisation after finding the ledger operates via quick thinking rather than patient observation. Present in setup and ending; middle development is thematic rather than operational.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The funeral home prep room is present from the opening line and supplies three key resources: the embalming machine's wheeze as time marker, the steel counter staging the ink pot, and the chemical atmosphere that charges the metaphor and final image. The setting's dual function (death work and refugee passage) makes Sam's moral compromise spatially coherent. The director's office appears briefly for the ledger discovery. Strong integration: setting constrains the breach window, provides the central object, and its "deathly vitality" charges closure. Minor gap: spatial choreography during the breach could be more precise.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Mathematics of a fair trade" is named in paragraph five as Sam's consuming question and drives the thematic inquiry throughout. It motivates the casing mission, shapes Sam's reaction to the ledger ($47,000 = three cons = survival), and crystallizes in the closing calculation of "seven more lies." The motivation creates intellectual pressure and thematic coherence. Weakness: the desire is more philosophical lens than embodied want tested by friction—Sam does not face a moment where fairness and survival directly compete in a forced either/or choice. Present across all beats but operates at one remove from visceral stakes.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Deathly vitality" is established in the opening line via the embalming machine and recurs as metaphor and atmosphere: the funeral home as "cathedral where death became commerce and commerce became survival," the fluid that "liquefies rigid tissue," and the closing organ dirge. Tone remains consistent—morbid yet transactional—and modulates appropriately under pressure. The phrase itself is named twice, bordering on over-articulation. Strong coherence with minor repetition debt; the tone charges the final image of Sam counting organ notes "like currency," but the explicit label in paragraph 24 ("deathly vitality had taught them") edges toward thematic summary.</comment>
