<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Miren's interiority is concrete and embodied through tactile/sensory method rather than labels. Her blindness drives both capability (water-feature navigation) and constraint (reliance on vibration/temperature), and the repair decision is earned by prior demonstration. Minor slip: Kael's presence feels more observational than crucible; his single question lands late without earlier friction to charge it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal with accumulative textural support: the navigation crystal fracture → patch → test → delivery sequence coheres cleanly, and closure lands with the drone restored and Miren teaching Kael via demonstrative action. The *Prospect*'s departure functions as external clock tightening the repair window. Cost is understated but legible: the all-night labor under deadline pressure and the transfer of the repaired tool into uncertain expedition hands. Orientation is swift (repair shop, Miren blind, depot setting by line 2).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The water features—mercury basin, glass sphere, prism, flowing test chamber—constrain and enable Miren's diagnostic method throughout, shaping the repair sequence and the teaching moment at closure. The mist-coated depot supplies atmospheric pressure and the *Prospect*'s horn marks time. Micro-setting (the workbench array) functions as tactical ground. Spatial choreography is coherent across all moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: repair the drone's navigation before dawn deadline. One meaningful tightening: the *Prospect*'s three blasts convert abstract urgency into embodied countdown. The patch decision and test-chamber validation show agency under pressure. Cost is visible (night labor, precision demand) but remains procedural; no live risk of failure dramatized on the page beyond the ticking clock.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—navigation through brokenness, listening to what distorts light/sound—emerges from particulars (Miren's method, the fractured crystal, Kael's question) without thesis statement. The final glass-of-water demonstration reweights "seeing" as interpretation and offers a resonant teaching image. Slight weakness: "listening to what was broken until it told me which way was true" edges toward overt articulation where pure image would suffice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Miren; perceptual signature (vibration, temperature, refracted light patterns) is distinct and sustained under pressure. Dialogue is sparse and functional; Kael's lines pursue understanding, Miren's carry magnetic authority without exposition. Diction remains controlled—no register drift. Very minor: "magnetic calm that drew projects toward her like filings to a magnet" stacks vehicle and tenor redundantly in one beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; information density is high across the repair sequence. Minor loop: "feedback loop" (line 12) and "feedback into direction" (line 7) echo without added meaning. Slight overwriting in the opening paragraph: "tools hanging from ceiling hooks in a symphony of metal she knew by weight alone" stacks metaphor where concrete detail would propel faster. No clarity failures; propulsion is steady through closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The blind artisan navigating via light refraction offers a specific, non-obvious synthesis that avoids both inspiration-porn and pure competence showcase. The water-feature diagnostic method and the prism teaching moment feel earned by world logic. Risk: the piece commits fully to sensory inversion without hedging. Slight familiarity: the wise-craftsperson-teaching-apprentice frame is well-worn, though the particulars (mercury, spectrum analysis, navigation crystal) freshen it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Miren (heartfelt artisan) drives all key beats: diagnosis via water/light, patch decision, test activation, teaching Kael. Her choices shape the repair arc and closure. Present from line 1; her method and ethos charge the final image.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The hummingbird drone is handled across setup (arrival, shattered wing), middle (diagnosis of navigation crystal fracture, platinum patch), and closure (test-chamber flight, cartographer handoff, wings catching dawn light). Its restored grace is the story's physical proof of Miren's skill and the teaching anchor. Indispensable to plot and final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The repair shop frames all action: tools, workbench, test chamber, water features supply the means and setting for diagnosis and teaching. It shapes stakes (deadline, client arrival) and tactics (solder, micro-crystals, light examination). Present throughout and causally essential.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Oversees while blind" is not merely label: Miren's blindness drives her diagnostic method (vibration, temperature, light refraction through water rather than direct sight) and creates the teaching paradox at closure. It constrains and enables across all beats, including the final demonstration where her "blind eyes reflecting nothing yet seeing everything" charges the thematic resolution.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Patch" appears as the platinum patch decision (beat 11), the soldering/micro-crystal work (beat 12), and implicitly in Kael's question ("How did you know where to patch it?"). It is the central action that resolves the navigation fracture. Causally essential but slightly replaceable with "repair" or "seal" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Examining light refraction through water features is signaled early (mercury basin, line 5; glass sphere, line 8) and executed in the diagnosis beat (spectral lines reveal the hairline fracture). It recurs in the test chamber (water carving holographic pathways) and the final teaching image (prism, glass of water with bubble). The method is irreplaceable: removing it collapses Miren's technique and the story's central conceit.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The mist-coated rail depot supplies atmosphere and the *Prospect*'s anchor/horn as external clock. The depot's "dim gaslight" enables the mercury-basin light work. Setting affects mood and time pressure but does not supply a critical resource or physical obstacle that alters tactics; the repair could occur in any dim workshop with similar effect.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "as an anchor lifts for a ship's maiden voyage" is seeded early (*Prospect* departure ripples, line 6), tightened mid-repair (three horn blasts, line 13), and closed (cartographer arrives "as promised" at dawn, engines drone toward open sea). It drives urgency and structures the night-labor sequence. Cost is temporal (all-night work) but no on-page moment dramatizes a near-miss or adjustment forced by the shrinking window.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Decode feedback into direction" is Miren's explicit stake (line 7) and recurs in the repair goal (restore clear coordinates, each pulse a compass point). The motivation is dramatized through her focused night labor and choice to patch the navigation crystal. Friction is mild: no competing desire or cost that complicates the repair motive; she pursues it without internal conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Magnetic calm" is attributed to Miren's voice (line 11: "magnetic calm that drew projects toward her") and coheres through her steady hands and teaching demeanor. Tone modulates subtly with urgency (horn deadline) but never breaks into overt stress. The final teaching moment ("I don't see, I interpret") sustains the calm authority. Minor: the metaphor is stated once rather than consistently embodied across beats, limiting its charge at closure.</comment>
