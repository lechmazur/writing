<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Sable's journey is motivated by the thematic question about night-blooming flowers, but her interior remains abstract—no contradictory impulses act simultaneously in scene. The cathedral revelation that she sees herself in the glass feels unmotivated; no prior causality explains why *she* would be depicted there. The final "reckoning" is told rather than shown through embodied choice with visible cost. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("quiet wonder," "umbral tenderness") without character-particular texture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural (lyric mode with recurring images). Orientation is delayed—"who" and "where" anchor by ~150 words but "when" (autumn/winter/spring cycle) remains vague until mid-story. The closure unit attempts Conceptual Repricing: flowers bloom for the moon, not the sun. However, the cost is abstract—Sable's heart "blooms like the night flowers" is metaphorical assertion, not a legible forfeiture or stance crystallization on the page. The piece teaches a lyric pattern but the final reconfiguration lacks felt weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The amber pavilion and cathedral windows are described with vivid texture ("wooden ribs glazed with honeyed light," "stone arches rose like ribs"). The postcards recur across beats and charge the final collection moment, crossing the micro-setting threshold. However, spatial choreography at the cathedral is vague—how Sable "pressed her palm" and what she physically does as dawn breaks lacks concrete anchoring. The setting provides atmosphere but does not materially constrain a choice at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: understanding why flowers bloom at night. The journey to the cathedral is a tightening, and the glass revelation offers new knowledge. However, escalation is passive—Sable travels, observes, and receives the answer without a live trade-off or decision that narrows options. The "reckoning" is conceptual only; no on-page price (time, resource, relationship) alters her tactics or forecloses a path. One meaningful deepening is present but agency at closure is observational, not decisional.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the night-blooming flower motif and the hidden-layers conceit, avoiding overt statement until the penultimate line ("darkness is not an absence, but a quiet invitation"). The final image of visitors adding postcards and Sable mixing silver pigment offers resonance. However, the theme skirts banality—"flowers bloom for the moon, not the sun's approval"—without sufficient on-page friction to charge it beyond familiar romantic lyricism. The answer feels handed rather than earned through specific struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited, stable distance throughout. Perceptual signature is present (visual artist's eye on light, color, glass) but diction drifts into elevated register ("umbral tenderness," "reckoning," "communion") that feels authorial rather than character-rooted. Psychic distance remains consistent, but the prose lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure—emotional peaks ("breath caught") use stock embodiment. No dialogue to evaluate. The narrative voice is coherent but not distinctly Sable's lived idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff—nearly every sentence carries metaphor ("ribs of an ancient beast," "silver whisper," "umbral tenderness"). Paraphrase loops appear: "The postcards...seemed to hum" / "She would often arrange them" restates their presence without new pressure. Template cadence: "She thought...She imagined...She learned" runs across multiple paragraphs. Register drift into poetic abstraction ("quiet reckoning," "silver promise") clashes with concrete action. Artifacts touch closure ("her heart bloomed like the night flowers"), triggering the −1.7 deduction and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The hidden-layers-in-glass conceit and night-blooming flower question offer a lyric frame, but the execution relies on familiar romantic premises (moon as lover, darkness as invitation). The cathedral window revealing Sable herself is an intriguing turn, yet it arrives without groundwork and feels convenient rather than inevitable. The mural-artist setup and the postcard collection are specific, but emotional truth is diluted by poetic abstraction. One fresh inflection (self-image in glass) is present but not fully transformed into lived consequence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Sable is present throughout and her decision to travel to the cathedral creates the journey. However, she functions primarily as observer—mixing pigments, reading, standing before glass—without on-page choices that alter tactics under pressure. The final mural is a product, not a decision with visible cost. Two beats (mixing pigments, creating new mural) but both are outcomes rather than pressure-laden choices. Swappable with "curious researcher" or "philosopher" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Postcards appear in setup (studio walls), middle (read during journey, "tinted by time"), and closure (visitors add them; Sable arranges them in a circle). Three distinct beats with purposeful reweighting—from mystery maps to shared memory tapestry. However, the postcards do not constrain a choice or enable tactics under stress; they remain atmospheric anchors. The "frayed" moonflower-vine card seeds the mural but is summary-told. Causal pressure is low; they guide but do not force.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Dawning hush" appears explicitly once ("In that dawning hush") and is echoed in "the hush that settled" and "quiet reckoning." It frames the moment of revelation at the cathedral and the pavilion's twilight effect. However, it does not shape stakes or alter tactics—Sable waits for dawn as instructed, with no agency required. The concept charges the tonal closure but remains thematic rather than operational. Setup and payoff present; development is passive observation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Quietly driven" is labeled once in the opening ("She was quietly driven by a question") and echoed in "quiet drive" near the end. The trait explains motivation but does not visibly constrain or enable an action with cost. Sable's journey and work are steady rather than conflicted; no on-page moment where being "quiet" versus "loud" alters a choice. The attribute is consistent but ornamental—swappable with "persistently curious" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Reckon" and "reckoning" appear five times, clustered in the second half and closure. The word frames Sable's understanding ("quiet reckoning," "to reckon with that mystery"). However, the action of reckoning is internal and abstract—no physical or relational act on the page. The glass revelation and mural creation are the visible beats, not "reckoning" itself. The verb charges the thematic closure but could be replaced with "understand" or "accept" with minimal structural loss. Two-gate presence (development, payoff) but low causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cathedral's etched glass is signaled early ("windows held hidden layers"), visited at midpoint (Sable presses her palm, dawn light reveals images), and delivers the revelation that answers her question. The mechanics matter—"etched glass," "hidden layers," "dawn broke"—and the element is irreplaceable at closure. However, Sable does not navigate or solve access; she reads about it, travels, and observes. The glass enables discovery but does not constrain her attempts. Three gates with strong closure linkage but passive agency. Specificity and payoff elevate despite mid-level causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The amber pavilion opens and closes the story, framing Sable's studio and final mural. It provides atmosphere ("wooden ribs glazed with honeyed light") and a spatial anchor for her work. Visitors pause there at closure, adding a micro-social beat. However, the pavilion does not constrain choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—Sable could paint anywhere. The autumn-to-spring cycle charges the setting's reprise, but the effect is lyric framing rather than tactical pressure. Two-gate presence with thematic payoff but low causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The timeframe is signaled early ("autumn winds," "winter's last snow melted") and tracked loosely (journey "across the melting," return "as spring began"). The seasonal progression frames the quest but does not tighten decisions—no live clock or deadline on the page. Sable's journey duration is vague; the passage of months is summary-told rather than dramatized with cost. Setup and vague development present; payoff is thematic (spring rebirth) but time does not alter tactics. Swappable with "over several months" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The motivation ("why do flowers bloom at night?") is stated early and drives Sable's journey to the cathedral. It recurs in her reflections and shapes the final mural's subject. However, the desire is never conflicted—no trade-off where pursuing the answer costs her something else on the page. The glass provides the answer without friction; Sable does not choose between competing wants or pay a visible price. Setup and payoff strong; development is pursuit without obstacle. The motivation is focal but friction-free, capping causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Umbral tenderness" is labeled once and echoed in imagery: "shadows that seemed to breathe," "silver whisper that fills the shadows," "quiet reverence." The tone is stable—gentle, nocturnal, reverent—and coheres through turns. At closure, the pavilion's "umbral tenderness" charges the final scene with visitors feeling its effect. However, the tone does not modulate meaningfully under pressure; Sable's wonder remains constant. The piece teaches the tone early and sustains it, but static mood limits dynamic range. Two-gate presence with atmospheric payoff but mid-level charge at the ending image.</comment>
