<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is consistent (decode, protect, interfere), but her interiority relies heavily on summary rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The "cautiously hopeful" trait is told repeatedly but rarely constrains an on-page choice with visible cost—her three sleepless nights and the final switch are action beats, yet we don't see competing impulses wrestling in real time. Dr. Chen's entrance feels ornamental; he storms in, she shows charts, pressure deflates without a trade-off that tests her values. The closure choice (flip the switch) arrives without meaningful internal friction or a path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with situational pressure overlay. Orientation anchors clearly (booth, 2:47 AM discovery, campus split). The breakthrough → counter-frequency → transmission → effect sequence is motivated, but the core turn (recognizing tricksters manipulate via subsonic waves) lands via summary exposition rather than a dramatized beat that narrows options. Closure delivers a Decisive Change (arguments falter, signal fractures), yet the cost remains abstract—"wary dialogue" is asserted, not shown through a specific choice or forfeited path. The ending gestures toward Charged Poise ("tricksters would adapt"), but without a concrete on-page price or a visible option foreclosed, the resonance feels muted.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The booth's vintage equipment, peeling paint, burnt coffee, ozone, and vinyl records create vivid, purposeful texture that filters through Mara's professional lens. The spectrogram display and turntable needle are handled in scene and contribute to the discovery beat. Spatial choreography is clean (console, charts, transmitter tower), and the subsonic pulse vibrating the needle concretizes the threat. The booth constrains her choice (ancient amplifiers, risk-averse administration) and charges the final image as a "shield" space, lifting this into the 7+ band despite the campus and tower remaining lightly sketched.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: prevent community fracture and decode alien manipulation, signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs (2:47 AM discovery that signals are malevolent), and the counter-frequency plan introduces tactical risk (destabilize amplifiers, censure). However, the escalation is largely expository—three nights recalibrating happen off-page, and the climactic switch-flip meets no on-page resistance or complication. Cost is declared (arguments cool, mistrust smolders) rather than dramatized through a specific forfeited relationship or resource. Agency is present but the price remains abstract, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (manipulation, division as psychic fuel, interference as moral stance) emerges from events rather than statement. The tricksters-as-gaslighters concept and the radio-as-shield motif accumulate purposefully, and the final image (charts as sigils, "beating back the dark") offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. However, the closing paragraph edges toward thesis articulation ("she was still cautiously hopeful, knowing the tricksters would adapt") in a register slightly more diagnostic than dramatic. The piece resists tidy resolution and invites reflection, but the thematic payoff is more asserted than charged by a concrete final choice or image that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Mara; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature (astronomical charts as star map of suspicion, ozone and vinyl sensory anchors) is character-specific and consistent. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("infra-linguistic commands," "ethereal grit") that feels imposed rather than Mara's lived idiom, especially under peak stress. Dr. Chen's brief dialogue ("demanding answers") is functional but generic. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during discovery, wider during summary exposition), and the compression during the climax ("flipped the switch") matches urgency without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, and most sentences advance story or atmosphere. Clarity is strong, but several beats exhibit template cadence ("she was cautiously hopeful… she remained… she was still cautiously hopeful") and paraphrase loops (the tricksters' nature is restated across multiple paragraphs without added pressure). The phrase "ethereal grit" appears twice, feeling more like a prompt echo than organic voice. Filter verbs ("she realized," "she saw") cluster in expository beats, dulling immediacy. The final paragraph's repetition of the opening trait ("cautiously hopeful") reads as thematic bookend rather than momentum, and the line "a human heart, beating back the dark with nothing but static, stubborn faith" stacks modifiers without fresh specificity. Baseline −0.6 for paraphrase and template cadence; −0.2 for filter-verb stack in mid-story exposition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The celestial-signal-as-manipulation premise is familiar from recent genre work, and the lone-scientist-decodes-threat arc follows a recognizable template. Specific freshness arrives in the subsonic-frequency mechanism and the university radio station as both weapon and shield, lending purposeful grounding. The tricksters-as-gaslighters angle offers a contemporary inflection, but the emotional arc (discover → plan → execute → wary hope) does not transform the template through non-obvious moral calculus or a choice that reshapes expectations. The transformation test is marginal: swap Mara's name and the booth's details, and the core beats remain unchanged. −0.5 for derivative premise structure, partially offset by the radio-station micro-setting specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara (celestial signal interpreter) drives the discovery beat (2:47 AM), the counter-frequency plan, and the climactic switch-flip. Present in setup, middle, and closure. Her professional role enables the breakthrough and the tactical solution, and the final image anchors on her sustained vigilance. However, the key turns (recognizing manipulation, flipping the switch) are executed without on-page friction or a visible trade-off that tests competing values. Causal pressure is moderate; the role shapes tactics but the choices feel inevitable rather than costly. Two gates plus closure participation elevate to mid-6s, but lack of visible cost or a path foreclosed caps below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Astronomical charts appear in three beats: spread across console (setup), cross-referenced during discovery, held up to Chen at the end. They reappear with reweighted meaning (sigils against the dark) in the final paragraph. However, their use is largely summary ("traced their subsonic fingerprints across weeks of archived broadcasts") rather than on-page manipulation that constrains a choice. The charts enable research but do not force a tactical trade-off or narrow options under pressure. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure reprise +0.7, but summary-only middle use −0.8 and swappability (any research tool could serve) −0.6 cap below 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Power plays (dean threatens lab reassignment, Chen claims credit, tricksters manipulate) are present and frame conflict, but the dean and Chen pressures dissolve without on-page resolution or cost. The cosmic power play (tricksters betting on self-destruction) shapes the thematic stakes but does not force Mara into a tactical choice where she must sacrifice one goal for another. The concept is functional but replaceable—"manipulation" or "conspiracy" could substitute with minor edits. Setup +0.5, thematic involvement +0.4, but no middle constraint or closure linkage, and swappability −0.6, ornamental professional-conflict layer −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Cautiously hopeful" is labeled in the opening, the midpoint recalibration beat, and the final paragraph. It never constrains an on-page action—Mara proceeds with the plan without visible friction between hope and caution. The trait reads as thematic color rather than a value hierarchy that forces a trade-off. Early signal +0.3, three mentions across beats +1.4, closure reprise +0.3, but label-only use without cost −1.0, swappability (any temperament descriptor could fit) −0.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Interfere" is the story's spine: Mara's plan (counter-frequency), the three-night recalibration, and the climactic broadcast all enact interference. Setup (plan formed after discovery), middle (recalibration), and closure (switch-flip, signal fractures) all hinge on this action. Removing it collapses the arc. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (narrows tricksters' options) +1.2, closure linkage (arguments falter, signal scatters) +1.4. However, the execution is summarized (three nights off-page) rather than dramatized with on-page obstacles, and no visible cost (resource burned, ally lost) is tied to the act itself, capping below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Subsonic frequencies are discovered at 2:47 AM (spectrogram reveals infra-linguistic commands), shape the counter-strategy (sonic mirror, modified frequency generator), and execute the climax (subsonic waves pour from the tower). Present in setup, middle plan, and closure. The mechanics matter—subsonic below human hearing, structural-level cancellation—and are specific enough to feel researched. Early signal +0.6, two beats (discovery, climax) +0.9, causal pressure (enables the solution) +1.0, closure linkage +1.2. But the middle development (three nights recalibrating) happens off-page as summary −0.8, and the method could be replaced with another signal-tech solution (e.g., phase inversion, counter-pulse) with modest edits, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>WKUZ radio station is the story's crucible: vintage equipment reveals the pulse (turntable needle vibrates), the booth supplies the transmitter and generator for the counter-frequency, and the station's broadcast reach is the weapon. The setting pressures choice (ancient amplifiers risk frying, administration censure) and charges the final image (booth as shield, protective space). Setup (cramped booth, peeling paint, equipment described) +0.7, middle (equipment used for discovery and modification) +0.9, closure (booth as sigils-wall sanctuary) +1.4, causal pressure (constrains tactics, supplies tool) +1.2, specificity (vintage turntable, ozone, vinyl) +0.6. The university campus remains lightly sketched and ornamental, but the micro-setting (booth + tower) is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"As the community divides" frames the external pressure and is present in the opening (campus split, protests) and the closure (hysteria cools, wary dialogue). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—Mara has three uninterrupted nights to recalibrate without escalation from the dean, Chen, or the community's fracture. The division is static backdrop rather than a live clock that forces a rushed or costly choice. Setup +0.5, thematic throughline +0.4, closure mention +0.3, but no middle constraint or escalation tied to time pressure −1.0, and the element is replaceable with "during a crisis" or similar phrasing −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Mara's desire to outwit the tricksters drives the arc: recognize manipulation, devise counter-frequency, execute broadcast. Setup (interpret signals, cautiously hopeful about contact shifts to recognizing threat) +0.6, middle (cross-reference archives, plan interference) +0.9, closure (counter-signal works, tricksters scatter) +1.2. The motivation is consistent and causal. However, the friction between "outwit" (implying cunning, risk) and the cost is told rather than shown—no on-page moment where her cleverness backfires or forces a sacrifice. The climax succeeds without complication, deflating the outwit stakes. Swappability (protect, stop, counter) −0.6, summary execution of key beats −0.8.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Ethereal grit" is stated twice and operationalized through imagery: subsonic whispers, cosmic tricksters, vintage booth decay, burnt coffee and ozone. The tone marries the spectral (infra-linguistic, starlight-in-fog signal scatter) with the tactile (peeling paint, needle vibration, coffee smell). Tone modulates purposefully—tense during discovery, compressed during the climactic broadcast, reflective in the final paragraph. However, the phrase "ethereal grit" itself reads as a prompt label rather than organic voice, and the final paragraph's shift to summary reflection slightly flattens the grit in favor of thematic articulation. Setup +0.7, consistent modulation +0.9, closure charge (protective sigils, beating back the dark) +1.0, but label-only insertion −0.5, slight tonal drift in final beat −0.3.</comment>
