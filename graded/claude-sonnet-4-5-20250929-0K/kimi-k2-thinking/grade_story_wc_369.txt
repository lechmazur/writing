<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to understand what the trees witnessed is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. The shift from maintenance worker to grief-archaeologist feels imposed by the discovery rather than earned through prior interiority. The emotional progression—old wound healing in moonlight—arrives as assertion without embodied cost. Micro-choices exist (climbing stairs, placing the sextant) but read as plot service rather than revealing a hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as accumulative/lyric with symbolic objects gathering toward a thematic reweighting, but the closure unit—Elara's realization that the labyrinth transforms sorrow into hope—lands as stated theme rather than felt reconfiguration with visible cost. The pin's echo in the final paragraph gestures toward resonance but the cost of her new understanding remains abstract. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first 120 words, waiving that penalty. Causality is present but soft: the sextant heals because legend says so, the door opens because she "deconstructs" threads of light, without friction or price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The stormlit tower, spiral stairs, and garden with glowing trees are vivid and purposeful. The sextant—"brass limbs twisted, glass lens cracked," "smelled of salt and stardust"—functions as micro-setting and constrains the moonlight-healing beat. Sensory detail is selective (distant thunder, humming air, rustling leaves) and filtered through Elara's maintenance-worker familiarity. The hidden map on the wall and the sealed door provide spatial stakes that guide action, lifting the score above postcard description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering what the trees witnessed—is signaled early and pursued through the sextant's healing and the door's opening. One meaningful tightening occurs when the sextant reveals the hidden map, narrowing Elara's tactical options. However, escalation is soft: she climbs, places, waits, and the tools cooperate without friction. The final realization (sorrow transformed into hope) is conceptual but lacks visible cost; no live option is foreclosed, no trade-off made. Agency reads as attention and endurance rather than decision under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme—grief as transformable into hope through witnessing and mapping—emerges from the sextant, map, and tree imagery rather than assertion. The "quiet miracles of everyday resilience" (lullaby, prayer, laugh) offer textured particulars. Yet the final paragraph states the premise directly: "the labyrinth's purpose was not to trap sorrow, but to transform it into a map of hope." The ending gestures toward non-literal resonance (the pin's echo, the new dream scattering) but the thematic answer is told rather than charged by a final image with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and anchored to Elara's perception. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent: "the labyrinth exhale," "the trees whispered their secrets in rustling leaves." Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close (her fingers brushing metal) to wider lyric register (the map as web of scattered dreams). Occasional elevated phrasing ("mundane miracle," "quantified sorrow") reads voice-motivated rather than intrusive. No head-hopping, no dialogue to judge; focalization is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and paragraph structure supports lyric accumulation. Information density is generally high (sextant description, map reveal, garden discovery). However, paraphrase loops appear: "She wanted to know if they saw hope or only desolation" followed two beats later by "the trees had witnessed not only sorrow but also the quiet miracles." The final two paragraphs restate theme ("transform it into a map of hope") and recycle the pin image without adding pressure. Some filter verbs ("she realized," "she felt") stack in the closure third, dulling immediacy. Syntax varies purposefully; no grammar errors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—labyrinth as grief repository, sextant healing in moonlight—combines familiar fantasy tropes (enchanted objects, symbolic architecture) without a sharp transformative angle. The emotional arc (maintenance worker discovers purpose, heals old wound) follows a template path. Specificity in sensory detail (salt and stardust, silver-blue light) offers texture, but the transformation test fails: swap names and setting, the arc remains unchanged. The "quantified sorrow" concept and "map of scattered dreams" gesture toward fresh synthesis but remain abstract rather than embodied in irreplaceable choice or cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and makes choices (kneels, climbs, places sextant, maps threads, steps into garden). These choices advance the sequence but trend reactive: she follows the sextant's revelation rather than creating turns through internal conflict. The final realization is hers, but it reads as recognition rather than decision with cost. Setup, development, and closure participation are all present, lifting the score above ornamental, but her agency does not narrow options or force trade-offs. Functional but replaceable protagonist role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sextant appears in four distinct beats: discovery (pins clatter, she retrieves it), examination (brass limbs, cracked lens), healing on windowsill (cracks shimmer and close), and revelation (lens focuses light onto map). Its specific properties—broken, salt-scented, heals in moonlight—matter causally: without it, no map, no door. It returns in the final paragraph on the windowsill as "a reminder," reweighting prior material. Setup, development, and closure participation all present. The object drives two major beats (healing, map reveal) and charges the ending image, but its use after the map reveal is summary-only (she uses the light to "deconstruct" without friction), capping the score below indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Quantified sorrow" is named early ("Each stone absorbed a measure of sorrow, quantified in silent weight") and returns when Elara charts the map ("the sorrow took shape: a number, a tangible measure of grief"). However, the concept remains thematic decoration: it does not constrain her choices or alter tactics. The numbering of grief is told, not shown; no on-page cost or friction tied to quantification appears. The concept could be swapped for "archived sorrow" or "recorded grief" with minimal edits. Functional mention without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Heals in moonlight" is signaled early via legend, enacted on-page when Elara places the sextant on the windowsill, and the healing enables the map revelation that drives the second half. The trait constrains her action: she must wait for moonlight, must climb to the chamber, must position the instrument. The cost is mild (time, effort) but the trait's specificity is irreplaceable: without moonlight healing, the plot breaks. Setup in first third, middle development (healing sequence), closure participation (sextant remains on sill as reminder). Two beats of causal involvement and closure linkage push the score into the essential band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Deconstruct" appears explicitly when Elara must "deconstruct the labyrinth's sorrowful foundation" and later "deconstructing the threads, unraveling the sorrow into threads of light" to open the door. This action drives the major turn (door opening, garden access). However, the mechanics are vague—she "focuses the light" and threads unravel—without friction, cost, or tactical choice. The action is signaled and present at closure but could be swapped for "unlock," "translate," or "harmonize" without deep structural loss. Setup, development, and closure participation all present; causal role in one major beat lifts it to mid-band, but lack of specificity and cost caps it below essential.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Mapping scattered dreams" is named when the sextant reveals "a map...a web of scattered dreams" and Elara "began to map the scattered dreams, tracing the threads with her finger." The method drives her middle action (charting the map to understand the trees' testimony) and enables the door-opening. However, the mapping itself is summary: "she traced...feeling the weight of each quantified sorrow" without shown cost or friction. The method is signaled early (first third), used in middle development, and its result (map understood) participates in closure. Functional across beats but mechanics remain abstract, capping the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The stormlit tower appears in the title phrase and throughout: storm clouds part to let moonlight pierce the "stormlit tower's high window," the "stormlit chamber" glows with silver-blue light, and the tower's base holds the sealed door. The setting enables the moonlight-healing beat (tower's height and window position matter) and the final garden discovery (door in tower's base). The storm outside "subsided, leaving a sky washed clean" charges the ending's tonal shift. Setup, development, and closure participation all present. The setting constrains two key actions (climb to window, descend to door) and modulates atmosphere, lifting it into the essential band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The pin drop is the inciting moment: "a pin clattered against the stone floor...the silence fractured, and she felt the labyrinth exhale." It recurs in the final paragraph: "the pin had been replaced, but its echo lingered, a reminder of the moment everything changed." However, the timeframe element—"at the moment a pin is heard"—does not constrain choices or tighten decisions after the opening beat. The story spans hours (sweeping, climbing, mapping, opening door, entering garden) without time pressure. The pin functions as symbolic bookend, not live clock. Present in setup and closure reprise but ornamental in development; lyric resonance lifts it above absent but lacks causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"To discover what trees witness" is stated early: "her true purpose was to understand what the trees outside had witnessed...She wanted to know if they saw hope or only desolation." This desire drives her use of the sextant and map to access the garden where "the trees whispered their secrets." The motivation is pursued across beats (retrieval, healing, mapping, door-opening, garden entry) and resolved on-page when the trees speak. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through contradictory wants or visible cost. No friction between this goal and another need; she pursues it linearly. Setup, development, and closure participation present; shapes attempts but lacks on-page conflict or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Mundane miracles" is named explicitly: "the quiet miracles of everyday resilience. A mother's lullaby, a farmer's prayer, a child's first laugh—each a mundane miracle that balanced the scales." The tone mixes lyric wonder (labyrinth exhale, silver-blue light, trees glowing with stored memories) with grounded maintenance work (sweeping, climbing stairs). The contrast is purposeful and modulates with pressure (quiet opening, heightened discovery, subdued ending). However, the final paragraph states the tone rather than embodying it in a charged image: "each sweep of her broom felt like a prayer." The tone is coherent and present at closure but articulated rather than felt, trending functional without full lyric charge.</comment>
