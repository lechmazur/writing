<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The archivist's motivation to "compile fragments into meaning" is established, but her interior life remains thin—trait-label ("reactively visionary") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The navigator's weeping at recognition reads functional but lacks the layered irrationality or self-deception that elevates characterization. Agency exists (she demonstrates the valve's use, summons him, plays the sequence), yet the choices feel inevitable rather than wrestling with competing impulses. Interiority leans abstract ("sensing how absences could be navigated") rather than showing her mind's specific texture under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece establishes a pattern (collecting spray-samples over seven years, then aligning them via staggered intervals) and pays it off when the seventh sounding reveals voices and the navigator's story emerges. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the navigator receives "a transcript of his silences, each gap now a bridge"), and conceptual cost is legible (exile reframed as composition, not void). However, orientation debt persists: "who" anchors late (~"ocean-spray archivist," no proper name ever given), spatial grounding drifts (archive chamber introduced only at summoning), and the mechanics of how mist-samples align with the valve remain elided until final third. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) applies; Q3 capped at 7.0, Q6 at 7.8, all categories at 8.3 per cross-caps.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ivory Harbor after rain supplies vivid images (stones "gleamed like blank pages," "bottles of captured spray lined the walls like bottled starlight"), yet spatial choreography remains vague—archive location, harbor layout, and navigator's path never cohere. The setting does charge the final image (wet stones to "true ivory" under sun, spray writing on her skin) and the valve's case with "salt-crusted velvet" grounds the archivist's work. Sensory detail skews visual; brine and old paper scent opens strong but other senses drop away. Micro-setting allowance applies (bottles, valve, stones), lifting the score slightly, but the piece never uses environment to constrain a choice—rain clears the sky, stones gleam, yet tactics remain unaffected.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: compile the navigator's story from fragments and hearten him by proving his silence was speech. The archivist's work proceeds without opposition or resource constraint—she collects, plays intervals, and the fragments align on schedule. No meaningful tightening occurs; the seventh interval simply completes the sequence without prior risk or narrowed options. The navigator's weeping registers emotional payoff, but no trade-off or forfeited path is visible. Coincidence (the valve "resonating with the stored mists") enables resolution rather than protagonist choice under pressure. One micro turn (summoning him to demonstrate) exists, but escalation reads flat across the accumulative design.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—absences define presence, silence as speech, negative space as meaning—emerges organically from the valve's mechanics and the archivist's final insight ("meaning emerged not from what was preserved, but from what had been lost"). The closing image (sun turning stones to ivory, spray writing "first draft" on her skin, "every ending was merely a silence waiting for its key") reweights prior material without moralizing. However, the piece edges toward over-articulation: "Her gift was never the recovery of sound, but the cartography of silence" and "heartening those who returned with the proof that their silence had been heard" border on Thematic Echo, though they stop short of prompt-language. The conceptual repricing (gaps as bridges, not wounds) lands clearly, and the final lines resist summary, keeping the score above mid-band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single POV (archivist) with stable third-limited distance and no head-hopping. Diction remains elevated and consistent ("reactively visionary," "negative spaces that defined a shape," "cartography of silence"), fitting an archivist's lexicon. However, perceptual signature is generic—her way of noticing could belong to any contemplative professional. Sentence stems recur ("She collected," "She accepted," "She recorded," "She summoned," "She placed," "She returned") without rhythmic variation, flattening momentum. The navigator's speech appears once ("This, he said, was all that remained") without distinct idiom. Orientation debt (late anchoring of who/where) and cross-cap from Q2 applied, capping this category at 7.8; absent that, internal voice control would still plateau mid-6s due to template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "She did not merely chronicle; she heartened..." immediately after "she demonstrated how each gap...revealed...intentional space"; "the spaces between them" / "the shape of what had been lost" / "meaning emerged...from what had been lost and then found in the gaps" cycles the same concept. Template cadence: nine sentences open with "She [verb]" or "The [noun]" within two paragraphs, creating drumbeat rhythm. Stock metaphors cluster without fresh tenor: "bottled starlight," "blanket of mist," "archives against the stones, writing." Figurative density in non-peak beats (ivory stones as blank pages, trumpet's ghost sounding shape) muddles rather than sharpens. Patterned-artifact penalty (paraphrase + template + stock strings) totals −1.2 in Q7, and presence in final third disallows 9+ globally, capping high-band entries at 8.8 per artifact rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Core premise—collecting ocean spray as memory archives—offers a fresh angle, and the valve as resonance key shows ingenuity. However, execution leans decorative: the mechanics (how mist samples encode voices, why staggered intervals matter, how the valve unlocks them) remain vague, reducing conceptual rigor. Emotional beats (navigator weeping, archivist standing at water's edge) follow familiar reconciliation-after-exile templates without transformation. The "cartography of silence" frame recurs in slight variations rather than building through specifics. Proximity check: "every ending was merely a silence waiting for its key" and "spaces between" echo common poetic closures. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure is present but undercut by ornamental rather than causal use of fantasy elements.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Archivist present throughout. She collects samples (setup), aligns fragments via valve (development), and plays the complete sequence to the navigator, then places the valve in the case (closure participation). Her decisions drive the revealing of the navigator's story. Causal pressure: her choice to blow through the valve initiates the discovery; her choice to summon him and demonstrate completes it. Two distinct beats (discovery, demonstration) with closure linkage. Swappability moderate—another scholar or curator could perform similar work with minor edits. Cost is conceptual (her ongoing solitary work, waiting for the next exile) but not sharp on the page. Early signal, beat involvement ×2, closure linkage, moderate causal pressure lift the score; swappability and diffuse cost hold it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Valve introduced early ("corroded herald's trumpet valve, green with sea-sickness"), handled in discovery beat (she blows through it gently), used again in demonstration beat (she plays intervals to the navigator), and placed in case at closure. Three beats. Causal pressure: its hollow body resonates with mists, unlocking the navigator's story—without it, no revelation occurs. Closure linkage strong: "The valve remained in her archive, a testament to how what is broken can still conduct truth" and its final casing. Specificity high (corroded, herald's, valve mechanics matter). Cost tied to it (the object's brokenness mirrors the navigator's exile). Early signal, three beats, causal necessity, closure charge, and irreplaceability push this into the 7+ band. Minor swappability (another resonant object could substitute) and the mechanics remaining elided keep it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Navigated absences" functions as both method and theme. Setup: "sensing how absences could be navigated like treacherous reefs." Development: "the silences between notes mapping the harbors where his ship had been forbidden to land" and "She recorded these navigated absences...as negative spaces that defined a shape." Closure: "each gap now a bridge rather than a wound." The concept reweights the ending by framing silence as compositional rather than void. However, it operates primarily as interpretive frame—no on-page choice hinges on understanding absences this way; the valve's mechanics unlock the story regardless of how she philosophizes it. Causal pressure weak; closure linkage moderate (reframes but doesn't enable); two beats of thematic presence. Lyric-resonance allowance applies (early seed, final reprise), reaching mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Reactively visionary" appears once: "her reactively visionary mind already sensing how absences could be navigated." Label-only; no on-page action demonstrates what "reactively visionary" means in practice—does she see patterns others miss, does visions arrive uninvited, does reaction-speed matter? No cost, no constraint, no enabling tied to this trait. The archivist's work (collecting, sounding, aligning) would proceed identically without this descriptor. Late middle introduction (~third paragraph), ornamental use, high swappability. Functional mention prevents a sub-3.0 score, but lack of dramatization caps it in the low 3s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Hearten" appears explicitly: "she heartened the broken man by showing how his silence had been a form of speech" and "heartening those who returned with the proof that their silence had been heard." Setup implicit (her role collecting memories suggests restoration). Development: the demonstration of the valve's revelations performs the heartening. Closure: the navigator leaves "with a transcript of his silences," and the resolution pivots on emotional repair. Causal role: without the act of heartening, the ending's reconciliation (exile no longer void but composition) collapses. Two beats, closure essential, moderate irreplaceability (another verb of restoration might serve). Cost tied to her ongoing solitary work awaiting the next exile. Reaches low 7s on necessity and closure linkage; slight swappability and the verb's late explicit naming keep it from 7.5+.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Staggered intervals" signaled early: "Through staggered intervals—dawn, then three days later, then a fortnight—the fragments began to align." Development: the intervals structure her investigation and the mechanics of unlocking the story. Closure: "she played the complete sequence, the staggered intervals merging into a chorus." The method shapes her attempts and the final revelation's form. Causal necessity moderate—some patterned approach is required, but why these intervals (dawn / 3 days / fortnight) matter remains unexplained, reducing specificity. Two beats (investigation, final playing), closure linkage, early signal. Swappability moderate (another timed pattern could substitute). Mechanics elision and lack of on-page constraint or cost (she never struggles with timing) hold the score mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Ivory Harbor after rain anchors the piece. Setup: "ships of reconciliation docked beneath a sky scrubbed clean by rain" and "ivory stones of the harbor, washed by the recent rain, gleamed like blank pages." Closure: "The sun broke through the remaining clouds, turning the wet stones to true ivory" and "Ivory Harbor kept its name, but after that day, its residents understood it held not just ships but the spaces between them." The setting charges the final image (wet stones to ivory under sun, name reweighted). However, it never constrains a choice—the archivist's work proceeds identically regardless of location or weather; rain aesthetic rather than functional. Lyric reprise (ivory stones early and late) with thematic reweighting (name now means spaces between ships). Two gates (setup, closure), lyric-resonance path reaches ~5.9. Missing development and no tactical constraint prevent higher band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the exile ends" sets temporal frame in opening: "After the exile ended, when the ships of reconciliation docked." The navigator's return initiates the story. Closure references it: "after rain and exile, the archivist continued compiling." However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—no urgency, no deadline, no pressure from when exile ended or how long she has. The seven years of prior collecting are backstory; the on-page action (playing intervals across staggered time) unfolds without clock pressure. Setup present, closure mention, but no development or tactical constraint. Functional but replaceable (another temporal marker could serve). Caps at mid-4s per missing development gate and lack of causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"To compile fragments into meaning" stated explicitly: "These were the fragments she had been born to compile" and "In Ivory Harbor...the archivist continued compiling fragments into meaning through staggered intervals." Setup implicit (collecting spray-samples over seven years). Development: aligning fragments via valve and recording them. Closure: the complete sequence played, transcript given, and her ongoing work affirmed. The desire drives all major beats. However, it is never conflicted—no competing want, no cost to her relentless collecting, no friction between compiling and other needs. Causal role strong; closure essential; cost weak (her solitary work mentioned but not dramatized as sacrifice). Three beats, closure linkage, high necessity; lack of on-page friction or visible trade-off holds it mid-6s.</comment>
