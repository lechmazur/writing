<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The protagonist is a walking concept rather than a character with embodied struggle. Motivation is stated abstractly ("to understand why some houses feel alive") but never tested by a concrete choice with visible cost. Interior life consists of ornamental observations and label-only states ("feeling its weight like a secret prayer") without contradictory impulses or genuine friction. The ending grants satisfaction without earned change or renunciation that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural but remains unfocused; the piece loops through repeated sanctification beats without meaningful tightening or a decisive reweighting. No on-page closure: the protagonist continues unchanged, stakes remain abstract, and the final paragraph recycles the opening's claim without cost. Orientation is delayed—who/where/when take ~180 words to anchor with no functional payoff. The ending offers thematic assertion ("every act of noticing can sanctify the world") in place of a scene-pressure image with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "quiet bay in spring" and "streetlights daydream" recur as atmospheric labels but never constrain a choice or supply resources. Spatial choreography is vague—houses, shoreline, thresholds, and an oak are visited without legible transitions or cumulative pressure. Sensory detail is generic and decorative ("amber pools," "hushed blaze") rather than filtered through urgent perception. The orris root shard and displaced objects appear as talismans without tactile handling or evolving physical consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding animate houses—is declared but never dramatized as a problem that narrows options or imposes cost. The protagonist gathers and places objects in a repeating loop with no escalation, reversal, or trade-off. No on-page tightening: each house responds the same way ("exhaled," "hummed," "breathe easier") without complication or resistance. Agency is absent; the protagonist enacts a ritual without friction, and the ending grants legend status without a scene-pressure choice or visible price paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Theme ("small things sanctify the everyday") is stated repeatedly rather than earned through particulars. The orris root shard is introduced as "a shard of hush" with symbolic weight declared on arrival, then recycled without reweighting. The final paragraph moralizes directly: "every act of noticing can sanctify the world." Epiphanies are asserted ("He realized that the act of noticing...was a prayer") without dramatized struggle or conceptual cost. No non-literal resonance; the ending summarizes rather than charging prior material with a new lens.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, but the voice is generic and tonally uniform—elevated diction ("inadvertently profound," "sanctify," "hushed blaze") recurs without character-specific texture. Perceptual signature is absent; the protagonist notices in catalog fashion without bias or selective attention shaped by urgency. Reflection dominates (~40% of the text) with minimal present anchoring: "He had learned," "He knew," "He realized" loop without micro-choices altering present tactics. Psychic distance remains fixed at summary remove, flattening pressure at every beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "houses feel alive" / "houses breathe easier" / "houses...hummed with a low breath" recycle the same claim across a dozen lines without added pressure. Template cadence dominates with "He [verb]" and "The creeping normality noticer [verb]" stems repeated mechanically. Stock metaphors ("shard of hush," "hushed blaze") appear in most beats without pattern-teaching or payoff. Register drifts into abstract elevation ("inadvertently profound," "sanctify") mismatched to the POV's practical task. Synonym churn ("displaced objects," "shards of hush," "rite," "prayer") substitutes for causal linkage. Artifacts touch the closure paragraph directly, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Core premise—collecting talismanic objects to animate houses—reads as a writing-exercise template without transformation. The protagonist's observational role ("creeping normality noticer") and the sanctification ritual echo genre conventions (urban fantasy, animism) without fresh synthesis. Turns are predictable: each placement yields the same contented hum. No risk-taking or bold choice; the middle-ground execution avoids specificity that would anchor universals. The ending retreats to legend-making rather than earned particularity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Present throughout but never makes a decision that alters tactics or costs. Observation is continuous; placement is repetitive without consequence or trade-off. Closure grants legend status via summary rather than an on-page choice. Late cap (3.0), swappability (3.8), and ornamental use (−0.5 to −1.0) all apply.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Introduced at ~13% (twilight discovery), placed beneath threshold at ~28%, and mentioned in final-third summary. Two beats, but both placements yield identical results without evolving function. Not causally active in closure; cameo mentions do not count as participation. Missing closure gate caps at 2.8; two-beat involvement and early signal raise to mid-4s, but swappability (any magical object could replace it) and no specific cost tied to it on the page limit further lift.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Labeled early ("shard of hush") and repeated as thematic claim throughout. Never tested as a mechanic that changes options or imposes visible cost—houses simply accept the shard and respond uniformly. Present in closure paragraph as ornament ("shard of hush" recurs) but not causally active or reweighted. Missing development and closure gates; swappability and label-only use apply.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Inadvertently profound" appears once as label ("The effect was inadvertently profound") and in the final summary. No on-page action demonstrates unintended depth or a trade-off arising from the trait. Ornamental descriptor with no causal pressure or cost. Missing all gates.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Repeated across many beats: protagonist sanctifies houses by placing objects. Early signal, middle involvement, and closure participation all present. However, the action is mechanical and interchangeable—each sanctification beat is identical without escalation or evolving cost. Causal pressure is low because no house resists or complicates the ritual. Swappability moderate (similar verbs could substitute). Lifts to mid-5s for gate coverage but cannot reach 7+ without visible friction or a scene where removal of this exact action breaks closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Objects are gathered and placed throughout. Early signal (sea glass, keys, marble by ~10%), middle beats show placement, closure paragraph mentions them. However, mechanics are vague—how displacement matters or why certain objects fit certain houses is never dramatized. The method functions as backdrop ritual rather than a tactic under pressure. Gates covered but swappability and summary-only use limit lift; no specific cost tied to the method on the page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Mentioned in opening and closing frames; shoreline, houses, and bay recur as labels. Never supplies resources, constrains movement, or pressures a choice—protagonist moves freely without spatial friction. Postcard atmosphere without tactical involvement. Missing development and closure participation as active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"While the streetlights daydream" appears in opening, one mid-story beat, and closing frame as tonal label. No clock or temporal urgency; events could occur over minutes or months with no change to the text. Timeframe is ornamental rather than a constraint that alters tactics. Missing all functional gates.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Stated at ~8% and answered in summary at ~55% ("answered in the hush that spread"). The question drives the protagonist's gathering but is never dramatized as a friction or contested—houses cooperate, no cost is paid to learn. Present early and at closure but as thematic frame rather than a choice-forcing desire with visible trade-offs. Missing true development (no beat where the want conflicts with another need or fear).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Hushed blaze" recurs as a phrase in multiple beats and the closing image. Tone remains uniform—elevated, meditative—without modulation under pressure or a cadence shift at closure. Coherent but static; does not charge the final image with new weight or cost. Present across the arc but ornamental in function.</comment>
