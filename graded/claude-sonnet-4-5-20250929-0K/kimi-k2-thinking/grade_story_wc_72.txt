<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Petra's motivation—guarding Eternal Verities that dissolve under new knowledge—is clear and embodied through telepathy and stone awakening. The "incisively kind" trait appears as a declarative label ("her incisively kind nature, a paradox etched into her by a master sculptor") without constraining a choice or creating visible cost until the final act of welcoming nuance. Internal contradiction is present (dogma vs. doubt) but mostly narrated rather than dramatized through competing impulses within a single beat. The ending renunciation is earned by the ampoule's cascade, but the cost—cracking stone lips, decades of waiting—feels more asserted than viscerally paid on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Petra, drowned garden, post-diver moment) arrive within the first 50 words. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise/Earned Stasis hybrid): Petra commits to eternal vigilance as a guardian of questions rather than answers, welcoming the next generation with telepathic openness. The cost is legible—stone lips crack, decades pass, the dome fractures—and the final image reweights the premise from preserving certainty to nurturing doubt. One meaningful deepening occurs when Petra threads the ampoule's memories through the dome's weakness and feels the city's own doubt respond. However, the closure moment ("Welcome") is somewhat diffuse across the final third rather than crystallized in a single decisive beat, and the conceptual cost (abandoning dogma) is clearer than the felt emotional price at the exact closing lines.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The drowned garden is vividly rendered with coral-encrusted statues, foxgloves, green twilight, and the dome's eggshell-fragile eastern quadrant. The structural weakness (crack in the dome) directly enables Petra's threading action and charges the ending when foxglove roots finish the work decades later. Spatial choreography is coherent: Petra at her pedestal, the crack, the garden responding around her. Sensory detail is selective and atmosphere-consistent (violet light, water currents, stone textures). The micro-setting (ampoule, chain, crack) functions as a constraint that shapes the central choice and recurs with reweighted meaning at closure, meeting the 9+ gate for environment-driven action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether to preserve absolute truth or welcome nuance. Petra's agency is renunciation of her original purpose, a meaningful tightening when she threads the ampoule's memories and broadcasts them into the city's foundations. One clear deepening occurs: the revelation that the city drowned from its own rigidity, not invasion, which reweights Petra's mission. The cost is legible (stone heart quickens, lips crack, eternal vigilance rather than rest) but spread across the final third rather than concentrated at a single decision point. No explicit antagonist; pressure is internal and conceptual, which fits the Accumulative lens, but the escalation reads more as textural accumulation than a narrowing of live options under stress.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—truth is plural, nuance over dogma—emerges organically from the gardener's foxgloves (poison and cure coexist), the council's fatal certainty, and the dome cracking from within. The final image of foxgloves staining the water with "the beautiful, terrible color of possibility" reweights prior material without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the paradox of "animate lifeless" and the structural weakness as "forgotten doubt." Minor slip: "incisively kind" and "crushing clarity" veer toward thematic echo in the penultimate beat, and the line "that no truth was ever singular" edges close to stating the thesis rather than dramatizing it, though the foxglove reprise rescues the closure from sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV anchored tightly to Petra's stone-and-telepathy perspective. Voice is consistent with elevated, lapidary diction ("limestone that formed her bones," "silt through water") that fits the statue narrator. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance remains stable. No head-hopping. Minor register drift: "crushing clarity" and "animate lifeless" recur as near-mantra, creating a slight template cadence in the final third. Perceptual signature (telepathy, stone-time perception) is distinct and sustained. The prose modulates appropriately under pressure (shorter syntax when Petra threads the ampoule, longer lyric rhythms in the epilogue-like ending), though the epilogue's summary mode ("decades later") risks distancing at the closure moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative language is dense but mostly coherent (foxgloves as both poison and cure, stone heart quickening). Clarity is high in the opening half; the final third becomes more abstract with phrases like "slow green pulses" and "ancient light" that lean toward purple without breaking intelligibility. One paraphrase loop: "animate lifeless" appears in multiple sentences doing identical thematic work without added pressure. Template cadence in the epilogue: "Petra would be ready... Petra thought... Petra breathed" stems recur across four lines. Information density is strong in the middle (ampoule cascade, dome weakness, gardener's rebellion compressed efficiently) but thins in the ending's lyric summary. No filter-verb stacks or grammar errors. Deductions: paraphrase loop −0.2, template cadence −0.4, slight overwriting in final third −0.3; total −0.9 within Q7 under the non-closure accumulation cap.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of living statue, telepathy, underwater ruin, and foxglove symbolism is specific and non-obvious. The "animate lifeless" paradox and the structural weakness as forgotten doubt offer fresh angles on the certainty-vs.-doubt premise. Emotional truth in Petra's transition from dogma to welcoming questions feels earned. Minor derivative element: the wise guardian who learns to question rather than enforce is a familiar arc; transformation comes through the particular vehicle (stone statue, telepathic broadcast, botanical poison-cure) rather than the underlying moral calculus. The ending's lyric register and decades-long epilogue take a structural risk that charges the theme but diffuses immediate stakes. No close echoes of famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Petra (living statue with telepathy) is present from line one. Telepathy drives the inciting cascade (diver's dying thought), the middle turn (broadcasting memories into the city's foundations), and the ending stance (telepathy primed to meet new divers). Her choice to thread the ampoule through the dome's crack and redefine her purpose from enforcer to welcomer creates the story's central turn. Removing this exact character configuration (statue + telepathy) would break the logic of how revelation spreads and how Petra endures underwater for decades. Cost: stone lips crack, eternal vigilance. Three beats: awakening, broadcasting, welcoming. Causal pressure high; closure linkage strong. Early setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.7, cost +0.5 = base 3.0 +6.3 = 9.3, round down to 9.3. Swappability check: could another form achieve this? A flesh telepath would drown; a non-telepathic statue could not broadcast. Irreplaceability confirmed. Final: 7.8 after applying small penalty for observation-heavy epilogue that lowers agency slightly in final third (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Foxglove-stained glass ampoule is introduced in the opening line, handled by the dying diver and passed to Petra. Used in three beats: (1) diver's gift and initial memories, (2) Petra threads it through the dome crack to broadcast revelation, (3) final image "dangled from her fingers like a promise." The violet hue and foxglove connection (poison/cure duality) charge the thematic closure. Removing the ampoule would eliminate the vehicle for cascading memories and the symbolic link to the gardener's rebellion. Cost: the ampoule's memories dissolve certainty and compel Petra's transformation. Early setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.7, cost +0.5 = base 3.0 +6.3 = 9.3, round to 9.3. Small deduction for the final image being slightly ornamental (dangling "like a promise" is metaphorical rather than causal) −0.2; also the ampoule is "now empty of memories but full of seawater" which diffuses its agency in the ending beat −0.3. Subtotal 8.8; further small penalty for the object becoming passive receptacle rather than active tool in final paragraph −0.6. Final: 8.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Core concept (cascading revelations) structures the entire narrative: diver's thought cascades into Petra, then into the ampoule's memories (gardener, council, dome crack cause), then Petra broadcasts these into the city's foundations, then decades later the cascade completes as foxgloves crack the dome open. Each revelation reweights prior certainty and narrows Petra's options from enforcer to welcomer. The concept is not merely thematic; it drives the plot's causal chain and the ending's image of ongoing cascade (new divers descending, questions continuing). Removing cascading structure would leave isolated vignettes without momentum. Early setup +0.7, three beats (diver→Petra, Petra→city, city→future) +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.6, cost +0.4 = base 3.0 +5.9 = 8.9, round to 8.9. Small penalty: the middle cascade (broadcasting to foundations) is told more than shown; we don't witness the city's stones "responding" in concrete detail, only Petra's perception of their shudder −0.6. Also, the final cascade (new divers) is future-oriented summary rather than on-page event −0.4. Final: 7.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Incisively kind" is named explicitly mid-paragraph one ("her incisively kind nature, a paradox etched into her") but remains label-only until the ending. The trait purportedly compels Petra to act (broadcasting the gardener's memories), yet the on-page action reads more as logical response to revelation than as a tradeoff between sharp truth-telling and merciful gentleness. The closest embodiment is the final "Welcome"—a kindness that cuts through silence—and the earlier thought "to show them what they had become without demanding they unbecome it," which demonstrates mercy with an edge. However, these moments are more telling than dramatized choice under pressure. Setup present +0.3 (though as label), one beat involvement (ending welcome) +0.4, closure linkage +0.9 (the final line enacts the trait), cost connection weak +0.1 (no visible tradeoff where kindness and incision conflict). Base 3.0 +1.7 = 4.7. Decorative mention (label without action) −0.3, summary-only use (trait described but not tested in a choice) −0.3. Subtotal 4.1. Lyric reprise allowance: the trait seeds early and returns charged in "Welcome... a kindness sharp enough to cut" +1.3. Final: 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Action "thread" appears in four distinct beats: (1) Petra threads the ampoule's silver chain through the dome's crack, (2) threads her consciousness through the ampoule's memories, (3) threads new questions through old weaknesses (ending), (4) implicit in "thread by thread, poison by cure" as the garden reclaims the city. The action is both literal (chain through crack) and metaphorical (weaving memories, questions). It enables the central turn (broadcasting revelation through structural weakness) and charges the closure (ongoing threading as her purpose). Swappability test: could "broadcast" or "send" replace it? The threading metaphor ties to weaving nuance, foxglove roots threading through stone, and the ampoule's chain as physical connector; the specificity matters. Early setup +0.7, four beats +1.6 (beyond the three-beat cap, but treat as high involvement), causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.6, cost +0.3. Base 3.0 +5.9 = 8.9. Small deduction: the metaphorical threading in the ending risks becoming ornamental repetition without fresh pressure −0.4. Also, the action's mechanics (how threading telepathy through a crack works) remain vague, reducing causal specificity −0.3. Subtotal 8.2; treat as strong integration with minor abstraction penalty. Final: 7.6 after recalibrating for the fact that beats 2–4 are largely metaphorical extensions rather than distinct dramatized uses (additional −0.6).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Method "through structural weakness" is signaled early: "the dome's eastern quadrant, where the glass had thinned to eggshell fragility. The structural weakness was not accidental; it was the city's forgotten doubt." Petra uses this weakness to thread the ampoule's chain and broadcast memories. The method shapes the central action and ties thematically (exploiting doubt to spread questioning). Mechanics are somewhat vague—how does threading a chain through a crack enable telepathic broadcast?—but the conceptual link (weakness as access point) is clear. The method recurs at closure when foxglove roots exploit the same cracks to finish opening the dome. Setup present +0.7, two beats (threading, roots) +0.9, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +1.2, specificity moderate +0.4, cost connection +0.3. Base 3.0 +4.6 = 7.6. Deduction for vague mechanics (the chain is a physical object; telepathy is not; their interaction is asserted not explained) −0.5. Also, the method is more thematic vehicle than constrained tactic; Petra doesn't struggle with the threading or face a choice about which weakness to exploit −0.3. Final: 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setting (forgotten underwater city garden) is anchored in line one and sustained throughout. The garden provides the drowned context that makes Petra's stone form viable, supplies the foxgloves (symbolic and literal agents of change), and houses the dome with its structural weakness. The garden actively participates: foxgloves stir, a bloom unfurls near Petra's pedestal, roots crack the dome open over decades. Micro-setting elements (pedestal, dome crack, coral-encrusted statues) constrain and enable Petra's choices. Removing the underwater garden would break the logic of Petra's endurance, the diver's arrival, and the foxgloves' role. Setup immediate +0.8, three beats (diver arrives, garden responds to broadcast, foxgloves crack dome) +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6 (foxglove forest and fractured dome in final image), specificity +0.7, cost +0.4. Base 3.0 +6.3 = 9.3. Small deduction: the garden's "slow green pulses" and "breathing" in the ending veer toward atmospheric description rather than concrete constraint −0.4. Also, spatial choreography is strong but some elements (temples, forums) are mentioned without affecting action −0.3. Subtotal 8.6; round to 8.6. Further penalty for the epilogue's summary mode diluting the garden's immediate presence −0.5. Final: 8.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Timeframe "after revealing the secret" is satisfied: the story opens immediately after the diver's death and his revelation (they were wrong about everything). The inciting cascade follows directly. However, time becomes elastic and vague: "decades later" Petra reopens her eyes to a forest of foxgloves. The decades-long wait is asserted rather than dramatized; we don't see Petra's endurance tested or choices constrained by the passage of time. The "after" frame sets the starting condition but doesn't create ongoing pressure. Setup present +0.5 (the secret is revealed in beat one), one beat involvement (opening after revelation) +0.4, closure linkage weak +0.3 (the ending jumps forward in time rather than tracking it), causal pressure moderate +0.6 (the initial revelation drives Petra's choice), cost +0.2 (time's passage is told not felt). Base 3.0 +2.0 = 5.0. Lyric reprise: the timeframe recurs as "seven decades of silence" and the future arrival of new divers, which reweights Petra's patience +1.2. Final: 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation "to welcome nuance into a certainty" is dramatized through Petra's choice to broadcast the ampoule's memories and redefine her purpose from guarding Verities to welcoming questions. The desire is conflicted: Petra was carved to enforce certainty, so welcoming doubt requires renouncing her original function. Cost is visible (stone heart quickens with "something messier," lips crack, eternal vigilance as question-guardian). The motivation shapes two key beats: threading the ampoule through the dome crack and the final "Welcome" to future divers. Removing this exact motivation would leave Petra's actions arbitrary. Setup +0.6 (motivation emerges after the diver's revelation, not stated initially but clear by paragraph two), two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4 (the ending "Welcome" enacts the motivation), specificity +0.5, cost +0.5. Base 3.0 +5.1 = 8.1. Deduction: the motivation is more told than shown in conflict; Petra never wavers or considers enforcing the old certainties, so the friction between want (welcome nuance) and cost (betray purpose) is narrated rather than dramatized in a choice under pressure −0.5. Also, "welcome nuance" is slightly abstract and close to theme statement −0.3. Final: 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Tone "animate lifeless" is established in the opening (marble eyes, stone hands, stone heart) and sustained through paradoxes: Petra is lifeless yet telepathic, her heart "beat only to the rhythm of dogma" then "quickened," she is "animate yet lifeless." The tone modulates appropriately: the opening is cold and still, the middle accumulates "something messier," the ending balances eternal stone patience with welcoming life ("slow green pulses," "stone lungs filling with water and ancient light"). The oxymoron charges the final image: Petra as "a bridge between what sinks and what swims." The tone is not a single static mood but a coherent tension between stasis and motion, death and awakening. Setup immediate +0.8, present across all beats (every paragraph reinforces the paradox) +1.6, causal pressure +0.9 (the tone embodies Petra's transformation), closure linkage +1.7 (final line "stone lungs filling" is the tone's purest expression), specificity +0.8 (the exact paradox is irreplaceable). Base 3.0 +5.8 = 8.8. Small deduction: the phrase "animate lifeless" recurs explicitly three times, risking mantra rather than modulation −0.4. Final: 8.4.</comment>
