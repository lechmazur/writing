<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to build intergenerational support is clearly stated but rarely tested through on-page contradictory impulses. The boy and grandmother appear but function more as emblematic figures than sources of pressure on Mara's choices. Interiority defaults to label-only feelings ("quiet declaration," "gentle persistence") without embodied tension. The final vow to "keep ringing, to keep listening, to keep building" reads as assertion rather than a choice earned by prior dramatic conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural (ritual, stories, bell returning across beats), but the closure lacks a decisive image that reweights prior material with visible cost. Orientation Test: who/where/when anchor by ~120 words is present (arbor, ridge, exile community, midnight). The ending disperses into summarized future nights and a declarative vow without a final beat that makes before/after legible. Cost proof test fails: no exact on-page sentence shows a felt price at the closure moment—only thematic assertion. Apply −0.6 for missing cost proof and −0.4 for closure that summarizes rather than dramatizes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor is anchored early and hosts all action; the silver bell is handled across beats. The storm sequence briefly shows environment constraining movement. However, the ridge and arbor remain descriptive backdrops rather than pressuring choices—spatial choreography is clear but the setting does not force a tactical shift or charge the final image. Sensory selection defaults to visual moonlight and generic weather without POV-filtered urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (intergenerational support) is signaled early but remains abstract; no on-page choice forces Mara to trade one good for another. The midnight food runs continue without obstacle, the story-night succeeds immediately, and the community responds "with quiet enthusiasm" without friction. The storm sequence offers a reversal opportunity but is resolved off-page ("soaked but safe"). No tightening narrows options; escalation reads as thematic intensification rather than rising cost under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme (memory as survival, intergenerational bridge) emerges from repeated motifs—bell, stories, anonymous donations—but the ending articulates rather than enacts: "legacy of the silver bell would outlast the sanctions" is thesis statement, not resonant image. The final paragraph's declarative vow ("whispered a vow to keep ringing") replaces scene pressure with thematic summary. Subtext is thin; dialogue and gesture rarely carry implication beyond their surface content. Apply −0.5 for final-paragraph theme statement that replaces dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV on Mara is stable with no head-hopping. Voice carries a consistent lyric-declarative register ("gently persistent force, a whisper among the weary") but syntactic patterns recur: "The bell would chime," "The community listened," "The antique silver bell seemed to…" across multiple beats. Perceptual signature is generic (moonlight, flicker of lantern) without Mara-specific bias. Dialogue is minimal and functional; the grandmother's tale is summarized rather than voiced. Psychic distance remains steady but offers little modulation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "The bell's chime… the bell's tone… the bell's gentle chime"; "quiet declaration… quiet resolve… quiet pride"; "gently persistent" recurs without variation. Template cadence in multiple paragraphs: "The [noun] would [verb]" and "Mara [verb], her [noun] a [metaphor]" across six beats. Figurative language stacks without pattern-teaching: "heartbeat," "beacon," "canvas," "threads weaving through hearts" in close proximity. Apply −0.8 for loops and template stems; −0.4 for figurative density without payoff. Information density is low—many sentences restate thematic claims rather than advance situation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise (exile community sustains itself through ritual and story) follows a familiar resilience-under-oppression template without a transforming angle. The bell as symbol and the intergenerational-bridge theme are executed earnestly but without friction or surprise. Mara's "gentle persistence" and the community's unanimous cooperation avoid bold, specific choices that would risk failure. The sanctions backdrop remains abstract; no detail of scarcity or enforcement pressures tactics. Transformation test: plot and arc function identically with different props and setting.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mara (exile community leader) is present throughout and initiates the story-night, but her choices do not create key turns—she proposes, the community accepts without conflict. Setup present; middle development is declarative; closure participation is a summarized vow rather than a dramatized decision. Functional but decisions do not narrow options or reveal cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The antique silver bell appears in beats across the story: hangs in the arbor (setup), chimes to signal the food run (middle), chimes again to close the story night, guides volunteers in the storm, and is polished by rain. Setup, development (guides in storm), and closure (final image "seemed to hum with promise") all present. However, its function remains largely symbolic—it signals but does not constrain choice. Charged reprise qualifies for lyric-resonance allowance, lifting the score to mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Anonymous donations (core concept) are declared in the opening and frame the food runs, but the mechanism is never tested—no scene shows a donor's choice, the cost of giving, or tension around anonymity. The concept shapes the premise but does not alter on-page tactics or force a dilemma. Present by implication but not dramatized; functional setup without middle pressure or closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Gently persistent" (attribute) is used as a label three times but never constrains an on-page action with visible tradeoff. Mara's persistence succeeds without friction; no moment shows gentle approach failing or costing her a faster, harsher option. Label-only trait without dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Declare" (action) appears twice: Mara declares the story-night initiative and later declares the Bell of Memory festival. Setup and middle beats both hinge on this action. However, no turn results from declaration—community accepts without conflict, and the closure does not trace to a declaration moment. Shapes two beats but does not redefine options or force a reversal.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Through midnight food runs" (method) is signaled early, shown on-page (volunteers unload bundles), and the storm sequence involves guiding volunteers home. Setup, middle involvement (storm), and thematic closure presence all met. However, the mechanics do not create friction or test Mara's choices; the runs succeed each time. Functional across beats but does not constrain tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Terra-cotta arbor on the ridge (setting) is anchored early, hosts all action, and appears in the final image. Setup, middle (hosts gatherings), and closure participation all present. The storm briefly tests the space, but the arbor does not alter choices—it remains a backdrop. Three-gate presence lifts score above mid-band, but postcard use without tactical constraint limits it to low-5s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"During a sanctions period" (timeframe) frames the premise and is mentioned across beats ("five years of sanctions," "sanctions persisted," "outlast the sanctions"). Setup present; thematic echo throughout; closure references it. However, sanctions never tighten on-page—no scene shows scarcity forcing a choice or enforcement threatening the runs. Vague backdrop without tactical pressure; introduced early but does not alter moves, capping at 4.6 per missing development gate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To build intergenerational support" (motivation) is stated early, drives Mara's story-night proposal (middle beat), and the ending claims success. Setup, development, and closure all present. Yet the motivation is told rather than tested through conflicting wants or costs—no scene shows elders resisting, youth indifferent, or Mara sacrificing another need. Present across structure but friction between want and cost is absent, limiting to high-5s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Amplified quiet" (tone) is sustained through diction ("whisper," "quiet resolve," "shared silence") and coheres across beats. The tone modulates slightly during the storm but returns to the same register. Setup and development present; closure attempts to charge the final image ("whispered a vow") but the effect is static rather than intensifying. Coherent throughout but single-note mood without dynamic shift under pressure, placing in mid-5s.</comment>
