<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared early but her choices feel summarized rather than dramatized under pressure. The retro-cognitive trap operates as a vivid label, yet interior contradiction remains abstract—"sand in her sheets" is an evocative image but her moment-to-moment struggle reads as exposition. The Under-Minister's shift from adversary to ally happens off-camera ("He flinched, recognizing...") without on-page friction that would show contradictory impulses. Maria's memory fragments are told, not inhabited, flattening what could be a layered internal conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The story opens with adequate spatial and temporal anchors (zeppelin library, post-discovery), satisfying the Orientation Test. The causal lens is taught: diary → cipher → beach debris → translation → parley → joint disclosure. However, the key turn (the Under-Minister's recognition and agreement) is summarized in two sentences without on-page negotiation or visible cost at the moment of reversal. The final "truth released" moment lands as a summary of consequence rather than a dramatized Decisive Change; we're told the broadcast "would soon" happen and Elara "finally slept," but the cost remains abstract and deferred rather than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The floating zeppelin library is a vivid anchor, and the coastal dunes return as a spatial motif. The beach debris (shells, driftwood, coral) constrains Elara's translation work and she physically arranges them in the parley scene, pressing the Under-Minister with tactile evidence. The obsidian lagoon beneath the dunes is referenced repeatedly but remains offstage, a memory-space rather than a site that shapes on-page action. Spatial choreography in the map room is clean, and the zeppelin's drift south at the end offers a purposeful closing image, though the setting functions more as backdrop than active constraint through most beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decode the diary and release suppressed testimony—is signaled early and pursued across beats. Elara's retro-cognitive suffering accumulates pressure, and the parley introduces external opposition. However, the escalation is summary-driven: "truth in tension" is declared but the friction between disclosure and fragile peace is resolved off-page when the Under-Minister "agreed." The final revelation (weapons drowned, bodies burned) shifts the historical record, but the cost to Elara—her sleep restored, the reverie quieted—reads as relief rather than a trade-off that forecloses a path. The story gestures toward a meaningful tightening but does not dramatize a visible price at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of contested memory and institutional erasure emerges organically from the encrypted diary and beach-debris testimony. "Truth in tension" recurs as a phrase, bordering on direct statement, but the story earns thematic weight through the specifics of the Dunes Massacre cipher and the dual motivations (Elara's archival duty, the Under-Minister's inherited silence). The final image—descendants recognizing grandparents' symbols—offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing. However, the resolution feels tidy: the parley concludes, the truth is broadcast, and all parties find peace, reducing the moral complexity to a "both sides had secrets" symmetry that flattens the ethical stakes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The POV remains stable third-person limited on Elara throughout, with no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and literary ("searing reverie," "retrocognitively trapped," "time-capsule accusation"), consistent with an archival voice but occasionally edging into abstraction. The dialogue in the parley—"These people were terrorists" / silent counter-arrangement—is economical and subtext-driven. Perceptual signature is present (Elara notices symbols, beach debris, photographs) but does not modulate distinctly under stress. The phrase "retrocognitively trapped" and similar terms repeat as labels rather than varying through embodied perception, and the voice remains uniformly formal across emotional peaks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Information density is high, but the prose relies on template phrasing and paraphrase loops: "She had to parley… negotiate the terms" / "The cipher key wasn't mathematical but geographical" / "They knew the tide would erase… but the photograph might preserve." Sentences often restate the same idea in adjacent lines without added pressure. Stock metaphors ("bleeding into memories," "saltwater taste of survival") and elevated register ("calcified into myth," "archival peace") appear frequently without modulation. The final third accelerates but retains formulaic cadence ("The arrangement was complete: messages decoded, parley concluded, truth released"). Artifacts touch the closure beat ("her solemn duty fulfilled, and finally slept"), triggering the Q7 cap and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The premise—encrypted survivor testimony decoded via beach-debris cipher on a floating archive—is conceptually fresh. However, the execution leans on familiar templates: tortured archivist, repressed state memory, reluctant official turned ally, tidy joint disclosure. The emotional arc (tormented by visions → decode → parley → release → peace) follows a predictable path without transformation. The "obsidian lagoon" and "retro-cognitive trap" are evocative labels but do not generate non-obvious complications. The Under-Minister's sudden recognition and agreement resolve the central tension too cleanly, and the descendants' epiphany in the final line feels imposed rather than earned from prior particulars.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and makes choices (decode the diary, arrange the parley, propose joint disclosure), satisfying setup and middle development. However, her agency at closure is passive: she "prepared the final translation" and "closed the diary," actions that follow from the Under-Minister's agreement rather than forcing it. The key turn (his recognition and shift) is not driven by her on-page tactic but by his own grandfather's photographs, reducing her to witness. Her "solemn duty fulfilled" moment is summary rather than a decision that alters tactics or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon is mentioned early ("an obsidian lagoon beneath the dunes") and returns in multiple beats (retro-cognitive visions, Maria's memory, final revelation as burial pit for weapons). It supplies the story's central mystery—what was hidden there—and the climactic disclosure reweights its meaning from refuge to evidence site. However, it is never handled or visited on the page; all interaction occurs through memory and summary. Setup and payoff are present, but middle development is absent, and the element functions as backstory anchor rather than a constraint or resource that shapes present choices.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The encrypted diary frames the inciting action (post-discovery) and drives Elara's decryption work across beats. Its cipher is decoded through the beach-debris key, and the final entry's revelation (weapons drowned, not bodies) changes the historical record and enables the joint disclosure. The element appears in setup, middle (decryption attempts), and payoff (final translation), and its specificity (symbols matched to debris) matters. However, the actual decryption happens off-page between beats, reducing on-page causal pressure. The diary's role is essential but partially summarized rather than dramatized in key moments.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The retro-cognitive trap is introduced early ("her mind bleeding into memories") and recurs across beats (nightly drowning in final moments, becoming Maria, sand in her sheets despite the zeppelin's altitude). It imposes visible cost—Elara loses sleep and appetite, her "searing reverie burning away" health—and the constraint shapes her urgency to decode the diary. At closure, the reverie "quieted" when Maria's memories release their grip, offering relief as payoff. The trait constrains throughout and pays off, but the mechanics remain abstract (how does decoding free her?) and the final release is told rather than shown in a decisive moment.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The parley with the Under-Minister is signaled midway, occupies the map-room scene, and produces the key reversal (his agreement to joint disclosure). Setup and payoff are clear, and the action is specific to this conflict (cannot be swapped for a generic "negotiation"). However, the parley itself is compressed into a few lines: he declares the official position, she arranges debris as a counter-argument, he flinches and shifts stance. The turn happens off-camera (his recognition of his grandfather's role), reducing the parley's on-page causal weight. The element drives the resolution but is not fully dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The beach-debris messaging system is introduced early as the cipher key (shells = bodies, crossed sticks = betrayal) and functions in two distinct beats: Elara's weeks of matching photographs to diary margins, and her live demonstration before the Under-Minister ("Seven white pebbles, a crossed stick, three shells"). The method is specific, irreplaceable (the diary depends on this system), and its use in the parley forces the Under-Minister's recognition. Setup, middle (decryption work), and payoff (tactical demonstration) are all present, and the method's mechanics matter. The element is essential to causality and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The floating zeppelin library is established in the opening and anchors several spatial details (tilting gently, observation deck, reinforced windows, map room, Elara's quarters). It supplies atmosphere and marks the archive's remove from the coastal site. However, the setting does not constrain choices or supply resources that affect the outcome—the parley and decryption could occur in any secure location. The zeppelin's final drift south offers a closure image ("drifted south, its library of whispers no longer demanding") but this is ornamental rather than causal. Present throughout but functionally swappable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the letters are found" anchors the story post-discovery and implies urgency (sixty years since the massacre, Elara's predecessor died before completing translation, government pressure to classify). However, the timeline remains vague: "weeks" of decryption, "months" since the zeppelin touched ground, but no live clock that tightens decisions beat-by-beat. The element sets context but does not create immediate temporal pressure or shape tactics. Setup is present, middle and payoff are weak; time is a backdrop rather than a constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—to uncover truth in tension, letting the dead speak without reigniting violence—is declared early and recurs across beats. It drives her decryption work, her parley strategy (joint disclosure to balance truth and peace), and her final relief when the truth is released. The friction between truth and fragile peace is named explicitly and shapes the Under-Minister's initial resistance. However, the tension is asserted more than dramatized: Elara never faces a moment where she must choose between full disclosure and stability. The motivation is present throughout and shapes the ending, but the internal conflict remains abstract.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The tone of "searing reverie" is established through imagery (sand in sheets, drowning in memories, saltwater taste, burning away sleep) and recurs across Elara's retro-cognitive episodes. The elevated, somber register is consistent, and the reverie "quieted" at closure, offering tonal closure. However, the tone does not modulate meaningfully under pressure—Elara's voice remains uniformly formal and abstract in both calm and crisis beats. The searing quality is told through labels ("searing reverie," "archival peace") rather than shown through rhythm or diction shifts. Present and coherent, but static rather than charged by escalation.</comment>
