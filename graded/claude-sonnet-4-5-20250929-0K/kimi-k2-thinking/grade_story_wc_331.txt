<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The librarian remains a thematic vehicle rather than a person with embodied contradictions. Her twenty-year motivation is declared but never tested by a visible cost or competing desire on the page; the scarf-folding and portal-stepping read as fulfillment of an outline rather than a choice under pressure. The young man appears as atmospheric furniture; his solitude is told and his participation in the climax arrives without prior friction or stakes of his own. Internal conflict is absent—she wants the zeroth volume, executes the method, and succeeds without a dramatized mistake or renunciation that would earn the closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: by line ~15 we know "librarian" and "library," but the who/where/when anchor drifts in ornamental detail (scarf knots, astrophysical sonnets) without situating the present goal until much later. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (density of metaphor and image), but the closure—opening the zeroth volume and experiencing "raw déjà vu"—offers no legible cost or stance shift; the librarian reappears "pristine" with no path foreclosed. The reawakening completes without friction, and the final image ("stories never truly end—they only fold and refold") is abstract moralizing rather than a charged particular. Causality is loose: the scarf-as-map and hyperbolic-geometry method are introduced late and resolve the quest without prior obstacle or tradeoff, reading as convenient fulfillment rather than earned closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The scientific poetry library and hyperbolic-geometry shelves are vivid and specific, anchoring the voice in surreal detail. Spatial choreography (stacks, threshold, pedestal) is legible throughout. However, the setting remains decorative: the non-Euclidean architecture does not constrain a choice or force a tradeoff—it simply opens when the scarf is folded. The zeroth volume's chamber and "frozen sound waves" charge the atmosphere but do not alter tactics or cost. The library breathes and sighs in the final image, but the effect is metaphorical flourish rather than a pressure point tied to the protagonist's options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—locating the zeroth volume—is signaled early and pursued throughout, but pressure never tightens. No reversal or obstacle appears; the scarf method works on first attempt, the portal opens, and the volume "pulses" with no cost extracted. The young man's appearance beside her in the chamber is unexplained and does nothing to complicate her goal. Coincidence (scarf happens to be a map, shelves respond on cue) resolves rather than complicates. Closure is fulfillment without renunciation, mistake, or visible price: she "reappears pristine," the process will "begin again," and no path is foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>A coherent theme—recursion, the place where stories live—emerges from imagery (Möbius strip, Klein bottle, folding narratives). However, the final paragraph moralizes overtly: "stories never truly end—they only fold and refold" and "every patron was a librarian, every book a memory, and every equation a verse searching for its reader" replace scene pressure with abstract thesis. The scarf and zeroth volume accrue symbolic weight but the ending offers no non-literal answer rooted in character cost—only a decorative loop. Epiphany is declared ("she understood") rather than earned through a specific on-page choice or sacrifice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct lyric-surreal register (e.g., "event horizons marked by dog-eared corners," "frozen sound waves"). Psychic distance is consistent. However, perceptual signature is generic: the librarian notices metaphorical constructs (black holes of narrative, scarf humming with lullabies) in omniscient poetic voice rather than character-specific idiom. The young man's single line of dialogue reads functional but generic. Syntax and diction are controlled, but elevated register ("analog memories flooded the chamber," "photons dusted his corduroy") persists even in peak beats, flattening urgency. No head-hopping, and tense is stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Prose is ornate and imagistic throughout: nearly every sentence carries figurative freight ("black hole of narrative," "narrative gravitation," "recursion folding into loops"). Density without pattern-teaching or escalation dulls momentum rather than sharpening it. Template cadence: "She had discovered," "She began her method," "She opened it," "She resumed her post" stacks identical subject-verb openings across key beats. Paraphrase loops: "the place where stories live is not a location, but a recursion, each tale folding into the next" restates the premise rather than advancing it. Mixed register: "starlight and story," "photons dusted" elevate diction beyond the grounded present action. No line-level opacity prevents comprehension, but scaffold repetition and figurative over-layering create drag in high-pressure beats (portal, chamber, reawakening).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The scientific poetry library with hyperbolic geometry and a librarian questing for the "zeroth volume" offers a fresh synthesis of concept and setting. The scarf as Möbius map and the portal mechanism are inventive particulars. However, the emotional arc (librarian seeks, finds, succeeds without cost) is template fulfillment: no tradeoff, no mistake, no renunciation. The young man and the "reawakening" payoff arrive as convenient additions rather than transformations earned by prior causality. Proximity check: "place where stories live," "stories never truly end," and recursive-loop closures echo common meta-narrative tropes without a non-obvious stance. The piece commits to its surreal premise but retreats into abstraction at closure rather than grounding theme in a character-specific price.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The odd-hour librarian is present throughout and her goal (find the zeroth volume) drives the quest. However, her "choices" are outline steps (search, fold scarf, step through portal, open book) executed without friction or cost. Observation and atmospheric presence dominate; no on-page decision alters tactics or forecloses a path. Setup and development gates met, but closure participation is passive fulfillment. Swappable: any seeker archetype could execute the same beats. Penalize for summary-only involvement in the reawakening and ornamental presence in the final image.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tattered silk scarf appears in beat one (knotted three times, frayed ends marking decades), returns as a discovered map (stains = star charts), is used actively (folded into Möbius strip, then Klein bottle) to trigger the portal, and reappears at closure (now pristine, a constellation on the ceiling). Setup, development, and payoff gates all met. Causal pressure: the scarf method opens the threshold and its knots "release starlight" in the chamber. However, the scarf does not constrain a choice or extract a visible cost—its transformation from tattered to pristine is asserted rather than earned through sacrifice. Irreplaceability is moderate; a similar token could function with edits. Credit for beat involvement (three distinct uses) and closure linkage, but cap for lack of felt cost tied to its transformation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Analog memories are mentioned early ("stored in the very fabric of spacetime," "not on tapes or film") and return at closure ("raw weight of déjà vu, taste of unspoken words" flood the chamber; memories "rewoven into the narrative substrate"). Setup and payoff gates met, but middle development is absent—the concept does not constrain a tactic or enable a choice under pressure. It remains thematic decoration: a label for the library's metaphysical quality rather than a stake or mechanic that alters options. The librarian does not wrestle with how analog storage works or pay a cost to access it; she opens the book and memories "flood." Ornamental use and swappability (any memory-storage metaphor could substitute) lower the score. Late closure mention without causal work caps at ~2.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Sanely eccentric" is declared in paragraph one ("her sanely eccentric reputation was earned through conversations with bound volumes") but never constrains or enables an on-page action. The librarian's behavior (folding the scarf into impossible topologies, stepping through a portal, conversing with books) reads generically mystical rather than as a specific tradeoff between sanity and eccentricity. Label-only mention, no visible cost, no middle beat involvement. Setup gate met (mentioned early), but development and payoff gates missed. Swappable with "quirky" or "unconventional" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Reawaken" is the stated goal and climax action: the librarian "reawakens" the zeroth volume, which then "pulses" and causes "every scientific poetry text in the building to sigh in synchrony." Setup (motivation declared early), development (scarf method prepares the reawakening), and payoff (the reawakening completes on-page) gates all met. However, the action is summarized declaration ("The reawakening was complete") rather than dramatized struggle. No obstacle appears; the book simply "pulses" when opened. The reawakening does not redefine options or extract a visible cost—it succeeds on first attempt and the librarian "reappears pristine." Swappability is moderate: "activate," "unlock," or "restore" could replace "reawaken" with minor edits. Credit for goal centrality and closure presence, but cap for lack of dramatized friction or cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry is seeded early (patrons browsing "the hyperbolic geometry aisle—where shelves curved away from each other like the surface of a saddle") and returns as method: "through hyperbolic geometry, she understood" and "The hyperbolic geometry of the shelves responded, their curvature deepening." Setup and payoff gates met. The geometry is named as the lens of understanding at closure. However, the mechanics are opaque—how does folding the scarf into a Möbius strip invoke hyperbolic geometry? The method is asserted rather than taught; no failed attempt or constraint tied to the geometry's rules shapes tactics. It reads as thematic label rather than a mechanic with on-page cost. Swappable with "non-Euclidean logic" or "topology" without structural loss. Late first functional use (second half) and ornamental closure mention cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The scientific poetry library is introduced in the opening line and dominates every beat: hyperbolic shelves, astrophysical sonnets, event horizons marked by dog-eared corners, the threshold and chamber. Setup, development (the library's architecture "responds" to the scarf folding), and payoff (the chamber of the zeroth volume, the final image of "the scientific poetry library" with patrons unaware) gates all met. The setting supplies resources (scarf, shelves, portal) and the architecture "breathes" in coordination with the scarf. However, the library does not pressure a choice or impose a visible constraint—it facilitates the quest without cost. Spatial choreography is clear. Micro-setting (scarf, pedestal) charges the final image. Credit for beat involvement (present in all phases) and closure linkage, but moderate irreplaceability (a magical archive or museum could substitute with edits) and lack of on-page constraint lower the score into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "while patrons browse" is mentioned in the opening and final thirds but does not function as a clock or tighten decisions. Patrons are described as "browsing" at 3:17 AM in the opening and "continued browsing, unaware" at closure—no progression or urgency. The librarian's quest (search, fold, step, open, return) unfolds without time pressure; the portal and chamber sequence has no ticking constraint. Setup gate met (signaled early), but development and payoff gates missed—time does not alter tactics or charge the closure. Ornamental framing device. Swappable with "during the night shift" or "in the early hours" without impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the place where stories live" is stated early ("she searched for the place where stories live") and rephrased at closure ("the place where stories live is not a location, but a recursion"). Setup and payoff gates met. The motivation drives the quest structure: she searches, uses the scarf method, crosses the threshold, and reaches understanding. However, the desire is never conflicted—no competing want or cost tests her commitment. The librarian succeeds without renunciation or mistake. The motivation is told and pursued but not dramatized through friction between wants and prices. Middle development is weak: no beat where she hesitates or sacrifices to pursue the goal. Credit for goal centrality and closure linkage, but lack of on-page cost tied to the motivation and summary-only treatment lower the score to mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Observed solitude" appears throughout: "the only patrons were insomniacs and ghosts," the young man's "solitude palpable as the dust motes," "his solitude momentarily shared," "observed solitude of the scientific poetry library." Setup and payoff gates met; the tone is consistent. However, the tone is static—a single atmospheric register that does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image. Peak beats (portal, chamber, reawakening) maintain the same detached lyric distance as the opening. The closure image ("She adjusted the scarf...and waited for the next solitary seeker") reasserts rather than transforms the tone. No cadence shift or pressure intensification. Credit for coherence across beats, but lack of escalation or closure transformation caps the score in mid-4s.</comment>
