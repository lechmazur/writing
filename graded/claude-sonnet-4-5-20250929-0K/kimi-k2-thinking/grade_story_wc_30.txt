<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's internal contradiction—machine versus human, preservation versus destruction—is embodied through moon-phase fluctuation and sensor feedback, creating genuine tension. Her choice to refuse complete smelting demonstrates agency with cost (protocol violation, identity instability). However, the interiority relies heavily on abstract formulations ("contradiction as physical pressure," "quiet triumph of refusal") rather than moment-to-moment embodied choice under duress. The lunar migration mechanism remains more told than dramatized in its constraint on her decision-making.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. The piece accumulates density through the creel's journey from discovery to transmutation, building to a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis hybrid): Elara's refusal to fully smelt creates a new artifact category that preserves contradiction. Orientation anchors (titan-gear librarian, tidal atrium, post-tomorrow world) arrive cleanly in the opening. Cost is legible: she violates protocol, creates an unresolved artifact, and accepts perpetual migration rather than mechanical certainty. One meaningful deepening occurs when she places the creel on warming stones instead of in the feed-chute, reweighting her archival duty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tidal atrium functions as active constraint: flood cycles deliver artifacts, geothermal vents enable partial transmutation, pressure glass frames her watch. The creel (bamboo texture through sensors, river-reed smell) triggers the protocol contradiction and becomes the micro-setting object that charges the final image. Sensory detail is filtered through her brass exoskeleton and fluctuating identity. The "warming stones where tide and geothermal met" provides the exact environmental gradient that enables her compromise solution, directly shaping the closure choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserve wonder versus maintain archival order. Pressure coheres through the waning crescent phase pulling Elara toward mechanical precision while the creel's organic weave triggers human memory. The tightening occurs when she reaches the crucible: machine-logic demands dissolution, human fibers resist. Her compromise (half-heat gradient, creel on platform not in chute) is protagonist-driven and narrows future options—she creates an unresolved artifact category. Cost is felt: ongoing identity migration, protocol breach, and acceptance that "her work was futile and eternal." The escalation is modest but sufficient for this length under an accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the creel's woven patience versus the smelting crucible's erasure, bamboo darkening but not burning, data bleeding into reeds. The piece resists the tidy binary (human vs. machine) by showing Elara holding both simultaneously. "Preservation sometimes required loss, routine needed surprise to remain wonder" skirts direct statement but is earned by the prior transmutation sequence. The final image—creel pulsing with slow-dreaming memories, neither destroyed nor imprisoned—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Minor penalty: "Let them be fish" interior monologue in the final third edges toward theme summary rather than pure image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited through Elara's sensors and brass-filtered perception. Perceptual signature is consistent: "brass gears within her chest," "mechanical vision recording," "titan-gear librarian walked on." Psychic distance modulates purposefully at key beats (close during the crucible choice, slightly elevated during tidal rounds). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("temporal lacuna," "annular furnace," "metabolism instead of cremation") that feels imposed rather than voice-organic, particularly during high-pressure moments. The repeated sentence stems ("The creel remained," "Let them") and participial openers create mild template cadence in the final third.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines serve character, world, or pressure. Rhythm varies between short declaratives and longer accretive sentences that mirror accumulation. However, multiple paraphrase loops appear: "contradiction in her protocols she couldn't parse" / "feeling contradiction as physical pressure"; "neither data nor flesh" / "neither fully human nor entirely machine"; the "wintersun serenity" phrase repeats three times without reweighting. Template cadence runs in the final section ("Let them be fish... Let them breathe... Let them remind") accumulate to −0.6. Stock metaphors ("heart—such as it was," "walked on") and filter-verb stacks ("watched," "feeling," "seeing") in early beats dull immediacy. No critical opacity, but cumulative artifacts prevent higher bands.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The core synthesis—librarian as moon-governed cyborg navigating post-linear time through archival choices—feels specific and committed. The creel's transmutation via thermal gradient rather than binary destruction offers a non-obvious resolution. However, the "disappearing tomorrow" premise and "identity migration" concepts remain abstract; lived detail of what daily work looks like or how others experience the collapsed timeline is absent. The ending's wisdom ("wonder was in the changing, not in the capture") trends toward platitude. Proximity check: "titan-gear," "tidal memory," "drowned library" echo familiar SFF furnishings without full transformation through character-specific stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara's choice to open vents halfway and place the creel on warming stones rather than in the feed-chute creates the story's key turn. Her decision is constrained by waning crescent (mechanical pull) and enabled by human memory triggered by the creel. She appears in every beat and her fluctuating identity drives the escalation. The transmutation and her acceptance of perpetual migration form the closure. Cost is visible: protocol violation, artifact that will challenge her future self, ongoing identity instability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The creel appears in discovery (clattered against steps), handling (lifted with gauntleted hands, woven pattern read), crucible scene (placed on platform not in chute), transmutation (darkening on warming stones), and closure reprise (pulsing with soft light, teaching the next version). Its bamboo weave contrasts with brass/marble, triggers sensor contradiction, and becomes the story's central object—half-bamboo, half-crystal by the end. Removing it would collapse the plot. The "patience, waiting in stillness" pattern it tells directly informs Elara's choice to create a gradient rather than inferno.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Identity migration shapes Elara's tactics: waning crescent means mechanical precision dominates, pulling her toward protocol (smelt completely). The concept appears in her sensor fluctuation, the memory-crystals as trapped identities, and her realization that "she was never the same self from moment to moment." It enables her compromise (accept both machine and human) and charges the ending (future self under full moon will learn from the artifact). However, the migration is more asserted than dramatized—we don't see her abilities or perception shift on the page in response to lunar phase, only her internal claim of the effect.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Moon phase is mentioned three times: waning crescent "meant Elara's identity migrated toward the mechanical," the invisible morning moon "pulled at tidal waters beneath the atrium, and at brass gears within her chest, initiating migration," and future "full moon's mechanical clarity." It constrains her choice by intensifying machine-logic at the crucible, creating the friction that makes her refusal costly. However, the fluctuation is largely interior claim rather than demonstrated tradeoff—we don't see specific abilities she loses or gains, or how the next phase would alter her perception of the same problem. The attribute shapes her internal conflict but not her external tactics in a legible way.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Smelting is the story's central action: her duty is to "smelt such fragments into the Archive, rendering them into pure information, erasing messy humanity." The expectation structures the rising pressure, and her refusal to complete it creates the turn. She reaches the smelting crucible, "machine-logic calculated: dissolve the crystals," but instead "opened the crucible's vents only halfway," creating transmutation rather than erasure. The compromise action—partial heat, warming stones—produces the new artifact category. Her later reflection that "every time she smelts, she also creates, and every time she preserves, she also destroys" reweights the action at closure. Removing smelting would eliminate the story's mechanism and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The method is signaled early: Elara "couldn't parse into binary," "feeling contradiction as physical pressure." The creel's woven pattern models patience rather than binary resolution. At the crucible, "accepting contradictions meant acknowledging that preservation sometimes required loss, that routine needed surprise to remain wonder." She enacts the method by creating a thermal gradient instead of inferno, leaving the creel un-smelted but transformed. The final realization—"she must accept: her work was futile and eternal, mechanical and alive"—cements it. The method shapes her tactics (half-open vents, platform not chute) and provides the thematic answer. It could be more materially demonstrated in earlier choices, but it governs the climactic turn.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The tidal atrium is integral: tides deliver yesterday's artifacts at dawn and bring "tomorrow's absence" at dusk, creating the story's cycle. Geothermal vents heat the annular furnace, enabling smelting. The "warming stones where tide and geothermal met" provide the exact environmental resource Elara uses for her compromise. Cathedral windows frame her watch, pressure glass traces her reflection. The flooded chamber's "drowned library" and "sleeping archives" establish the post-tomorrow world's constraints. Spatial choreography is clear (archive steps, observation platform, feed-chute, crucible). Setting is causally active, not decorative.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The timeframe—"after tomorrow disappeared"—structures the world: "only today repeated, and yesterday's artifacts washed ashore in flood cycles." It creates the story's central constraint (no future to plan for, only perpetual present and recurring past) and justifies the archival mission. However, the disappeared-tomorrow functions more as premise than active pressure on this particular morning's choice. Elara's decision at the crucible is driven by moon phase and the creel's presence, not by a ticking clock or tomorrow's specific absence narrowing her window. The timeframe is setting-level constraint rather than a live escalator of this scene's urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The motivation is embodied throughout: Elara watches water retreat, feels "tidal memory" in her gears, and the creel "triggering a contradiction" demonstrates wonder versus routine in conflict. At the crucible, machine-logic demands "maintain routine wonder through perfect order," but human fibers remember "sunlight on skin," creating friction. Her choice to refuse complete smelting and accept "routine needed surprise to remain wonder" enacts the desire with cost—she violates protocol to preserve the creel's contradictory presence. The cataloging as "Preserved Impermanence" and her realization that "wonder was in the changing, not in the capture" close the loop. The motivation drives every key beat and is tested with visible stakes.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Wintersun serenity is invoked explicitly three times and modulates through the piece: "silver pools," "cathedral windows," "cold light warmed the flooded chamber," "cold that was also warmth, wintersun's gift." The tone coheres as contemplative calm over mounting internal friction—never frantic, always measured. It supports the accumulative lens and charges the ending: "under wintersun's witness, Elara continued her migration." However, the phrase "wintersun serenity" itself appears as a label rather than emerging purely from sensory anchors. The serenity remains consistent but somewhat static; pressure rises without tonal shift until the final reflective section, where the tone of acceptance deepens the serenity rather than breaking it. The tone serves closure but doesn't dynamically modulate with escalation.</comment>
