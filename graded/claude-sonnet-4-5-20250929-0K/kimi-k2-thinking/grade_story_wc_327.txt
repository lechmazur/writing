<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The copper-veined storyteller's motivation is clear and her interior state is visible through sensory markers ("copper pathways," "verdigris"), but crucial choices lack embodied contradiction. The decision to use spinebirds' flight patterns arrives without dramatized hesitation or competing impulse; she "understood" and "closed her eyes" in a straight line. The ending's acceptance of failure reads as summary rather than a lived renunciation with visible cost in the moment. "Quietly articulate" appears as label more than constraint shaping her tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a lyric pattern early (nested images, mythic diction) and sustains it. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing: the diamond continues singing "a voice without need of ears," reweighting the storyteller's failure into persistence beyond meaning. Cost is conceptual and legible—the language dies completely, she exhausts herself, yet the translation endures. Orientation anchors appear late (~15% for "canyon of endless echoes," ~20% for bone tower context). One meaningful deepening occurs when the spinebirds' geometry is mapped onto the diamond's curse, tightening the translation attempt. The lens holds, but the late anchoring and the summary-heavy final third (years passing, travelers reporting, her death recounted) dilute immediacy at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The bone towers, canyon, and tunnel are vivid and mythically coherent. The tunnel's "throat of polished calcium" and "fossilized thunder" create sensory texture filtered through the storyteller's copper resonance. However, the setting primarily serves as backdrop; spatial choices do not constrain tactics. The diamond is pressed to the wall, but no alternative surface or access problem shapes the attempt. The spinebirds' flight is observed from a distance without proximity or wind affecting her stance. Micro-setting (her body, the copper veins) charges perception but does not alter a key choice on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—translate the diamond's texture into sound before the language vanishes—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when she realizes motion (spinebirds) can become syntax, narrowing her approach. The mapping of avian patterns onto the diamond is a protagonist-driven turn under the Accumulative lens. Cost is stated ("the language had died completely now") but remains abstract; we do not see a specific forfeited option or live consequence that alters her final tactics. The summary of her death and the diamond's endless song dilutes the on-page price at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme—persistence beyond meaning, translation as monument—emerges from concrete images (diamond singing to itself, "voice without need of ears") and the accretion of material: copper oxidizing, echoes keeping counsel, spinebirds as living alphabet. The final image reweights the storyteller's failure into a self-sustaining memorial without overt thesis statement. However, the line "some languages die so completely they cannot be mourned" borders on explicit theme claim, and "the gift of persistence beyond meaning" in the final third edges toward articulation rather than inference. The resonance is real but slightly over-helped.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a lyric, elevated register ("copper-veined," "articulate," "verdigris and dust") that matches the mythic setting. Perceptual signature is consistent: sensory details filter through texture and resonance metaphors. However, diction stays uniformly heightened without modulation under peak pressure—the moment she channels the spinebirds' syntax reads at the same register as earlier exposition. No dialogue. Filter verbs ("saw how," "understood") appear but remain voice-coherent within the lyric mode. The voice is distinct but does not degrade or sharpen when the translation attempt climaxes.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm and imagery are controlled; sentences vary in length and the lyric parallelism ("a voice like…," "a story that…") creates intended cadence. Information density is high in the first half. However, the final third accumulates paraphrase loops: "the curse was broken, not by removal, but by fulfillment" followed by "meaning persisted" and "she had given texture a voice, and the echo had accepted the gift" restate closure without added pressure. Template cadence: "The spinebirds still flew… The curse had been a gift… The canyon of endless echoes…" across adjacent lines. Minor figurative muddle: "echoes kept its own counsel" mixes metaphor of counsel with echo. Apply −0.6 for loops and template stems in the closure third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of embodied language (copper veins as conduits), translation via living geometry (spinebirds), and the conceptual repricing of failure into self-sustaining monument is specific and non-obvious. The piece commits to its mythic frame and follows through. However, the storyteller-translator premise and the "lost language" arc are well-worn; transformation arises more from the copper/diamond/bird triad than from fresh emotional calculus. The final image (diamond singing endlessly to itself) is resonant but the path there—solitary figure, failed quest, posthumous vindication—follows a familiar template. Risk-taking in structure (lyric compression) is present but does not radically heighten stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The copper-veined storyteller is present throughout and her choices (climbing the tower, pressing the diamond, channeling the spinebirds) drive beats. However, most action occurs in summary ("she closed her eyes and extended her consciousness") rather than dramatized decision with visible hesitation. The final acceptance of failure is recounted, not enacted. She appears in the closure (her death and the diamond's persistence) but as passive subject. Two gates met (setup, closure participation); Development is summary-only. Causal pressure is moderate; the spinebird insight narrows her method but does not foreclose a prior path with on-page cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The flawed diamond is introduced early (~10%) with its curse described. It is pressed to the tunnel wall (one beat) and then sings at closure, its internal fracture now voiced. Two beats (press, final song); closure participation is strong—the diamond's endless recitation is the story's final image. However, the diamond does not constrain a choice; its curse is backdrop, and the storyteller does not struggle with its properties on the page. The "curse was not malice but memory" is told, not discovered through handling. Setup and Payoff gates met; Development is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The tunnel of echoes is introduced early and used as the physical site where the storyteller channels the spinebirds' syntax into the diamond. It amplifies the translation ("its walls trembling") in one beat. At closure, the tunnel falls silent after her death, then the diamond continues within it. Two gates: setup and closure framing. The tunnel does not constrain her tactics—she could have performed the translation elsewhere—but its acoustic property (amplification) is functional. Development beat is weak; the tunnel is setting more than active concept.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Quietly articulate" appears twice as label ("quietly articulate in her observation," "quietly articulate in her failure") but does not enable or constrain an on-page action. The attribute describes her manner rather than shaping a choice or tradeoff. No gate is met; it is decorative characterization without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Harness" appears in the action beat where she channels the spinebirds' flight pattern into the diamond ("she channeled this avian syntax into the diamond"). This is the story's major turn—the method by which she attempts the translation. One distinct beat; the action is functional and advances the stake. However, the mechanics are summarized ("extended her consciousness through the copper threads") rather than dramatized with physical or mental cost. Setup is late (~60%); closure references the act's result but does not depict harnessing again. Two gates: middle development and indirect closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The spinebirds' flight patterns are observed (~55%), and their formation is explicitly used as the translation method: "their formation translated wind resistance into geometry" and "each turn a consonant, each swoop a vowel." This is the story's central mechanism. One substantial beat where the method is applied. At closure, the spinebirds "still flew, and their patterns still meant something," a lyric reprise. Setup is late; Development is strong (the method enables the peak action); Payoff is thematic echo rather than causal reuse. Two gates; method is functional but introduced past midpoint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The towers of bone and canyon of endless echoes frame the entire story. The storyteller climbs the tower (setup), performs the translation at its summit (development site), and the towers "stood witness" at closure. The bone tower provides the tunnel, which amplifies the attempt. However, the setting does not constrain her choices—no blocked access, no resource scarcity tied to the towers. It is atmospheric and consistent but does not alter tactics. Three gates met (setup, site, closure frame); causal pressure is low. The setting charges the final image (towers listening, canyon understanding nothing) with thematic weight.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "across the death of a language" is stated early and tracked: "three speakers left, then two, then one." The language dies completely during the translation attempt, which imposes conceptual urgency. After closure, "years" pass in summary. The time pressure is abstract—no live countdown forces a tactical shift on the page. The storyteller's death and the diamond's persistence occur "in the years that followed," diffusing the clock. Setup gate met; Development is conceptual rather than tactical; Closure spans an indefinite post-death period. Time shapes theme more than choice.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to translate texture into sound" is stated early and drives the entire arc. The storyteller seeks to "give the stone's grief a voice," presses the diamond to the wall, and channels the spinebirds' patterns to achieve this. Multiple beats center on the goal. At closure, the translation succeeds materially (the diamond sings) but fails communicatively (no one understands). The motivation is clear and sustained. However, it is never conflicted—no competing desire or doubt dramatized on the page. The line "her motivation, quiet and consuming" tells rather than showing friction. Three gates; causal work is strong but lacks embodied cost or tradeoff in the moment of choice.</comment>
