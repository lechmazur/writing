<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is stated ("sculpt patience from impatience") but her interior contradiction never dramatizes competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The "restrained wildness" and "caged urgency" are labeled rather than embodied through contradictory micro-choices under pressure. The final action—sending pulses—reads as competent execution without visible internal cost or genuine struggle that would make the revolution feel earned by her agency. No secondary character applies immediate pressure, leaving the stakes abstract.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of moon-path imagery and patient-revolution rhetoric builds toward the viaduct pulse. However, closure relies on a late-breaking magnetic surge that disables the tyrant's network—a convenience not earned by prior causal pressure; the tyrant and enforcers are mentioned but never constrain Elara's choices on the page. The "unyoke" moment lands as conceptual repricing (people feel mental quiet), but the cost is told, not shown through a visible forfeiture or trade-off in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct are vividly established and sensory detail is filtered through Elara's professional lens (pressure ridges, lunar azimuth, magnetic flux). The viaduct's polarity shift after rain is specific and purposeful. However, spatial choreography during the climax—Elara on the ice, lights flickering on the far shore, enforcers on the viaduct who "fear the ice"—remains abstract; the enforcers' position and threat never materially constrain her movement or choice, reducing the setting's pressure at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—freeing the community from the tyrant's manufactured urgency—is signaled early but remains abstract; the tyrant and enforcers never appear on the page to apply direct pressure or force a trade-off. Elara's pulse transmission faces no meaningful resistance or complication; "they feared the ice" tells us a problem was avoided rather than dramatizing one overcome. The revolution "releases" without visible cost to Elara's tactics, resources, or safety. No reversal or tightening narrows her options under the chosen Accumulative lens; escalation is rhetorical accumulation of moon-path metaphors rather than rising stakes that alter her agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The patient-revolution theme emerges through recurring images of restraint, moon paths, and the viaduct's polarity. However, the final paragraph explicitly states the theme: "wildness restrained was not wildness diminished, but wildness refined into its most purposeful form"—a direct thesis that replaces earned resonance. The "horizons of possibility" and "unyoke" motifs recur but do not constrain choice or accumulate pressure toward a non-literal final image; instead, the ending tells us Elara "saw... the outline of every future she had helped to free," an abstract assertion rather than a concrete, charged reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("vigilant horizon mapper," "restrained wildness," "lunar azimuth"), creating a distinct perceptual signature. However, several lines drift into expository telling that paraphrases rather than advancing interiority: "Her restraint was a wildness held in check, a river dammed until its power could reshape stone" explains the metaphor instead of trusting the image. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she watched") are present but not excessive. The prose maintains narrative distance and voice coherence under pressure, though sentence stems repeat ("She had," "The," "Elara") across multiple paragraphs without purposeful variation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear throughout: "unyoke" and "unyoking" recur eight times without added pressure; "patient revolution" appears four times with minimal variation. Template cadence is evident in repeated "She [verb]" and "The [noun]" openings across consecutive paragraphs. Mixed metaphors: "restrained wildness" as "a river dammed until its power could reshape stone" conflates fluidity with geological force unconvincingly. "Horizons of possibility" and "sky's hunger met the ice's silence" pile figurative language densely in early beats without pattern-teaching or payoff. The closing image—"the outline of every future she had helped to free"—is abstract rather than concrete, dulling closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—patient revolution via magnetic viaduct pulses disrupting a tyrant's network—combines speculative elements (magnetic polarity shifts, moon-path prediction) with a resistance narrative, but the core arc (lone expert uses hidden knowledge to free oppressed community) follows a familiar template without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The tyrant remains abstract; no specific cost or trade-off personalizes Elara's victory. "Sculpting patience from impatience" and "unyoke" are thematic labels rather than fresh synthesis. The viaduct's mechanics and the moon-path method are asserted but not developed with verifiable or surprising specificity that would make them irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara appears throughout and her role (horizon mapper tracking moon paths) frames the narrative. However, her choices are execution of a pre-established plan rather than adaptive decisions under pressure. She checks calculations, waits for alignment, sends pulses—competent moves that do not create key turns or force trade-offs. The enforcers' fear and the community's readiness are told, not tested by her agency. Present and functional, but swappable with a generic "expert protagonist" archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The magnetic viaduct appears in setup (established after rain, polarity shifts), middle (Elara calibrates sensors at dusk, tracks its hum), and closure (she sends pulses through it to disable the tyrant's network). Its unique property—polarity shift mapping intention—enables the climactic action. However, the viaduct's mechanics are asserted rather than dramatized; we are told it becomes "a compass for... intention" but never see this constrain or complicate Elara's use. The final surge is convenient rather than costly. Essential across beats but lacks specificity that would make removal catastrophic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Patient revolution" is named repeatedly and structures the thematic arc: Elara teaches the community to wait through seventeen lunar cycles, rejecting the tyrant's "manufactured crisis." This shapes the dominant stake (timing the uprising) and appears in closure ("The revolution did not explode. It simply... released"). However, the concept is told via reflection and thematic statements rather than tested through on-page choices with visible cost. The waiting itself is summarized; no scene dramatizes Elara or the community resisting an urgent temptation. Present in setup, middle reflection, and ending rhetoric, but not embodied in pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Softly purposeful" is attributed to Elara's movements and her transmitter design ("each circuit placed with meditative care"). It colors tone but does not constrain or enable a specific action with visible cost. The trait is asserted rather than demonstrated through a trade-off—e.g., slowness risking discovery, or deliberate calm preventing a mistake under pressure. Functional description, but swappable with "careful" or "deliberate" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Unyoke" appears eight times and anchors the thematic turn: the community is "unyoking their desires from the tyrant's artificial urgency" and at closure "they were ready to unyoke." The final beat—disabling the tyrant's communication yoke—literalizes the metaphor. However, the action is rhetorical repetition more than causal mechanism; we never see the yoke constrain choice or the unyoking cost anything. Early signal, thematic reprise at closure, but the metaphor does not redefine options through dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Moon-path tracking is established early (Elara has tracked lunar arcs for three winters, cross-references azimuth with magnetic flux) and appears in the climactic timing: "When the moon reached the predetermined altitude, she sent the final pulse." The method shapes the waiting period and the precise moment of action. However, the mechanics are told rather than shown creating friction; no scene dramatizes a miscalculation or near-miss that the moon-path method helps avoid. Signaled, shapes the attempt, present at closure, but lacks costly application.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary anchors Elara's location and recurs as a visual marker ("rose behind her," "stood solid behind her," "walked back toward"). The frozen lake provides the stage for the climactic walk and ice-borne pulse transmission. However, neither setting materially constrains choice; the ice is "prepared" without obstacle, and the sanctuary functions as backdrop rather than resource or pressure point. The viaduct and ice are more integral. Visible in setup and closure framing, but postcard description dominates over tactical use.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the lake froze over" anchors the world's quiet and Elara's three-winter observation period. The narrative present occurs during one specific night when "the moon's path would cross the viaduct's apex at precisely eleven degrees," and Elara counts "seventeen lunar cycles" of community waiting. However, no live clock tightens the climactic scene; Elara waits for alignment without visible pressure from patrolling enforcers or environmental threat. Time is tracked but does not alter tactics or force trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The motivation—"to sculpt patience from impatience"—is explicitly stated and frames Elara's backstory: "She had come here to... unyoke herself from the desperate need to act before understanding." It recurs at closure ("She had sculpted patience from impatience"). However, the desire is told via reflection rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses in scene. We never see Elara wrestle with impatience under pressure or pay a cost for restraint; her moves are calm execution. Told-only friction without on-page embodiment.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Restrained wildness" is named explicitly ("her own caged urgency," "a wildness held in check") and modulates through the narrative: early restraint, the viaduct's "low thrum," and the final image where "wildness restrained was not wildness diminished, but wildness refined." Tone is coherent and charges the thematic close. However, the articulation is abstract label rather than embodied rhythm; sentence-level syntax remains controlled and elevated throughout without degrading under stress or releasing into wildness at closure. Tone asserted more than enacted in prose texture.</comment>
