<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias remains a cipher whose interiority is told through abstract metaphor rather than embodied contradiction. The woman who left him is summarized rather than felt; his grief operates as poetic assertion ("echo of lost songs") without micro-choices that test competing impulses. The ledger rewriting and pigeon trust are mentioned repeatedly but never constrain a present decision with visible cost. Emotional progression is smooth and declarative, lacking the irrational layering that would earn the final smile.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: dust-mote patterns and meteorite warmth recur, and the final pigeon release with ledger closure offers Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise). Orientation anchors late—Elias's role and the woman's disappearance emerge past the 20% mark—but the attic frame holds. Cost is atmospheric rather than legible: the "fragile trust" and "promise" are asserted, not demonstrated through a foreclosed path. One meaningful deepening occurs (the customer's matching tune), but causality remains associative rather than because/therefore.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The attic—skylight, beam, dust—constrains Elias's physical stance and charges the recurring dust-map motif. Sensory hierarchy (old paper, rain, creaking boards) reflects his retrospective focus. The meteorite chip's warmth and the ledger's tactile presence anchor micro-setting effectively. The bookshop below remains postcard gesture, but the beam as tightrope and the skylight as window satisfy the micro-setting standard and link to closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving the echo of lost songs—is signaled early but remains abstract. Pressure accumulates through recurrence (pigeons, dust, meteorite) rather than narrowing options. The final pigeon release and ledger closing offer no visible trade-off or foreclosed alternative; the customer's tune arrives as coincidence, not earned escalation. Agency reads as atmospheric completion rather than choice with cost. One tightening (whispered lyrics, sealed promise) deepens tone but does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme—trust rebuilt through fragile rituals—emerges from dust-mapping and pigeon flights without overt statement. The meteorite, ledger, and skylight recur with shifting charge, and the final "bloom and wilt" image reweights the opening dust. However, the woman's songs and Elias's reinvention remain told rather than tested, and the ending smile asserts resolution without interrogating cost. The "paper trail" concept hovers as metaphor without friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent: Elias filters sensory input through music and light. Diction remains elevated and lyric throughout, with purposeful compression in dust-mote metaphor and "withered song of wood." No head-hopping. Distance control is stable. However, peak-stress moments ("fragile trust solidify") lean toward abstract assertion rather than voice-specific texture, and the final paragraph's rhythm flattens into summary. Experimental compression is taught and legible, but does not fully charge closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops dominate: "dust motes swirled" appears in four passages with synonym variation but no added pressure. Template cadence: "He [verb], [object]" runs across six consecutive beats mid-story. Stock metaphor stack: "blooming," "withering," "fragile," "echo" recur without reweighting. The final third cycles through "trusted," "preserved," "balanced" as abstract claims rather than concrete action. Figurative density in high-pressure beats (final pigeon release) obscures propulsion. Artifacts touch closure: −1.4 in Q7, disallow 9+ globally, cap high-band at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Courier-pigeon trainer in a bookshop attic offers mild premise freshness, but the emotional arc—lonely man rebuilds trust through ritual—follows a familiar template without transformation. The meteorite chip and dust-mapping are specific props, yet they function as decorative anchors rather than irreplaceable story logic. The ledger rewriting and the woman's vanishing operate as backstory gestures. No bold structural risk or non-obvious synthesis; swapping pigeons for another solitary craft would leave the arc intact.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias releases pigeons in three beats, records messages, and balances on the beam, but none of these actions narrows options or creates a turn. His occupation frames the setting and supplies props (ledger, pigeons) without driving escalation. The final release is announced, not dramatized as choice with cost. Present throughout, functionally involved, but replaceable with any solitary ritual role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The meteorite chip appears in four beats: initial find, repeated warmth checks, tucked into pouch, final glow. It signals connection to the vanishing woman and recurs with tonal charge at closure. However, its warmth never constrains a decision or alters tactics; it remains symbolic anchor rather than causal lever. Two-gate presence (setup, payoff) with lyric reprise, but no middle development that changes options.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Paper trails thread the story: pigeon-carried scrolls, ledger entries, the woman's left notes, and the final "paper trail of trust and song." The ledger rewriting shapes Elias's motive and the final closure image ("closed the ledger"). Concept appears in all three gates and ties to the ending's metaphorical resonance. However, it does not narrow a specific on-page choice or impose visible cost; it operates as thematic frame rather than tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Reinventing personal history is told in one passage: "rewriting his own history with each entry." The ledger work recurs, but the trait's cost or friction never surfaces in a decision. It flavors backstory but does not constrain present action or charge the closure with visible trade-off. Label-only integration; swappable with "preserves memories" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Balance appears in five beats: perching on beam, arms spread, stepping down, "quiet balance," and "balanced between memory and dream." The beam stance physically constrains Elias and mirrors thematic poise. The final "balanced" image charges closure. However, the action itself does not create a turn or foreclose an alternative; it operates as recurring metaphor. Setup, development (repeated), and payoff present, but causal pressure is weak.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dust-mote mapping appears in four beats: counting patterns, tracing geometry, seeing a path forward, final constellation. The method is signaled early and shapes Elias's ritual, but it never alters a tactic or choice under pressure. The dust swirls frame atmosphere and metaphor without imposing mechanics that matter. Present in setup and payoff, but middle application remains decorative.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The attic dominates: skylight, beam, floorboards, creaking wood, and the bookshop below as contrast. The beam constrains physical stance, the skylight supplies the dust column, and the ledger rests on worn boards. Setting shapes the pigeon-release ritual and charges the final image. Three-gate integration with spatial specificity that affects posture and tone. However, the attic does not alter a decision path or impose resource scarcity; it supplies stage rather than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Learning to trust is the arc's label, mentioned in opening metaphor and final declaration ("learned to trust again"). Time passage is vague—"years ago" for the meteorite find, unspecified duration for ledger-keeping. No live clock tightens decisions; the customer's tune arrives as ambient coincidence. The timeframe structures theme but does not pressure tactics or impose cost. Summary-only integration.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Preserving the echo of lost songs is stated early and recurs in five passages: wanting to keep the echo, whispering old lyrics, songs flying on wings, echo remaining. It frames Elias's motive and the final affirmation. However, the desire is never tested by a conflicting cost or competing want on the page; it drives mood and ritual without forcing a trade-off. Present in all gates but lacks friction that would elevate score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Blooming" and "withering" appear in eight passages, framing the dust motes' life cycle and Elias's emotional arc. The tone modulates from static observation to active release and final "bloom and wilt" synthesis. The dual cadence charges the closure image and holds coherent pressure. However, repetition trends decorative in mid-beats without advancing plot; the tone operates as lyric refrain rather than tactical modulation. Strong setup and payoff with charged reprise, but middle development is ornamental.</comment>
