<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The veiled dreamer remains almost entirely opaque—no embodied emotion, no contradictory impulses, no micro-choices under pressure. Her "cautious exuberance" is labeled twice but never dramatized through action or internal friction. The watch, scroll, and notebook are handled as passive props rather than decisions that foreclose paths. The final "releasing" of silence reads as an unmotivated epiphany with no visible cost or prior struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation debt is severe: who is the dreamer, where is she before the forest, and what calendar anchor frames "the first fateful letter"? The closure unit—"releasing" the unspoken words—arrives without causal setup; we never see what stakes this foreclosed or what she gave up. The "cyclically reversed" cipher and propagation delays are mentioned but never constrain a choice or create a reversal. The drive lens remains ambiguous throughout; no meaningful tightening occurs.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The glowing library, mist, and spiral staircase are vivid and consistently rendered. Spatial choreography is clear across the forest, library entrance, and descent. However, the setting remains decorative—no environmental constraint forces a choice, and the final chamber's "unspoken words" are abstract rather than tactile. The watch and scroll function as portable objects rather than setting elements that pressure tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to find the library of unspoken words"—is declared but never tested on the page; she arrives, finds it, and "releases" it without opposition or trade-off. No reversal tightens options; the watch's "hidden compartment" opens conveniently without cost. The second letter's arrival is framing rather than complication. No agency-driven escalation or felt price shapes the ending.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The theme of silence and unspoken words recurs as image and motif, and the final scroll line—"The silence you seek is the echo you leave"—attempts a conceptual repricing. However, this insight is delivered by letter rather than earned through on-page struggle, and the act of "releasing" remains abstract. The cyclical structure and propagation delays are mentioned but never constrain the protagonist's understanding or choices, reducing them to ornamental recursion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The third-person narration maintains stable distance and a consistent lyric register. Vocabulary is controlled and atmospheric ("whispered secrets," "forgotten memory"). However, the perceptual signature is generic rather than character-particular; the dreamer notices what the prose needs rather than what her goals and flaws would select. No dialogue. Filter verbs ("She felt," "She realized," "She knew") cluster in key beats, dulling immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "cautious exuberance" appears twice with identical phrasing; "unspoken words" and "library of unspoken words" cycle without variation. Template cadence dominates the middle third: "She [verb], [article] [noun]" repeats across a dozen lines. "Each tick was a delay, a propagation of a secret through propagation delays" is circular and conceptually redundant. The final third includes stock metaphors ("cold as forgotten memory") and several filter-verb stacks that flatten the closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The glowing library in mist, the watch with reversed cycles, and the scroll map are familiar fantasy furniture. The "unspoken words preserved in ink that glows" and the "silence you seek is the echo you leave" moral are abstract rather than grounded in specific human calculus. The cyclical structure is mentioned but not dramatized, and the protagonist's arc—arrive, understand, release—follows a template quest without a fresh inflection or trade-off that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The veiled dreamer is present throughout but makes no on-page decisions that alter tactics or foreclose paths. She observes, records, and follows the map; the "releasing" act in the final third is stated rather than dramatized as a choice with cost. Decorative presence without agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The confidence man's watch appears at the pedestal, is lifted and examined, "ticks" across multiple beats, releases a hidden compartment, and is carried in the satchel at the end. It drives the cipher-decoding middle sequence and marks the "final tick" at closure. However, it does not constrain a choice or create a reversal; the protagonist simply observes its mechanism. Two-gate participation (middle and ending mention) with causal involvement in one beat.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The unfolding cipher is described in the middle third: "each turn reversing the pattern of the last." The protagonist documents it in her notebook. However, the cipher never constrains a decision or alters tactics; it is observed rather than solved under pressure. Present and thematically echoed but functionally ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"Cyclically reversed" is labeled twice—once for the watch's hands, once for the staircase—but neither reversal forces a trade-off or visible cost. The staircase's direction-reversal is mentioned without affecting the descent. Label-only attribute without on-page constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The protagonist documents the watch's ticks in her notebook. This action recurs across two beats and is mentioned in the satchel inventory at the end. However, the documentation does not drive a turn or alter tactics; it is passive record-keeping. Present in setup and closure inventory, but swappable with "observe" or "study" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Through propagation delays" is named twice: "propagation of a secret through propagation delays in the mechanism's gears" and "a last propagation delay marking the end of the cycle." The method is described but never shown to matter tactically; the protagonist does not wait, compensate, or suffer from the delays. Mentioned without mechanical consequence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The glowing library in mist is established early, provides the map that guides the descent, and its "intensified" glow merges with the mist at closure. The library's architecture mirrors the watch's workings, and the "unspoken words" chamber is reached via its staircase. The setting supplies the scroll and books that the protagonist interacts with across three beats, and the final image of the library "glowing in the mist" reweights the opening. Three-gate participation with structural involvement, though no environmental constraint forces a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "between two fateful letters" is signaled in the first and final paragraphs. The second letter arrives at the bottom chamber and is carried forward, bracketing the action. However, the interval does not tighten tactics or create urgency; the protagonist has unlimited time to decode and explore. Framing device without pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the library of unspoken words" is stated in the opening (implied by "promised a library") and drives the journey through the forest and into the library. The protagonist reaches the chamber and releases the words, fulfilling the goal. However, no friction or cost complicates the desire; she succeeds without trade-off. Setup and payoff present, but desire is not conflicted on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Cautious exuberance" is labeled twice—once in the opening third, once in the final third—with identical phrasing. The tone does not modulate under pressure or charge the closure image; the protagonist's affect remains steady throughout. Static label rather than enacted emotional texture that shifts with escalation.</comment>
