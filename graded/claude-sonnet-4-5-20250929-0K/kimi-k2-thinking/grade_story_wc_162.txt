<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The protagonist exists as a collection of poetic labels rather than a person under pressure. "Featherly determined" is asserted but never constrains a choice; the internal experience remains abstract throughout ("my heart aches," "I intuit"). No embodied contradiction acts in scene—the narrator simply walks forward, counts steps, and crosses thresholds without visible cost or foreclosed paths. The final "legend" claim tells rather than earns transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Drive lens reads accumulative/textural: repeated threshold crossings and grain-reading gestures layer toward a conceptual endpoint. Orientation is delayed—"who" clarifies only at line 3, "where/when" remain vague past 120 words (−0.4). The closure ("I know now that some distances are necessary") is asserted rather than dramatized with visible cost; no on-page choice forecloses a path or reweights prior material through action. The piece teaches a pattern of lyric recurrence but never pays it off with stakes-altering pressure at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace and wooden grain offer vivid, recurring images that anchor the voice. However, spatial choreography remains abstract—thresholds "emerge" and dissolve without clear geography or physical constraint. The grain map and pilot logbook return across beats, charging the final image with some resonance, but they never block or enable a tactical choice. Sensory detail is selective and voice-consistent, lifting the score into functional range despite the lack of micro-setting pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering why thresholds feel sacred—is signaled early but never tested by a choice with visible cost. The protagonist encounters no opposition, makes no trade-offs, and sacrifices nothing; each threshold opens on cue. "Necessary distances" and step-counting gestures recur but do not narrow options or deepen pressure. The resolution is delivered by narrator assertion ("I understand...") rather than earned through agency or renunciation, leaving escalation absent under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme—sacredness of thresholds measured by intention and distance—emerges clearly from recurring images (grain, logbook, corn maze). Yet the ending states the theme directly ("some distances are necessary, and some thresholds are sacred") rather than offering a non-literal answer through image or action. The pilot logbook and wooden grain function as motifs without constraining a choice or charging the closure with cost. Subtext is thin; interiority often articulates the premise in prompt-like language rather than letting particulars speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and lyric, with a distinct perceptual signature (prisms, fractured hush, featherly determination). Psychic distance remains stable; no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("prayer," "reverence," "legend") that blurs urgency, and the patterned repetition (threshold, distance, grain) reads as taught motif rather than voice-driven necessity. The father's voice and the logbook provide purposeful elision that primes the ending, partially offsetting the abstraction.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence damage momentum: "necessary distances" rephrases across six lines without added pressure; "I [verb], the [noun]" stems repeat in adjacent sentences (lines 11–14, 34–37). Figurative language is dense but often mixed ("featherly determined, light as down yet unyielding as stone"). Rhythm varies and opening/closing lines are strong, but synonym churn ("fractured hush" × 3, "threshold" × 9) and stock phrasing ("memory of storms," "silent symphony") flatten peak beats. Artifacts span multiple paragraphs, triggering cumulative −0.6 and disallowing 9+ globally per the filter-verb/template-stack rule applied to repeated stems.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of corn maze + pilot logbook + prism terrace + necessary distances is specific and non-obvious, offering a fresh frame. However, the emotional arc—lost child seeks understanding, walks forward, gains wisdom—follows a familiar template without transformation through lived cost. The "butterfly effect" and "fractured hush" contribute atmosphere but remain ornamental. Risk-taking in structure (lyric accumulation) is present but does not heighten stakes; the ending retreats to abstraction rather than committing to a bold particular.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Present throughout as narrator; signals early (line 3). Appears in multiple beats (kneeling, tracing grain, crossing thresholds, final garden). However, no choice alters tactics or forecloses a path—observation and walking dominate. The "legend" closure mention is ornamental. Swappable with "lost architect's child" or similar. Functional but lacks causal pressure or cost at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Introduced early (line 5), handled in beats (trembles at line 13, merges with grain at line 22, held close at line 29, turned at line 39, carried at end). Two-gate participation (setup, middle) and lyric reprise at closure. However, it never constrains a choice or blocks a move; "trembling" and "aligning" are passive observations. Swappable with any symbolic guide object. Mid-band for recurrence without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup (line 8–9), develops across middle beats (step-counting, grain distances), and appears in closure unit ("distances are not just steps but moments of reverence," "distances are always necessary"). Shapes the protagonist's method (counting steps) and reweights at the end. However, "necessary" is asserted rather than dramatized with cost—no distance blocks passage or forces sacrifice. Reaches low-7 band eligibility via three gates but lacks irreplaceability and visible price, capping near 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Label-only mention at line 6 and reprise at line 43. Never constrains or enables an action with cost; "light as down yet unyielding as stone" is decorative metaphor. No beat involvement beyond assertion. Ornamental, swappable with any determination synonym. Below functional threshold.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Present at line 10 ("I intuit a pattern") and closure ("I realize..."). Two touches, but both are summary rather than dramatized process. The act of intuiting does not drive a turn or alter options—the threshold appears regardless. Swappable with "perceive" or "sense." Functional mention without causal pressure or cost linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Setup (line 7), developed in beats (line 8 map discovery, line 14 tracing with fingers, line 15 distance correspondence, line 40 "still whispers"), and present at closure ("whenever I find it, seeking the next sacred threshold"). Three-gate participation. The method yields the map and primes the step-counting tactic, providing some causal linkage. However, the grain never blocks a move or imposes cost; discoveries arrive without friction. Mid-5 band for method involvement without high irreplaceability or visible price.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Introduced at line 1, reprised at final lines ("drifting prism terrace carries me forward"). Setup and closure participation, but no middle development—it drifts passively without constraining movement or supplying resources. Spatial choreography is vague; no choice depends on terrace features. Lyric-resonance allowance applies (early seed → final reprise reweights slightly), reaching mid-4 band, but lacks causal work to climb higher.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Setup (line 2 "after the butterfly effect"), thematic echo in closure ("after the butterfly effect, toward the next mystery"). Two-touch lyric frame. However, time never tightens decisions—no clock, no urgency, no trade-off shaped by "after." The butterfly effect remains atmospheric backstory. Functional frame without tactical pressure or cost, mid-3 band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Introduced at line 4, developed in beats (line 9 thresholds' sacredness, line 18 father's teaching, line 26 understanding), and answered at closure ("I know now...some thresholds are sacred"). Three-gate participation. Shapes the protagonist's method (step-counting) and final realization. However, the desire is never conflicted or tested by cost—every threshold opens; no want-versus-fear friction. Told-only rather than dramatized in choices. Reaches near-5 for setup-to-closure arc without visible friction or price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Setup (line 2 "whispers," line 11 "fractured hush"), recurring (lines 19, 28, 45, 48, 52), and charged at closure ("the hush is whole"). Modulates subtly with density (deepens at line 28). The tone is coherent and pattern-taught, shaping the perceptual signature. However, it does not shift under pressure or drive a choice; static mood throughout. Lyric-resonance and closure participation lift to mid-5, but lack of tonal escalation under stakes caps climb toward 7+.</comment>
