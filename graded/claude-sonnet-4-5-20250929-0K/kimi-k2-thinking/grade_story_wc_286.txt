<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kai's motivation is clear and her decision to leave the bowl as an offering constitutes a meaningful choice, but internal conflict is thin—she observes and understands more than she struggles. Embodied emotion appears in moments like "her motivation hummed beneath her ribs," yet much of the piece reads as calm discovery without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final stance feels earned by the oasis's teaching, but the journey lacks the friction and inevitable mistakes that would push this into higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases through layered images (lantern glass, rosemary, thrum) and the closure reweights the premise with a charged conceptual repricing—kindness as architecture, the bowl left as both offering and messenger. Cost is legible in the "empty space in her pack" and the knowledge she carries forward. Orientation is clean. One meaningful deepening occurs when Kai recognizes the oasis is "phototropic to kindness," which reframes her investigation and leads directly to the final gesture. The structure holds, though the resolution leans heavily on thematic realization rather than a decisive physical turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The beekeeping oasis is vividly realized through selective detail: silvered hive boxes, wild rosemary in cracked flagstones, hidden spring clay. The setting constrains Kai's final action—she uses oasis materials (rosemary kindling, spring clay) to create the bowl, and the "thrum" she feels guides her wheel work. Spatial choreography is coherent. The oasis functions as more than backdrop; it teaches and supplies, charging the final image when she leaves her offering "on the central stone."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why some places resist entropy—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure tightens when Kai feels the thrum and realizes the oasis absorbed generations of care; this recognition narrows her options to either replicate that kindness or carry the secret onward. Her decision to fire a bowl and leave the lantern glass inside it is a renunciation (she loses the relic) with visible cost ("the absence as a kind of fullness"). One meaningful deepening under the Accumulative lens. The escalation is conceptual rather than urgent, keeping the piece out of the highest band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the oasis's persistence, the lantern glass's memory, the bowl as new offering. The story resists moralizing; instead, the final image—bowl and glass on the stone, the single bee messenger—offers a resonant answer to the central question without stating a thesis. "Kindness could be a structure as solid as any wheel or kiln" risks abstraction but is earned by prior concrete action (wedging clay, firing with rosemary, feeling the thrum). The piece balances complexity and clarity, inviting reflection on care as temporal architecture without false equivalence or platitude.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: Kai notices through a potter's lens (clay settling, glazes, wheel rhythm). Voice is purposeful and imagistic, with occasional compression ("phototropic to kindness") that fits the lyric-meditative register. No head-hopping. Distance modulates appropriately—tighter during wheel work, wider during reflection. Some diction edges toward elevated register ("temporal overlap," "bent time around itself") but remains voice-motivated and legible. Elision is taught and paid off; the piece sustains its textural coherence under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sentences carry distinct texture ("chimney smoke flattened," "sharp gentleness"). Information density is high; most lines advance image or understanding. However, several passages loop conceptually: "some things submit to entropy, while others absorb it and transform it" restates the premise without added pressure, and the final paragraph recycles "sharp gentleness" and "thrum" without new detail. Figurative language clusters heavily ("phototropic," "glazes on a single vessel," "love's architecture") but remains coherent. Minor scaffold in the long penultimate paragraph ("For now, she walked on...") dilutes momentum. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence. Clarity and propulsion are strong overall; loops and restated abstractions prevent entry to the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of potter + temporal oasis + kindness-as-structure offers a fresh angle on memory and place, avoiding template resolutions. The detail is specific (lantern glass with honeycomb etch, rosemary kindling, wedging clay from a hidden spring) and the emotional arc transforms the familiar "abandoned place" trope through Kai's disciplined, embodied practice. Risk is moderate—the lyric-meditative mode and conceptual closure could flatten, but the piece commits fully and follows its premise. Transformation test passes: swap names and the story loses its potter's perceptual signature. No close echoes of famous lines. The oasis as "phototropic to kindness" is memorable and non-obvious.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Kai appears in the opening and her choices (touching the hive, shaping the bowl, leaving the offering) drive beats. The final gesture—placing bowl and glass on the central stone—alters her relationship to the oasis and her mission. Setup, development, and closure participation are present. Her zen-minded observation informs her decisions, though observation dominates over internal conflict. Two beats involve active choice (wheel work, leaving the bowl), and the closure depends on her action. Swappability is low; her potter identity is integral. The cost (losing the lantern glass, "absence as fullness") is tied to her choice. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, cost connection +0.4; no major frictions beyond moderate observational passivity −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lantern glass is introduced early ("half-buried in the apiary's central garden"), used in a discovery beat (images flicker within it), and returns at closure when Kai nests it in the bowl as an offering. Three distinct touches across setup, middle discovery, and payoff. The glass's honeycomb etch and memory-holding property are specific and irreplaceable. Its loss charges the final image ("the absence as a kind of fullness"). Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, specificity +0.6, closure linkage +1.4, cost connection +0.5; no major frictions. Reaches high band but not indispensable—story logic could survive without this exact object if another relic were substituted, though resonance would weaken.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Fractured timelines appear in the lantern-glass vision ("beekeepers tending frames... children running... coexisted here, layered like glazes") and in the thematic claim that the oasis "held its many times in one resilient space." The concept shapes Kai's understanding and primes her final realization that "change and constancy coexist." Setup in the glass beat, thematic payoff at closure. However, the concept does not constrain a tactical choice or alter options on the page—Kai's actions (wedging clay, firing, leaving the bowl) would proceed identically if the timelines were simply "memory" rather than fractured/coexistent. Early signal +0.5, one beat (glass vision) +0.4, closure participation (thematic) +0.7; swappability −0.6, theme-only use without tactical pressure −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Phototropic to kindness" is introduced mid-story when Kai realizes the oasis absorbed gentle handling and released it as sustenance. This recognition reframes her investigation and leads directly to her decision to create and leave the bowl—an act of kindness that replicates the pattern. The attribute constrains her final choice (she must offer care, not take) and charges the closure ("the oasis pulsed gently"). Setup delayed to ~40%, one key turn (the realization), closure linkage strong. Late signal −0.3, one beat +0.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, specificity (unique metaphor) +0.6, cost connection (she leaves her work and relic) +0.4; late introduction and lack of middle tactical constraint keep it below 7.5.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The thrum appears when Kai presses her palm against the hive box, recurs as it "resonated through her arms" during wheel work, and persists as "a quiet resonance in her palms" after she leaves. Three touches across setup, wheel-work beat, and closure. The thrum guides the bowl's form and becomes the knowledge she carries forward. Causal linkage is moderate—it informs but does not strictly enable her action. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.5; swappability −0.5 (could be replaced with "pulse" or "hum" with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"By following sun patterns" is mentioned in the opening ("She followed sun patterns not as maps but as mantras") and recurs in the closing ("following the sun's arc back toward the wasteland's edge"). The method frames her journey but does not constrain a choice or shape tactics—she could navigate by any means and the plot would hold. Setup present, closure reprise yes, but no middle beat involvement and no causal pressure. Early signal +0.4, lyric reprise +0.5, closure participation (framing only) +0.3; ornamental use −0.7, swappability −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The oasis supplies essential resources (clay from the hidden spring, rosemary kindling) and its thrum guides Kai's wheel work. The setting constrains her final action—she uses oasis materials to create the bowl and leaves it on "the central stone." Four touches: discovery, spring clay, rosemary fire, final stone. The oasis's specific features (hive boxes, rosemary, spring, stone) are irreplaceable and causally active. Early signal +0.7, four beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.7, cost connection +0.4; no major frictions. Story logic would fail without this exact setting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"As chimney smoke flattens" appears twice: once mid-story ("chimney smoke flattened from chimneys at dawn" in the glass vision) and again near the end ("chimney smoke flattened against a sky the color of old porcelain"). The timeframe does not tighten decisions or track a live clock—it functions as atmospheric marker rather than temporal constraint. Kai's actions unfold at her own pace with no urgency. Setup in vision, closure reprise; no middle development or causal pressure. Lyric reprise +0.5, closure participation (atmospheric only) +0.3; ornamental use −0.8, no tactical constraint −0.7.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kai's motivation—to understand why some places resist entropy—is signaled early ("her motivation hummed beneath her ribs") and drives her investigation. The lantern-glass discovery and thrum realization both advance this goal, and the closure ("she had learned that some resistances were not stubbornness, but love's architecture") completes it. Three beats: opening goal, mid-story realizations, closure answer. The motivation shapes her choices (to observe carefully, to create rather than take) and forecloses alternatives (she could have harvested resources but instead leaves an offering). Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +1.4, cost connection +0.3; slight abstraction in articulation (told more than dramatized in friction) −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Sharp gentleness" is embodied throughout: Kai's patient walking, the careful wheel work, the flames that "moved with the same sharp gentleness she had cultivated," and the closing line ("a shape both sharp and gentle in the fading light"). The tone modulates appropriately—softens during discovery, tightens during wheel work, breathes in the final walk—without breaking coherence. It charges the final image and integrates with the theme (kindness as structure, care as resistance). Present in opening, multiple middle beats, and closure. Early signal +0.7, four beats +1.4, closure charge +1.6, specificity (unique tonal marriage) +0.7; minor repetition without new detail in final paragraph −0.5.</comment>
