<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation is clear and consistent, but his interiority remains abstract ("cultivate serenity within motion") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The tincture's success unfolds without meaningful internal conflict or visible cost to his own stance. The minstrel's transformation is told rather than dramatized, and Elias's final "smile" and whispered gratitude lack the micro-choices under pressure that would earn the change. Minor penalty for therapy-adjacent phrasing ("undercurrent of wisdom," "deeper current") in reflective beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers motifs (seed, scent, doodling, journal) and modulates tone through repetition. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—the seed's teaching reweights the premise—but the cost remains asserted ("a memory... rested in the soil of his heart") rather than dramatically legible on the page. Orientation is clear by the opening. One meaningful deepening occurs when the tincture is brewed and tested, but the minstrel's arrival and the elders' testimonies feel like additive validation rather than a turn that narrows options. The final paragraph loops thematic claims without a fresh image that charges prior material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The treetop village, perpetual mist, and canopy details establish vivid atmosphere. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elias's olfactory focus (jasmine, sulfur, corpse flower's "pungent breath"). However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; no environmental constraint meaningfully alters a choice at closure. The seed and mortar are handled on the page, but their mechanics do not pressure tactics. Spatial choreography is coherent but lacks the micro-setting detail that would force a trade-off or charge the ending image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—brewing a tincture to "calm a heart caught in the rush of the world"—is signaled early. However, escalation is weak: Elias faces no opposition, resource scarcity, or internal contradiction that narrows options. The minstrel's arrival provides a test, but his instant success deflates tension rather than deepening it. The elders' validation continues the pattern of frictionless acceptance. The closure offers thematic repricing but no visible price paid by Elias; his "ambition had borne fruit" without dramatized cost or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—that stillness coexists with motion, and beauty with decay—emerges from the corpse flower's symbolism and the tincture's effect. The final journal entry ("stillness is not absence, but a deeper current") and closing lines ("every ending is a beginning scented with possibility") articulate the theme clearly, but veer into thematic statement rather than letting the final image resonate non-literally. The piece offers complexity in pairing "foul and fragrant," yet the village's unanimous acceptance smooths over the moral ambiguity that could have lingered. Subtext operates more in description than in charged silence or gesture.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elias throughout. Voice carries a lyric, elevated register ("olfactorily sensitive," "tide's thought," "wildflower hush") that fits the mysterious setting but occasionally drifts toward ornamental phrasing. The minstrel's gift and the elders' testimonies are summarized rather than shown in direct dialogue, missing an opportunity for voice distinction. Psychic distance is consistent, but perceptual signature lacks sharp idiosyncrasy—Elias's way of noticing is poetic but not character-particular. Minor drift into thematic narration at closure ("the village continued to whisper its secrets") that externalizes rather than trusts the image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose is lyric and rhythmic, but clarity suffers under density of figurative language. Synonym loops appear: "undercurrent of wisdom" recurs without fresh context; "wildflower hush" is invoked three times as mood label. Template cadence in the final third: "He realized... He recorded... He knew... Elias closed... Elias smiled..." stacks similar stems across six consecutive beats. Mixed metaphor: "tide's thought" as a literal sap-direction mechanic strains credibility. Paraphrase loops: the closing three paragraphs restate "serenity within motion" and "balance" without advancing pressure. Information density is moderate; many lines serve atmosphere over plot. Artifacts touch the closure unit, triggering −1.7 baseline and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The herbalist-cultivates-wisdom premise is familiar, and the story does not transform it through unexpected moral calculus or lived friction. The corpse flower's duality (decay/beauty) is apt but executed as symbolic decoration rather than a pressure that alters Elias's tactics. The treetop village and "tide's thought" offer fresh diction, but remain ornamental. The minstrel's instant success and the elders' unanimous approval follow a predictable validation arc. Emotional truth is present in the desire for calm, yet the frictionless resolution into "shared serenity" avoids the cost or ambiguity that would make the premise memorable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and his decisions (sealing the seed, grinding it, offering the tincture) drive the sequence. However, his choices are executed without opposition or visible cost, reducing their turn potential. He observes outcomes (minstrel's calm, elders' smiles) but does not alter his own stance in response. Setup and development gates are met; payoff is thematic rather than causal. Swappability: another herbalist with similar resolve would produce the same arc.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The corpse flower seed appears in setup (kept, described), development (unwrapped, inhaled, ground), and payoff (invoked as "a memory... in the soil of his heart"). Its mechanics—foul fragrance teaching coexistence of beauty and dread—shape the tincture's conceptual basis. However, the seed's specific properties do not constrain a choice with visible cost; any rare, dual-natured ingredient could serve. Three beats of involvement and closure linkage push it above mid-band, but swappability and ornamental final mention cap it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The concept "undercurrent of wisdom" is invoked in the opening and recurs as a thematic claim ("undercurrent of wisdom rise within him," "wisdom often hides in the most pungent of places"). It frames the stake but does not alter on-page tactics or choices. Elias's realization is asserted rather than tested by conflicting options. Present in setup and payoff but lacks middle development that constrains action. Label-only integration reduces the score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias's olfactory sensitivity is demonstrated early ("separate the perfume of night-blooming jasmine from the acrid hint of sulfur") and again when he inhales the seed's "pungent breath." However, the trait does not enable a unique tactical choice or impose a visible cost. Any herbalist could grind the seed and observe its scent. The attribute colors description but remains ornamental; swappable with "keen observer" or similar. Setup and one beat of use met; no middle constraint or payoff cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Journalizing appears in setup (Elias keeps a journal, records scent shifts), development (he writes after the minstrel's visit), and payoff (he records elders' testimonies, closes the journal at the end). The action provides a frame and closure beat, but does not drive major turns—the tincture's creation and success occur independently. The journal is a container for reflection rather than a constraint that shapes choices. Two gates plus closure presence, but no causal pressure; mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The family custom of doodling on wrapping paper interiors is described early (spirals and leaves as "a ward against decay") and repeated when Elias labels the vial and doodles in his journal margin. Present in three beats, but the doodles never constrain a choice or impose a cost. The custom is mentioned as cultural texture; removing it would not alter the story's logic or stakes. Functional but replaceable; below mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The mysterious treetop village shrouded in mist is established in the opening and provides consistent atmosphere (mossy bridges, canopy, hammocks). The setting enables the herbalist's work but does not pressure his choices—no access constraint, resource limit, or social friction. The village's collective acceptance at the end is environment-as-outcome rather than environment-as-obstacle. Setup and development (location for brewing, minstrel's arrival) are present; payoff is thematic. One turn shaped by setting (minstrel arrives during thunder), but no micro-constraint that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"At the turning of the tide's thought, when the moon's pull reversed the sap's direction" is invoked once as the timing of the seed-sealing rite. The timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the story unfolds over multiple days without a live clock. The phrase is lyric but ornamental. Missing middle development and closure participation; present in setup only as atmospheric detail.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to cultivate serenity within motion" is stated early and recurs as Elias's goal. It drives the tincture's creation and is tested when the minstrel drinks and the elders sip. However, the desire is asserted rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost to Elias himself. The minstrel's and elders' success validates the ambition without friction. Setup, development (brewing and offering), and payoff (journal reflection, village flourishing) are all present, but lack on-page conflict between want and price. Told-only interiority caps the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Wildflower hush" is invoked three times: the evening when Elias unwraps the seed, the village's final state, and the closing line. The tone is coherent—lyric, quiet, contemplative—and modulates subtly as the story moves from solitary experiment to communal peace. However, the tone remains static rather than shifting under pressure; no tonal contrast when stakes rise. Present in setup and payoff with a charged reprise at closure, but does not tighten with escalation. Lyric-resonance allowance applies; mid-band.</comment>
