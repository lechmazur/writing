<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The prophet's "precognitive forgetfulness" is delivered as a label with minimal dramatized contradiction or on-page cost. His actions—kneeling, tracing chalk, listening—are physically embodied but remain uniform in texture; we see gesture without micro-choices that reveal conflicting impulses. The final acceptance ("clinging to echoes is not about holding them, but about letting them flow") arrives as a thesis statement rather than an earned shift visible in altered behavior. The orientation test passes cleanly, but interiority remains abstract and the closure choice lacks visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens inferred: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates fog, chalk, driftwood, and VCR imagery toward a final spiral gesture that functions as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: the prophet captures the echo momentarily, then releases it). Orientation anchors early (junkyard, fog, dawn). Cost is conceptual—he knows the memory will slip—but the final image ("chalk spiral... a silent witness") reweights the longing without a felt price in altered options. The "tidal breath" climax emerges without prior causal tightening; it arrives as atmosphere rather than escalation under pressure. One meaningful deepening is present but escalation remains diffuse.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The junkyard garden is vividly realized with rusted VCRs, rebar sculptures, and Betamax shells; fog modulates perception and the chalk/driftwood constrain his search method. The "Birthday, 1994" cassette provides a concrete anchor that charges the midpoint. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the fog thickens to frame the climax. The setting does not force a choice but actively shapes the prophet's tactics (arranging markers, kneeling at the spiral site), meeting the micro-setting test for the 7-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake: capture the sound of growing older. The prophet arranges driftwood, traces chalk, hears the tidal rumble, then traps it in a spiral—one on-page tightening. The chalk snaps, ending the moment, but this is a micro turn without escalation of options or visible tradeoff; he could repeat the attempt. Agency is present (he draws the spiral) but the cost is告知 rather than dramatized: "he would not remember this night" is summary. No prior constraint narrows his path, and coincidence (the rumble swells unbidden) complicates rather than being earned by his choices. Pressure coheres under Accumulative lens but does not escalate meaningfully.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme—ephemerality, the futility and necessity of capturing time—emerges through chalk dust, magnetic tape, and the tidal metaphor rather than thesis. The final realization ("clinging to echoes is not about holding them, but about letting them flow") is direct but grows from the chalk snap and the spiral image. The piece resists moralizing until the penultimate paragraph, where "he had learned" edges toward summary. Subtext operates in the fog, the "Birthday, 1994" label, and the driftwood compass, but the ending offers a resonant answer without full non-literal charge—it restates the premise more than reweighting it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with lyric elevation ("the hush of old videotapes," "tidal longing"). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, but the perceptual signature is generic: repeated constructions ("He knelt," "He pressed," "He turned") flatten the texture. No dialogue. Filter verbs ("he felt," "he thought") appear frequently but remain voice-legible. The final paragraphs compress into summary mode ("he had learned," "he would not remember"), reducing immediacy at closure. Psychic distance widens when pressure should tighten, and the prophet's way of noticing is poetic but not character-particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paragraph rhythm varies purposefully, and sensory detail is vivid without overwriting. However, template cadence dominates: "He [verb]" opens nine consecutive beats in the middle third without variation, creating a drumbeat monotony (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: lines 4–5 restate "forgetting futures" in adjacent sentences; lines 22–23 echo "ghost echo" and "slow sigh" without added pressure (−0.3). The chalk-snap moment is crisp, but the final five paragraphs summarize rather than dramatize the release, flattening closure momentum. No figurative muddle, but information density sags in the ending and scaffold phrasing ("a small proof," "a quiet percussion") pads several beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The junkyard-prophet frame and "precognitively forgetful" attribute offer a fresh synthesis, and the chalk-spiral-as-trap is a specific, non-obvious image. The tidal-longing tone and VCR relics create memorable texture. Yet the emotional arc—seeking, briefly capturing, then releasing ephemera—follows a familiar meditation-on-time template without transforming it through lived cost or moral calculus. The driftwood compass and fog sculptures are vivid but do not impose unique constraints that another setting could not provide. The piece commits fully to its lyric premise but remains within the safety middle of poetic resignation; no bold risk heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The junkyard prophet is present throughout and makes observable choices: he arranges driftwood, traces chalk, opens the VCR, draws the spiral. These choices shape the arc (setup, middle search, closure spiral), meeting two gates. However, his decisions do not narrow options or create visible tradeoffs—he could repeat the attempt without cost—so causal pressure is weak. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.8, but low irreplaceability (a poet or hermit could perform the same actions) −0.5 and ornamental interiority (label-only "precognitive forgetfulness") −0.3 yield mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The chalk appears early (line 7), is used twice on the page (driftwood trail markers, spiral at climax), and returns with reweighted meaning when it snaps. Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2 (the snap ends the capture), specificity +0.5 (worn nub, dust in palm). The spiral functions as the story's pivotal gesture, and the chalk's fragility embodies the theme. Swappability is low; no other tool would carry the erasure motif as tightly. Cost connection is present but conceptual rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Clinging to echoes" is named early (line 9: "longing"), recurs as metaphor (magnetic fields, tidal breath), and is explicitly resolved in the final third ("clinging to echoes is not about holding them, but about letting them flow"). Setup +0.5, thematic presence across beats +0.6, closure linkage +1.0. However, it operates as theme rather than shaping tactics or narrowing on-page options; the prophet's search method (driftwood, chalk) is not constrained by the echo concept. The concept could be swapped for "grasping the past" with minor edits (−0.4), and the final articulation is told rather than shown (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Precognitively forgetful" is introduced early (line 4) and mentioned twice (lines 4, 23, 33). Setup +0.4, closure mention +0.3. Yet it functions as atmospheric label rather than constraint: no on-page action is enabled or blocked by the trait, and the cost (he will forget tonight) is summary in line 42 rather than dramatized choice. The trait is swappable with "amnesiac mystic" (−0.6), and late first function in closure paragraph (−0.4) caps it. Ornamental use dominates.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Locate" drives the prophet's search: he marks paths (line 8), traces circles (line 13), arranges driftwood compass (line 26), and ultimately finds the rumble (line 29) before trapping it (line 31). Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0 (the spiral is the culmination of locating). Causal pressure is moderate: the search narrows spatially but not tactically; any method could serve. Specificity +0.4 (the driftwood markers and chalk spiral are particular to "locate"), but swappability remains moderate—"pursue" or "trace" would function similarly (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Driftwood markers appear early (line 8) and are used twice: arranging the trail and forming the compass cross (line 26). Setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, but closure linkage is weak—the final spiral is chalk, and the driftwood recedes. The method shapes the middle search but does not constrain the climax choice. Specificity +0.4 (arrows, cross), causal pressure +0.3 (they guide him deeper), but the markers are replaceable with stones or sticks (−0.5) and do not return in the ending image (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The fog sculpture garden anchors every beat: fog rolls (line 3), thickens (line 27), lifts (line 35). The sculptures (rebar, TVs, cassette decks) frame the space, and the fog narrows perception at the climax. Setup +0.7, present in four beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0 (fog unveils the sculptures as the ending resolves). The garden pressures the search by obscuring landmarks, and the fog modulates the tidal atmosphere. Specificity +0.6 (junkyard relics are irreplaceable for the VCR/time motif). Micro-setting test is met: the body (kneeling, pressing finger to screen) and chalk constrain action.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "amid the hush of old videotapes" is atmospheric setup (line 2) but does not tighten decisions. The story unfolds in one dawn session with no live clock or deadline; the prophet could search indefinitely. Present early +0.3, thematic resonance (videotapes = arrested time) +0.4, but no escalation or tactical shift tied to time passing. The "Birthday, 1994" cassette adds specificity +0.3, yet the element is swappable with any relic motif (−0.5). Time does not narrow options or charge the ending.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To capture the sound of growing older" is stated early (line 5, 12) and recurs (lines 24, 30, 41). Setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.7 (the spiral enacts the capture). The motivation drives the search and is visibly pursued on the page. However, friction between want and cost is told rather than dramatized: "he knew the echo would slip away again" (line 33) is summary, and the final acceptance ("letting them flow") arrives as articulated insight rather than embodied tradeoff (−0.5). Swappability is moderate (−0.3): "preserve the past" would function similarly.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tidal longing is signaled early ("his own longing, pulling him," line 9) and modulates throughout: quiet mist (opening), intensifying search (middle), the rumble "matching his own" breath (line 29), and the prophet's heart "a tide pulling outward" (line 38). Setup +0.7, four beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.3 (the tide metaphor charges the final release). Coherent under Accumulative lens, and the tone tightens at the chalk-snap beat then releases cleanly. Specificity +0.5 (tide/breath/fog interweave). The tone is indispensable to the piece's resonance.</comment>
