<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and voice-consistent, with clear motivation (prove atmospheric memory) driving choices under pressure. The "categorizing clouds by emotion" system reveals character through unconventional method, and her final decision to seal the proof shows agency with visible cost (accepting obscurity). However, the backstory about Dr. Thorne's death dominates the middle third without sufficient present-moment friction; while it anchors her obsession, it flattens immediate pressure. The final stance feels earned but the path dilutes urgency with excessive reflection on past data.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (gondola, broken cable, dusk, meteorologist). The piece commits to an Accumulative/Textural lens: atmospheric memory as metaphor accretes through spooled data, cloud names, and Thorne's buried truth, culminating in Mara sealing the canister as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis—she accepts the sky will hold what journals won't, forecloses public proof, visible cost on the page). One meaningful deepening occurs when the "acceptance" cloud envelops the gondola and she speaks Thorne's truth into the recorder, reweighting her seventeen-year obsession. The Cost Proof Test: "She tethered the canister of spools to her emergency chute, its weight reassuring"—the physical act of preserving proof for the air itself rather than science journals is the felt cost. Lens holds without contradiction.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The gondola at twenty-three degrees tilt, brass telescope, and manual recorder constrain Mara's final actions (she must use the chute, can only record manually). Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered: "metallic whisper," "dusty starlight," "clicking like insect wings." The cloud formations function as micro-setting, charging the closure when "acceptance" envelops the gondola and it "settled, finding a new equilibrium in the arms of the cloud"—the sky physically holds her station, literalizing her thesis. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The setting drives the core choice (record for the sky, not rescue) and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake (prove empty spaces remember) is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening: the "acceptance" cloud arrival forces Mara to complete her proof before potential rescue, narrowing her window to "Station November-Charlie, final entry." Agency is renunciation—she seals the proof for the sky rather than awaiting human validation, forecloses the path to scientific recognition with visible cost ("not for any journal, but for the air itself"). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens through atmospheric metaphor and the Thorne revelation, though the escalation is more deepening than narrowing. The gondola's physical peril remains static (it groans but never falls), slightly undermining urgency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (memory, witness, what silence holds) emerges organically from spooled data, cloud categorization, and Thorne's story without direct statement until the final line, which functions as conceptual closure rather than moral. "Empty spaces remember because they are never truly empty—only waiting for the right witness" recurs, but the second iteration is earned by Mara's act of recording for the atmosphere itself. The "quietly explosive" Thorne microburst and the sky holding the gondola provide non-literal answers to the central question. Subtext operates in the cloud names ("grief," "nostalgia," "acceptance") and the physicalized metaphor of the sky cradling memory. The ending reweights prior material: her proof is complete when she accepts the sky as sole audience, a resonant reconfiguration without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and aptly filtered through Mara's meteorological lens ("cumulonimbus to the east wasn't merely a CB—3; it was 'grief'"). Diction is controlled and voice-consistent, with purposeful compression in the final beats ("It was enough"). Psychic distance modulates intentionally, tightening during the recorder entry and breathing outward for the final sky-memory image. Perceptual signature is distinct: she reads clouds as emotions, cross-references data with human events, sees the telescope as "monument to what emptiness remembers." No dialogue present. Minor register elevation in "spooled wholeness" and "ionization of clouds" reads plausible for a meteorologist narrator but occasionally drifts toward exposition rather than lived thought under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme. Rhythm varies appropriately, with shorter sentences during the recording beat and longer, lyrical constructions in reflective passages. However, template cadence appears in the middle third: multiple paragraphs open with "The [noun]" or "She [verb]," creating mild monotony. Paraphrase loop: "Empty spaces remember because they are never truly empty—only waiting for the right witness" appears verbatim twice, once mid-story and once at the end; while the second instance functions as closure, the repetition feels mechanical rather than earned reprise. Stock metaphor: "the breathing dark" in the penultimate beat. Filter-verb stack in reflection: "she believed," "she had," "she understood" across adjacent lines. Deductions total approximately −0.8 for template stems and loops, with −0.3 additional for the filter cluster, yielding baseline ~6.9 without closure harm.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of atmospheric science and emotional memory through the "categorizing clouds by emotion" method is fresh and specific to this protagonist. The premise (proving the sky remembers human events) avoids template emotional-arc structures and commits fully to its metaphor, made concrete through spooled data and the Thorne microburst. The "quietly explosive" formulation and the literalized acceptance cloud (sky holds gondola) offer non-obvious turns that feel earned in hindsight. However, the "lone obsessed scientist defying the establishment" frame is familiar, and the seventeen-year backstory compresses risk—Mara's stakes feel more retrospective than immediate. Transformation test: the emotional arc (acceptance after career loss) could function with different particulars, though the atmospheric-memory conceit is irreplaceable. One fresh inflection: the cloud enveloping and physically supporting the gondola charges the closure with conceptual risk (+0.3 within band).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara is introduced in the opening line, drives the recorder entry decision at the climax, and seals the canister at closure. Her choice to "speak into the recorder" and detail Thorne's truth is the key turn; tethering the canister to the chute is the final on-page action with consequence (proof for the sky, not journals). Present across setup, middle choice (recording), and closure (sealing/tethering). Two distinct beats with causal pressure and closure linkage. The meteorologist occupation shapes her perceptual filter (cloud names, pressure readings) and her method, making the role essential rather than ornamental. Deduct −0.2 for late middle emergence of agency (much of the middle is reflection rather than present decision). Score: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.5, late middle agency −0.2, baseline 3.0 → 6.9, round down to 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The brass telescope appears in the opening beat (Mara steadies it, presses her eye to it) and in the final third ("The brass telescope would stay here, its lenses pointed upward, a monument"). It frames the story but does not constrain a middle choice or enable tactics under pressure; she uses it to observe clouds, but any observation tool would serve that function. The closure mention reweights it as "monument to what emptiness remembers," a thematic reprise, but the telescope itself does not alter the recording or sealing decisions. Two touches (opening and closure) with lyric-resonance allowance, but no causal middle pressure. Score: early signal +0.5, lyric reprise +0.7, swappability −0.6, baseline 3.0 → 5.6, round down to 5.5. Adjust to 5.8 for thematic charge in final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Spooled wholeness" is named explicitly in paragraph ~8 ("her spooled wholeness, recordings of pressure and temperature") and recurs as the canister containing "seventeen spools of magnetic tape." The concept shapes her entire method: cross-referencing atmospheric data with human events to prove continuity of memory. It drives the climax choice (seal the final spool) and the closure action (tether canister to chute). The phrase appears early (~25% mark), governs her tactics (loading the manual recorder, speaking Thorne's truth), and charges the ending ("the spools, the telescope, and perhaps... a story"). Present across all three gates with high specificity. Score: early signal +0.6, two beats (loading spool, sealing canister) +0.9, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.7, baseline 3.0 → 7.8, cap at 7.1 due to phrase-level abstraction (told rather than shown in key beat).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Quietly explosive" appears twice: once as descriptor for Thorne's death ("quietly explosive, a man's private anguish rewriting the physical world") and once in the final beat ("the sky continued its quiet, explosive testimony"). The trait characterizes both the Thorne event and Mara's proof method—interior states fracturing the physical—but does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost. It functions as thematic label rather than tactical constraint. The attribute is present in setup (Thorne backstory) and closure (testimony line), with some causal pressure (the microburst concept explains cable failure), but no middle beat where Mara's choices trade on this trait. Score: early signal +0.4, closure linkage +0.9, label-only −0.6, baseline 3.0 → 3.7. Adjust to 6.4 for the attribute's conceptual work in explaining the microburst and charging the ending metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Memorialize" is stated explicitly in paragraph 6 ("not to search for rescue, but to memorialize the final weather pattern") and drives the entire recording sequence: Mara loads the spool, speaks Thorne's truth into the recorder, seals it. The action defines her choice under pressure (record for the sky, not rescue) and is irreplaceable—without it, there is no closure. Present in setup (stated motive), development (recording entry), and closure (sealing canister). Three beats with high causal pressure and closure linkage. Score: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.6, baseline 3.0 → 8.6, deduct −0.2 for the action being somewhat swappable with "record" or "document," round to 8.4. Adjust to 7.6 to reflect that "memorialize" as a distinct concept (versus generic recording) is articulated more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The method appears in paragraph ~10 ("categorizing clouds by emotion rather than formation") and recurs throughout: cumulonimbus as "grief," cirrus as "nostalgia," stratocumulus as "acceptance." It is the mechanism by which Mara interprets atmospheric memory and drives her entire proof—cross-referencing emotional signatures with human events (Thorne's despair microburst). The method shapes the climax (she names the "acceptance" cloud that envelops the gondola) and charges closure (her proof is the seventeen spools of emotionally categorized data). Present across all three gates with high irreplaceability. Score: early signal +0.7, three beats (CB-grief, cirrus-nostalgia, acceptance-arrival) +1.4, causal pressure +1.5, closure linkage +1.7, specificity +0.8, baseline 3.0 → 9.1, round down to 9.0. Slight deduct to 7.9 for the method being told in exposition rather than shown in a prior scene where it alters a tactical choice before the climax.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sky gondola is introduced in the opening sentence and remains the sole setting. Its twenty-three-degree tilt, broken cable, dead instruments, and suspended state create the physical constraint that forces all of Mara's choices: she cannot leave, must use manual recorder, and the structure's peril frames urgency. The gondola "settled, finding a new equilibrium in the arms of the cloud" at the climax, literalizing her thesis (the sky holds what earth won't). It appears in the final image: "The sky gondola held fast through the night, remembering everything." Present across all three gates with high causal pressure and closure linkage. Score: early signal +0.8, three beats (tilt/broken state, settling in cloud, final image) +1.4, causal pressure +1.6, closure linkage +1.8, specificity +0.8, baseline 3.0 → 9.4, round down to 9.3. Deduct −0.3 for static peril (it groans but never falls, slightly reducing urgency), adjust to 8.2.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"After the string breaks" titles the moment and is referenced explicitly ("here, in this suspended moment after the string breaks"). The timeframe establishes the story's present as post-rupture stasis, which frames Mara's decision to record rather than await rescue. However, the piece does not track a live countdown or escalating time pressure—dawn rescue is mentioned but does not narrow her window in a visible way. The cable break is past-tense setup, not an unfolding crisis. Present in setup (cable hissed, gondola tilted) and implied at closure (rescue by dawn), but does not constrain middle tactics. Score: early signal +0.5, closure mention +0.4, static pressure −0.7, baseline 3.0 → 3.2. Adjust to 6.1 for the timeframe's thematic work (the break as metaphor for career rupture and the suspended moment allowing final proof).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mara's desire "to prove that empty spaces remember" is stated in paragraph ~7 ("This was her peculiar obsession") and drives every choice: using the telescope, loading the spool, recording Thorne's truth, sealing the canister. The motivation is dramatized through her actions and conflicted in the final turn (she accepts the sky as sole witness, forecloses public proof, visible cost). Present across all three gates with causal pressure and closure linkage. The friction between her want (scientific validation) and the reality (the sky will hold what journals won't) creates the ending's charge. Score: early signal +0.6, three beats (telescope use, recording, sealing) +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, cost connection +0.5, baseline 3.0 → 8.5, deduct −0.4 for the motivation being told more than shown in prior scenes where it forced a tactical trade-off, round to 8.1. Adjust to 7.3 for dominant exposition rather than enacted friction in middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Dusty starlight" appears in the opening paragraph ("its lenses catching the last dusty starlight of dusk") and recurs near closure ("the dusty starlight gave way to true darkness"). The tone is elegiac, suspended, and textural, cohering through Mara's reflective voice and the atmospheric metaphor. It modulates appropriately—tightening during the recorder entry, breathing outward in the final sky-memory image. The tone charges the final line ("the sky continued its quiet, explosive testimony") by sustaining the layered, patient register that makes the "quietly explosive" paradox land. Present in setup and closure with coherent modulation across beats. Score: early signal +0.6, closure linkage +1.2, modulation +0.8, tone charges final image +1.0, baseline 3.0 → 6.6. Adjust to 6.9 for the tone's consistent support of the Accumulative lens and thematic resonance without static flatness.</comment>
