<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to "cultivate psychological safety" is stated rather than embodied through contradictory impulses under pressure. The involuntary truthfulness remains abstract—we're told the curse forces raw honesty but never see the protagonist struggle with a specific secret they desperately want to hide. The final "teaching" mode (instructing villagers to pause before the eye) flattens agency into facilitator role rather than showing a choice that forecloses a personal path with visible cost. Interior voice leans toward thesis-speak ("fragile space where truth could be spoken without becoming a contagion") rather than character-particular perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece signals an Accumulative/Textural lens through repeated storm imagery and the eye motif, but the closure wobbles between modes: the protagonist "learns to bind the eye with linen soaked in bitter sap" (a causal solution) while also claiming they now "balance the raw force of truth against trust" (thematic summary). The final paragraph's study of the glass eye as "a map of cracks" gestures toward Conceptual Repricing but the cost remains abstract—no on-page action or forfeiture crystallizes what was given up to reach this equilibrium. Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored early). The midpoint tightening (uncovering the eye at dawn, forcing truth onto villagers) does narrow options, but the resolution's cost is told rather than shown in a decisive image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The hanging orchard, ravine, and storms are vividly rendered and purposefully recur, but they function primarily as backdrop rather than constraint. The storm-scarred trees provide sap for the binding ritual (a late functional detail), and ropes anchor the orchard in the penultimate paragraph, yet neither choice is shown to alter tactics under pressure—they're solutions introduced after the main turn. The antique glass eye (a micro-setting object) does charge the final image, lifting the score modestly. Sensory hierarchy is consistent (rain-blackened fruit, bitter sap) but the ravine's spatial choreography never forces a choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to reveal or occlude the truth-telling relic—is signaled early and braided with the goal of psychological safety. However, the core turn (uncovering the eye at dawn) happens abruptly without visible prior deliberation or cost: "I uncovered the eye and let its gaze sweep across the gathered survivors" reads as a single-beat decision rather than a pressure-driven escalation. The aftermath ("truth did not destroy; instead, it peeled away the armor of fear") resolves the conflict almost immediately, and the subsequent binding method arrives as a convenient fix rather than a trade-off that forecloses another path. One meaningful tightening is present but the escalation lacks felt cost on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme—truth as both wound and healing—emerges through concrete images (splinter, shard, armor) and the orchard's shift from decay to ripening fruit. The final image of the cracked glass eye as "a map of the broken world we were trying to mend" is purposeful and non-literal. However, the penultimate move toward explicit articulation ("I realized that the eye was not a curse but a tool") and the teaching mode in the closing paragraphs edge toward thesis statement rather than allowing the particulars to resonate without guidance. The prompt concept "psychological safety" is never fully sublimated into dramatized stakes; it remains a label the text must state.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and lyric ("each sentence a splinter I could not swallow") with controlled register in descriptive passages. However, filter verbs cluster in high-pressure moments ("I knew I had to occlude," "I realized that the eye was not a curse"), and the narrator's diction occasionally drifts into workshop idiom ("cultivate psychological safety," "fragile, shared safety") that sits outside the truffle-forager's established lexicon. POV remains stable (single first-person throughout) with no head-hopping. Dialogue is absent, so those bullets do not apply. The final paragraphs shift into summary mode ("In the days that followed, I learned…") which lowers immediacy at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "occlude" appears six times across the piece in near-identical grammatical slots, and "psychological safety" / "fragile safety" / "shared safety" cycle without added nuance. The phrase "discredited textbooks" is repeated verbatim three times, twice in the same sentence structure. Template cadence runs through the middle third: "The moment I touched… / I knew I had to… / The settlement… / I buried…" chains identical stems across four consecutive sentences. Mixed metaphors muddle peak beats: truth is both "splinter," "shard," and "contagion," and the eye's "whisper" contradicts its visual "gaze." Figurative density is high but often decorative rather than propulsive, slowing momentum in the storm-turn paragraphs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The "empathy virus" and "involuntarily truthful" premise is a recognizable speculative-fiction template (post-plague society, cursed artifact, protagonist learns to balance power). The transformation is modest: the orchard and truffle-forager details add texture but don't fundamentally alter the arc. The binding ritual sourced from "discredited textbooks" and the sap solution feel like stock quest-object beats. The final image—studying the cracked eye as a map—is evocative but not surprising given the setup. One fresh inflection: the shift from occluding truth to "let its truth flow when the community could bear it" attempts a non-binary resolution, though it arrives through summary rather than a dramatized turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "rational truffle forager" trait is mentioned once in the opening line and never constrains a choice. The protagonist's actions—burying the eye, consulting textbooks, binding it with sap—could be performed by any careful survivor; the foraging skill never shapes tactics or options. No on-page scene shows the protagonist using precision or scientific method to solve a problem tied to the central stake.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The antique glass eye is handled in four distinct beats: discovery (touch triggers curse), burial in the cliff, uncovering at dawn (forces truth-telling), and final study as "a map of cracks." It drives two major turns (initial curse, dawn revelation) and charges the final image. Its specific properties (cloudy iris, cracked surface, gaze that whispers) are irreplaceable. The binding ritual shapes middle tactics. Closure linkage is strong. Early signal and beat involvement push it toward the essential band, though the binding method (linen-wrapped, sap-soaked) feels late and convenient, slightly reducing irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "smuggled relic" concept frames the external threat (patrols hunting relics) and the protagonist's choice to hide the eye. It appears in the opening third and motivates the burial decision, satisfying setup and one middle beat. However, the patrols never arrive on the page, so the smuggled status doesn't create visible cost or constrain the climactic choice to reveal the eye. The concept shapes background stakes but doesn't drive the closure action. Swappable with "forbidden artifact" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "involuntarily truthful" attribute is triggered by touching the eye and forces the protagonist to speak "raw honesty" at the dawn scene, driving one major turn. It also motivates the search for a cure (middle development) and the need for the binding ritual. However, no specific secret or lie the protagonist must reveal is dramatized—truthfulness remains abstract. The trait constrains two beats and enables the closure moment (shared truth-telling), but we never see a concrete instance where the protagonist fights the compulsion or pays a personal price for what they're forced to say.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Occlude" is the protagonist's dominant verb: they bury the eye to "occlude its gaze," seek to "occlude the relic's sight," hope rock will "occlude its power," and ultimately learn "to occlude its power when needed." The action shapes three beats (burial, search for cure, binding method) and the final equilibrium. The word's six repetitions signal structural importance, and the protagonist's realization that they must selectively occlude (not permanently) forms the thematic hinge. However, the physical act of occlusion is never shown in granular detail—wrapping in linen is mentioned but not staged—so the mechanics remain summary-level. Essential to the concept but not irreplaceable in execution (could be "conceal," "veil").</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "rumored cures in discredited textbooks" are introduced at the midpoint, frame the protagonist's research effort, and provide the binding ritual (hair strand, later sap-soaked linen). The method appears in three beats: the desperate search, the ritual's requirements, and the final sap solution. However, the textbooks are never shown on the page—no passage read, no failed attempt dramatized—so the method remains summary. The sap cure arrives late (final third) and resolves the problem without prior setup, capping the score. Functional across beats but the mechanics are told rather than enacted.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The "hanging orchard in a ravine battered by storms" is vividly established in the opening line and recurs in four beats: opening description, the orchard groaning as trees "trying to speak," the storm pause at dawn, and the closing image of ropes anchoring it. The storms pressure the protagonist's emotional state through pathetic fallacy and the orchard's shift from "decay" to "healing" mirrors the community arc. The ravine cliff supplies the hiding place (burial hollow). However, the setting never forces a tactical choice—the protagonist's decisions would work in any isolated, storm-prone location. The ropes in the penultimate paragraph add a practical constraint but arrive late. Strong lyric reprise (first line to final paragraph) with thematic weight, satisfying setup and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The "after the empathy virus" timeframe anchors the world's rules (truth-telling is dangerous, relics are hunted) and explains why psychological safety is fragile. It appears in the opening phrase and the settlement's "constant fear." However, the timeframe never tightens a decision—no countdown, no advancing threat from patrols, no urgency tied to when the virus struck or how long the protagonist has been foraging. The "days that followed" summary in the final third diffuses rather than sharpens time. Present in setup but does not constrain middle or closure choices. Replaceable with any post-catastrophe backdrop.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to cultivate psychological safety" is stated explicitly in the opening third and drives the protagonist's choices: hiding the eye to protect villagers, seeking a cure to control the curse, and ultimately teaching measured truth-telling. It shapes three beats (burial, cure-search, dawn revelation) and the closure equilibrium. However, the desire is articulated in prompt language ("cultivate psychological safety," "fragile space") rather than embodied through a specific fear or memory that would make the stake personal. The protagonist's internal conflict—balancing truth against safety—is told more than dramatized. Functional and present across the arc but lacks friction between competing wants with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Fractured grace" coheres in diction (splinter, shard, crack, scent of healing) and the orchard's dual imagery (storm-battered yet ripening). The tone modulates: lyric and reflective in description, urgent at the dawn turn, quieter and studious in the closing paragraph. The final image of the cracked glass eye as "a map of cracks" and "fractured grace that promised we might survive our own honesty" charges the ending with the exact tonal blend of brokenness and hope. The phrase "fractured grace" appears once, late, which slightly reduces teachability, but the tone's emotional register is stable and purposeful throughout. Strong closure linkage and cadence control earn it mid-7s eligibility; the lack of tonal contrast under peak pressure (dawn scene feels summarized rather than lived) keeps it just below.</comment>
