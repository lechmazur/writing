<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's arc from isolation to community conduit is present, though her interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("translator between generations," "currency of loss") rather than embodied contradiction. The turn from selling penny verses to giving sound-infused poems away shows renunciation with cost, but the decision arrives through summary rather than a dramatized internal conflict where competing impulses act simultaneously. The phrase "positively wistful in her lonesome splendor" reads as authorial assertion rather than earned character particularity. Micro-choices exist (opening jars, writing with sound) but the protagonist's flaws and blind spots remain decorative rather than driving inevitable mistakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who and where early; the drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with lyric patterning taught through repeated "dawn's earliest whistle" and jar-stacking motifs. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the protagonist shifts from vagrant penny-seller to rooted conduit, opening one jar daily with visible relational cost (now dependent on others' stories). The cost is legible in "no longer vagrant, but rooted in the invisible architecture of sound." One meaningful deepening occurs when she opens all jars at the solstice, reweighting her role from hoarder to distributor. Minor causality skip: the music box suddenly "offered different memories when coaxed with different pressures" without prior setup of this mechanic.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The feral loft beneath dunes supplies recurring sensory anchors (sand breathing through walls, rotting ladder, damp corners) and the jar collection constrains her final choice to open them. "Dawn's earliest whistle" recurs to charge the ending image and structures the temporal frame. The glass jars function as micro-setting that evolves from beach detritus to glowing archive, directly enabling the climax action. Spatial choreography remains coherent (ladder, pallet, floor). One subtraction: the tourist beaches and boardwalk cafés are mentioned but never pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (redemption through preservation) is signaled early and tightens when she opens all jars, forcing her to choose between hoarding and releasing. The opening action introduces visible cost (poems now "given to the wind" rather than sold, altering her livelihood), and the tourist/librarian responses confirm relational change. One meaningful deepening: the shift from selling for pennies to accepting stories as currency. However, escalation relies on accumulation rather than a reversal that narrows options, and the climax (opening jars) faces no on-page resistance or competing pressure. The music box's sudden ability to yield different memories when "coaxed with different pressures" introduces a convenience that bypasses earned struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (translation of loss into living memory, preservation as generational bridge) emerges through concrete image work: jars as captured sound, condensed notes as ink, verses that hum. The final image—one jar opened daily to sweeten morning air—offers a resonant answer to the redemption question without stating a moral. Subtext operates in "the weight of captured sound pressed against her chest at night, a new kind of poverty richer than any she'd known." One slip: "to become the translator between generations" and "sweeten the bitter notes of forgetting" edge toward thematic echo in the middle section, though the ending image redeems this with specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance; narrative diction ("feral loft," "lonesome splendor," "invisible architecture of sound") sustains a lyric register appropriate to a poet protagonist. Perceptual signature shows in how she notices sound and texture ("melody that tasted of honey and rust"). Two slips lower the score: "positively wistful in her lonesome splendor" reads as narrator commentary rather than character-filtered observation, and several passages ("redemption, she believed, could only be gleaned") use elevated abstraction that sits uneasily with the sensory specificity elsewhere. No dialogue on the page to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lyric patterning ("dawn's earliest whistle") and sensory specificity ("varnish peeled like old sunburn," "notes stain the page") create texture, but multiple artifacts lower the score. Paraphrase loop: "She couldn't bear to lose it. / That's when she remembered..." recaps motivation already implied. Template cadence in the jar-filling section: "Some contained... Others held... A few jars caught... One jar captured..." runs four parallel stems without payoff. Register drift: "gleaned redemption," "currency of loss," and "invisible architecture" elevate diction beyond the established voice in peak beats. The phrase "the vagrant penny poet, positively wistful in her lonesome splendor" stacks modifiers that blur rather than sharpen. Combined artifact penalty and mid-passage sluggishness prevent higher placement.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The core synthesis—capturing ephemeral sound in jars as metaphor for preserving generational memory—offers a fresh angle on legacy and artist-as-archivist themes. The music box yielding different memories under different pressures and sound condensing as "singable light" show imaginative specificity. However, the vagrant-poet-finds-redemption-through-art frame follows a recognizable template, and the turn from isolation to community via magical object leans on convenience (the music box's mechanics arrive without cost or struggle). The ending's one-jar-daily ritual feels earned by prior accumulation, lifting the score into mid-range, but the lack of a non-obvious moral calculus or risky structural choice keeps it from higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Vagrant penny poet is seeded early, drives the jar-collecting choice (middle), and her identity shift to "rooted conduit" anchors the closure. Her specific occupation (selling verses for pocket change, writing with sound-ink) creates distinct tactics. Two-of-three gates met; causal pressure present in her decision to open jars and shift from selling to giving. Specificity and closure linkage elevate; slight swappability (another artist type could perform similar arc with edits) and summary-heavy execution in the final third prevent higher score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Forgotten music box is introduced early (Tuesday discovery), handled in two distinct beats (winding with paperclip, placing in jar), and its mechanics enable the entire jar-collection sequence. It supplies the melodies that become ink for final poems, directly shaping closure. High irreplaceability (its ability to yield different memories is unique) and causal pressure (without it, no captured sound). One friction: the box's rule that "different pressures" yield different memories arrives without setup, reducing felt cost. All three gates met; strong closure linkage and beat involvement justify high placement.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Gleaned redemption is stated early ("redemption, she believed, could only be gleaned from the scattered fragments") and returns at closure ("realized she had finally gleaned her redemption"). It frames the dominant stake and the protagonist's final shift from vagrant to rooted translator answers the redemptive question. However, much of its work is thematic echo rather than on-page constraint; it does not narrow a middle choice or impose visible cost. Lyric early–final reprise reweights meaning but lacks development beats. Two-of-three gates (setup, payoff) met; swappability moderate (other redemption language could substitute).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Positively wistful appears once in the final section as narratorial gloss ("The vagrant penny poet, positively wistful in her lonesome splendor") without constraining action or enabling a choice. It reads as label rather than trait demonstrated through micro-decisions. Setup and development gates missing; only a cameo near closure. No causal work; highly swappable. Ornamental use and late first mention trigger caps.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sweeten is seeded in the music box melody ("tasted of honey and rust"), developed when she realizes "translation required... to sweeten the bitter notes of forgetting," and charges the final image ("releasing a single memory to sweeten the morning air"). It shapes her shift from preservation to distribution and anchors the thematic question. All three gates met; causal pressure in her choice to open jars and give verses rather than hoard. Irreplaceability high (the honey/sweetening metaphor threads through). One friction: the concept does more thematic than tactical work; it does not impose a middle constraint with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Capturing sounds in glass jars is introduced early (remembering tourist beach jars), executed in a distinct beat (sealing music box with wax, melody condensing as light), developed through weeks of jar-filling, and drives the climax (opening all jars at once). The method's mechanics (wax seal, condensation against glass) matter and enable the sound-as-ink innovation. All three gates met; high causal pressure and irreplaceability. Closure linkage strong (jars opened to create the final poems). One friction: the mechanics arrive suddenly without prior trial-and-error cost, slightly reducing integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Feral loft beneath the dunes is anchored early, supplies recurring sensory detail (sand, damp corners, rotting ladder), and houses the jar archive that enables closure. The setting's "invisible architecture of sound" reframes it at the end. Two-of-three gates met (setup, payoff); lyric reprise reweights meaning. However, the loft does not constrain a middle choice or impose spatial obstacle; it functions more as atmospheric container than tactical pressure. Moderate irreplaceability (another isolated dwelling could substitute with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>At dawn's earliest whistle recurs three times (opening, middle, closure) to frame temporal rhythm and charges the final image (opening one jar daily at dawn). It signals the protagonist's ritual and anchors the story's lyric structure. Two-of-three gates met (setup, payoff); the reprise reweights prior material. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or alter tactics in the middle; it functions as atmospheric marker rather than live clock. Moderate swappability (another time-of-day could serve similar structural role).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>To become the translator between generations is stated early ("Her motivation had always been simple"), developed when she realizes translation requires preservation, and answered at closure (she becomes "the conduit through which the past could sweeten the present"). It frames the dominant stake. Two-of-three gates met (setup, payoff); causal linkage moderate. One significant friction: the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants; no on-page scene shows her struggling between translator-desire and another competing need. Development gate weak (no middle choice where this motivation costs her something tangible).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Lonesome splendor operates throughout: the isolated loft, her solitary jar-work, and the final phrase "positively wistful in her lonesome splendor" before she opens the loft to community. Tone modulates from isolation to connection, charging the closure shift. All three gates met (setup in early diction, middle jar-stacking solitude, ending reframe). However, the tone is more consistent atmosphere than pressure that forces stance crystallization; it does not constrain a choice with cost. Moderate irreplaceability (another melancholic-yet-elevated tone could substitute).</comment>
