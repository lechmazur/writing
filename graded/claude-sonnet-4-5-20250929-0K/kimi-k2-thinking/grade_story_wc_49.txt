<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to restore the ritual is clear and sustained, but her characterization leans on type ("whimsical tinkerer") rather than embodied contradiction. The choice to sing is presented as inevitable discovery rather than a decision under pressure; no competing impulse complicates her action. The villagers' tears and the elders' remembered youth feel summarized rather than dramatized through micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: dawn hush → song → vine revival → community gathering builds through density and a cadence shift at closure. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening arbor description. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the sacred practice restored as "living thread"), but cost remains abstract—no visible forfeiture or path foreclosed on the page. The "remedy" arc (weeks of tinkering → forgotten song) functions but the song's mechanics are asserted rather than tested against resistance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The verdant arbor at dawn anchors setting early and supplies the tendril as a recurring micro-object. Sensory detail is selective (pale blush, cool bark, silver moonlight) and POV-filtered through Elara's tinkerer lens (toolbox rattle, old copper scent). The arbor constrains the ritual spatially but does not force a tactical choice—Elara always has access. Spatial choreography remains clear across the gathering scene, though the shift from solitary morning to evening crowd skips the transition work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore the Golden Vein ritual—is signaled early and sustained. The single meaningful turn is Elara's song reviving the vine, but no live option is foreclosed; singing succeeds without trade-off or visible price. The weeks of failed tinkering are told in summary, so the pivot to song lacks on-page discovery friction. The harvest moon deadline imposes a clock, yet Elara completes the task "on the final morning" without dramatized cost or competing pressure that forces a sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of tradition's restoration emerges through the vine, song, and harvest moon convergence without overt statement. The final image (arbor as "living thread") reweights the premise from relic to community fabric, achieving Conceptual Repricing. However, the answer feels predetermined—no counter-reading or ambiguity complicates the restoration. The elders' tears and "sacred practice" phrasing risk sentimental abstraction; the music box buried as insurance is a neat symbol but arrives after emotional closure, diluting cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with Elara as focalizer; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature (tinkerer's toolbox rattle, "threads" and "coil" diction) is consistent but not deeply idiosyncratic. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("verdant arbor," "gathering hush") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. No dialogue on the page. Psychic distance holds steady, though the shift to villagers' collective experience in the final third ("curious folk," "elders who had long given up") broadens the lens without confusion.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is clear and rhythmically controlled, with varied sentence openings and no major loops. Minor scaffold appears: "The tendril stretched, coiling anew" and "a fresh sprout emerged" restate vine revival across adjacent beats without added pressure (−0.2). "Gathering hush" recurs as a phrase without evolving meaning, reading as motif-checklist rather than pressure accumulation. Figurative density ("golden threads," "breath of a song," "sacred silence") is high but legible and voice-consistent. Information density is moderate; several lines do double duty (e.g., "toolbox rattling" conveys both object and character trait).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—tinkerer restores forgotten ritual through rediscovered song—follows a familiar template (lost knowledge recovered, community healed). Transformation is limited: swap names and the arc functions unchanged. The harvest moon and Golden Vein ritual supply specificity, but the vine's revival via song feels predetermined rather than earned through non-obvious synthesis. The music box buried as failsafe is a thoughtful detail yet arrives post-climax, reading as insurance rather than ingenuity under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's choice to sing the forgotten song is the key turn, satisfying Development and Payoff gates. However, Setup is thin—"whimsical tinkerer" is told via label and toolbox rattle without a prior on-page micro-choice that reveals her tinkering nature under pressure. The song decision feels like discovery rather than a decision between competing options, limiting causal pressure. Present in three beats (arrival, song, demonstration) but swappable with "determined scholar" or "devoted priestess" with minor edits. Early signal +0.3, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, swappability −0.6, ornamental setup (label-only trait) −0.5. Caps: no gate missing; late element and swap caps do not apply. Band guidance suggests mid-5s for functional integration without irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Vine tendril is Setup (withered coil in opening), Development (drinks the sound, green blush returns), and Payoff (spins golden stories at closure). Handled across at least four beats: initial withered state, revival during song, demonstration to villagers, and harvest moon spinning. The tendril's state constrains the ritual's viability and its transformation drives the closure image. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (revival enables ritual) +1.0, closure linkage (spins stories at moon) +1.2, specificity (silken coil, dry tendril) +0.5. No major frictions. Band guidance and positive signals place this in upper 7s; irreplaceability is strong but the tendril does not impose a tactical trade-off or visible cost, keeping it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Harvest moon is Setup (three nights away), Development (imposes deadline pressure), and Payoff (rises to trigger story-spinning). It shapes the timeframe and anchors the ritual's culmination. Early signal +0.4, two beats (deadline, final rising) +0.9, closure linkage (moon rises, tendril spins) +0.9, causal pressure (clock tightens urgency) +0.6. However, the moon does not alter tactics on the page—Elara completes the task before the deadline without a trade-off forced by the moon's timing. Swappability −0.4 (any seasonal marker could serve). Band guidance suggests mid-6s for solid presence with moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Spins golden stories" is Setup (promised in the ritual description), absent in Development (the spinning is not attempted or constrained mid-story), and Payoff (occurs at closure and demonstration). The attribute describes the vine's output but does not constrain Elara's actions or impose a cost. Early signal +0.3, one beat (closure demonstration) +0.4, closure linkage +0.8, ornamental use (description without action pressure) −0.7, swappability −0.5 (could be "weaves memories" or "roots blessings"). Missing Development gate caps at 3.4; lyric reprise allowance lifts to ~4.8 because the final image reweights the stake (stories now spin anew). Band guidance and caps converge at upper 4s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Remedy" is Setup (Elara seeks the remedy, believes it lies in song), Development (song is the remedy applied), and Payoff (remedy works, vine revives). The action drives the central turn. Early signal +0.5, two beats (seeking, applying) +0.9, causal pressure (remedy enables revival) +1.2, closure linkage +1.0. However, the remedy is discovered off-page (weeks of tinkering summarized) and applied without on-page friction or failed attempt, reducing irreplaceability. Summary-only friction (seeking phase told, not shown) −0.5, swappability −0.4 (song/ritual/water could substitute). Band guidance places this in upper 6s for strong presence with moderate cost visibility.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Through forgotten songs" is Setup (Elara recalls the melody), Development (song coaxes vine to life), and Payoff (song's preservation in music box ensures future use). The method is signaled, applied with specificity (notes drift, vine drinks sound), and its mechanics matter to the revival. Early signal +0.4, three beats (recall, application, preservation) +1.4, causal pressure (method enables the turn) +1.2, closure linkage +0.8, specificity (melody particulars) +0.4. Late preservation beat −0.2 (music box arrives post-climax). Band guidance suggests low-7s for essential method with solid integration and one post-closure addition that dilutes peak focus.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Verdant arbor at dawn is Setup (opening location), Development (arbor holds the vine, villagers gather there), and Payoff (arbor described as place of "quiet magic" at closure). The setting houses the action and supplies the micro-object (tendril) but does not force a tactical choice or constrain access. Early signal +0.6, two beats (opening, gathering) +0.9, closure linkage (final image anchored there) +0.8, causal pressure (arbor is the ritual site) +0.5. Postcard friction (described as backdrop without altering moves) −0.4, swappability −0.3 (any sacred grove could serve). Band guidance places this in mid-to-upper 6s for solid anchoring with moderate tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"When everything aligns" timeframe is Setup (dawn hush, final morning), Development (aligns sky/breeze/memory at the moment of song), and Payoff (alignment acknowledged at closure). The temporal convergence is described as the perfect moment but does not impose a live cost—Elara completes the task on schedule without a forced trade-off or missed window. Early signal +0.4, two beats (dawn alignment, closure reflection) +0.9, closure linkage +0.6, causal pressure (alignment enables song's success) +0.5. However, the alignment is asserted rather than tested; no counter-pressure threatens the timing. Ornamental friction (alignment told, not felt as constraint) −0.5. Band guidance suggests upper 5s for functional temporal framing with limited tactical impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Motivation "to restore sacred practices" is Setup (Elara comes to mend frayed memory), Development (her quiet flame mentioned explicitly mid-story), and Payoff (sacred practice described as living thread at closure). The desire drives the arc consistently. Early signal +0.5, three beats (arrival, mid-story flame, closure reflection) +1.4, causal pressure (motivation sustains attempts) +0.8, closure linkage +0.8. However, the motivation is told and summarized ("her motivation… had been a quiet flame") rather than dramatized through a conflicted choice or competing want. Label-only friction −0.6, ornamental mid-story declaration −0.3. Band guidance places this in mid-6s for sustained but under-dramatized drive.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Gathering hush" tone is Setup (opening hush over leaves), Development (hush deepens after song), and Payoff (hush of dawn returns in final lines). The tone recurs and modulates slightly (anticipation → sacred silence → quiet magic) but remains largely static—reverent throughout without tension or counter-mood. Early signal +0.4, three beats (opening, post-song, closure) +1.4, closure linkage (tone charges final image) +0.9, specificity (breath-held quality) +0.3. Static mood friction (no tonal shift under pressure) −0.5, ornamental recurrence (phrase repeated without evolving meaning) −0.4. Band guidance suggests mid-6s for coherent tone with limited modulation under pressure.</comment>
