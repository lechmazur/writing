<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elena's grief and its translation into research is established, and the chrysalis release offers a concrete micro-choice. However, the internal arc relies heavily on abstraction ("symphonically tuned mind," "polymer chain" metaphors) rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final lab sequence shows agency, but the ease of the polymer's success and the tidy emotional resolution ("loosened grief") undercut the felt cost of renunciation or endurance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—grief unpacks through layered images (ravine, foam, chrysalis, polymer synthesis). Orientation is clear early (ravine, Elena, chrysalis). Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (loosened grief, new polymer formula), but the cost remains abstract: the sister's absence is reframed as "connection" without a visible trade-off or foreclosed path on the page. The foam-to-polymer insight and lab success feel convenient rather than earned by prior dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The braided ravine is vividly anchored with sensory specifics (foam arabesques, dual channels, river merge). The foam's transient geometry constrains Elena's research insight and charges the final lab image. Spatial choreography is clean across ravine and lab. Micro-setting via chrysalis and polymer film also shapes closure, meeting the 9+ gate requirement of environment constraining choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (translating separation into connection) is signaled early. The foam observation tightens her research direction, but no reversal forces a trade-off or narrows live options with felt cost. The lab synthesis succeeds without complication, and the "loosened grief" resolution arrives without visible sacrifice or endurance that forecloses a prior path. Accumulative design allows quiet escalation, but this piece lacks the decisive tightening or deepening cost required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme (separation into connection, grief as weaving) emerges through concrete images—foam, chrysalis, polymer chains. The final synthesis offers a resonant answer without overt moralizing. However, thematic statements cluster late ("atonement was not a single act," "separation could be transformed") and some phrasing edges toward prompt echo ("symphonic embrace of all that is lost and found"). The foam/polymer braid is a strong particular, but the conceptual repricing remains abstract rather than undeniably charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with Elena's perceptual bias (symphonic framing, polymer metaphors). Distance is controlled; no head-hopping. The "symphonically tuned mind" and recurring musical metaphors create a distinct texture, though some register drifts into elevated abstraction ("arabesques," "duet now silenced") feel slightly ornamental rather than voice-integrated. Elision of the sister's death and the lab work is purposeful and does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings are mostly diverse. Clarity is generally maintained, though some figurative density stacks without payoff ("polymer chain," "symphonic whole," "harmonious ribbon" cluster in adjacent beats). Minor scaffold: "She felt the pieces fall into place" (paragraph 22) echoes the timeframe prompt phrasing. Paraphrase loop: paragraphs 9 and 12 restate the polymer-weaving concept without added pressure. Template cadence: "She [verb]" pattern recurs across five beats without taught effect. Apply −0.6 for loops and stem monotony, touching final third; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Grief-to-research synthesis is familiar but grounded in specific polymer chemistry and river foam observation. The braided ravine as metaphor for divergence/connection is purposeful but not highly original. The foam-pattern insight and lab success feel template-like (convenient epiphany followed by immediate synthesis). No bold structural risk; the arc follows a predictable observe-realize-synthesize path without subversion or surprising inflection.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Polymer chemist appears early, drives the foam observation (middle beat), and synthesizes the new polymer at closure. Occupation shapes perception (polymer metaphors, self-assembly insight) and the final lab action. Cost is implied (research redirection), though not sharply dramatized. Three beats, closure linkage, moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Empty chrysalis appears in opening line, is held and released mid-story, and reappears in final reflection ("empty chrysalis had become a catalyst"). Two beats with lyric reprise that reweights grief as transformation. However, the chrysalis does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; its role is symbolic rather than causal. Early seed, charged reprise, but no middle development or causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Divergent path (ravine's dual channels) is signaled early, shapes Elena's research metaphor (bridging the divide), and informs the polymer design to "close gaps." The river's merge downstream models the solution. Present in setup, middle insight, and closure synthesis. Strong causal linkage and irreplaceability; the specificity of the braided/divergent geometry drives the polymer-brush concept.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Symphonically minded is named early and recurs as metaphor ("symphonic whole," "river's symphony"). However, it remains label-only; no on-page action is constrained or enabled by this trait. Elena's choices (observing foam, releasing chrysalis, synthesizing polymer) would proceed identically without the musical framing. Ornamental texture without causal pressure or visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Atone (seeking atonement for sister's loss) is named early, drives Elena's ravine visit, and frames the chrysalis release as symbolic reconciliation. The final reflection confirms "atonement was not a single act, but a continuous weaving." Present across setup, middle action, and closure reflection. Causal role in Elena's motivation and the letting-go gesture, though the cost (loosened grief) is more told than shown.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Insight gained tracing river foam patterns is dramatized on the page (paragraph 8: foam's geometry mirrors polymer brush), shapes the middle turn, and produces the lab synthesis. The method is specific (foam arabesques, transient geometry) and irreplaceable; remove it and the polymer solution loses its anchor. Early signal, middle beat involvement, closure payoff, strong causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Braided ravine is anchored early, pressures Elena's grief (dual channels mirror her sister's choice), supplies the foam observation that unlocks the polymer insight, and its downstream merge models the solution. Setting directly constrains research direction and charges the final synthesis. Early setup, middle causal work, closure linkage, high irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>As the pieces fall into place is named explicitly (paragraph 22) and frames the shift from observation to synthesis. However, timeframe is more thematic marker than lived constraint; no ticking clock narrows Elena's choices. The phrase recurs in closure reflection but does not tighten tactics or escalate pressure. Present at middle and closure, lyric function, but low causal force.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>To translate separation into connection is stated early (paragraph 5), drives Elena's ravine reflection, shapes the foam insight (bridging the divide), and resolves in the polymer synthesis and loosened grief. Motivation is dramatized through the chrysalis release and lab work, though the friction between grief and research remains understated. Early signal, middle and closure involvement, moderate cost legibility.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Loosened grief appears at the chrysalis release (paragraph 13: "grief begin to flow rather than constrict") and anchors the closure reflection (paragraph 18: "weight of grief loosen"). Tone modulates from constricted sorrow to released flow, coherent with the accumulative lens. However, the shift feels more asserted than embodied; the final "symphonic embrace" edges toward tidy resolution without sharp cost. Present early-final, moderate modulation, but the charge is diluted by abstraction.</comment>
