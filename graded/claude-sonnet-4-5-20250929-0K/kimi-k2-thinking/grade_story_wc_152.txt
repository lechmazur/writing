<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority relies heavily on abstract metaphor ("silence held its breath," "weight of unheard stories") rather than embodied perception. Her decision to act—folding the tapestry and stepping into the corridor—arrives but feels reactive rather than driven by contradictory impulses acting in scene. The "disguised wisdom as foolishness" attribute is asserted ("To the casual eye she seemed a foolish old woman") but never dramatized through an on-page choice or social friction. Emotional states remain poetic but lack the micro-choices under pressure that would ground her agency.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and remain stable. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through pattern, metaphor density, and cadence rather than causal turns. Closure attempts a Charged Poise—Mira steps forward with the secret, crystallizing her stance—but the cost is more asserted ("the echoed silence held its breath") than felt in a specific forfeiture or tactical constraint. The conspiracy unfolds largely in summary ("hidden meetings and coded messages") rather than through on-page beats that narrow her options, weakening the reweighting at the end.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory and eternal candle are vividly rendered and recur throughout, establishing a coherent atmosphere. The flame functions as both sensory anchor and symbolic constraint (its flicker signals narrowing possibilities). However, the setting mostly serves as backdrop; spatial details (stone floor, iron stand, corridors) do not materially constrain Mira's choices or tactics. The autumn leaves scraping the floor and the observatory absorbing light are atmospheric but do not directly shape the final decision or image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preventing the coup by sharing the unheard story—is signaled early but remains abstract. Pressure accumulates via metaphor and imagery (the flame's flicker, the tapestry glowing) rather than tactical narrowing or trade-offs. The one meaningful tightening occurs when Mira confirms the coup's timing and decides to act, but the cost of that choice (whom to trust, what she risks) is posed as a question rather than faced on the page. The resolution—stepping into the corridor—reconfigures her stance but does not show a visible price paid or a live option foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme of unheard stories and listening to silence emerges clearly through particulars (the flame, the stitches, the secret star). However, the final image leans on direct thematic statement ("I will not let your stories fade") rather than allowing the act itself to answer the question non-literally. The tapestry's glowing and the message it reveals serve the plot but do not deepen the thematic question in an unexpected way. The piece avoids moralizing but also avoids meaningful ambiguity—Mira's stance is heroic and uncontested.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited and the perceptual signature is consistent—poetic, attuned to silence and light. However, diction frequently drifts into elevated, abstract register ("galaxy-chart embroiderer," "adjacent possibilities," "echoed silence") that reads as authorial rather than character-specific. Purposeful compression (e.g., "whispered secrets," "blue-white heart") is present but the rhythm flattens under metaphor density in high-pressure beats. No dialogue appears, so voice distinction is not tested. Filter verbs and stock metaphors ("breath caught," "heart beat in time") appear in peak moments without fresh texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Metaphor density is high throughout and many images contradict or blur ("leaves scraped like whispered secrets," "silence held its breath," "fabric became a tapestry of hidden maps"). Paraphrase loops are frequent: "She stitched a secret star" / "each stitch a question posed" / "She stitched faster" / "she had stitched" recycle the same action without advancing pressure. Template cadence runs appear ("Mira believed... Mira felt... Mira understood..."). Line-level opacity and stock phrasing ("breath caught," "heart beat in time," "walked onward") dull the closure beat. Applying −1.2 for density/loop/template issues distributed across the text, including the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The combination of embroidery, eternal flame, and conspiracy detection offers a fresh surface but the emotional arc (wise woman acts to prevent coup) follows a familiar template. The "adjacent possibilities" concept and "synchronize stitches with flame" are intriguing but remain ornamental—mechanics are asserted, not dramatized in a choice under pressure. The piece commits to its lyric premise but retreats from specificity when stakes demand it (the conspiracy is "hidden meetings," the trusted ally is never named). No bold structural or perspectival risk heightens the ending.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and her choices (stitching the secret star, folding the tapestry, stepping into the corridor) shape the narrative. However, her role as galaxy-chart embroiderer is more label than constraint—any artisan could serve the same function with minor edits. The embroidery itself does not impose a visible cost or tactical limitation; it is a vehicle for symbolic work rather than a skill that alters her options. Setup clear, middle and closure participation present, but swappability and lack of causal pressure limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The eternal candle appears in multiple beats: Mira synchronizes stitches with its rhythm, it illuminates the secret star, it flickers to signal narrowing possibilities, and it lights her path at the end. The flame's behavior is tied to adjacent possibilities and Mira responds to its cues. However, the mechanics remain asserted rather than dramatized—the flame does not impose a visible constraint or cost on Mira's choices. Strong setup, middle use, and closure participation, but the element could be replaced with another oracle-like signal without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Unraveling conspiracies is the core premise and shapes the dominant stake. Mira stitches a secret star, the flame reveals a pattern, and a hidden message emerges. However, the conspiracy itself is summarized ("hidden meetings and coded messages") rather than dramatized through specific beats that alter Mira's options. The concept drives the plot at a high level but does not constrain tactics or force trade-offs on the page. Setup, middle development, and closure participation all present, but lack of specificity and causal pressure prevent a higher score.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The attribute "disguises wisdom as foolishness" is stated early ("To the casual eye she seemed a foolish old woman, babbling about star stories no one cared to hear") but never enacted. No on-page character challenges or dismisses Mira; no social friction tests the disguise. The veil is asserted but does not enable or constrain a choice with visible cost. Setup present but no middle development or closure participation. Ornamental mention without integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Synchronization appears in multiple beats: Mira synchronizes her stitches with the flame's rhythm, the tapestry glows as if stars awaken, and the final image shows her heart beating in time with the flame. The action is thematically resonant and recurs with reweighted meaning at the end. However, the mechanics of synchronization remain metaphorical—it does not impose a tactical constraint or visible cost. Strong early signal and closure linkage earn credit, but lack of causal pressure limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Adjacent possibilities are mentioned twice: Mira "threaded the needle" through them and the eternal candle's flicker mirrors "a change in the adjacent possibilities." The concept is intriguing but its mechanics are never explained or dramatized. It does not shape Mira's tactics or constrain her choices on the page. The method appears in setup and middle but remains ornamental, a label rather than a functional element. Swappable with any mystical detection method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory in autumn is vividly rendered (stone floor, iron stand, cobalt walls absorbing light, leaves scraping) and recurs throughout. The setting establishes atmosphere and the observatory's walls "seemed to listen," adding mild paranoia. However, the environment does not materially constrain Mira's choices or provide resources that affect the outcome. Spatial details serve as backdrop rather than shaping tactics. Strong setup and closure presence, but lack of causal pressure on choices limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "before the coup" is established early and the tapestry reveals "The coup will rise with the harvest moon." The temporal pressure is asserted ("time was running out") but not dramatized through a live clock or deadline that alters Mira's tactics. The harvest moon is mentioned once without follow-up. Setup present, mild middle signal, but the timeframe does not constrain choices or charge the closure image. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to listen for unheard stories is stated early and recurs ("She would find the one who still listened," "I will not let your stories fade"). The desire drives her actions (embroidering, listening to the flame, stepping into the corridor) but is never conflicted or tested against a competing want. No visible cost or friction dramatizes the motivation. Setup, middle use, and closure participation all present, but the motivation remains uncontested and does not force a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Echoed silence is the dominant tone and recurs throughout: "Silence hung in the air," "a whisper of ancient light that spoke in silence," "the echoed silence of the observatory," "the one whose ears were tuned to silence." The tone is coherent and modulates with pressure (the silence "held its breath" at the end). It charges the final image and supports the theme. However, the tone sometimes flattens into poetic abstraction rather than intensifying under stress. Strong setup, middle use, and closure linkage earn credit.</comment>
