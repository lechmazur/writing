<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The lantern maker's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. Interior states read as summary labels ("hollow," "grief") without contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The shadow's departure and the daughter's death are told in past-perfect recap; no on-page moment forces a trade-off that reveals character hierarchy. The final reunion with the shadow arrives without visible cost or renunciation—the protagonist continues her work unchanged, reading as stasis without the foreclosed path required for Earned Stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty applied: who/where/when anchors emerge piecemeal across the opening third without a clear anchor by ~120 words; reader must assemble "lantern maker on floating island after shadow left" from distributed fragments (−0.4). The piece unfolds as accumulative texture—polishing dreams, folding cranes—but no on-page beat narrows options or changes knowledge with visible cost. The ending reunites shadow and daughter's breath in a final lantern, yet this arrives as summary declaration ("she placed it inside") without a prior constraint or trade-off; closure reads as awarded fulfillment rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The glass basilica, tea garden, and floating island are vividly rendered ("spires catching light," "night-blooming jasmine"), but function as backdrop. No environmental detail constrains a choice or charges the final image; the basilica's "descending while ascending" spiral is named but never used tactically. The leaves turning to glass in the penultimate paragraph is decorative rather than causal. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recovering the daughter's breath—is declared early but never tested on the page. The lantern maker polishes gems and folds cranes in repeated cycles without a reversal or tightening that narrows options. The shadow "steps from beneath the island" in the final paragraph and returns the breath without the protagonist paying a visible price or making a trade-off. Coincidence resolves the stake; agency is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme of grief-as-transformation emerges from the polishing and folding motif, and "luminous torment" recurs to charge the mood. Yet the ending offers no non-literal answer or reweighting; the protagonist receives her daughter's breath back in a final lantern and "continues to descend while ascending," a symmetrical loop that restates rather than reprices the premise. The piece gestures toward complexity but lands on tidy fulfillment without ambiguity or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds stable focal distance and the prose carries a lyric, elevated texture ("each fold was a descent into memory"). Register remains consistent—no head-hopping or filter-verb stacks. However, perceptual signature is generic: the lantern maker's way of noticing does not reveal character-specific bias or hierarchy. Diction occasionally drifts into prompt-echo phrasing ("luminous torment," "recorded dream") that feels imposed rather than voice-motivated.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade the text. Lines 9–10 restate "searching for innocence" in synonym churn; lines 14–15 loop "fold/crease/descent/ascent" without added pressure. Paragraph-long runs of "She [verb]" and "The [noun]" stems ("She worked," "She descended," "She found," "The method," "The polishing," "The shadow") flatten rhythm (−1.0). Figurative density is high ("wound becoming instrument," "each callus a successful transformation") but vehicles often contradict physics (cranes that "sang" and "flew and fell" without clear mechanism). Artifacts touch the closure beat ("she placed it inside a final lantern") with summary rather than scene (−1.7 total in Q7; disallow 9+ globally).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The core synthesis—grief materialized through gem-polishing into origami cranes on a floating island—is vivid and internally coherent. The "descends while ascending" paradox and shadow detachment frame a fresh angle on loss. However, the piece does not transform these elements through lived cost or non-obvious moral calculus; the lantern maker receives her desired outcome (daughter's breath returned) without a trade-off that challenges premise. The ending's symmetry (shadow returns, work continues) reads as designed fulfillment rather than inevitable consequence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The lantern maker is named and her craft described across multiple paragraphs, but no on-page choice alters tactics or options. She polishes gems, folds cranes, and accepts dreams in repeated cycles; the shadow's return happens to her rather than through her decision. Observation and summary dominate; agency is absent at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The glass basilica appears in setup (paragraph 3), towers over the tea garden, and hums with collective dreams late (paragraph 27). It is never handled, entered, or used tactically; no choice depends on its presence. The final paragraph mentions it as locale for continued work, a static frame rather than a causal participant. Two gates (setup, payoff mention) met, but no beat involvement or cost linkage (cap 6.0 per two-gate rule; actual use functional-only, trends lower).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dream recording is introduced early (paragraph 4: "harvesting dreams"), demonstrated in the boy's dream captured in rose quartz (paragraph 11), and underpins the thousand cranes in the tea garden. It shapes the protagonist's ongoing work and the island's "recorded history" at closure. However, the concept does not narrow options or create a visible trade-off—dreams are gathered and polished without friction. Three gates met; one extended beat (paragraphs 10–13); closure mentions it but does not hinge on it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Descends while ascending" is named in paragraph 6 as architectural paradox and echoed in paragraphs 15, 20, 29, 34. It functions as thematic refrain rather than constraint; no choice depends on this attribute and no cost is tied to it. Label-only across multiple mentions without causal pressure or closure action (−0.6 for ornamental recurrence).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Transform" appears throughout: paragraph 5 ("craft both necessity and penance"), paragraph 14 ("transformation: grief becoming tangible"), paragraph 23 ("transforming darkness into fragile, singing things"), and the final union where grief is "transformed" into the diamond lantern. The action frames the dominant stake and is present at closure, but the final transformation is summarized ("she placed it inside a final lantern") rather than enacted with visible cost. Three gates met; closure linkage present but summary-only at the peak (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Gem polishing is introduced in paragraph 5 ("each dream captured in raw crystal, then faceted"), detailed in paragraph 11 (rose quartz, four days faceting), refined in paragraph 24 ("learned to cut hope into facets"), and underpins the final diamond lantern. The method shapes two distinct beats (rose quartz crane, collective dreams into cranes) and is causally necessary for the protagonist's craft. Setup, development, and payoff gates all met; beat involvement moderate; no single choice hinges on polishing mechanics versus another method (swappability present but limited).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The tea garden circles the basilica, hosts the night-blooming jasmine, and holds the thousand cranes. It recurs across paragraphs (7, 13, 19, 22, 29, 35) and supplies the midnight folding site. However, it functions as static locale; no environmental feature constrains a tactic or alters a choice. The leaves turning to glass (paragraph 30) is decorative. Setup and payoff present, but no development pressure; lyric reprise without cost linkage trends mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"After the shadow detached" anchors the timeframe in paragraph 2 ("three mornings past") and paragraph 9 echoes "the shadow had taken her daughter's final breath with it." The shadow's return occurs "at her thousandth crane" (paragraph 29), implying elapsed duration. However, no scene clock tightens decisions; the timeframe is backdrop rather than pressure. Setup present, but no tactical constraint or urgency tied to time passing (missing middle gate; cap 4.6; trends lower within that band).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The motivation is declared in paragraph 8 ("to fold grief into origami cranes that might seek her lost shadow") and drives the polishing/folding cycle across paragraphs 10–22. Paragraph 29 shows the thousandth crane triggering the shadow's return, and paragraph 30 places the daughter's breath in the final lantern. Setup, development (crane-making), and payoff all present. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants; no on-page moment forces a trade-off between folding and another path. Three gates met; moderate causal pressure but no visible friction or cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Luminous torment" is named in paragraph 16 and recurs in paragraphs 17, 22, 27. The tone of grief made radiant pervades: "wound becoming instrument," "grief so bright it cast no shadows," "polished tears." Tone modulates from hollow loss (opening) to collective resonance (basilica hums, visitors hear singing) and is present in the final image ("wakefulness is just another kind of darkness to polish into light"). Three gates met; coherent mood charges the ending; no single beat tests tone under opposing pressure, so ceiling trends mid-7s.</comment>
