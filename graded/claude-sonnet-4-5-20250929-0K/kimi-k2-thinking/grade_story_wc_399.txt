<question>1</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The line walker remains a cipher throughout—her choices are narrated but never dramatized with contradictory impulses or embodied cost. Interiority consists entirely of abstract declarations ("her motivation crystallized") and label-only states ("strangely honest purpose") without concrete, character-particular texture. The final departure forecloses no visible path; she simply walks away after completing a task with no friction, ambivalence, or trade-off shown on the page. No micro-choices under pressure reveal a hierarchy of values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The piece signals an accumulative/textural lens early but never tightens or deepens pressure—sand parts, stone pulses, echo preserved, walker leaves—without a meaningful turn or cost that narrows options. The "echo of wisdom" closure is asserted complete but the text does not show what was risked, lost, or transformed; the walker's task simply ends with no before/after legible in her situation or stance. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) appear but the dominant stake—preserve the echo—remains abstract and untested by on-page complication. The ending offers recurrence (clearings, parapet pulsing) but no resonant reconfiguration or conceptual repricing with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The murmuring pavilion, whisperfield calm, and kinetic parapet are named and described across multiple beats, but none constrains a choice or alters tactics—sand recedes when summoned, stone responds without friction. Spatial choreography is vague (pavilion "at the edge," parapet "beneath," clearings "around") with no legible distances or evolving micro-setting. The recurring motifs (murmuring, clearings, parapet pulse) charge the atmosphere but do not pressure the walker's path. Sensory detail leans heavily visual ("moonlight," "glimmer," "shimmering thread") with minimal tactile or auditory specificity beyond repeated "murmuring."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve the echo—is signaled early but never tested by complication or trade-off; the walker performs a ritual, the parapet responds, the task succeeds without reversal or tightening. No on-page moment forces a choice between competing goods or narrows options with visible cost. The prophet and the buried structure supply setup but no opposition; coincidence (the parapet answers her call) enables rather than complicates. Agency is assertion rather than decision under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme of preservation and continuity emerges through repeated images (echo, murmur, clearings) but relies on direct statement ("her task was not to keep the echo but to ensure it could be heard") rather than earned particulars. The final image recycles prior motifs (parapet pulsing, pavilion whispering) without reweighting them through visible cost or character change. Subtext is minimal; the text declares meaning rather than implying it through gesture or silence. The echo functions as an abstraction rather than a grounded object that constrains choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited but perceptual signature is generic—"peripheral awareness" and "strangely honest" are told traits without distinct lexicon or rhythm that differentiate this narrator's noticing. Diction drifts into elevated register ("sacred geometry," "testament to her strangely honest purpose") that reads imposed rather than voice-motivated. Template cadence pervades: "The [noun] [verb], [article] [noun]" recurs across dozens of lines without rhythmic variation. No dialogue on the page. Purposeful compression is signaled (lyric/accumulative mode) but the pattern does not teach a rule or pay off with reweighted cost at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Severe paraphrase loops and synonym churn: "murmuring pavilion" appears in 8 lines, "echo of wisdom" in 7, "kinetic parapet" in 9, "whisperfield calm" in 6, often in identical syntactic slots without added detail or pressure. Template stems dominate: "The [noun] [verb]" and "She [verb]" recur in nearly every paragraph. Figurative density in nearly every sentence ("seeds," "vessel," "thread," "hymn," "lullaby," "heart," "fabric") without coherent vehicle or pattern payoff. Scaffold phrases ("thus," "and the," "in the") stack without propulsion. Information density is low—most sentences restate the same action (preserve echo, parapet pulses) across 47 lines. Stock metaphors ("seeds," "thread in the fabric") appear without transformation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Core elements (half-masked walker, kinetic parapet, conjured clearings, peripheral awareness) are assembled but feel prompted rather than inevitable—swap names and the arc (seeker performs ritual to preserve artifact) remains template. No fresh inflection or turn; the walker succeeds without complication, and the ending recycles the opening's mood and imagery. The premise (hidden structure beneath desert holds ancient knowledge) matches widely used templates without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. Emotional arc is linear declaration without ambiguity or risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The half-masked line walker is present throughout and performs the central ritual, satisfying Setup and Payoff gates. However, her choices are narrated summaries ("her motivation crystallized," "she drew that thread into herself") rather than dramatized decisions that narrow options. The half-mask is mentioned four times but never constrains a tactical choice or is handled with visible cost. No middle beat shows the walker making a trade-off or adapting under pressure. Ornamental presence without causal pressure; swappable with "seeker" or "guardian" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The kinetic parapet appears in Setup (legends spoke), Development (she touches and whispers to it), and Payoff (pulsing beneath dunes at end). It is described across multiple beats but never handled in a way that alters the walker's tactics—it responds when summoned, releases the echo when consecrated, then remains static. No evolving use or cost tied to its properties. The "moving stone" quality is told but not shown affecting her approach. Functional across the arc but replaceable with "buried altar" or "hidden shrine" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Conjured clearings appear in Setup (ritual to force sand to recede), Development (circle of bare earth forms), and Payoff (clearings multiply, glowing under stars). They enable the walker to reach the parapet but do not constrain her—sand parts when she raises her hands, with no friction, cost, or tactical adaptation required. The clearings are described as "sacred geometry that locked the kinetic parapet in place" but this effect is asserted, not dramatized through choice or complication. Present across beats but ornamental; the story would function identically if the sand simply "parted" without the clearing mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Strangely honest" is mentioned three times (half-mask "strangely honest," pavilion's voice "strangely honest," her "strangely honest purpose") but only as a label. No on-page action or choice demonstrates what this trait means or how it constrains her—does honesty create vulnerability, limit deception, force disclosure? The text never shows. The trait does not shape a tactical decision or incur cost. Label-only ornament without integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Consecrate" appears in Setup (ritual to consecrate the parapet), Development (she kneels and whispers ancient words that consecrate the vessel), and Payoff (parapet "now consecrated" pulses beneath dunes). The action drives the middle beat—without it, the echo is not preserved—but the ritual itself is summarized ("whispered the ancient words") rather than dramatized with steps, friction, or cost. The act is necessary to the plot but the text does not show what consecration requires of her or how it transforms the parapet. Functional but summarized; one clear causal link without visible struggle or trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Through peripheral awareness" is mentioned in Setup (her way of discerning ley lines), Development (felt the tremor of the buried structure), and Payoff (caught the faint glimmer of the echo). It is told as her method but never shown shaping her tactics—what does peripheral awareness reveal that direct focus would miss? How does it limit or cost her? The text does not dramatize the mechanics. Present across beats but ornamental; swappable with "intuition" or "inner sight" without altering action. Label-only method without on-page constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The murmuring pavilion appears in Setup (opening line), Development (murmuring grew louder, urging her), and Payoff (resumed quiet murmuring, whispered blessing). It frames the setting and recurs across the arc, but does not constrain the walker's choices or supply resources—its murmurs "urge" but she was already committed. The pavilion stands as a static anchor rather than a pressure that alters tactics. Recurrent framing device with thematic charge at the end, but no micro-setting use that changes her approach. Purposeful reprise without causal grip; eligible mid-band on closure linkage and early signal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"After the prophet arrives" is signaled in Setup (line 2) and mentioned again at Payoff ("the prophet's arrival was no longer a moment but a continual presence"). The timeframe establishes the inciting urgency but does not track a live clock or tighten decisions—there is no deadline, no racing dawn, no cost for delay. The "after" is static context rather than a ticking constraint. Present in framing but does not pressure tactics or shape the closure image with temporal cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"To preserve the echo of wisdom" is signaled in Setup ("her motivation crystallized"), drives Development (she draws the echo into herself, ensures it can be heard), and is declared complete at Payoff. The desire is told rather than dramatized through friction—no competing want, no moment where preserving the echo costs her something else she values. The task succeeds without ambivalence or trade-off shown on the page. Motivation is clear and present across the arc but lacks conflicted choice or visible sacrifice. Functional without felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Whisperfield calm" appears in Setup (line 1), Development (held its breath, desert held its breath), and Payoff (story settled in whisperfield calm). The tone is coherent and recurs but remains static—calm throughout, with no modulation under pressure or tonal break that charges the closure. The repeated "calm" and "murmur" create atmosphere but do not shift to reflect stakes or escalation. Stable mood without dynamic charge; purposeful framing without tonal intensification at the end.</comment>
