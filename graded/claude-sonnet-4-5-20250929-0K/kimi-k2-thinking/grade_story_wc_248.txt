<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's shift from arsonist to restorer is established, though the interiority relies heavily on abstract summary ("volcanic tenderness erupted," "analytically intuitive mind") rather than embodied contradiction. The motivation to rescue Cress's promise drives the extended painting sequence, but the weeks-long work is compressed into montage that tells rather than dramatizes micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation (staying as librarian) is credible but arrives without a visible on-page cost that forecloses an alternate path; we don't see what Kael gives up by remaining.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Kael traces ash → discovers archive → paints murals → finds vault. The orientation anchors early (volcanic foothills, archive entrance), and the final image (weeping portrait, Kael as eternal librarian) offers a Resonant Reconfiguration. However, the cost is asserted in the final lines ("guarding knowledge with a tenderness that burned eternal") rather than legible in a concrete forfeiture or visible price. The Fibonacci cipher and dawn-angle calculation arrive as convenient solutions without prior dramatization of how Kael's choices shaped or risked the discovery.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The archive setting is vivid and functional: steam, sulfur, limestone chambers, bioluminescent fungi, and three natural skylights all anchor the space concretely. The dawn-angle geometry constrains the final reveal, and the pigments Kael mines by hand charge the murals with physicality. Minor slip: the spatial choreography of "hundreds of chambers" and "winding passages" remains vague during the weeks of work; we never learn how Kael navigates or prioritizes them.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is rescuing the forgotten promise, signaled early via Cress's dying words. The tightening occurs when the faded tapestry reveals Kael's own propaganda image, forcing a reckoning with complicity—but this reversal is processed in a single paragraph of summary rather than a scene that dramatizes choice. The weeks of mural-painting compress into montage ("Each artistic creation revealed another layer"), and the vault discovery is a reward rather than a hard-won tradeoff. Cost is implied (staying forever) but not tested on the page against a competing want.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of redemption through creation versus destruction emerges clearly from Kael's arc, and the weeping restored portrait is a resonant non-literal answer. The volcanic tenderness metaphor recurs purposefully. However, the final paragraph veers toward overt moralizing: "why they stayed, and Kael would only point to the weeping portrait, where truth and forgiveness were woven into every thread" tells the theme rather than letting the image speak. The stakes remain personal; the Revisionists' broader censorship is framing device only.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited focalization is stable, and diction ("deep层 archive" intrusion aside) remains consistent with Kael's analytical yet emotionally charged perspective. The prose modulates well between catalogue detail (star maps, botanical studies) and lyric intensity ("volcanic tenderness," "breath thick with forgotten stories"). Two slips: "deep层" is untranslated code-switch without context, and the narration occasionally drifts into convenient omniscience (e.g., knowing the tapestry was slashed "with deliberate hatred" when Kael can only infer motive from artifact).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is mostly strong, with good sensory anchors (sulfur, charcoal, ochre pigment) and varied syntax. Two clusters harm momentum: the opening three paragraphs recycle "Kael + past-tense verb" stems without variation, and the middle section stacks filter verbs ("breath caught," "felt thick," "began reconstructing") that dull immediacy. The phrase "deep层 archive" is a generation artifact (Chinese character embedded without translation). Figurative language is dense but mostly controlled; "volcanic tenderness" metaphor recurs without muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise—arsonist redeems past by restoring archive—transforms a familiar redemption arc through the specific mechanics of hidden geometry and pigment craft. The propaganda tapestry twist adds fresh complication. However, the core emotional beats (guilt → penance → forgiveness through art) follow a well-worn template, and the Fibonacci cipher + dawn-angle reveal feel convenient rather than inevitable. The Revisionists remain abstract antagonists without specificity, and Kael's three years off-grid lack grounding detail that would anchor the transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael is present throughout and their decision to paint rather than burn drives the middle sequence. Setup is strong (opening line), and the final image shows them as librarian. However, the weeks of work are compressed into summary, so we don't see the iterative choices that narrow options; the major turns (discovering tapestry, finding vault) happen *to* Kael rather than arising from tactical decisions under live pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The tapestry fragment appears in the seventh chamber and triggers Kael's reckoning with their propaganda image—a strong beat. It's mentioned again in the final mural restoration. However, it's handled only once (it "dissolved at a touch"), then reconstructed in Kael's mind; the physical object doesn't return or evolve across beats. The closure reprise is thematic rather than tactile.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The vandalized self-portrait (Kael as propaganda icon, face slashed and scorched) is discovered mid-story and directly shapes the dominant stake: confronting complicity. Kael's response—restoring the portrait whole but weeping—charges the final image and reweights prior guilt. The concept drives two clear beats (discovery, restoration) and participates in closure. Strong causal linkage and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Analytically intuitive" is mentioned once in the tapestry discovery paragraph ("Kael's analytically intuitive mind began reconstructing the pattern") and again obliquely when calculating the Fibonacci progression. It's label-only; we don't see a dramatized tradeoff where intuition enables one path but forecloses another, or where the trait constrains choice under pressure. Swappable with "keen" or "pattern-recognizing."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Portray" is signaled early ("They must portray what had been destroyed") and drives the extended middle sequence: Kael paints murals that form a cipher leading to the vault. The action is irreplaceable—destroying versus creating is the thematic and tactical pivot. It shapes two major beats (decision to paint, vault discovery) and charges the ending (portrait as witness). Cost is tied to the weeks of solitary labor.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The trail of artistic creations is introduced in the decision beat ("Using charcoal from their own burned past") and unfolds across the middle: each mural reveals another layer, forming a geometric cipher. The method shapes Kael's tactics (Fibonacci progression, pigment mining, dawn-angle calculation) and enables the vault discovery. Two beats (painting sequence, coordinates reveal) and closure linkage (final mural). Mechanics are sketched but not fully dramatized; we don't see Kael puzzle through the cipher construction on the page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lost civilization archive is introduced early (para 5) and remains the primary location throughout. It supplies resources (limestone walls, pigments, bioluminescent fungi, three skylights for the dawn calculation) that directly enable Kael's tactics and the final reveal. The archive's scale and structure create both opportunity (hundreds of chambers to restore) and the constraint that shapes the ending (Kael must stay as guardian). Strong causal participation and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After going off the grid" anchors the opening (three years prior) and establishes Kael's fugitive status, which motivates the isolated archive refuge. However, the timeframe doesn't tighten decisions: the weeks Kael spends painting pass in montage without a live clock or competing deadline. The "off-grid" detail is setup only; it doesn't alter tactics or participate in closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rescuing Cress's forgotten promise ("Protect the deep层 archive") is declared in para 14 and drives the painting sequence. The motivation is told rather than shown—Cress's death is summarized, and we don't see Kael wrestle with conflicting desires (e.g., escape versus penance). The final choice to stay as librarian fulfills the promise, but the cost (what Kael forgoes) is asserted rather than dramatized. Two beats (discovery of promise, fulfillment) with closure participation, but friction between wants is minimal.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Volcanic tenderness" is introduced explicitly in para 16 ("Volcanic tenderness erupted in Kael's chest—a fury hot enough to melt stone, aimed only at their own past cowardice") and recurs in the final paragraph ("guarding knowledge with a tenderness that burned eternal, volcanic and unyielding"). The metaphor is coherent and charges both the emotional pivot and the ending. However, the tone is *declared* in label-like phrases rather than modulated through sentence rhythm and image; it's asserted more than embodied.</comment>
