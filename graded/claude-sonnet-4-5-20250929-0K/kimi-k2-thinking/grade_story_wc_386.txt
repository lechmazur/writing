<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya's interiority is present but often abstract ("weaving truth carefully" recurs as a phrase rather than embodied choice). The ghost child Elias is instrumental rather than pressuring; he points and smiles without forcing Maya to confront competing impulses. A decisive moment of salvage occurs, yet the emotional cost—whether Maya wrestles with withholding information about the mother—is told rather than shown in contradictory action. Embodied emotion appears sparingly; most beats rely on atmospheric description.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece opens in medias res at the shrine, then flashes back to months of dream analysis before moving forward to the wreck—spatial and temporal anchors shift without clear transitions, creating mild orientation debt around the 30% mark. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: dream fragments mosaic into a map, the melted globe is replaced by a pristine one, and Elias dissipates with "borrowed starlight" resonance. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (the ghost gains peace, Maya receives a dream-gift), but the cost is conceptual rather than on-page forfeit—Maya does not visibly sacrifice an alternative or face a trade-off in the final beat, only a quiet reminder of fragility. One meaningful deepening (the lullaby's recovery) tightens the emotional thread, yet the mechanics of how the dream achieves physical manifestation in the waking world are elided without pattern-teaching, weakening causal confidence at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The glacier shrine and wreck are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (ice cracking "like glass," ribs "jutting like broken promises"). Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the transition from shrine to shore to wreck interior compresses without tracking Maya's physical movement or time elapsed. The pristine snow globe's discovery in a sealed cabin supplies the key object that charges closure, so the micro-setting (the hidden compartment) constrains and enables the turn. Scope is appropriate; occupational wreck-diving detail is light but sufficient.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—salvaging a "pure memory" for Elias—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through the dream-mosaic method and the shrine ritual, leading to the wreck descent and chest discovery. However, the escalation is more procedural than agonistic: no live obstacle (other than ice) threatens Maya's goal, and no ticking constraint forces a choice between competing goods. The final recovery grants Elias peace without Maya visibly paying a price or foreclosing an alternative path; the cost is atmospheric rather than enacted. One meaningful tightening (finding the pristine globe) advances the stake, but under the Accumulative lens the closure deepening is mild.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of salvaging "pure" moments from wreckage and maintaining "fragile connections" between living and dead emerges organically from image and action. The borrowed-starlight motif recurs purposefully, reweighting at closure when Maya dreams of Elias bathed in that light and receives a tangible globe. The "windows of connection" concept operates more as metaphor than interrogated premise—no competing interpretation or moral ambiguity is tested. The final gift (pristine globe in waking hands) is earned by prior particulars and avoids overt moralizing, though the emotional truth leans toward wish-fulfillment rather than confronting the cost of mediation or the ethics of withholding the mother's death.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Voice is lyric and atmospheric, favoring poetic compression ("breath turning to silver mist," "form translucent as starlight borrowed from a distant sky"). Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-specific (e.g., "weaves truth carefully" recurs as a thematic tag rather than a perceptual signature). No dialogue on the page. Psychic distance remains consistent, though the final dream sequence's ontological shift (waking with a physical globe) is not cued by prior POV rules, creating a small unreliability question without payoff.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose is imagistic and rhythmically varied, but pervasive phrase recycling weakens momentum: "borrowed starlight" appears six times, "weaves/weaving truth carefully" four times, "windows of connection" three times, "cameo appearances" twice—each recurrence adds little new pressure. Template cadence in the middle third ("She whispered…," "She recorded…," "She traced…," "She closed…," "She rose…") creates monotony. Mixed metaphor: "ribs jutting like broken promises" anthropomorphizes the ship uncomfortably. Several beats paraphrase without advancing (e.g., paragraphs 8–10 restate the dream-analysis method). Information density is moderate; some sentences do double duty (the melted globe's glass "warped" and "catching candlelight like a star"), but scaffolding remains visible. No severe clarity breaks, yet the artifact load across peak beats (shrine ritual, wreck discovery, dream ending) lowers propulsion and disallows high-band entry.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The premise—wreck-diver ghost whisperer who analyzes strangers' dreams to recover lost memory artifacts—is specific and non-obvious, and the glacier-shrine setting adds freshness. However, the emotional arc (lonely mediator salvages pure moment, grants peace to child ghost, receives magical thank-you gift) follows a familiar template without transformation through moral ambiguity or lived detail; Maya faces no genuine friction or cost, and the ending's magical-realist gift feels convenient rather than inevitable. The borrowed-starlight motif is purposeful but leans toward decorative lyricism. The dream-cameo method is interesting yet underexplored: the mechanics and ethical stakes of entering strangers' dreams are asserted rather than dramatized. Risk-taking is present in the lyric compression and mosaic structure, but the closure's wish-fulfillment arc undercuts boldness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Maya is on the page throughout and makes decisions (kneel at shrine, trace glyph, pry door, withhold information about the mother), but many beats are procedural rather than agonistic—she follows Elias's cues without internal conflict or competing options. The choice to withhold the mother's death is told in a summary aside (paragraph 28) rather than dramatized as a stake-altering moment. She is present at closure (receives the dream-gift globe), but the final turn is granted to her rather than earned by a decision. Introduced early (paragraph 2) and involved in multiple beats (shrine, wreck, dream), yet her agency is more observational than transformative.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The melted snow globe appears early (paragraph 3), is placed on the altar (paragraph 13), and returns in the final beats when Maya places the pristine replacement beside it and later keeps the melted one on her bedside table. It anchors the lullaby memory that defines the pure moment Elias seeks, and its warped glass serves as a visual motif for fragility. However, the globe's presence in the middle beats is largely static description; it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. The closure linkage is strong (the pristine globe plays the lullaby, the melted one persists as reminder), and the duality (melted/pristine) charges the final image. Causal pressure is moderate—removing the globe would require restructuring the memory-salvage plot—but it could be replaced by another keepsake with similar edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Windows of connection" is named twice (paragraphs 9 and 14) and echoed in the final reflection (paragraph 39), but it functions as thematic label rather than on-page mechanic. The concept does not constrain Maya's choices or shape her tactics; the actual method (dream analysis) and tool (snow globe) do that work. It is introduced early but remains abstract, more a poetic frame than a story engine. No visible cost or trade-off is tied to the concept itself.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Weaves truth carefully" appears four times (paragraphs 8, 19, 27, 38) but operates as a recurring phrase rather than a trait that constrains action. The one potential dramatization—Maya choosing not to mention the mother's death—is summarized in a single line (paragraph 28) without showing the internal calculus or on-page cost. The trait does not enable or foreclose a tactic; it is label-only. Introduced early but never tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Expose" is framed as the night's goal (paragraph 12) and fulfilled when Maya pries open the compartment and reveals the pristine globe (paragraphs 24–25). The action drives the major turn (discovery of the intact memory), and the plot hinges on it. However, "expose" is more procedural unlocking than moral or relational revelation—no secret reshapes Maya's understanding or alters a relationship. The word itself recurs only once; the story could substitute "recover" or "uncover" with minor tonal shifts. Causal role is clear, but thematic charge is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Dream analysis is described in paragraphs 7–10 (Maya spent "months analyzing," recorded details, wove fragments into a mosaic map) and is the method that locates the hidden compartment. The mechanics are summarized rather than shown in real time; we do not witness a dream or Maya's interpretive process on the page. The method is introduced early and pays off when the map leads to the wreck, but it does not constrain a choice or create friction—Maya's analysis is seamless and uncontested. Functional but largely tell-only, with no visible cost or failure beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The shrine is introduced in the opening line, vividly described (ice walls, etched glyphs, candle flames), and serves as the ritual space where Maya places the globe and communes with Elias. It provides atmospheric grounding and a symbolic anchor (the glyph Maya traces, the altar as focal point). However, the shrine does not constrain Maya's choices or supply a resource she must navigate—it is backdrop for the inciting ritual, then the story moves to the wreck for the causal turn. The shrine returns briefly at closure (paragraph 33) when Maya leaves it, but the wreck site does the tactical work. Early signal, moderate specificity, but limited causal pressure beyond atmosphere.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The desire to "salvage something pure from the wreckage" is stated in the opening pages (paragraph 5: "pure memory she sought to salvage") and drives Maya's months of preparation and the night's descent. The motivation is tested when she recovers the pristine globe and Elias dissipates with peace. However, the friction between "pure" and the compromised reality (the mother also died, the melted globe is warped) is told rather than enacted in a choice—Maya simply withholds information without visible cost. The want is clear and sustained, but internal conflict is muted. Closure ties back to the motivation when Maya reflects on salvaging the lullaby, earning moderate integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Borrowed starlight" appears six times, anchoring the opening image (shrine glow), recurring through the narrative (Elias's form, the shrine's candles), and charging the final dream (Elias "bathed in borrowed starlight"). The tone is lyric, elegiac, and consistent—atmosphere modulates gently rather than swinging. The motif reweights at closure when the starlight image recurs in the dream gift, adding resonance. However, the phrase's repetition becomes decorative in the middle beats; the tone is stable but does not sharpen under pressure. Early signal, closure linkage, but mid-section use is more ornamental than integral.</comment>
