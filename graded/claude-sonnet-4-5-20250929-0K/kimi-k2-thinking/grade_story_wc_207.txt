<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is coherent and her decision-making follows from her established traits (collector, sensibly eccentric, university-associated). The psychometry reading and her final choice to become keeper rather than follow demonstrate internal consistency. However, the protagonist remains observational through most beats; her peak choice—placing the compass and walking away—feels more like ritual completion than a decision forged under contradictory pressures. The embodied emotion is thin: we're told she feels "the weight of a thirty-man expedition" but her bodily experience stays abstract throughout the descent and lagoon encounter.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density builds through layered images (vials, compass memory, lagoon's temporal strata) and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise: Mira becomes keeper, boundary marked by petrichor circle). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the loading dock opener. The closure lands on the page with conceptual cost (she empties her vials, abandons the expedition compass, carries only memory). One meaningful deepening occurs when the lagoon "remembers" after the petrichor drop, reweighting the stakes from personal archive to threshold-guardian. Causality remains loose—why this lagoon responds to petrichor, why the compass spins now—but the Accumulative lens tolerates pattern over strict because/therefore.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The subterranean lagoon is vividly rendered: "water so still it seemed to be a hole in the world," stalactite rhythm, calcite-slick ledges. The compass and petrichor vials function as micro-setting elements that constrain Mira's choice at the waterline. Spatial choreography is clean through the quarry descent. However, the factory setting (dominant in the timeframe element) remains generic—"broken windows," "emptied desk," "loading dock"—and does not pressure any choice; it serves only as a launch point. The lagoon charges the final image strongly, but the above-ground half lacks specificity that would distinguish this valley from any shuttered industrial site.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Mira seeks "the place where explanations fail," signaled early. The lagoon discovery provides one meaningful deepening when the water "remembers" and Mira understands the expedition's choice. However, escalation is gentle: no live option is foreclosed with visible friction. Mira's final decision (become keeper, not follower) feels preordained by her "sensibly eccentric" nature rather than forced by competing pressures. The cost is conceptual (empty vials, abandoned tools) but not felt as loss or renunciation on the page—she walks away "her purpose finally aligned," which reads as satisfaction rather than sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—mystery as resource, the hinge between knowing and not-knowing—emerges organically from the lagoon's refusal to ripple, the compass's stubborn deviation, and Mira's choice to mark rather than cross the threshold. The final image ("petrichor collector walked home...her vials empty, her purpose finally aligned") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. "Hinged awakening" as metaphor is threaded purposefully: "understanding swung open on a different kind of hinge." One slip: "some awakenings must remain hinged—neither fully open nor closed" becomes a thematic echo in the penultimate paragraph, slightly over-articulating what the image already conveys. No diagnostic label-speak or late sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV, stable throughout. Perceptual signature is consistent: Mira notices scent-molecules, "sensory detours," mineral breath. Diction remains controlled and voice-particular: "the water clarified, revealing layers of time stacked like pages." No head-hopping. One register slip: "explanation's architecture collapsed" and "coordinate where measurement dissolved into mystery" drift slightly elevated for a field collector, though her university affiliation provides some cover. Psychic distance modulates purposefully between intimate (fingertips, breathing) and reflective (survey team, valley history). Free indirect style is clean. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Line clarity is high; sentence rhythm varies, and paragraph structure supports accumulation. Information density is strong: most lines advance image, memory, or stance. Two mild loops: "some truths could only be approached through sensory detours" (paragraph 8) is paraphrased by "some awakenings must remain hinged" (penultimate graf). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; one muddle: "understanding swung open on a different kind of hinge, one made of scent and silence rather than logic" mixes the mechanical (hinge) with the ephemeral (scent/silence) without a clear vehicle. Template stems appear once: "She saw them... She understood... She stood... She placed..." across four beats, creating mild cadence monotony. No filter-verb stacks or major scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The petrichor collector and psychometry reading offer a fresh synthesis; the hinged-awakening frame is specific and purposefully sustained. However, the expedition-lost-in-caves and mysterious-underground-water tropes are familiar, and the story does not transform them through unexpected moral calculus or world logic—the lagoon's mechanics remain abstract. Mira's final choice (guardian rather than crosser) feels like a median option that avoids the bolder risks of either crossing or destroying the threshold. Emotional specificity is present but not deeply individuated: her "sensibly eccentric" stance is told more than dramatized in micro-choices that surprise. The story commits fully to its premise, but the synthesis reads more careful than daring.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira (petrichor collector) is present throughout and makes the closure choice: to mark the lagoon and walk away. Her occupation primes the use of petrichor vials in two beats (preparation, lagoon drop). However, her role as collector is more identity than causal lever—she could be an archivist or geologist with minor edits and the same arc would hold. The collector trait enables the vial-drop tactic but does not constrain or complicate her choice at the threshold. Two gates met (setup, payoff); middle development is observational.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The compass appears in three beats: discovery (foreman's desk, psychometry trigger), descent (warming, spinning), and closure (placed on ledge as boundary marker). Its deviation and spinning charge the story's mystery and its final placement anchors Mira's guardian role. The object's specific property (needle pointing to quarry/lagoon center) matters causally. Strong closure linkage; irreplaceable. One friction: the compass does not constrain a middle choice—it informs but does not force tactical adaptation during the descent.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Hinged awakenings" is named explicitly and threaded thematically ("understanding swung open on a different kind of hinge," "awakenings must remain hinged"), but it functions as metaphor rather than stake-shaping mechanic. The concept does not narrow Mira's options or force a tradeoff; it describes the result rather than driving the attempt. Present by implication throughout, but ornamental to the plot. Lyric recurrence charges the theme but does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Sensibly eccentric" is labeled twice (colleagues' view, final paragraph) and shown obliquely in her decision to become keeper rather than follower. However, the trait does not visibly constrain or enable an on-page action with cost—it rationalizes her choice retroactively. No middle beat where eccentricity forces a mistake or tradeoff. Setup and payoff gates met, but the attribute remains summary-level rather than dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Delve" structures the middle third: preparation (mapping, testing, decanting) and the descent itself (quarry entrance, solution tubes, cathedral space, lagoon discovery). The action enables the lagoon encounter and the closure choice. Essential across beats; removing it collapses the story. One small swappability note: "descend" or "explore" could substitute with minor tonal loss but equivalent structure. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; cost is tied to physical risk and vial expenditure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The psychometry reading occurs once (compass touch triggers vision of 1923 survey team) and primes Mira's understanding of the lagoon as threshold. Setup is clear, payoff indirect: the vision informs her final choice but does not return as active method at closure. The mechanic ("not as a vision but as a taste of iron and limestone dust") is specific and voice-consistent. Two gates met (setup, closure participation via consequence); middle beat absent. Lyric reprise qualified: the taste of iron links to "mineral breath of the earth" at the lagoon, subtly reweighting the opening read.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The subterranean lagoon is the site of discovery, decision, and closure. Its properties—stillness, memory-revealing water, impossible depth—directly enable Mira's petrichor experiment and her choice to mark rather than cross. The setting supplies both resource (reflective surface) and constraint (the threshold she will not enter). Present across three beats (discovery, petrichor drop, compass placement) and essential to the ending image. Highly specific and irreplaceable; strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the factory shuts down" is signaled in the opening line and provides context (endings, archive completion, availability for the quest). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—Mira prepares leisurely over three days, and no clock pressures her lagoon choice. The factory closure motivates her availability but does not constrain tactics or escalate stakes. Setup gate met; development and payoff absent. Swappable with "after retirement" or similar life-transition framings.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The desire "to find the place where explanations fail" is articulated midway ("some truths could only be approached through sensory detours") and drives the delve and lagoon experiment. The motivation shapes two beats (descent, petrichor drop) and the closure aligns with it ("the precise coordinates where answers become irrelevant"). However, the friction between this want and any competing need is absent—Mira pursues the goal without visible cost until the very end, when she empties her vials. Told more than dramatized in choice-under-pressure moments.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Resonant hush" is established early ("silence that now owned the factory floor") and sustained through the descent: stalactite echoes, "breathing sound profane," soundless ripple. Tone modulates subtly—urgency in the opening, reverence at the lagoon—and charges the final image ("the valley's deepest silence"). Coherent across turns and purposeful in supporting the threshold theme. Strong closure linkage; the hush becomes both atmosphere and thematic vehicle. One friction: "resonant" risks oxymoron with "hush," but the piece earns the paradox through the stalactite rhythm and echo patterning.</comment>
