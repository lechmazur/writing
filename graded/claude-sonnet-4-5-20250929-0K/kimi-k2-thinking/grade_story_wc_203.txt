<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marlon's motivation ("to discover what ceilings hide") is signaled early and drives his actions, though the "quiet obsession" feels abstract. Interior moments are concrete—his trade reading of dust patterns has specificity—but the climactic choice (taking one mainspring, leaving the rest) lacks visible cost or contradiction; he simply acts as witness without foreclosing a competing want. The ghosts remain atmospheric rather than forcing a dilemma, and the final "weightless burden" reads as summary rather than embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land within the opening paragraph. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: dust patterns, layered ghost arrivals, and discovered mainsprings build density toward the ringmaster's testimony, which reweights Marlon's role from repairman to witness. Closure form is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the ghosts dissolve after testimony, Marlon pockets one barrel, and the final image ("silenced mechanisms of ordinary cruelty") reconfigures his burden with conceptual cost. The shift from skillful observer to bearer of testimony is legible, though the cost remains largely implied rather than dramatized in a choice with visible stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office is vivid (collapsed counter, water-stained poster, sagging ceiling) and the dust spirals constrain Marlon's investigation. The mainsprings hidden above the tiles directly enable the closure discovery. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; spatial choreography (climbing the counter, reaching into darkness) is clean but the environment does not pressure a choice or force a trade-off. The final exterior glance at the cracked façade charges the theme but does not alter tactics.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>One dominant stake (Marlon's drive to discover what ceilings hide) is signaled early and tightened when the ghosts point upward, narrowing his focus to the hidden mainsprings. The discovery provides a reversal of understanding (wages frozen in mechanisms) but Marlon's agency is passive observation—he does not face a trade-off or competing pressure. The choice to leave most barrels for authorities is offstage logistics, not a dramatized cost. Under the Accumulative lens, the tightening is present but mild; escalation reads as density increase rather than foreclosed options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (bearing witness to "ordinary cruelty," the silenced mechanisms of exploitation) emerges from concrete particulars: the engraved mainsprings, the ringmaster's crumpled-paper voice, the architectural testimony. The final image ("silenced mechanisms of ordinary cruelty") reweights Marlon's lifelong search without overt moralizing. However, "weightless burden" appears as a label in the final paragraph rather than being fully dramatized through cost. The ghost testimony is specific and earned, but the resolution leans slightly abstract—"the weightless burden of bearing witness" is named rather than shown in a sacrifice or choice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with perceptual signature: Marlon's professional eye ("every worn cable, every slipped pulley told its story") filters setting and ghost encounters. Diction remains character-consistent (e.g., "choreography" for dust, "structural grief"). The ringmaster's single line of dialogue ("We wound the clocks. We kept the time. But time forgot us.") carries voice and purpose. Minor register drift: "architectural longing, a structural grief" and "the weightless burden" elevate slightly above a technician's lexicon at peak beats, though they read as thematic coloring rather than POV break.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance discovery or theme. Rhythm varies (short declaratives at the fluorescent death, longer accumulation during ghost arrival). Minor template cadence in the ghost catalog: "A ringmaster's top hat materialized first... Then came the others—tightrope walker, bearded lady, a child acrobat" reads list-like. "Weightless burden" recurs three times in the final third, borderline loop. Stock metaphor: "like damaged film reels" and "like crumpled paper" are functional but familiar. No paraphrase loops or causality-obscuring artifacts; the closure image remains clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis (elevator technician who reads dust as testimony, discovering circus workers' stolen wages via mainsprings hidden in ceilings) is specific and non-obvious. However, the ghost-witness premise and "what lies above" vertical mystery are familiar tropes executed competently but without radical transformation. The mainspring-as-wage detail is fresh, and the "silenced mechanisms of ordinary cruelty" twist elevates the material. The piece commits fully to its premise but plays safely within established ghost-story and working-class-exploitation conventions.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Marlon (elevator repair technician who sees ghosts) drives all beats: he analyzes dust, climbs to investigate, interprets the mainsprings, and chooses to bear witness. Setup early; middle development (climbing, discovering); closure participation (final burden). His dual nature (technician + ghost-witness) enables the solution and charges the ending. However, his choices are observational rather than involving a visible trade-off or cost—he does not sacrifice a competing want. Strong causal role but limited friction.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The horologist's mainspring barrel is touched twice: first discovery (palm-sized, humming, completes a circuit with the ghosts) and second discovery (dozens engraved with names, revealed as frozen wages). Setup mid-story (~30%); development (enables ghost solidification); closure (Marlon pockets one, the testimony completes). The object is irreplaceable—the engraved names and their function as wage-containers drive the thematic reveal. Strong integration, though late first appearance (~40%) and the resolution (leaving them for authorities) is told rather than dramatized with on-page cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Cracks in the façade" shapes the literal discovery (pushing aside ceiling tiles, revealing fissures and hidden mainsprings) and charges the final image (cracked building façade "seemed to breathe secrets"). Setup at closure moment; middle development (ceiling investigation); payoff (final glance). The concept constrains Marlon's physical action and reweights the theme (surface vs. hidden truth). However, it functions more as motif than a pressure that narrows options—Marlon does not face a choice because of the cracks; they illustrate rather than complicate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Skillfully observant" enables Marlon's dust-pattern analysis and mainspring discovery. Setup early ("his gift sharpened into something else entirely"); middle development (noticing spirals, following ghost gestures); closure (carrying the story forward). The trait is demonstrated on the page (dust choreography, hidden barrels) rather than label-only. However, no visible trade-off: observation does not cost him time, safety, or a competing value. Functional but does not constrain with friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Engage" drives the second-half turn: Marlon climbs the counter, pushes aside tiles, retrieves mainsprings, and commits to bearing witness. Middle development and closure participation present. However, the action is vague—"engage with this, not as a repairman, but as a witness" is told rather than shown in a specific choice with cost. The major turn (understanding the testimony) happens via discovery rather than a decision to engage that forecloses another path. Swappable with "investigate" or "understand."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Analyzing dust accumulation patterns" is signaled early ("years analyzing dust... to determine ceiling integrity"), demonstrated in the ticket office (dust spirals "that gravity alone couldn't explain"), and enables the ghost encounter. Setup, middle development, and thematic closure (dust as testimony language). The method is specific and irreplaceable—it is Marlon's professional signature. However, it does not constrain a choice with cost; the dust guides him but does not force a trade-off. Strong beat involvement, moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office supplies the hidden mainsprings, the collapsed counter Marlon climbs, and the sagging ceiling that hides the barrels. Setup early; middle development (physical space enables discovery); closure participation (exterior façade image). Setting is specific and irreplaceable—the circus history motivates the ghost workers and wage theft. However, it does not pressure a choice; Marlon does not navigate hazards or resource limits. The environment is stage more than crucible.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"When the overhead fluorescent buzz dies off" opens the story and cues the ghost arrival ("in the sudden silence, the past began to surface"). Setup present; closure absent. The timeframe does not constrain Marlon's investigation—no ticking clock, no urgency. After the opening beat, time becomes vague ("seventeen minutes" is precise, then the rest unfolds without temporal pressure). Functional atmospherically but does not alter tactics or tighten decisions. Replaceable with any threshold moment.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"To discover what ceilings hide" is signaled early ("the quiet obsession that had driven him into vertical spaces for twenty years"), dramatized in the climb and discovery, and fulfilled at closure ("he'd finally learned what waited above"). Setup, development, payoff all present. The motivation drives every beat and charges the ending realization. However, no friction or competing want: Marlon does not sacrifice safety, time, or another goal to pursue the discovery. Strong causal role but limited visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Weightless burden" modulates through the story: dust as "weightless" language, ghosts as "architectural longing," and final image ("the weightless burden of bearing witness... a spring wound tight"). Setup via dust and ghost testimony; closure participation (title phrase in final paragraph). Tone is coherent and charges the ending. However, the phrase itself appears late (~85%) and is stated rather than fully embodied in a cost—Marlon does not yet carry visible weight. The tone supports the conceptual repricing but leans abstract at the final beat.</comment>
