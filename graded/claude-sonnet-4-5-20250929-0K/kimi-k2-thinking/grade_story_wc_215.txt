<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to "preserve the weight of unspoken words" is stated repeatedly but never embodied in concrete action or internal contradiction. The "astonished recluse" trait remains label-only; no on-page moment shows astonishment constraining a choice. Her final vow to restore the hives arrives without prior struggle or visible cost—she simply "resolves" with no foreclosed path. Interiority cycles through stock phrases ("tranquilly perceptive," "mute eloquence") rather than character-particular perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive promptly, and the piece maintains single POV throughout. However, no decisive change occurs on the page: Elara begins守护ing words, continues守护ing words, and ends守护ing words with only declarative intent ("resolved to restore"). The ghost's dissolution is visual decoration, not a cost or reconfiguration—his spectral fingers brush glass and he fades, but Elara's options do not narrow. The covenant's "broken" state is told in exposition; no on-page beat dramatizes its breaking or repair with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The wasteland, hives, and stained glass box anchor space clearly. The box returns across multiple beats and gains slight meaning (note → vow container), touching the lyric-reprise threshold. However, the oasis itself supplies no resource constraint or tactical pressure—Elara moves freely among hollow hives without the environment ever limiting a choice. Sensory detail ("dust motes," "brittle light") decorates but does not filter through urgent POV selection.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving unspoken words—is signaled early but never tested. No reversal or tightening narrows Elara's options; she discovers the box, reads intent, places the note inside, and watches the ghost fade in a linear sequence with no visible trade-off. The ghost's "quiet plea" is received without friction. Agency is observation and declaration rather than renunciation or a choice that forecloses a live path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>A coherent theme of memory and unspoken language emerges through images (bees, glass, covenant). The stained glass box accrues slight symbolic weight across its appearances, approaching a purposeful reprise. However, the final paragraph moralizes directly: "the weight of words would never fade," "guarded the mute eloquence of the past"—telling the theme rather than letting the image speak. The ending offers no non-literal answer; it states the thesis in prompt-like language.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains stable; no head-hopping. However, diction recycles template phrases across the text: "tranquilly perceptive" appears verbatim four times, "mute eloquence" three times, "tangled covenant" six times, "weight of unspoken words" five times. This label-churn flattens the narrative voice into a committee consensus rather than a singular perceptual signature. Under peak moments (ghost dissolving, vow sealing), syntax does not compress or shift—rhythm remains uniform.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Severe paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade: "tranquilly perceptive" recycled in identical syntactic slots; "mute eloquence" and "weight of unspoken words" restated without added pressure; adjacent paragraphs (lines 11–13, 22–24) restate the same content (covenant → bees → afterlife) in synonym churn. Runs of "She [verb]" and "The ghost's [noun]" create algorithmic rhythm. Stock metaphors ("shimmered like a mirage," "pressed against the glass") cluster in the final third. These artifacts dull the closure image and trigger combined penalties: −1.7 baseline in Q7, with an additional −0.3 for final-third concentration.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The premise—ghost beekeeper, broken covenant, spectral plea—assembles familiar Gothic-pastoral elements without transformation. The protagonist's journey (recluse discovers artifact → understands plea → vows restoration) follows a template plot with median, risk-averse choices. Elara's backstory ("her own voice became a burden") arrives late (line 21) as an add-on rather than shaping earlier tactics. The stained glass box could swap for any keepsake; bees for any dying symbolic creature. No fresh inflection or non-obvious synthesis distinguishes this iteration from stock "guardian of memory" tales.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout but makes no on-page choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. "Astonished" is claimed in line 2 but never dramatized; she observes, reads, and declares intent without struggle. Her agency is passive reception. The "recluse" label does not constrain action—no social friction or isolation cost appears. She begins守护ing and ends守护ing with no visible transformation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The stained glass box appears in three functional beats: discovery (line 8), placement of note (line 30), and final image (line 34–39). Its colored panes allow Elara to see the ghost's face dissolve, and it becomes the covenant's container. However, it could swap for any keepsake with minor edits—its "stained glass" property (colored light) is used once and does not constrain later choices. Early signal and closure presence meet two gates; causal pressure is weak.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The "tangled covenant" is mentioned six times but never shapes an on-page choice. Its terms (bees carry souls) are exposited in lines 11, 26, with no dramatization of the binding or breaking. The covenant's "broken" state is told (line 27) rather than tested. It functions as thematic backdrop rather than a constraint that narrows Elara's options or forces a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Tranquilly perceptive" appears verbatim four times (lines 3, 12, 25, 41) as a label without embodied cost or enablement. No scene shows this trait constraining an action—Elara's perception does not miss a crucial detail or force a sacrifice. The attribute decorates rather than pressures.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Gaze" recurs across multiple lines (7, 14, 23, 29, 38) and anchors key moments: Elara gazes at the ghost, through the glass, at the horizon. The ghost's dissolution occurs during a gaze (line 15), and the final stance involves gazing (line 38). However, the action is interchangeable with "look" or "watch"—its specificity does not drive a turn. It shapes atmosphere more than options.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Through contextual clues" is named in lines 6 and 13 (footprints, candle, story piecing). Elara's method of reading the ghost's intent is signaled, but the mechanics are summarized rather than dramatized—we do not see her interpret a clue incorrectly or revise her understanding. The method enables comprehension but does not constrain an attempt or force a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The oasis and wasteland anchor all action and are present from the opening line through closure. Hollow hives and drought provide thematic context (covenant broken by environmental failure). However, the setting does not constrain Elara's moves—she accesses the box, altar, and ghost without spatial friction. The environment is stage rather than crucible; it could be any desolate ruin without altering her tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After ghosts become visible" is stated in line 1 and contextualized (veil lifted, line 20). The ghost's presence drives Elara's discovery and vow. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—no urgency or countdown shapes her actions. The post-veil world is a static condition rather than a pressure that escalates or alters tactics as time passes.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to preserve the weight of unspoken words" is declared in line 4 and restated in lines 17, 28, 35. It frames Elara's vow to restore the hives (line 33) and her final守护 role (line 41). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized in conflicted choice—no scene shows Elara sacrificing a competing want or paying a cost to uphold this motive. It functions as thematic summary.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Mute eloquence" appears three times (lines 10, 18, 32, 40) as a tonal label for the ghost's presence. The phrase recurs but does not modulate—it remains a static descriptor rather than shifting under pressure. Tone at closure is identical to tone at opening: quiet, reverent, abstracted. No cadence break or intensification charges the final image.</comment>
