<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Cassian remains a collection of atmospheric labels rather than a coherent agent. The "habitually borrows personalities" trait is told but never dramatized with cost—he borrows the mathematician's mind and the poet's joy in consecutive beats without friction, contradiction, or visible tradeoff. The mathematician and poet appear as passive vessels for abstraction rather than characters who apply pressure. Interior contradiction is absent; Cassian moves through the evening with clinical detachment that never fractures under the weight of transposed emotion.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piece presents a series of thematic gestures rather than a coherent causal chain. Cassian feeds the halo fragment into the press, hands pages to clients, records data—but these moves do not narrow options or impose cost; they simply accumulate atmosphere. The ending offers a cosmic mood ("the world was a matrix of light and shadow") but no on-page decisive change, renunciation, or stance crystallization with felt consequence. The "open problem" frame explicitly defers closure, leaving the reader with an unresolved thesis statement rather than earned pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The topaz workshop is vivid in color and light but remains atmospheric wallpaper. Stars vanish in sympathy, walls pulse, shadows shift—yet none of these details constrain Cassian's choices or alter his tactics. The halo fragment and letterpress are described but not handled with tactile specificity that would ground the transposed-empathy mechanics. Spatial choreography is vague; the mathematician and poet appear and depart without legible movement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to understand the mathematics of emotion"—is declared but never tested on the page with a live cost or forced tradeoff. Cassian prints two sheets, observes reactions, records data, then continues printing with unchanged motivation. The realization that "emotion could not be solved like a linear equation" arrives without prior resistance or escalation; it is offered as thesis rather than earned through pressure. No reversal forecloses a path or reweights options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The central question—can empathy be mathematized?—is articulated repeatedly in prompt-like language rather than emerging from scene particulars. The line "Empathy = DeltaSelf / DeltaOther" in the penultimate paragraph is explicit moralizing that replaces image with thesis. The halo fragment and vanishing stars function as symbolic décor rather than motifs that accumulate pressure or constrain choice. The ending gestures toward complexity but delivers only atmospheric abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The prose establishes a consistent lyric register with controlled diction ("lucid turbulence," "dissonant chord"). However, Cassian's interiority reads as philosophical summary rather than character-specific perception; his way of noticing does not shift under the borrowed personalities despite the premise. The mathematician and poet lack distinct voices in their brief appearances. Purposeful compression is legible, but the narrative stance remains distant throughout, never modulating with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops cluster throughout: "He recorded the shift as a differential equation, mapping sorrow onto joy" is immediately followed by "He recorded the poet's euphoric pulse as a sine wave." Template cadence dominates the middle third with repeated "He [verb]" stems. The metaphor "each cell a feeling" in the final line is vague rather than specific. Stock phrases like "thousand masks," "borrowed personalities," and "the mathematics of emotion" recur without reweighting. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed," "believed") stack in high-pressure beats without voice motivation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise—transposing empathy via letterpress and halo fragments—is conceptually intriguing but executed through familiar tropes: the lone artisan, the magical artifact, the abstract quest for understanding. The "mathematics of emotion" frame reads as imported from the prompt rather than organically discovered. No turn or image reweights the premise in an unexpected way; Cassian's final embrace of "living, breathing flux" is a stock reconciliation of science and feeling.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Cassian is present throughout but his choices do not create turns. He performs operations (feeds vellum, hands pages, records data) without friction or cost. The decision to "embrace the turbulence" and "continue printing" at the end is told rather than dramatized and does not foreclose a prior path.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The halo fragment appears in four beats: initial placement, press insertion, flickering mosaic, and dimming. However, its mechanics remain vague—how does it "transpose empathy"?—and its dimming does not visibly constrain Cassian's final choice. It is atmospheric rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.0</grade><comment>Transposed empathy is the stated premise but never shown with specificity. The mathematician's sorrow and the poet's joy are labeled rather than embodied. The reversal ("empathy flowed in both directions") is asserted without prior dramatization of the one-way assumption under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>The trait is mentioned three times but never constrains or enables an action with visible cost. Borrowing the mathematician's mind "sharpens focus" and "injects cold disdain," then the poet's joy "surges" and "threatens to drown"—but these states do not alter Cassian's tactics or force a tradeoff on the page.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Disorient" appears twice as intention ("needed to disorient the next subject," "more disorienting") and once as result (the poet's "sense of time" is disoriented). It does not drive a turn; the poet reads the page and her joy transfers, but this move does not differ structurally from the mathematician's earlier scene.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Deliberate ambiguity" is mentioned as tool ("each line of type a question mark") and recurs in the penultimate paragraph ("more ambiguous"), but the mechanics are never shown. We do not see ambiguous glyphs or experience their disorienting effect; the element is claimed rather than demonstrated.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The topaz workshop is established early and recurs in multiple beats (walls glow, reflect starlight, pulse, keep their glow). However, it functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than constraint. The setting does not pressure Cassian's choices or supply resources that alter outcome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Stars vanish incrementally across the narrative, creating a symbolic timeframe. The phrase "between vanishing stars" recurs, but the progression does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. Time remains ambient rather than a live constraint with pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The motivation is stated in the opening third ("to solve the mathematics of emotion") and reasserted at the end ("to understand the mathematics of emotion, even if the numbers never added up"). It is declared but not conflicted on the page; Cassian's desire does not collide with a cost or force a tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The tone is coherent and consistent—lyric, elevated, contemplative. "Lucid turbulence" is invoked explicitly near the end and the prose sustains controlled contradiction (e.g., "dissonant chord," "quiet promise of a thousand unresolved equations"). The tone does not modulate with pressure, remaining static across beats, but it does charge the final image with poetic density.</comment>
