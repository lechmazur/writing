<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is declared (scholarly ambition transformed to shared burden) but rarely tested through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final choice to archive the telegram and whisper a promise lacks visible cost—no path is foreclosed, no competing desire resisted. Interiority relies heavily on abstract claims ("healing with words," "burden alone") rather than embodied perception under pressure. The ancient scribe vision feels like convenient confirmation rather than a complicating internal contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, with the variable star pulse and daylily symbolism building toward thematic resonance. The closure—Elara understanding the shared burden and archiving the telegram—lands as Conceptual Repricing, but the cost is asserted ("weight," "promise") rather than dramatized through a tangible forfeiture or constraint. The causal chain from photometer readings to ancient-scribe vision to epiphany relies on convenient mysticism; the "her face was her own" moment resolves tension via revelation rather than earned pressure. Orientation is present early (observatory, desk, telegram), so no penalty there.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The observatory setting (brass telescope, wooden ribs, photometer) is vividly rendered and the daylilies anchor the thematic image. However, environment does not constrain a choice—Elara's work proceeds without spatial friction or tool limitation. The variable star data and telegram are handled, but neither object blocks or enables a tactical shift. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric, supporting tone effectively, though the setting remains largely backdrop rather than pressure source.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decoding temple inscriptions—is signaled early and persists. The story offers one meaningful deepening (realizing inscriptions are confessions of shared burden, not prayers), but escalation lacks agency-driven tightening; the breakthrough arrives through mystical trance rather than a choice that forecloses options. No visible price is paid on the page—archiving the telegram and whispering a promise do not narrow future paths or force a trade-off. The "cannot bear alone" predecessor note provides external pressure but does not test Elara's commitment through a competing want.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme (shared burdens across time) emerges organically from the daylilies, variable star pulse, and chronicler lineage. The final line attempts resonance ("words had pressed their memory into eternity"), but it edges toward abstract philosophizing rather than image-grounded insight. The epiphany—"we carried it together"—is stated on-screen rather than enacted through a non-literal final action. Subtext in the predecessor's frantic notes and pressed flowers works well, but the ending summarizes theme rather than letting the reader complete it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited throughout, and the narrative voice carries a consistent lyric register. However, diction repeatedly drifts into elevated abstractions ("phonetic amber," "vigil," "syllables of solace") that strain the POV's internal texture during high-pressure moments. The line "healing with words was not a gift but a responsibility passed down" reads as thematic summary rather than lived perception. Filter verbs ("she watched," "she understood") cluster without voice motivation, dulling immediacy in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dense figurative language ("photonic amber," "epochs," "constellation of resilience") appears in most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting penalties. Paraphrase loops are evident: "burden alone" / "shared burden" / "burdens must be carried" and "healing with words" / "soothe…wound" / "bind…memory" recycle concepts across adjacent paragraphs. Template cadence runs appear ("She had discovered," "She understood now," "She left"). Register drifts into academic abstractions ("phonemes," "attribute," "methodology") that clash with the interior lens. Line-level artifacts touch the closure beat ("words drifted up…healing what could never be healed alone"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping this category further.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The core synthesis—time-spanning burden passed via celestial observation and pressed flowers—offers a non-obvious angle, but the execution leans on mystical convenience (lucid trance revealing the ancient scribe's face as her own) rather than grounded transformation. The variable star method and daylily symbolism are present but feel like prompt checklist fulfillment rather than inevitable story logic. Emotional specificity is thin; the predecessor's breakdown and Elara's resolution follow a familiar arc of scholarly discovery without fresh friction or moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara as lucid dream chronicler is named and her trance state is described, but her choices do not create key turns—the breakthrough arrives passively through the variable star's pulse. Present throughout but replaceable with "scholar" or "researcher" with minor edits; the lucid-dream trait does not constrain her tactics or force a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The daylily-pressed telegram appears in the opening, returns in the predecessor's note reveal, and is archived at closure—three functional beats. Its meaning reweights from puzzle to shared-memory signal, and the detail "daylilies, the flower of shared memory" charges the theme. However, Elara does not handle or use it to alter a tactic; it remains symbolic anchor rather than causal lever.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Shared burdens shapes the dominant stake (decoding the inscriptions as confessions passed across generations) and drives the thematic arc. The concept is signaled early via the telegram and predecessor's note, reweighted at the climax ("we carried it together"), and echoed in the final promise. However, it operates as theme rather than on-page constraint—Elara's choices do not hinge on accepting or refusing shared labor; the burden is declared shared in realization rather than tested through collaborative action or visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Heals with words" is labeled in the exposition ("each vowel she wrote could soothe a century-old wound") and repeated at closure ("healing what could never be healed alone"), but never dramatized with visible cost. No scene shows Elara choosing to heal at the expense of another goal or paying a price for this ability. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Witness" recurs (lucid trance to witness temple construction, "not merely translating but witnessing," "witness to histories") and frames the protagonist's method. It enables the climactic vision of the ancient scribe, a key turn. However, the action is passive observation; easily swappable with "remember" or "experience" without structural loss. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Variable stars are signaled early (Delta Cephei's 5.4-day pulse) and the photometer tracking appears in two beats. The method enables the final decoding ("light curve…translating into phonemes"), shaping the climax. However, the mechanics remain vague—how pulse rhythm encodes language is asserted, not demonstrated—and the method could be replaced with another symbolic celestial event. Present in setup, middle, and closure, but lacks irreplaceable specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The observatory is anchored early (brass telescope, desk, photometer, wooden ribs) and provides consistent spatial grounding. However, it does not constrain Elara's choices or alter tactics—she works uninterrupted, and no environmental friction (broken equipment, limited view, weather) complicates her task. Present and atmospheric but functionally passive.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"When understanding dawns" and the timestamp "3:47 AM, the darkest hour before false dawn" frame the climax, and the final paragraph notes "true dawn crested the horizon." Time anchors the arc but does not tighten decisions—Elara works at her own pace with no deadline pressure or clock-driven trade-off. Present but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The motivation to decode temple inscriptions is declared early, drives all on-page action, and evolves from "scholarly ambition" to understanding it as "continuation of a shared burden." This shift appears in the final reflection and frames the thematic closure. However, the motivation is not dramatized through conflicting wants—no scene shows Elara tempted to abandon the work or forced to choose decoding over another desire. Functional across the arc but lacks friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Midnight solace" is present in the phrase "a temple of silence where midnight solace became tangible" and the 3:47 AM timestamp anchors the tone. The quiet, contemplative register modulates slightly at the climax (trembling hands, urgency) and returns to calm resolution at dawn. Tone is coherent and charges the final image of words drifting into starlight. However, it remains largely static—no sharp tonal break under pressure that then reconfigures at closure.</comment>
