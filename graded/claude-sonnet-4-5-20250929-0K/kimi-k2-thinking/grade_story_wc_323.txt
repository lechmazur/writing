<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to teach starlight navigation is clear and consistent, but her interior life remains abstract—she "felt histories," her nature "pressed," her motivation "burned quietly"—without contradictory impulses or embodied stakes. The students function as a collective audience rather than individuals who pressure her choices. Corin's late introduction and single question do not create relational friction or force a meaningful trade-off; the anchor link becomes a teaching prop rather than a constraint that shapes her agency with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early—lyric accumulation via philosophical imagery—and the final image (Corin's bioluminescence forming Ursa Major) offers a Resonant Reconfiguration that reweights the dominant stake. However, cost remains conceptual and diffuse; no on-page moment crystallizes what Mara forfeits or risks to achieve this teaching breakthrough. The Tethian elder's appearance and Corin's question function as late markers rather than causal turns, and the closure image, while resonant, does not make a felt price undeniable.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The benthic city, dome, airlocks, and thermocline establish a coherent underwater world, and the anchor link recurs with tactile specificity (corroded, pitted steel). Spatial choreography is legible across moves. The micro-setting (anchor link as star map) charges the final teaching moment, satisfying the 9+ gate in principle. However, the city itself remains backdrop; no environmental constraint (pressure limits, failing seals, resource scarcity) alters Mara's tactics or sharpens a choice, capping the score below 7.0 despite vivid detail.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—teaching starlight navigation from the benthic city—is signaled early and remains coherent. The Tethian elder's exchange ("horizons must be unfolded from within") offers a philosophical deepening, but it arrives as instruction rather than a reversal that narrows options or raises cost. Mara's final method (using the anchor's corrosion as a star map) is presented as successful without a dramatized trade-off or visible price; Corin's achievement confirms the plan rather than testing it. One meaningful tightening is present but escalation under the Accumulative lens remains mild.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme—carrying stars inside, expanding perception until edges become horizons—emerges organically from the anchor-link imagery and pressure-layer geometry without overt moralizing. The final image (Corin's bioluminescence forming Ursa Major) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. However, multiple lines approach thematic echo: "unfolded horizons weren't about reaching the surface, but expanding navigation itself" and "expand perception until folded horizons of space and sea became one map" state the thesis rather than trusting the dramatized moment, reducing earned resonance by −0.4.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single POV (Mara) with stable third-person limited focalization; no head-hopping. Diction remains elevated and consistent ("balancedly curious," "somber marvel," "edge geometry"), though the register occasionally drifts into philosophical abstraction ("To where the horizon is still folded. To the edges of your own geometry"). Corin's single question carries natural syntax, but the Tethian elder's sung line ("Your geometry is correct, but horizons must be unfolded from within") reads more like conceptual summary than embodied speech. Perceptual signature is present but not deeply character-specific under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "unfolded horizons" recurs nine times; "edge geometry," "expand," and "balancedly curious" cycle without functional variation. The closing passage stacks synonym restatements—"the aliens hadn't just given them a city beneath waves. They had given a way to carry stars inside, to expand perception until every edge became a horizon waiting to unfold"—retreading the same concept across adjacent lines. Template cadence appears in the opening block ("Pelagia was… Seventy years… But tonight…"). These artifacts cluster in the final third, triggering −0.9 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The premise—teaching starlight navigation from an underwater city using thermocline geometry and anchor corrosion as proxies—offers a fresh synthesis of speculative elements. The Tethian elder and bioluminescent tattoos add textural specificity. However, the core emotional arc (mentor inspires students to see beyond their literal darkness) follows a familiar template, and the transformation relies on received wisdom ("stars are patterns you carry") rather than a dramatized discovery with visible cost. Risk-taking in structure (lyric accumulation) is coherent but does not heighten stakes or threaten clarity, yielding modest bonus within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mara (navigation instructor) is present throughout, frames the teaching goal early, and delivers the anchor-link method in the middle. However, her choices remain instructional rather than conflicted; she does not face a dilemma that forces a trade-off. The final image belongs to Corin, not Mara's agency. Two gates (setup, development) are met; closure participation is weak. Swappable with "researcher" or "scientist" with minor edits. Functional but replaceable: mid 4s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The boat anchor chain link appears in the opening line (tactile detail: "corroded," "pitted steel"), is handled and interpreted mid-story ("each pit a sun, each fissure a constellation"), and recurs in the final third ("catching light like a promise") before shaping Corin's star-pattern realization. Three gates met; beat involvement spans three distinct moments. However, the link does not narrow Mara's options or impose a visible cost; it serves as a teaching prop whose meaning is assigned rather than earned through constraint. Causal pressure is mild. Score: upper 6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Unfolded horizons" appears early, recurs throughout as both metaphor and method, and the final image ("To where the horizon is still folded") centers on it. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. However, the concept functions primarily as thematic echo rather than a tactical constraint; Mara does not face a choice between folded and unfolded paths with legible cost. The phrase is swappable with "expanded perception" or "inner navigation" with minimal structural impact. Lyric reprise lifts it to low 5s, but causal pressure remains abstract.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Balancedly curious" is mentioned three times but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. The trait is label-only; Mara's behavior (teaching, decoding, listening) does not demonstrate a visible trade-off between balance and curiosity that alters tactics. Setup gate is met (first paragraph), but development and payoff are absent. Swappable with "thoughtful" or "open-minded." Ornamental use: upper 3s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Expand" (perception, self, navigation) recurs throughout and the students' final achievement is framed as expanding their internal constellation. Setup and payoff gates are met. However, the action is diffuse and conceptual; no single on-page moment dramatizes the expansion with a visible cost or turning point. The method is told ("She taught them to expand perception") rather than shown through a conflicted micro-choice. The verb is swappable with "broaden" or "deepen." Functional across beats but lacks causal specificity: upper 5s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Edge geometry" appears early ("edge geometry" in paragraph 7, "thermocline's edge geometry" in paragraph 10) and is cited in Mara's dialogue and the Tethian elder's response. Setup and development gates are met. However, the mechanics remain abstract—how light bends at the ocean's skin, how pressure boundaries serve as navigational tools—without a dramatized application that alters a choice or tactic. The method is swappable with "boundary physics" or "interface mapping." Functional but mechanically inert: upper 4s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The benthic city (Pelagia) is introduced early, anchors all action, and recurs in the final image ("in the benthic city, she had unfolded horizons"). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The dome, airlocks, and depth context shape the impossibility of seeing real stars, which drives Mara's teaching goal. However, no environmental constraint (pressure failure, resource limit, spatial access) alters a tactic or forces a visible trade-off. The setting enables the premise but does not pressure choices. Low 6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Seventy years since First Contact" anchors the story post-alien-discovery, and the Tethians' teachings shape the city's existence and Mara's methods. Setup gate is met. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create a live clock; "after discovering aliens" is static context rather than an active pressure. No development or closure participation. Swappable with "in the age of the Tethians" or "post-contact era." Functional but passive: low 3s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Mara's desire "to learn to navigate by starlight" is stated early ("She wanted to learn to navigate by starlight"), drives her months of decoding and teaching, and culminates in Corin's star-pattern achievement. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through a conflicted micro-choice; no on-page moment shows Mara weighing this goal against a competing want or cost. The motivation is swappable with "to teach ancient navigation" with minor edits. Essential across beats but lacks visible friction: mid-to-upper 6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Somber marvel" is signaled early ("somber marvel" in the students' reaction, paragraph 11) and recurs explicitly ("The somber marvel pressed against her chest," paragraph 29; "In somber marvel, Mara understood," paragraph 43). The tone coherently blends melancholy (never seeing real stars) and wonder (teaching the unseeable) across beats, modulating with the philosophical deepening. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The final image (Corin's bioluminescent Ursa Major, Mara watching) charges the tone without stating it. However, label-reliance (three explicit mentions) reduces organic integration by −0.3. Upper 6s.</comment>
