<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to defy conformity is stated early, but her interiority remains abstract—"poetic body," "alarming grace"—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. The climactic unlocking happens through dance described in metaphorical terms ("arms weaving through cold air as if pulling invisible strings") rather than specific physical struggle with visible cost. Her transformation from courtesan to liberator is declared in summary ("her legacy as a liberator had just begun") rather than earned through on-page renunciation or foreclosed path. The final celebration feels convenient; no dramatized consequence tests her earlier choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening lines. The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: layered images (snow, starlight, prism, echoes) build toward a pattern-break moment when the sanctuary unlocks. However, the unlocking itself lacks visible cost—Elara dances, threads yield, voices bloom, and the city changes without on-page resistance or price paid in the closure beat. The ending shifts to summary mode ("her legacy had just begun," "tomorrow she would be hunted") rather than landing a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt consequence. The causal chain from dance to liberation reads as assertion rather than dramatized escalation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The silver courtyard under snow, the prism sanctuary, and starlight all provide vivid sensory anchors. The prism's "crystalline walls beneath the ice" and "facets holding whispers" create a charged micro-setting. The sanctuary directly enables the unlocking action and appears in the closure image ("its walls remained as testament"), satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. However, some details trend ornamental—"snowflakes fell like forgotten syllables"—without altering Elara's tactics or constraining her choices in the peak beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (defy the lullaby of conformity) is signaled early and coheres throughout. However, the escalation lacks a meaningful reversal or tightening that narrows options. Elara practices for months off-page, then executes the unlocking without on-page friction, failure, or adaptation. The "lullaby's pressure" is told ("her heart hammered against the lullaby's pressure") but never dramatized as resistance that forces a trade-off. The sanctuary unlocks "with a sound like shattering crystal," and the city changes—no cost legible in the moment, no failed attempt, no choice between competing goods. The ending declares consequence ("tomorrow she would be hunted") rather than showing it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of liberation versus conformity emerges through concrete images: the lullaby, the harvest of echoes, the untangled threads. The phrase "between sigh and smile" recurs purposefully and gains weight at closure ("Between this sigh and the next smile, a city had changed"). However, the final paragraph edges toward abstraction—"bodily poetic nature of her dance had been not just art, but translation"—and the teaching moment ("She taught them to listen to echoes") feels like a stated moral rather than an earned resonance. The prism's release of voices offers a strong thematic image, but the cost remains conceptual rather than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: Elara notices sound, silence, and movement in poetic register ("footsteps silent as memory," "snowflakes fell like forgotten syllables"). Psychic distance is controlled, staying close to Elara's sensory experience. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated metaphor that clashes with moment-to-moment urgency—"bodily poetic," "alarming serenity," "poetic finality"—terms that feel externally imposed rather than voice-motivated. Free indirect style is clean, and the narrative stance remains coherent. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Clarity and spatial choreography are strong; no pronoun confusion or time-line breaks. However, the prose carries pervasive figurative density without pattern-teaching: "footsteps silent as memory," "melody that flattened dreams," "harvest of echoes," "threads of sound," "forgotten syllables," "spectral colors that painted her skin." In the climactic unlocking beat, metaphor stacks without concrete action—"arms weaving through cold air as if pulling invisible strings," "unwinding it from the prism's core"—obscuring the physical mechanics. Paraphrase loops appear: "her body moved with alarming grace" echoes "her bodily movements becoming increasingly poetic" and "her poetic body moving differently now." Template cadence runs in the final third: "She had…" opens three consecutive summary sentences. These artifacts dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—a courtesan who dances to unlock imprisoned voices—offers a fresh angle on the conformity-versus-rebellion arc. The prism sanctuary and "harvest of echoes" are specific, non-generic inventions. However, the emotional beats follow a template: oppressive system, lone defiant act, instant city-wide transformation, implied future hunt. The unlocking sequence lacks friction or surprise; Elara's months of practice occur off-page, and the on-page execution proceeds without setback. The closing celebration and prophet imagery ("the bearing of a prophet") feel stock rather than earned. The "between sigh and smile" refrain is purposeful but does not transform in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and makes the decision to unlock the sanctuary, but her choices do not create reversals—she executes a plan formed off-page without on-page adaptation or cost. The final choice to teach others is stated, not dramatized as a turn that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary appears early (setup), enables the middle unlocking action (development), and is revisited at closure ("its walls remained as testament"). It is handled across multiple beats: Elara traces patterns, unwinding threads, and the sanctuary dims after releasing echoes. Removing it would break the story's logic. However, the mechanics of interaction remain metaphorical rather than concretely specific.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The "harvest of echoes" is introduced early and names the unlocking goal. It shapes the middle action (Elara untangles voices) and appears in closure as the released symphony. However, its mechanics are asserted rather than dramatized—voices "bloom," "set free," "layered upon voices"—without showing how the harvest constrains or pressures Elara's choices in the peak beat.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Bodily poetic" appears as a label multiple times but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. The dance is described metaphorically ("arms weaving," "each gesture was a question") without showing how the poetic quality of movement differs from ordinary dance or what price it exacts. Swappable with "graceful" or "expressive" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The "unlock" action is signaled early, drives the middle sequence (Elara dances, threads yield, sanctuary opens), and delivers the closure event. Major turns trace to this action. However, the unlocking itself lacks friction—no failed attempt, no adaptation—so it feels like a single inevitable beat rather than a series of choices that redefine options.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Untangling threads" is introduced early as the method and recurs in the middle unlocking sequence. However, the mechanics are metaphorical: Elara's body movements "unwind" threads, but the text does not show how specific gestures correspond to specific threads or what happens if she fails. The method shapes the attempt but remains abstractly described, trending replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The silver courtyard under snow is present in the opening, middle (Elara dances there), and closing (people fill it with candles). It provides a spatial anchor and visual motif. However, the courtyard itself does not constrain Elara's choices—she could unlock the sanctuary anywhere. The snow and silver contribute atmosphere but do not alter tactics or pressure outcomes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Between sigh and smile" recurs as a lyric refrain in four places, framing the story. However, it functions as metaphorical tone rather than a tracked clock that tightens decisions. The phrase does not constrain Elara's actions or create urgency; it names a conceptual space rather than a ticking timeframe. Removing it would weaken resonance but not break causality.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to defy the lullaby of conformity" is stated early and drives Elara's goal. It appears in the middle (she dances to unlock voices) and at closure (the city hears itself think). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants—no on-page moment where Elara weighs safety against defiance, or chooses between personal and collective liberation. The desire is singular and unopposed.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Alarming serenity" is named three times and describes the courtyard's atmosphere. The tone is coherent and modulates slightly (calming yet unsettling → shatters at the end → begins in revolution). However, it functions primarily as description rather than shaping pressure or choices. The final image carries urgency (people with candles, Elara as prophet) but the "alarming serenity" itself does not charge that moment—it is replaced by celebration.</comment>
