<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vespera's motivation is clear and consistent throughout—preserve wonder before it fades—but her characterization leans heavily on the label "insatiably creative" rather than showing contradictory impulses in action. The work is presented as technically demanding but never as a genuine struggle with visible mistakes or blind spots; she executes flawlessly across seven days without meaningful friction. The final collapse reads as token exhaustion rather than earned cost that forecloses a path. Internal conflict is asserted ("a flaw and a gift") but not dramatized through competing desires under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear dominant stake (preserve wonder) and delivers an on-page closure—the seed cracks, the tree grows, wonder returns—but the causal linkage is thin: Vespera sings, weaves water-threads, and the seed simply opens on schedule without a decision or reversal that narrows options. The "radiant hush" timeframe remains atmospheric rather than a ticking constraint that forces tactical choices. Orientation is prompt but vague: "verdant parapet" and "border-orchards that grew not in one world, but many" gesture at setting without grounding who, where, when in a legible frame by ~120 words (−0.3). The Accumulative lens is implied by the lyric mode, but the closure image does not reweight prior material with visible cost—wonder simply multiplies without dramatized trade-off.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The verdant parapet and waterfall are vivid and recur, but they function as backdrop rather than constraint: the waterfall's mist and spray are poetic elements, not resources that alter Vespera's tactics or choices. Spatial choreography is unclear—scale, proximity, and the mechanics of "weaving liquid into threads" remain abstract. The setting does not pressure a single decision on the page. Sensory detail leans heavily on color and light metaphors (violet, amber, silver, gold) without grounding in tactile or embodied experience.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake is signaled early and remains consistent, but escalation is declarative rather than dramatized: "The method was dangerous" is told, not shown through a moment where Vespera must choose between competing costs. No on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows her options; she works for seven days without obstacle, and the seed opens on the eighth dawn as if on schedule. The resolution—wonder returns multiplied—arrives without protagonist agency at closure; coincidence (the seed's inherent properties) solves the problem it was designed to solve. No visible price shapes the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme (wonder must be woven, not guarded) emerges from the premise and is later stated explicitly in dialogue, which undercuts earned resonance. The image of the heirloom seed and its children carries some weight, but the final paragraph drifts into thematic summary: "a sacrifice that was not a taking, but a giving of form." The phrase "radiant hush" recurs as mood-setting rather than a charged motif that reweights the stake. No counter-reading or moral ambiguity complicates the resolution; Vespera succeeds without meaningful internal friction or trade-off that redefines the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and the voice carries a consistent lyric register—elevated diction, mythic cadence—but it does not modulate under pressure; the same textured prose persists through exposition, action, and closure without variation. Perceptual signature is generic: Vespera notices colors and essences but her way of noticing does not feel character-specific. The dialogue section ("Wonder must be woven," she would say) shifts into future-tense summary and loses immediacy. Filter verbs ("she would show," "she would say") stack in the final third, dulling voice-driven urgency (−0.5 in Q7, noted here for voice contamination but not duplicated).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Figurative language saturates most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff: "violet of a child's first laugh," "amber of a dragon's final flight," "blue of a dream's edge," "gold of a forgotten name" pile metaphor on metaphor, reducing clarity and momentum (−0.5 density; −0.4 coherence). Template cadence appears in the final third: "The waterfall sang… and the orchard rustled… In the hush of every budding hope…" (−0.4). Paraphrase loops: "weaving the dying worlds into something new" / "weave it into the fabric of possibility itself" restate the same concept (−0.2). Stock phrasing: "radiant hush," "weight of consciousness," "living, growing thing." Total artifact deduction: −1.5 in Q7, and artifacts touch the closure beat, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core premise—orchard pruner who weaves dying realities into a new seed—offers a fresh surface, but the emotional arc and resolution follow a familiar template: wise figure performs arduous ritual, succeeds, and becomes a teaching legend. No turn or complication arises from Vespera's choices; the seed's mechanics are convenient rather than surprising. The "insatiably creative" trait and "radiant hush" tone are decorative labels rather than specific, lived-in particulars. Proximity to mythic-quest templates without transformation: −0.8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Vespera is present throughout and her role (pruner, weaver) frames the premise, but her choices are execution of a predetermined plan rather than decisions that create turns. She begins with the seed and the solution in hand; no on-page moment where she must choose between competing tactics or costs. Setup clear, middle involvement is procedural, closure shows her teaching others but does not hinge on a character-driven decision. Two gates (setup, payoff cameo), no causal pressure: cap 4.6, baseline 3.0 + setup 0.5 + procedural involvement 0.4 + ornamental payoff 0.3 = 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The heirloom seed is introduced early, handled in the opening beat, serves as the vessel for captured essences across the middle, and cracks open at closure. Three gates met. Its properties (shimmers with lost worlds, can hold captured wonder) enable the central action, but the mechanics are abstract—Vespera's song and weaving fill it, and it opens on schedule without a cost-laden choice tied to the seed itself. Setup 0.6, two beats 0.9, enables tactics 0.8, closure linkage 1.0, moderate specificity 0.5, no visible cost tied to the object −0.0, baseline 3.0 → 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Weaving between worlds is the premise and appears in the title-like opening, the water-thread action, and the final image of doorways through which wonder flows. Three gates. The concept shapes the method but does not constrain a tactical choice or force a trade-off; it is the solution Vespera applies without friction. Setup 0.5, two beats (water-weaving, tree-as-portal) 0.9, enables method 0.6, closure linkage 0.9, swappability (could be "bridging" or "merging") −0.5, baseline 3.0 + 2.4 = 5.4, round to 5.9 for closure presence but cap for lack of on-page cost tied to the concept.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Insatiably creative" is introduced as a label ("a flaw and a gift") and mentioned again in the final section, but it does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. The trait is told rather than shown through a moment where creativity compels a risky or flawed choice. Two gates (setup, payoff mention), no causal pressure, swappable with "determined" or "resourceful." Setup 0.4, label-only reprise 0.2, no beat involvement, baseline 3.0 + 0.6 = 3.6, round to 3.8 for dual mention but cap for ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Succor (relief, aid) arrives on the eighth dawn when wonder returns to the fading realms. The moment is signaled as pivotal ("succor came to every fading realm") and serves as the resolution, but it is a result of the seed's mechanics rather than a choice Vespera makes at that instant. Two gates (middle as goal, payoff as result), closure linkage strong, but the action is passive (wonder flows) rather than agent-driven. Setup implied 0.3, one beat (closure) 0.4, closure linkage 1.0, cost indirect, swappability moderate, baseline 3.0 + 1.7 = 4.7, lyric reprise allowance +1.4 for ending reweight → 6.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Capturing essence is introduced early ("Her song was a net of notes that captured the violet…") and the method (song + water-weaving) is described across the middle section. Two gates (setup, middle), but the mechanics are abstract and the method does not shape a contested attempt or force a tactical revision. Setup 0.5, one beat (middle procedure) 0.4, enables method 0.6, moderate specificity 0.4, no cost tied to method choice, swappability moderate, baseline 3.0 + 1.9 = 4.9, round to 5.3 for dual presence.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The verdant parapet beside a waterfall is anchored in the opening line and recurs in the middle and final sections. Three gates. The setting provides atmosphere and a resource (waterfall spray for weaving), but it does not constrain a choice or force a tactical adaptation; Vespera could perform the same actions in any liminal space. Setup 0.6, two beats (opening, middle weaving, final collapse) 0.9, enables method weakly 0.3, closure reprise 0.4, swappability high −0.6, postcard description without pressure −0.5, baseline 3.0 + 1.1 = 4.1, round to 4.7 for triple presence but cap for lack of constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Radiant hush" and "the hour of budding hope" frame the opening and recur in the final image, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. The seven-day duration is mentioned but functions as atmospheric progression rather than a live clock. Two gates (setup, payoff reprise), no middle constraint, vague tracking. Setup 0.4, lyric reprise 0.4, no beat involvement, baseline 3.0 + 0.8 = 3.8, but vague and untracked time −0.6 → 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The motivation to preserve wonder is stated early and drives the plot premise. Setup and payoff clear, but the desire is never conflicted or dramatized through a choice that tests cost—Vespera begins with the solution and executes it. Two gates (setup, payoff as fulfillment), told rather than shown in friction. Setup 0.5, one beat (goal pursued) 0.4, enables plot 0.6, closure linkage 0.8, no friction between wants and costs −0.7, baseline 3.0 + 1.6 = 4.6, lyric reprise allowance +1.0 for thematic closure → 5.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Radiant hush" is introduced in the opening, recurs as a phrase in the middle ("The radiant hush deepened"), and frames the final image. Three gates. The tone is coherent and lyric throughout, but it does not modulate with pressure—crisis and resolution carry the same elevated, static register. Setup 0.6, two beats 0.9, closure linkage 0.9, static mood without modulation −0.8, charges final image weakly 0.4, baseline 3.0 + 2.0 = 5.0, round to 5.8 for triple presence and ending participation.</comment>
