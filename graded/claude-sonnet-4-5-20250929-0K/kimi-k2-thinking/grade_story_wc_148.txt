<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The son character remains abstract throughout; no embodied emotion, contradictory impulses, or micro-choices under pressure appear on the page. His motivation "to thread a labyrinth with his own story" is asserted but never dramatized through a visible tradeoff or struggle—he simply speaks faster when time pressure is mentioned. The father's legend functions as backstory decoration rather than a live constraint that complicates present action. No meaningful change or renunciation is earned; he walks away after an offstage monologue with no felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty: who/where/when anchors drift across the first third (spiral corridor, chapel, door, staircase, chamber) without stabilizing into a coherent spatial frame past ~120 words; apply −0.4 and cap Q3 at 7.0. The closure unit—his spoken story sealing the chamber "before they find the bodies"—lacks visible cost or a legible change in options; the lattice glows and he leaves, but no prior setup constrains this outcome or makes refusal impossible. Drive lens is ambiguous: the prose gestures toward accumulative texture ("copperlight repose," "chasing hush") yet promises causal pressure ("before they find the bodies," the narrow door mechanism), but neither mode lands cleanly at the end. The chamber scene could be causal if the bodies and the timeframe mattered on the page, but they remain vague and do not tighten his choices or exact a price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison, reef, and lattice are described vividly but remain static postcards; no environmental feature constrains a choice or alters tactics. The "narrow door left ajar for decades" and its scuffs briefly gain function when he traces a pattern and presses the lattice, but the mechanics are asserted rather than shown to limit or enable. Spatial choreography is unstable: spiral corridor → chapel → door → spiral staircase → chamber with no consistent anchoring of distance or adjacency. Sensory hierarchy is generic (copper glow, cold air, hush) without POV-specific filtering. The lighthouse beam "swept the reef" in the final third, but this detail does not interact with the protagonist's actions or the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>One dominant stake is signaled early—"thread a labyrinth with his own story"—but it never faces an on-page test or tightening. The timeframe "before they find the bodies" is mentioned twice yet does not force a trade-off or alter his tactics; he simply "spoke faster" without visible consequence. No meaningful reversal or deepening narrows options; the lattice mechanism and the door opening occur without resistance. The ending—door swings shut, he walks away—lacks a felt price or a choice that forecloses a path. Coincidence does not resolve because nothing is resolved; the closure unit in Q2 is inert here as well.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme—silencing inherited lies, chasing hush—is declared repeatedly ("thread a labyrinth," "sustaining impossibilities," "chase that never ends") but never emerges from concrete dramatized action or a final image that reweights prior material. The lattice as confessional relic gestures toward a motif but is mentioned in isolation without accruing pressure or altering a choice. The ending's statement "the hush he chased became the lighthouse's breath, and the impossible was now the only truth" is abstract philosophizing rather than earned resonance. No epiphany arises from specific struggle; the protagonist's arc is told, not shown. Thematic echo in the final paragraphs ("story of a boy who learned to chase hush") replaces scene pressure with summary moralizing; apply −0.6 within this band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, but psychic distance is uncontrolled: the prose alternates between close register ("He knew that soon they would find the bodies") and distant lyricism ("The hush lingered. Forever, the lighthouse stands") without purposeful modulation. Perceptual signature is absent; the narrator's diction is uniform poetic abstraction ("copperlight repose," "sustained impossibilities") that does not reflect the protagonist's mind under pressure. No dialogue appears. Filter verbs ("seemed to sustain," "began to hover") cluster without voice motivation, dulling immediacy. The final paragraphs shift into omniscient summary ("When the search party finally arrived, they would read…") that breaks the established POV frame. Sentence openings repeat stem patterns: "The lattice…" "He…" "The door…" across adjacent lines without variation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "copperlight repose" appears six times, "hush" nine times, "lattice" fourteen times, often in adjacent sentences without added detail or pressure. Template cadence runs dominate the second half: "The lattice began to vibrate… He placed the lattice… The lattice caught his words… the lattice glowed… the lattice left behind…" without syntactic variety. Stock metaphors ("thread a labyrinth," "chase hush," "stone altar held a single candle") lack specificity or fresh synthesis. Register drifts into abstract poeticism ("sustained the impossibility of truth within a lie") that clashes with the lighthouse-prison setting. Mixed metaphor: "The copperlight repose thickened, a heavy quiet that swallowed the echo"—light repose cannot thicken or swallow. Apply patterned-artifact pack: −1.2 in Q7 for loops, template cadence, and stock phrasing across the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Core premise—son of "boy who cried wolf" confronts inherited lies in a lighthouse prison—gestures toward fresh synthesis but executes as generic Gothic atmosphere without specific character stakes or world logic. The lattice, bodies, and door mechanism are interchangeable props; removing any would require only minor phrase substitution. Emotional arc is told via abstract claims ("thread a labyrinth," "chase hush") rather than particular choices. The ending's pseudo-profundity ("the impossible was now the only truth") is a platitude without grounding in prior events. Derivative frictions: the confessional relic, hidden chamber, and ticking-clock search party echo familiar templates without transformation. No bold risk-taking; the piece hedges into lyric abstraction to avoid dramatizing the confrontation or cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The son is named and his relation to the "boy who cried wolf" frames the premise, but he makes no on-page decision that creates a turn. He paces, listens, lifts objects, speaks offstage, and leaves—all passive or summarized actions without visible cost or altered tactics. His character could be swapped for "any guilt-ridden descendant" with identical plot beats. Present in setup and ending, absent from middle development; ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The lattice appears in the chapel (~30% mark), is pressed against the door to open it, placed on the altar, vibrates and glows during the offstage speech, and is "left behind" in the ending. Three beats: discovery, door mechanism, altar glow. It enables two physical actions (door, altar) and is mentioned in the final image, satisfying setup/development/payoff gates. However, its properties ("sustains impossibilities," wood humming) are asserted without constraining a choice or exacting a cost; he never struggles with or against it. Swappable with another charged object (relic, key, tome) with phrase-level edits. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure mention +0.4, but swappability −0.6 and ornamental glow −0.5 hold it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Chasing hush" is named five times and functions as thematic label rather than stake that shapes on-page tactics. The protagonist never faces a choice between hush and noise, silence and revelation, or rest and pursuit with visible cost. It appears in setup as abstraction, recurs as poetic refrain, and is summarized in the ending ("the hush he chased became the lighthouse's breath") without dramatized pressure. Present but ornamental; functional gate for setup and ending, missing middle development cap at 4.6, further reduced for swappability and summary-only use.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"Sustains impossibilities" is attributed to the lattice once in the chapel and echoed in the ending line, but it never constrains or enables an action with cost. The protagonist does not struggle with sustaining versus releasing, truth versus lie, or any tradeoff tied to this attribute. Label-only mention; no visible consequence on tactics or closure. Present in setup and ending as theme claim, absent from middle; ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Hover" appears twice: "the air around it began to hover" when he lifts the lattice, and "the echo of his father's false cries seemed to hover above the altar." Both are atmospheric description without causal pressure; the air hovering does not prevent, enable, or complicate any subsequent action. Easily replaceable with "shimmer," "float," or "linger." Present in middle, touches ending image obliquely, but missing setup and lacking cost or turn-creation; functional but replaceable, cap 4.9, reduced for swappability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The narrow door with scuffs is introduced in the middle third: he traces a pattern through the scuffs, presses the lattice, and the door swings open. This is one functional beat—the door mechanism enables access to the chamber. However, the scuffs' pattern ("map etched in neglect") is asserted without prior setup or payoff; any door with any mark could serve the same role. The decades-ajar detail adds atmosphere but does not constrain his approach or cost. Missing setup (not foreshadowed early), present in middle, absent from ending; functional but swappable, cap 4.6, reduced for late intro and mechanical convenience.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse prison off a jagged reef is established in the opening line and recurs in the ending ("lighthouse stood sentinel," "tide whispered against the reef"). It provides Gothic atmosphere but does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. The reef is mentioned as backdrop; the prison's cells and chapel are static locations. Spatial elements (spiral corridor, staircase, chamber) could be rearranged without changing the plot. Setup present, closure mention present, but middle development weak—no environmental constraint shapes his tactics. Lyric reprise lifts it slightly, but postcard use and swappability hold it below 5.5.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Before they find the bodies" is stated twice (midpoint and ending) as a live clock, but it never tightens his decisions or alters tactics on the page. He does not race, hide evidence, or make a trade-off because of the timeframe; he simply "spoke faster" in summary. The search party's arrival is promised in future tense ("When the search party finally arrived…") after he has already left, erasing urgency. Present in middle and ending, missing setup; vague tracking and no cost, cap 4.6, reduced for summary-only pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>"To thread a labyrinth with his own story" is declared early as his purpose and repeated in the ending summary. It is told rather than dramatized; he speaks offstage without the reader witnessing the content, struggle, or cost of the story. No friction between the desire to tell and the risk of being found, or between his story and his father's. Present in setup and ending, absent from middle as a live choice; ornamental goal without visible tradeoff, cap 4.6, reduced for summary-only treatment.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Copperlight repose" appears six times as a repeated tonal marker (opening line, lattice glow, altar deepening, final paragraphs). Tone remains static—hushed, elegiac, abstractly Gothic—without modulating with pressure or charging the final image with new emotional weight. The repetition is mechanical rather than purposeful escalation. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but no cadence shift or reweighting; decorative recurrence without cost connection. Early signal +0.5, three touches +0.9, closure mention +0.4, but static mood and template repetition −0.8 hold it mid-band.</comment>
