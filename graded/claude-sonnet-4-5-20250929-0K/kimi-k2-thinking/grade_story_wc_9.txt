<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cartomancer's interiority is densely rendered but lapses into label-speak ("willingly perplexed" appears twice as a descriptor rather than dramatized tension). Embodied emotion is present ("beauty rose choking in her throat") but contradictory impulses are described rather than enacted in scene—she observes and accepts rather than struggles. The final gesture of hair-unfastening and card-gathering feels ceremonial but not costly; no path is foreclosed with visible sacrifice. Motivation is abstract ("find where lost time accumulates") and never tested by a concrete on-page dilemma that forces a trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers imagery (crack, ink, mist, hands) to reweight the mother-daughter time-debt without causal reversals. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by line two; closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (acceptance that lost time transformed rather than vanished). However, the reconfiguration is told in summary ("every lost moment had been transformed, not erased") rather than enacted, and no visible cost appears—she leaves with cards and saucer intact, daughter waiting. The midpoint deepening (crack weeps light, voice whispers) adds density but does not narrow options or foreclose a path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The midnight glade and cracked saucer are vivid and purposeful: the glade dissolves once its ritual function is complete, and the saucer's crack serves as both metaphor and tactile anchor. Sensory detail is selective ("mist curling around her knuckles," "pink fingers through the cloud-floor") and filtered through the cartomancer's ritual focus. The saucer constrains her final gesture (she places it on the deck as a weight) and charges the ending, meeting the 9+ gate test for this category.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding where lost time accumulates—is signaled early but remains abstract. No on-page reversal occurs; the glade provides answers without resistance, and the cartomancer's acceptance is a passive receipt of wisdom rather than an earned struggle. The crack "weeping silver light" and the voice's explanation are given, not won. Closure reconfigures meaning (lost time = bodily transformation) but without visible cost: she descends with knowledge, cards, and saucer intact, no tactic altered or path foreclosed.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme (maternal transformation, time as loan rather than loss) emerges through the cracked saucer and hand-tracing imagery. However, the final third lapses into explicit statement: "time is not lost but loaned, that every crack is a choking kind of beauty" and "her repentance was complete" articulate the premise rather than let the image resonate. The saucer and hand motif constrain the ritual's form but the ending over-explains rather than offering a non-literal answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Voice is ornate and consistent, with a perceptual signature (onyx-ink, porcelain, mist) that suits the cartomancer's ritualistic lens. However, register drifts into abstraction under pressure: "cloudbound repentance," "luminous burden," "repository of stolen moments" inflate diction without grounding in tactile action. No dialogue appears. Free indirect style is clean, but the prose performs lyricism rather than embodying the character's lived urgency; the cartomancer observes her transformation as spectacle.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout, with metaphors stacked in most sentences ("clouds pooled like liquid obsidian," "breath of ancestors," "threads of memory weaving through the crack"). Many are coherent individually but the accumulation blurs momentum, especially in peak beats where the crack "weeps," hair "becomes threads," and the glade "dissolves." Paraphrase loops appear: "lost time accumulates" is restated four times across the piece. Template cadence: "She [verb]" opens six consecutive sentences mid-story. Information density is moderate; many lines describe texture without advancing choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of cartomancy, postpartum reflection, and phantom-time ritual offers a specific angle, but the emotional arc (guilt → acceptance) follows a familiar template. The cracked saucer as bodily metaphor is vivid but the piece retreats to safety with explicit moralizing ("time is not lost but loaned") rather than trusting the image. No bold structural risk; the midnight-glade frame is a convenient stage rather than a constraint that shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The cartomancer is present throughout and her ritual gestures (tracing, unfastening hair, gathering cards) structure the piece. However, these are ceremonial rather than decisive: no choice alters tactics or forecloses a path. She receives wisdom passively from the glade and voice; her agency is observation and acceptance rather than a turn under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cracked saucer appears in three beats: initial mention, weeping light at midpoint, and placed on the deck at closure. Its crack is causally linked to the daughter's grasp and serves as the central metaphor for maternal transformation. However, the final use (weight on cards) is static description rather than a choice that alters outcome. Strong lyric reprise but lacks causal irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Cloudbound repentance" is named twice as a thematic label but never dramatized as a stake or choice. The cartomancer experiences recognition, not repentance; no guilt, atonement, or moral cost appears on the page. The concept floats as mood rather than shaping tactics or closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Willingly perplexed" appears twice as a descriptor but does not constrain or enable action. The cartomancer's perplexity is stated, not enacted in contradictory impulses or a choice with cost. The trait is ornamental, a label without visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Unfasten" appears in two beats: unfastening the hair clasp (ceremonial, releasing memory-threads) and unfastening "the final thread of her confusion" (metaphorical). The hair gesture enables the repair imagery but does not redefine options or force a turn. The action is purposeful but swappable with another ritual gesture; it does not lock the closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Hand-tracing is introduced early (family custom, mother/grandmother overlap) and returns at closure when she plans to trace her daughter's hand on the birthday tablecloth. The method frames the ritual and charges the final image, but the mechanics do not shape middle attempts or constrain tactics. Strong setup and payoff, minimal middle development.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The midnight glade is vivid and purposeful: it provides the ritual space and dissolves once its function is complete. However, it does not pressure choices or constrain tactics; it is a stage that accommodates her search rather than a micro-setting that alters outcome. Spatial detail is atmospheric rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Two weeks after the birth" anchors the timeframe and motivates the cartomancer's bodily state (still carrying weight, marked skin). However, the clock does not tighten decisions; the ritual unfolds without time pressure. The birth is backstory that primes the stake but does not constrain present tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The motivation to find where lost time accumulates is stated early and frames the ritual. However, it is pursued without friction or cost: the glade and voice provide the answer without resistance. The desire is told rather than dramatized in conflicting choices or visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Choking beauty" appears explicitly and the tone (reverent, dense, ornate) is coherent throughout. The prose modulates slightly (denser at the crack-weeping beat, softer at dawn) but remains uniformly elevated. The tone charges the final image but does not shift under pressure; it is a static mood rather than a dynamic register.</comment>
