<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The lunar-eclipse locksmith remains a label without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. Her motivations are declared ("to learn the rhythm of repair") but never dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost; she moves through the library solving puzzles without struggle or trade-off. Interiority consists of abstract poeticisms ("driftwood nostalgia tugged at her heart") rather than character-particular perception. No meaningful change is earned—she arrives competent, completes a ritualistic sequence, and leaves satisfied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The story unfolds as a series of static tableaux rather than causal linkage: she finds prophecy fragments, uncaps a gear, follows mist, inserts gear, retrieves second gear, restores the hall. No decision narrows options or incurs visible cost; each step is a frictionless discovery that enables the next without opposition. The ending offers metaphorical restoration ("time could be mended") but no on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration with cost, or Conceptual Repricing—she completes a ritual and departs unchanged. Orientation is delayed: "who" and "what she wants" emerge gradually across the first third without deliberate disorientation that later pays off, applying −0.4 under the Orientation Test and capping Q3 at 7.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The frozen library and hall of mirrors are vividly described ("crystal shard embedded in the sky," "hauntingly bright luminescence") but function as backdrop rather than constraint. Spatial choreography is loose—she "ventures deeper" and arrives at locations without navigating obstacles or using environment to solve problems. The uncapping of the gear and insertion into the mirror keyhole involve objects, but the library's frost, shelves, and mirrors do not pressure her choices or alter tactics. Sensory selection lacks POV filter; details read as catalog rather than lived experience.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("learn the rhythm of repair") is declared but never tested on the page. No reversal or tightening occurs: each puzzle step (find prophecy, uncap gear, follow mist, insert gear) succeeds without complication, alternative, or visible price. The protagonist's agency is passive reception—objects and mist guide her, and she completes a predetermined sequence. Escalation is absent; pressure remains static from opening to close, and the resolution is bestowed rather than earned through choice or renunciation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme ("rhythm of repair," memory, brokenness, renewal) is stated repeatedly in direct, abstract language rather than emerging from dramatized particulars: "every broken thing holds a ghost of its wholeness," "the rhythm of repair was not just about fixing locks, but about restoring the flow of memory." The final paragraph moralizes overtly ("even frozen things can thaw"), triggering −0.6. Recurrence of "driftwood nostalgia," "hauntingly bright," and "clockmaker's gear assortment" functions as motif checklist rather than constraint or closure charge. No non-literal answer to a central question; the ending resolves into tidy restoration without ambiguity or conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, but the narrative voice is generic and elevated, lacking perceptual signature or character-particular rhythm. Diction drifts into abstract lyricism ("the soft hush of a distant morning," "winter comet," "symphony of tiny heartbeats") that is atmosphere-only rather than voice-motivated. No dialogue to evaluate. Psychic distance remains constant; no modulation under stress. The prose reads as committee consensus rather than a singular perspective, and the locksmith's way of noticing is indistinguishable from authorial mood-setting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Heavy figurative density in most sentences ("crystal shard," "weaver of silver tumblers," "driftwood nostalgia," "winter comet," "thousand reflections sang") creates decoration rather than propulsion, applying −0.6 for overwriting. Paraphrase loops abound: "rhythm of repair" appears eight times, "hauntingly bright" four times, "driftwood nostalgia" five times, "soft hush" three times, applying −0.4 for synonym churn and template cadence. Filter-verb stacks ("she knew," "she felt," "she recognized," "she understood") cluster in key beats, adding −0.5 and disallowing 9+ globally. Information density is low; many sentences restate mood without advancing situation or choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The core premise (locksmith who repairs metaphysical locks via lunar eclipse and clockwork gears) is a fantasy template without fresh transformation. The arc follows a quest structure with no unexpected turn or complication; each element (prophecy fragments, magical mist, mirrored reflections, gear insertion) is expected genre furniture. Emotional specificity is absent—restoration occurs without personal cost, internal conflict, or moral calculus. The ending restates the premise rather than reweighting it, and the story could be retold with different metaphors (healer, musician, gardener) with no structural change.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Present throughout but makes no key choices; she receives clues and follows instructions without alternatives or trade-offs. Setup gate met (paragraph 1); development gate weak (middle actions are frictionless compliance); closure gate weak (she completes the task unchanged). Ornamental protagonist whose role could be performed by a generic fantasy adventurer. Late penalty does not apply; low causal pressure and swappability cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The clockmaker's gear assortment is mentioned in paragraph 1, uncapped in paragraph 6, and placed alongside a second gear near the end. Two beats of involvement, but the uncapping is not prepared by earlier conflict and the gears do not constrain choice—they enable a pre-ordained solution. The object is described ("tiny heartbeat of forgotten time") but not handled with visible friction or cost. Setup gate met; development gate weak (frictionless enabler); closure gate met (present in final image). Functional but replaceable with any magical tool.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The hall of mirrors is introduced in paragraph 2, revisited when mist leads her through it, and becomes the site of the mirror-keyhole at closure. Present across three beats and shapes the ending's imagery. However, it does not constrain tactics—she walks through without navigating obstacles, and the reflections are described rather than pressuring her choices. Setup, development, and closure gates all met; causal pressure minimal. The hall functions as setting rather than active stake-shaper, but its presence in the closure image and thematic reprising of reflections lift it into mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Hauntingly bright" appears as description of the mirrors' luminescence and the central mirror's glow. No on-page action is enabled or constrained by this attribute; it is visual label only. Setup gate weak (ornamental adjective); development gate missing; closure gate weak (final mirror glows "hauntingly bright" but the attribute does not alter her choice). Decorative recurrence without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Uncap" occurs once in paragraph 6 when she uncaps the central gear, releasing silver mist that guides her to the hall's center. This action enables the plot's key transition (mist → path → central mirror) and is not easily swappable—removing it would require rewriting the mechanism. Setup gate weak (gear mentioned early but uncapping not foreshadowed); development gate strong (the uncapping is the pivot that unlocks progression); closure gate indirect (the uncapped gear is inserted at the end). One major beat shaped, specific mechanics, but late signal and single-use limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Prophecy fragments are found "amid crinkled parchment" in paragraph 4 and provide one instruction ("a gear that must be uncapped"). The method is signaled early and its mechanic (reading fragments to learn next step) matters for one beat. However, the prophecy does not shape multiple attempts or create friction—she finds it, reads it, and proceeds without interpretation or trade-off. Setup gate met (paragraph 4, ~20%); development gate weak (single instruction, no complication); closure gate missing (prophecy is not revisited). Functional but minimal causal pressure and not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The frozen library is introduced in the opening line and remains the constant location. It provides the nook where prophecy is hidden and houses the hall of mirrors. The setting's "frost" and "ice shedding" bookend the story, and the library "above the clouds" is mentioned in opening and closing paragraphs. However, the environment does not constrain her movement or force tactical choices—she walks freely, finds what she needs, and the frost melts conveniently at the end. Setup, development (supplies the prophecy location), and closure gates all met; causal pressure weak but lyric reprise reweights the opening image. Postcard beauty with minimal friction, but purposeful framing lifts it above mid-band floor.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Under the soft hush of a distant morning" opens the story and "distant morning sun" appears near the end. The timeframe is poetic mood rather than clock; no urgency, no ticking deadline, no pressure from elapsed time. The phrase recurs but does not constrain her choices or alter tactics. Setup gate met (opening line); development gate missing; closure gate weak (reprise without reweighting stakes). Ornamental time with lyric bookend, but no causal work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"To learn the rhythm of repair" is stated in paragraph 2 and repeated verbatim or paraphrased eight times. The motivation is declared, not dramatized—she never faces a choice between learning and another want, no friction between cost and desire, no visible sacrifice. Setup gate met (paragraph 2); development gate missing (no conflicted choice); closure gate weak (she achieves the goal without trade-off and repeats the phrase). Told-only motivation with heavy recurrence but no on-page friction or cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Driftwood nostalgia" appears five times as a recurring phrase describing the reflections and mood. Tone is consistent (wistful, elegiac) but static—it does not modulate with pressure or shift at closure. The phrase is label-only; no scene demonstrates nostalgia through character perception or choice. Setup gate met (paragraph 2); development gate weak (repeated description without tonal shift); closure gate weak (phrase recurs in final third but does not charge the image with new meaning). Atmosphere without dramatic function.</comment>
