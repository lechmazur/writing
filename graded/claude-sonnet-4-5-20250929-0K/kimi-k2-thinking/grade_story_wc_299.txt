<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is adequately developed through her choice to keep the speaker cloth, but the arc feels schematic rather than earned. The final decision arrives through summary assertion ("she would wrest meaning," "turning each appraisal into a song") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. Dale's entrance provides a minor test, but Mara's rehearsed list of facts functions as evasion without visible cost or trade-off in the moment. The piece skirts therapy-speak ("discover purpose after loss") and relies on abstract emotional scaffolding in place of concrete micro-choices that would make the transformation feel inevitable.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a dominant stake (purpose after public failure) and progresses from discovery to decision, but the closure reads as conceptual assertion rather than on-page reconfiguration with felt cost. The choice to keep the cloth and pin it above her desk occurs, yet the cost remains abstract—"quiet declaration" and metaphorical "encore" language replace a concrete forfeiture or tactical shift. The Accumulative lens is signaled through repetition of "echo" and valley imagery, but the final paragraph multiplies declarative statements about future meaning-making rather than landing a single charged image. The escalation is a tightening of resolve, not a narrowing of options or a trade-off that forecloses a path on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The quarry trailer and valley setting anchor the piece early and recur with purpose. Sensory details—rust, old paper, metal walls, cool air—are filtered through Mara's appraisal mindset and support the tone. The speaker cloth functions as micro-setting, constraining her final choice and charging the closure when she pins it above her desk. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the environment subtly mirrors her isolation and potential for new resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (finding purpose after public failure) is present and the choice to keep the cloth tightens resolve, but escalation lacks a visible price or tactical consequence. Dale's question offers a minor pressure point, yet Mara's response (listing facts) does not foreclose an option or alter her stance in the moment—she was already insulating. The piece leans on told resolve ("she would create new echoes") rather than a dramatized action that costs something immediate and legible. The Accumulative lens supports the design, but the closure accumulates declarations instead of a single reweighted image with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme (purpose after loss, echo as renewal) emerges through the valley setting and the cloth's symbolic trajectory, avoiding overt statement until the final third. The metaphor of appraisal-as-performance is seeded early and repaid at closure. However, the ending lists thematic intentions ("turning each appraisal into a song, each fact into a verse") rather than offering a resonant image that reweights prior material without explanation. The piece gestures toward complexity but resolves into affirmation without acknowledging the cost of choosing nostalgia over forward motion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV remains stable and the perceptual signature is consistent—Mara filters experience through appraisal language and musical memory. Diction is controlled, with "confidently uncertain" and "wrest" folded into the flow without artifice. Dale's brief dialogue feels natural and goal-driven. The prose modulates between reflection and present action without head-hopping. Minor slip: the phrase "a tangible note of her own encore" edges toward authorial gloss rather than Mara's interior idiom, but the lapse is brief and does not derail distance control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is adequate, but the piece carries paraphrase loops and template cadence in the final third: "She would not let… Instead, she would create… each appraisal a quiet performance, each fact a note…" recycles the same syntactic stem without pressure gain. The opening anchors cleanly and sensory detail is specific, yet stock metaphors ("ghostly echo," "canvas for her unspoken questions") appear in high-stakes beats without transformation. Figurative language clusters near closure without clear payoff, weakening propulsion when the ending should land hardest. No severe opacity, but the scaffold reduces punch.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The ex-roadie-turned-appraiser premise offers mild novelty, and the quarry setting provides texture. The speaker cloth as heirloom is a specific inflection. However, the emotional arc (public failure → nostalgic object → renewed purpose) follows a familiar template without bold transformation. The valley-as-echo motif is seeded early but deployed predictably. Risk-taking is minimal; the piece hedges toward uplift without exploring the cost of clinging to the past or the irony that Mara's "new rhythm" may simply replay the old applause under different names.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Ex-roadie identity seeds the cloth discovery and frames the public failure stakes. Mara's choice to keep the cloth and pin it above her desk is a decision that shifts her stance, moving from hollow routine to declared purpose. The profession shapes how she filters the cloth (age, provenance, market value) and Dale's question tests her framing. However, the roadie past functions more as backstory primer than active constraint—her prior role does not narrow options or complicate the present choice in a way that only a roadie would face. Present by end of first third, shapes the middle beat with Dale, and anchors closure; eligible above 6.0, but causal pressure is moderate and the element is somewhat swappable (any ex-performer would yield similar beats). Two-gate presence with modest causal work and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The speaker cloth appears in the discovery beat, the decision beat with Dale, and the closure when Mara pins it above her desk—three touches across the arc. Its worn logo and frayed edges provide specificity, and the final act (pinning it) reweights it from relic to talisman. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. However, the cloth does not constrain a choice under pressure; Mara's decision to keep it is reflective rather than forced by a trade-off or scarcity. The object's properties (material, age, negligible price) are catalogued but do not alter tactics. Strong closure linkage and beat involvement lift the score, but causal pressure and irreplaceability remain modest—a different personal relic could function similarly with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After the applause" is announced in the title, seeded through Mara's roadie past and the phonograph failure, and echoes in the final assertion of creating "new echoes." The concept frames the dominant stake (purpose after public validation ends) and shapes her appraisal work as emotional insulation. It appears in the opening third, informs the middle reflection on the cloth's history, and charges the ending's metaphor of "encore." All three gates present. However, the concept operates more as theme than tactical constraint—it does not narrow options on the page or force a visible trade-off. The ending declares future meaning-making inspired by the concept but does not dramatize a cost tied specifically to navigating post-applause identity. Moderate causal work and closure participation; the lyric reprise reweights meaning but without irreplaceable specificity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Confidently uncertain" appears once as a label when Mara holds the cloth, hesitating between keeping it and listing it as worthless. The phrase captures her stance but does not recur or constrain a later action with visible cost. It summarizes interiority rather than enabling or blocking a tactic under pressure. Present in the middle third, no setup signal, no closure reprise. Single-beat ornamental use; swappable with "ambivalent" or "torn" without structural loss. Eligible for low-band only; insufficient beat involvement and no causal pressure or closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Wrest" appears in the final third: "She would wrest meaning from the silence." The verb fits the tone and signals effortful agency, but it arrives late as a summary of intent rather than a dramatized action that turns the plot. No setup, no middle development; the word describes Mara's future resolve, not a present choice that costs something on the page. Late introduction (final third) caps at 4.6; the term's specificity and thematic fit provide modest lift within that ceiling, but it remains swappable with "forge" or "reclaim" without breaking story logic. One-beat summary use; no causal pressure or closure mechanics tied uniquely to "wrest."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The method is seeded early: Mara catalogues items with "facts: age, provenance, market value" and tells herself "facts were safe." It recurs when Dale asks about value and she replies with a "rehearsed list of facts," hoping "data would protect her from the raw pang of nostalgia." The final turn repositions each appraisal as performance, implicitly moving beyond pure insulation. Setup and development gates met; payoff is present as the method is questioned and supplanted at closure. The mechanics matter—listing facts is an active tactic that shapes her interaction with Dale—and the cost (recognizing the emptiness of insulation) is legible. However, the method's presence in closure is oblique; the ending pivots to "song" and "verse" metaphors rather than returning to "facts" with reweighted meaning. Moderate causal pressure and beat involvement; closure linkage is implied rather than explicit.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The quarry office trailer anchors space in the opening line and recurs throughout: metal walls, rust smell, metal floor under Dale's boots, the desk where Mara pins the cloth. The trailer provides isolation that supports her reflective arc and houses the discovery beat. The valley outside mirrors her emotional state and charges the final image when she steps out, hears a distant truck echo, then returns to pin the cloth. Setup, development (Dale's entrance), and payoff (the pinning act inside, framed by valley context) all present. However, the trailer does not constrain a choice under pressure—Mara's decision would play similarly in any isolated workspace. Spatial clarity is strong and the setting supports tone, but causal pressure is modest. Solid closure participation and beat involvement within the allowed micro-setting track.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Three weeks ago, a televised appraisal went wrong" anchors the inciting failure in the past; the present unfolds in a single afternoon (cataloguing, discovery, Dale's visit, final decision). Time is legible but does not tighten tactics—no clock pressure forces Mara's choice, and the three-week gap functions as exposition rather than a constraint that narrows options. Setup present (early mention), development absent (time does not complicate the middle beat), payoff weak (the ending looks forward without temporal urgency). The timeframe is consistent and supports causality, but it remains replaceable: "three months ago" or "last year" would function identically. Functional but mid-low causal work; no escalation tied to elapsed or remaining time.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The desire to "discover purpose after loss" is established through the opening exposition (hollow work, public failure's lingering echo) and drives Mara's final choice to keep the cloth and reframe appraisal as performance. The motivation is present in setup, tested quietly in the Dale interaction (she insulates rather than engages), and resolved in the closing assertion of creating "new echoes." All three gates met. However, the friction between want and cost is told more than dramatized—Mara's internal conflict is summarized ("she wanted to discover purpose") rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The ending declares purpose found without a visible trade-off or path foreclosed. Moderate beat involvement and closure linkage; causal pressure is adequate but not sharp.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Echo valley longing" is coherent throughout: the valley's silence, the faint echo of blasted rock, the ghostly echo of the crowd's roar, the distant truck rumble, and the final image of the valley breathing possibility. Tone modulates from hollow routine to tentative hope without breaking continuity. Setup, development, and payoff all present; the tone charges the final image and supports the Accumulative lens. However, "longing" is more asserted than enacted—Mara's yearning is described rather than embodied in contradictory gestures or acute sensory pulls. The tone is consistent and purposeful, contributing strongly to atmosphere and closure resonance, but it does not constrain a choice or create tactical friction. Strong closure linkage and beat involvement; moderate causal pressure and specificity within the tonal register.</comment>
