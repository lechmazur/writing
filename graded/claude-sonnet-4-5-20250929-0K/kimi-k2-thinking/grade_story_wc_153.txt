<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's grief and quest for apology are clear, and the decision to read the letters aloud is earned. However, interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction ("the wound I had carried") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The sister's death is revealed late (line 23), which weakens the motivational throughline in earlier beats. Mira remains a functional facilitator without applying her own pressure or demonstrating contradictory impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors (swamp, protagonist paddling, singing spirits) arrive early. The closure—reading the letters aloud and releasing them—constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: the apology becomes irreversible act) with visible cost (the letters are sent, the silence broken). One meaningful deepening occurs when the shard glows and the protagonist kneels, narrowing options. The reveal of the sister's death at line 23 arrives late, creating slight retroactive motivation rather than forward pressure, but the accumulative design absorbs this. Escalation is present but gentle; the piece deepens rather than tightens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth, shard, and condensation on glass are vivid and purposeful. The swamp "breathed in time with the moon" and the gnarled root perch are specific anchors. The shard constrains the ritual (placed on bark, traced with a pattern) and charges the final image as a pocket-weight reminder. Sensory detail is balanced (scent of salt and sorrow, voices like wind chimes of broken glass) and filtered through grief. Spatial choreography is clean across the boat, root, and water.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to voice the unsent apology. The piece signals this early and deepens through Mira's instruction ("evoke the moment before deciding") and the protagonist's kneeling beside the shard. One meaningful tightening: the singing spirits urge the reading aloud, and the protagonist complies, splitting the night "like a cracked bell." The cost is legible—silence broken, letters released—but the escalation is textural rather than a sharp reversal. Agency is present (the choice to read), though the spirits and Mira guide rather than resist.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image and ritual: "The apology is not in the speaking, but in the listening." The unsent letters, shard, and singing spirits cohere around grief and release. The final image—letters as leaves finding their way, apology living in the mangroves' song—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The phrase "fierce tenderness" recurs purposefully, charging key beats. Slight reduction for the late reveal of the sister's death, which feels more like a thematic cue than an organically discovered truth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable first-person with a consistent lyric register. Perceptual signature is grief-soaked and metaphor-dense ("voices like wind chimes made of broken glass and memory"). Diction is purposeful and sustained, though the elevated register risks distancing the reader during peak emotional beats (e.g., "the fierce tenderness of the message cutting through my denial" tells more than it shows). No dialogue, so those bullets are waived. Psychic distance remains controlled; no head-hopping. Minor deduction for filter-verb stacks in reflective passages ("I felt the unsent letters flutter inside my chest").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled and sentences vary in structure. Information density is high in ritual beats (shard mechanics, condensation message). However, figurative language saturates nearly every line without pattern-teaching or payoff (e.g., "the singing spirits swirled around us, their song a fierce tenderness that cradled my rage"). Stock metaphors appear: "voices like wind chimes," "cutting through my denial." Register drift into elevated diction ("the fierce tenderness") clashes slightly with the immediacy of the grief. Paraphrase loop: lines 21–22 restate the spirits' song without added pressure. Apply −0.6 for density overload and minor loop.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—ritual apology mediated by a cryptic figure and a healing shard—draws on familiar fantasy templates (magical healer, grieving seeker, moonlit ritual). The mangrove setting and "singing spirits" add specificity, but the emotional arc (guilt → guided ritual → release) follows a predictable path. The twist that the shard's healing lasts only until sunrise introduces urgency, yet this constraint does not visibly alter tactics on the page. The final image (letters as leaves, apology in the mangroves' song) is evocative but not startling. Derivative Premise Guardrail applies; partial transformation through setting and tonal control prevents deeper reduction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira (cryptic medium) appears early, sets up the ritual, and delivers the condensation message ("The apology is not in the speaking, but in the listening"), which reframes the protagonist's task. She instructs the protagonist to "evoke the moment before deciding" and places the shard, shaping the middle beat. However, she does not resist or complicate; her role is purely facilitative. She does not drive a turn through her own choice. Present in setup, middle, and implicitly at closure (her smile), but lacks causal pressure or cost. Score: setup +0.5, middle instruction +0.4, closure cameo +0.2, facilitative role −0.5, no friction −0.4 → 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The gargoyle's rainspout shard is introduced early (line 7), its mechanics explained (heals in moonlight, drinks silver glow). It appears in at least three beats: Mira holds it to moonlight (line 12), places it on bark and traces a pattern (line 13), and the protagonist touches it ("I felt the unsent letters flutter," line 20); its light fades as healing completes (line 29), and it returns as a pocket-weight reminder (line 32). The shard enables the ritual and charges the final image. However, the healing constraint (lasts only until sunrise, line 26) is declared but does not visibly narrow tactics or force a timed choice. Score: early signal +0.6, three beats +0.9, causal pressure (enables ritual) +0.8, closure linkage (pocket reminder) +0.9, specificity +0.5, constraint underused −0.5 → 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Unsent letters are the core concept, introduced early (line 9: "bundle of ink and grief") and central to every beat. They tremble when Mira holds them to moonlight (line 12), flutter inside the protagonist's chest (line 20), are read aloud (line 28), and released into the water (line 31). The letters frame the dominant stake (voicing the apology) and their release constitutes the closure act. Removal would collapse the story's logic. Score: setup +0.7, beat involvement (four beats) +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.5, irreplaceability +0.8, cost connection (letters sent, silence broken) +0.5 → sum exceeds 8.0; round to 8.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Heals in moonlight" is introduced early (line 8) and demonstrated when the shard glows under moonlight (line 12). The attribute enables the ritual and is mentioned again as the light fades (line 29). However, the healing is internal/metaphorical (the wound begins to close, line 25) and does not visibly constrain a choice or force a tradeoff. The sunrise limit (line 26) is declared but never tested on the page. Score: setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure (enables ritual) +0.6, closure linkage (healing completes) +0.7, swappability (could be "heals in starlight" with minor edits) −0.5, no visible tradeoff −0.5 → 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Evoke" (line 18: "to evoke the moment before deciding, to pull it from the water like a fish") is Mira's instruction and frames the protagonist's kneeling beside the shard (line 19). The action structures the middle beat and primes the reading of the letters (line 28). The "moment before deciding" recurs in line 29 ("I had found the moment before deciding"), anchoring the thematic closure. However, "evoke" could be replaced with "recall" or "summon" without major structural change. Score: setup (instruction) +0.6, two beats (kneel, found) +0.9, causal pressure (frames ritual) +1.0, closure linkage (thematic anchor) +1.2, specificity +0.4, partial swappability −0.4 → 7.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Messages in condensation on windows: appears once (line 14: "Water condensed on the window of her tiny boat, and she breathed a message onto the glass"). The message ("The apology is not in the speaking, but in the listening," line 15) reframes the protagonist's task and shapes the middle beat. However, the method itself (condensation) is not signaled early, does not recur, and could be replaced (e.g., Mira speaks aloud, writes in sand) without loss. Score: one beat +0.4, causal pressure (reframes task) +0.8, late signal (second third) −0.3, ornamental mechanics (breath-on-glass is atmospheric but not functional) −0.5, swappability −0.6 → 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mangrove labyrinth inhabited by singing spirits is introduced in the opening line and sustained throughout. The spirits hover (line 3), respond to Mira's chant (line 17), sing louder to urge the reading (line 27), catch the apology and turn it into chorus (line 31). The labyrinth frames the journey (paddling deeper, line 2) and the final image (apology lives in the mangroves' song, line 33). The setting supplies both constraint (labyrinthine navigation) and resource (spirits as witnesses/chorus). Score: setup +0.7, four beats (paddle, hover, urge, chorus) +1.4, causal pressure (spirits enable closure chorus) +1.2, closure linkage (final song) +1.4, irreplaceability +0.7 → 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"In the space where an apology waits unspoken" (timeframe) is the conceptual window and appears in the title-esque framing. Line 23 locates the story "in that space" and line 29 confirms the protagonist "found the moment before deciding." The timeframe shapes the entire ritual's stakes (evoking a moment before a decision, not a linear clock). However, it is abstract rather than a ticking constraint; the sunrise limit (line 26) is declared but not enforced. Score: setup (implied early) +0.5, two beats (line 23, line 29) +0.9, causal pressure (frames ritual) +0.9, closure linkage (found the moment) +1.0, abstraction (not a live clock) −0.5, unused sunrise limit −0.4 → 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"To find the moment before deciding" (motivation) is articulated by Mira (line 18) and drives the protagonist's kneeling (line 19) and reading (line 28). The desire is dramatized through action (touching the shard, reading aloud) and the final confirmation ("I had found the moment," line 29) anchors closure. The motivation coheres with the unsent letters and unspoken apology. Minor reduction: the desire is somewhat passive (guided by Mira rather than self-generated friction). Score: setup +0.6, three beats (instruction, kneel, found) +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.4, cost (silence broken) +0.5, partial passivity −0.4 → 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Fierce tenderness" (tone) recurs three times: line 16 ("fierce tenderness of the message"), line 21 ("fierce tenderness that cradled my rage"), line 29 ("rare, fierce tenderness" in Mira's smile), and the final line ("fierce and tender, forever"). The tone modulates with pressure (fierce during the spirits' urging, tender at release) and charges the final image. The pairing is specific and coherent, though the repetition risks becoming a label rather than an embodied texture. Score: setup +0.6, four beats +1.4, modulation +0.8, closure linkage (final line) +1.5, specificity +0.6, label risk −0.3 → 7.3.</comment>
