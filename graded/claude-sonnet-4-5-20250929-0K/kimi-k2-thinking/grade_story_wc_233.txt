<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The queen's disenchantment is asserted but never embodied through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Her transformation into sentinel is told through summary ("Understanding flooded her") rather than shown through micro-choices under pressure. The vision sequence provides backstory exposition that flattens present tension rather than tilting a live decision. Interior voice relies on elevated abstractions ("the weight of a thousand years of watching") that read generic rather than character-particular.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the first paragraph. The closure unit—queen becomes mountain sentinel—lands on the page with conceptual cost (loss of identity, throne, memories), satisfying Resonant Reconfiguration criteria. However, the causal chain from dream to climb to transformation relies heavily on vision-dump exposition rather than motivated choice; the queen's acceptance feels passive, driven by revelation rather than agency. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (pattern of imagery reweights stakes), but mid-story the vision sequence introduces a Causal mechanic (invitation not warning) that doesn't fully cohere with the lyric frame.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ember grotto and cobalt walls supply vivid sensory anchors (heat melting ice, mineral water catching starlight) that evolve across the climb. The grotto's dual temperature states (heat/frost) create spatial pressure that charges the final image. Micro-setting detail (thorns defying gravity, frost's lacy menace) reflects urgency and POV filter. The environment constrains the queen's path and supplies the transformative site, meeting the 9+ gate requirement of choice-shaping terrain.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unraveling recurring dreams—is signaled early and tightens once when the queen learns acceptance requires surrendering her throne. However, the escalation is passive: the mountain's voice delivers the revelation rather than the queen forcing a choice under competing costs. The price (memories, identity, throne) is stated but not dramatically tested; she "thought of the court below" and releases them in a single reflective beat without visible friction or trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (power as sacrifice, dreamers as dreamed) emerges from concrete imagery (bleeding starlight, firefly-embers, frost crown) and the recursive structure of queens becoming sentinels. The final line "the dream had become the ridge" reweights prior material without overt moralizing. However, the mountain's speech ("you were never the dreamer, but the dreamed") edges toward Thematic Echo, articulating the thesis rather than trusting dramatization. The transformation of disenchantment into devotion is asserted more than earned through on-page friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited with consistent psychic distance. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout ("velvet cloak catching on thorns," "mineral water that caught the bleeding starlight"), appropriate to a disenchanted queen's perspective. However, register drifts into abstract philosophizing during peak beats ("not the bitter resignation of a crown, but the quiet devotion of a keeper") without embodied grounding. No head-hopping, but the mountain's voice at closure shifts narrative authority without clear filter, creating minor focalization blur.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and often mixed: "starlight bled across the stones like silver wounds" works, but "frost etching lacy menace" anthropomorphizes without clear vehicle logic, and "mist like the spine of a sleeping god" adds a third metaphor system. Paraphrase loops appear: "the mystery was finally unraveled" restates "to unravel the mystery" without added pressure. Template cadence runs through the reflection-heavy final third ("She learned to read," "She understood now," "And so the queen settled"). Filter-verb stacks in vision sequence ("She saw a young woman... The vision showed") dull immediacy. Artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("the dream had become the ridge, and the ember grotto burned on").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The recursive-sentinel premise (each queen becomes the next guardian) offers a non-obvious angle on abdication narratives. The inversion of warning-as-invitation and the firefly-ember motif supply fresh particulars. However, the emotional arc (disenchantment → acceptance → devotion) follows a familiar template, and the transformation hinges on vision-delivered exposition rather than character-driven discovery. The cobalt grotto and bleeding starlight are vivid but largely ornamental; swapping them for alternate mystical imagery would leave the core logic intact.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The queen initiates the climb and accepts transformation, but both choices are driven by external revelation (dreams, mountain's voice) rather than internal contradiction. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but her agency is reactive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The ember grotto appears in setup (framing the goal), is reached at midpoint, and houses the transformation at closure. Its heat melting surrounding ice into "dangerous lace" creates spatial pressure. However, it functions more as setting than handled object; the queen steps inside but does not interact with its mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Bleeding starlight appears throughout (opening dream, grotto interior, final paragraph) and is tied to the cost ("silver touch both baptism and erasure"). It shapes the visual stakes and charges the final image. However, it does not constrain tactics or alter options on the page; the queen's transformation would proceed identically with different mystical imagery.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Softly commanding" appears twice: the queen's voice commanding darkness, then reframed as the mountain's voice. The parallel reweights her authority into the sentinel role. However, it remains label-only; no on-page action is enabled or constrained by this specific quality. A visible cost or tactical trade-off tied to this trait is absent.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The climb structures the entire narrative from inciting action through transformation. Physical ascent (thorns, thin air, ridge) creates escalating pressure and spatial logic. The climb's endpoint (grotto arrival) triggers the vision and acceptance. Removing the climb would collapse the story's causal spine and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"A shared exhale spotting the first fireflies of summer" appears in the vision (past queen) and again at closure when the current queen's breath joins the mountain's and embers ignite. The method is signaled and reprised, but its mechanics remain opaque; why breath triggers star-embers is unexplained. It does not shape tactics or constrain earlier choices.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The cobalt grotto is the story's spatial and thematic center: goal, revelation site, and transformation chamber. Its walls "dripping with mineral water" and crack admitting starlight supply concrete detail. The grotto's dual nature (heat/cold boundary) creates micro-pressure. It participates in all three gates and would be difficult to replace without altering the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"After the final warning" frames the opening and recurs in reflection ("the final warning had not been a threat, but a gift"). The timeframe signals stakes (point of no return) and is reweighted at closure. However, the warning itself does not tighten on-page decisions; the queen proceeds without visible hesitation or tactical adjustment imposed by the warning's timing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Unraveling recurring dreams drives the climb and is explicitly named in the mountain's speech and final reflection. The motivation is present in setup, middle, and ending. However, it is told more than dramatized; the queen's desire does not face on-page friction or competing costs that force a choice. The friction between want (answers) and cost (throne) is stated but not tested through micro-choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Lacy menace" appears in the frost description and recurs in the final paragraph ("the lacy menace of the frost would welcome her, beautiful and terrible"). The tone—beauty entwined with threat—coheres through the climb and charges the closure image. However, tonal modulation under pressure is limited; the lyric register remains elevated and static throughout rather than tightening or fracturing at peak beats.</comment>
