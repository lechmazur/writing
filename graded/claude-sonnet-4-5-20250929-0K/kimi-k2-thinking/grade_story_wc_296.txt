<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The druid's interior motivation—guilt over a forgotten curse—is legible, but interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("guarded heart," "warlike serenity") rather than embodied contradictions acting in scene. The final realization lands, yet the path to it is more told than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The protagonist's agency at closure (planting the seed, releasing the confession) is present but feels mechanically assembled rather than earned through visible internal struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal. The closure effect—druid releases his own frozen confession, vortex calms—is legible with felt cost (guilt acknowledged, "warlike serenity" remains). Orientation anchors by ~120 words (druid, cursed lake, failed spell). Escalation moves from failed flame trick to expanding-circle chant to seed-planting, each narrowing options. However, the confession's revelation ("his own hand had once cast the curse") arrives without prior micro-cues that the druid suspected this truth, weakening the because/therefore chain at the peak beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The orchard vortex and cursed lake provide vivid, consistent spatial anchors. The ice block, seed, and expanding circles all constrain tactics: the druid kneels at water's edge, chants to create silver ripples, plants the seed into a crack. The flesh-eating plant's transformation (scarlet vine → red berries) charges the final image with renewal. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through urgency (ash taste, greedy water pull, ice groaning). The environment directly enables and shapes the resolution.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake: discover the frozen confession's truth. Escalation under causal lens: failed flame → expanding-circle chant (fractures ice) → seed deployment (melts ice, releases confession). One meaningful tightening with visible cost (druid confronts his own buried guilt, vortex calms but "warlike serenity" lingers). Agency is present—the druid's choices drive each turn—but the cost at closure ("his own forgotten guilt") feels conceptually asserted rather than viscerally paid, slightly dulling the price's charge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: mirrors hide inner scars, truth lies beneath surfaces, guilt can be frozen and must be unbent. The ice/confession metaphor and the flesh-eating plant's hunger integrate organically. The druid's journey from seeker to self-confronter offers a resonant answer without moralizing. However, late lines like "some truths remain hidden from mirrors" and "carried the truth like a lantern" edge toward thematic summation rather than trusting the image. The final image (wilted plant as red berries, smoothed lake) reweights prior material effectively.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single-POV third limited; distance is stable. Diction ("guarded," "warlike serenity," "ravenous hunger") is elevated and consistent, though occasionally drifts into stock fantasy register ("maelstrom of dead fruit and rot"). Perceptual signature reflects the druid's magical focus (silver light circles, ice groaning, curse tasting of bitter betrayal). No dialogue present. Some filter verbs ("he felt," "he understood") dull immediacy at peak beats. Psychic distance shifts are purposeful, tightening during the chant sequence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies across beats; sentence openings alternate. Clarity is generally high, though several lines carry paraphrase loops: "The druid stood, his guarded heart lighter, though the warlike serenity remained" echoes "Now he stood in the aftermath...curse pressing heavier." Stock metaphors appear ("truth like a lantern," "like a blade before the strike"). Template cadence in the final third: multiple "The druid [verb]" stems in sequence. Information density is moderate; some lines do double duty (ice fractures + confession stirs) but others merely restate mood without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise—druid confronts his own forgotten curse—offers a fresh twist on the seeker archetype. The flesh-eating plant as curse-devourer and the expanding-circle method provide specific, non-generic magical mechanics. The frozen confession as literal ice block is vivid. However, the warlike-serenity tone and guarded-druid archetype remain familiar fantasy tropes executed competently but not transformed. The turn (druid caused the curse) is foreshadowed only by vague "buried guilt," reducing its earned surprise. Risk-taking in structure and voice is modest.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The guarded druid is present throughout and makes key choices (chant, plant seed). His guardedness shapes his silence and solitary action. The confession reveal (his own curse) redefines his prior behavior. Present in all three gates (setup, middle chant, closure revelation), and choices narrow options. However, "guarded" functions more as a label than a trait that visibly constrains a specific beat; swapping "guarded" for "solitary" or "wary" would require minimal edits. Mid-band for functional but not indispensable integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Flesh-eating plant seed appears early (first third: "his hand slipped into his pouch"), enables the middle turn (planted into crack, roots sink, vine winds), and transforms at closure (wilts into red berries as new beginning). Seed's hunger is specific (devours curses, scarlet thorns) and irreplaceable—no other element could melt the curse-ice. Present in three distinct beats (pouch mention, planting, berry transformation) with causal pressure and closure linkage. Cost tied on-page: vine feeds on "bitter betrayal," ice melts. Strong integration, just shy of indispensable due to brief early setup.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Frozen confession is the central stake, introduced early ("locked in a block of ice"), shapes all tactics (flame fails, circles fracture it, seed melts it), and delivers the closure revelation ("his own hand had once cast the curse"). Present in setup, middle escalation, and payoff. Irreplaceable: the story's logic hinges on this exact frozen artifact releasing its truth. Visible cost at closure: druid confronts buried guilt, vortex calms. Strong causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Finds lost things" is stated early ("he could find lost things, be they keys, memories, or the faint echo of a confession") and frames the quest. The druid finds "the lost thing—his own forgotten guilt" at closure. However, the trait does not constrain a specific on-page action with a cost; no beat shows him using this gift under pressure or paying a price for its use. It functions as thematic scaffolding rather than a mechanical constraint. Functional but replaceable; the story could work with "seeks hidden truths" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Unbend" recurs purposefully: ice must "unbend its frozen grip" (middle), curse is "unbent" at closure, and final line reminds "some things must be unbent." The expanding circles "forced it to unbend," linking action to effect. Present in setup (implied in the druid's purpose), middle escalation (circles unbend ice), and closure (vortex unbent, orchard settles). The term's specificity (unbend vs. melt or break) charges the metaphor of releasing rigid truth. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong, though the word itself could be swapped for "release" with moderate edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Expanding circles" is signaled mid-story ("first expanding circle of silver light"), mechanics shown (ripple widens, second and third circles, each larger, pressing against ice), and causally linked to the ice fracturing. Present in middle escalation and shapes the druid's attempt. The method is specific and irreplaceable within this beat—no other technique could create the described effect. However, it does not appear in the final image itself (seed takes over), slightly weakening closure linkage. Strong middle development and causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Swirling orchard vortex at cursed lake is introduced in the opening line, frames spatial action (druid kneels at water's edge, vortex pulls at cloak), and transforms at closure (vortex slows, orchard settles into somber grove). Present in setup, middle (vortex's edge touched by circles, trees shiver), and payoff (slowing vortex signals curse lift). The vortex's swirl pressures the druid's positioning and urgency. Specificity is high (orchard trees, churning branches), though the lake itself could be replaced with another cursed feature without breaking logic. Strong but not fully indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"After the magic trick fails" anchors the opening beat and implies urgency (need to try a second method). The druid's immediate action (chanting, planting seed) follows. However, no live clock tightens decisions; the timeframe is a narrative past marker rather than a pressure device. The failure does not accumulate visible time cost or force faster tactics. Setup present, but no middle or closure development. Functional marker, but swappable with "after the first attempt" or similar phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To discover what mirrors don't show" is stated early and thematically restated at closure ("Mirrors only show the outer shell; they hide the scars"). The druid's quest is framed by this desire. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choice; no beat shows the druid choosing this search over an alternative want or paying a visible cost mid-story for pursuing it. Present in setup and closure resonance, but lacks middle friction. Thematic accent rather than causal driver. Mid-band for lyric reprise without on-page conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Warlike serenity" is introduced early ("centering himself in a warlike serenity, calm as a blade before the strike"), recurs mid-story, and lingers at closure ("the warlike serenity remained, a reminder of the cost"). Tone is coherent and modulates slightly (calm focus → charged action → somber aftermath). However, the phrase functions as a repeated label rather than a felt tonal texture shaping sentence rhythm or diction under pressure. The tone could be described as "focused resolve" with similar effect. Lyric reprise with thematic charge, but not mechanically indispensable.</comment>
