<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's motivation to decode knowledge's growth pattern is sustained throughout, and his interiority is concrete: the crystal testimonies become a fractal of his own erasure. The final realization—that his reticence was "not a virtue but an erasure"—lands with embodied cost when the crystal returns nothing for his name. Minor slip: the transition from listening to desperate reading feels slightly telescoped, compressing what could be a harder choice into rapid sequence. Internal contradiction (silent scholar vs. speaking aloud) drives the closure with visible renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches its pattern early (testimonies as layered fragments) and deepens through accretion of voices until Elias's absence reweights the premise. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis + Charged Poise hybrid): he places the crystal back, walks toward the doors—each step a testimony against the silence he perpetuated. Cost is legible in the torn page and the departure. Orientation anchors by line 3 (library, dawn, Elias). One micro-turn (crystal returns nothing) sets up the final renunciation. The causal chain is indirect but coherent under the accumulative lens: discovery → weeks cataloging → condemnation → self-test → desperate reading → placement and departure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The library is lived-in and functional: broken chandelier (source of crystal), locked doors, weak dawn light advancing each day, dust motes like letters. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The crystal's weight and facets are handled on the page; rotating it isolates decades. Minor limitation: the "shadowed library windows" and "cathedral ceiling" anchor scale but not distinct navigational detail within the space. The crystal-as-micro-setting constrains Elias's method (rotating facets, whispering into it) and charges the final image when he returns it beneath the chandelier.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: decode the pattern of knowledge growth before the library is lost. Escalation: discovery → weeks of cataloging → chained doors ("hours, perhaps less") → self-test (devastating nothing) → desperate reading aloud. The tightening is temporal (condemnation notice) and existential (his own voice absent). Agency at closure: Elias wraps the crystal in "endurance," places it back, and walks—each step a testimony. The price is renunciation of the artifact and acceptance of his erasure. One friction: the transition from desperation to calm placement compresses what might be a harder calculus.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: growth as erosion, testimony as counter to silence, the gap between listening and speaking. The crystal's fractured sequences (child 1956, botanist 1973, poet 1989) ground the abstraction. No overt moralizing; the final image—steps as testimony—answers the thematic question without stating it. The torn page ("endurance") and the dust motes "like forgotten letters" charge the ending. The piece resists tidy resolution: Elias's reticence remains both a failure and the condition for his insight. Minor note: "weathered innocence" as prompt-concept risks abstraction but is embodied in the stammers and hesitations the crystal captures.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Single-POV, third-limited with close psychic distance. Perceptual signature: scholar's idiom ("lexical accumulation," "sonic reflectivity") mixed with lyric compression ("dawn's gray breath," "suspended hush"). No head-hopping. Diction remains stable under pressure; the final beats compress rhythm appropriately. Minor friction: "sonically reflective" in line 8 edges toward exposition, though it is immediately dramatized. The voice modulates across emotional beats (discovery, weeks of work, devastation, calm departure) without convergence. Elias's internal register (reticent precision) matches the narration throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high: nearly every line advances discovery, world-state, or theme. Sentence rhythm varies; no template cadence. Figurative language is controlled: "ink bleeding through paper," "dust motes...like forgotten letters." Minor cluster of scaffold in mid-section: "The pattern emerged slowly" (line 13) followed by summary of that pattern; "he realized" (line 15) is a light filter but fits voice. One paraphrase slip: lines 17–18 restate the library's dimming without added pressure. No loops in peak beats. Clarity and propulsion remain strong; the closure image is clean. The "suspended hush" recurs purposefully rather than as filler.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The crystal-as-sound-fossil premise is specific and non-obvious; the lead-content mechanism (1847 chandelier capturing vibrations like amber) distinguishes it from generic memory artifacts. The testimonies' fractured form (syntax and emotion, not full sentences) is a fresh constraint. Emotional core—scholar's silence as erasure—feels earned rather than imposed. Minor limitation: the library-at-end-of-print-era frame is familiar territory; the piece elevates it through the crystal's mechanics and the protagonist's realization, but the setup does not fully escape template. The ending gesture (placing crystal back, walking as testimony) synthesizes prior material and avoids neat resolution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elias's reticence is signaled early, shapes his method (listening vs. testifying), and drives the closure turn when the crystal's silence devastates him, forcing the decision to read aloud and then walk. His trait forecloses the path of preservation (taking the crystal) and enables the final stance (each step a testimony). Present in setup, middle choice (desperate reading), and ending action.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Crystal introduced at line 1, handled across discovery (line 6), whispered-to (line 9), rotated for isolation (line 16), held to lips for self-test (line 23), pressed against pages (line 26), wrapped in torn page (line 29), and placed back (line 29). Its sonically reflective trait enables the entire investigation and its return of nothing precipitates the climax. Removing it breaks story logic and closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Suspended hush" appears at lines 7, 12, and 24. Functions as both atmosphere and thematic marker (silence vs. testimony). The hush "deepens" (line 24) when Elias discovers his absence, tilting his choice toward desperate action. Shapes tone and stakes but does not constrain a middle tactic as directly as the crystal. Early setup, lyric reprise at closure; functional across two gates with resonance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Sonically reflective trait (line 8) is the crystal's core mechanism: it returns voices rather than light. Enables Elias's entire method (whispering words, cataloging testimonies, rotating facets to isolate decades). Constrains his investigation (he cannot see the past, only hear fractured syntax and emotion). The trait's limit—capturing no record of Elias—drives the devastating self-test. Indispensable to plot and closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Testify" and "testimony/testimonies" appear nine times, structuring the narrative: crystal offers testimonies (line 9), Elias catalogs them (line 12), library's symphony testifies (line 27), final steps are testimony (line 31). The action defines both method and theme. Elias's failure to testify (line 24) is the hinge of the closure turn. Integral to escalation and ending; swapping for "record" or "witness" would dilute the moral and sonic charge.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Fractured sequences" named at lines 10, 12, 20, 27. The method is demonstrated early (child/botanist/poet fragments, line 10) and shapes Elias's interpretive work ("mosaic of meaning," line 11). Constrains his access (incomplete utterances require interpretation) and appears in the climactic symphony (line 27). Present in setup and middle; implicit in closure (his steps as fragmented testimony). Essential to mechanics and theme.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Shadowed library at dawn introduced line 1, anchors throughout: broken chandelier (source of crystal, return site), cathedral ceiling (breach allows crystal to fall), locked/chained doors (constraint, exit point), weak advancing light (marks days passing, illuminates final dust motes). Setting supplies the artifact, marks time pressure (dimming each day, condemnation notice), and stages the departure. Micro-setting (beneath chandelier) frames opening and closure. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Timeframe signaled line 2 (last dictionary printed three weeks prior) and reinforced at lines 18 (preface, machine-written), 22 (doors chained, imminent digitization). The post-print era motivates Elias's urgency and the library's obsolescence. Tightens decision when condemnation notice gives "hours, perhaps less" (line 22). Does not function as a live countdown but establishes existential pressure. Present in setup and ending; affects stakes more than tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Motivation stated line 4 (thirty years pursuing "how does knowledge itself grow") and embodied in the weeks cataloging (line 12), the pattern discovery (lines 13–14), and the final realization (line 28, "spaces between" words). Desire drives all action until devastation shifts it toward testimony. The crystal's answer—growth as erosion (line 20)—both fulfills and inverts his quest. Friction between scholarly listening and personal silence creates the closure cost. Present setup to end with visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Weathered innocence" appears once (line 18, "before it became certain") but the tone pervades: the crystal captures "stammers" and "hesitations" (line 18), voices arrive "incomplete" (line 11), the library "retreats into itself" (line 17). Modulates from discovery (quiet wonder) through cataloging (analytical patience) to devastation and calm departure. The final image—dust motes like forgotten letters—embodies the tone. Coherent and purposeful; charges the ending without being named there.</comment>
