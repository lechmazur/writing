<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior is sparse; she performs tasks (tending, cradling, placing) but we never see contradictory impulses or embodied fear/awe. The ghost bride's motivation is stated ("repay a debt") but not dramatized through choice—she appears, instructs, dissolves without internal friction or visible cost to herself. The ending grants Elara "mournful elation" and "grief and triumph," labels that summarize rather than embody emotion under pressure. No micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values; the bead placement is compliant execution, not a decision shaped by competing wants.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors appear early (greenhouse, Elara, ghost). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the ghost's ephemeral visits layer until the bead placement triggers luminescence and rebirth. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the orchard awakens, the ghost dissolves, debt repaid), but cost is diffuse—Elara "mourns a love she never knew" without forfeiting a present stake or altering her own options. The final beat dissolves into atmosphere ("each fruit bearing the sweet bitterness") rather than a sharp, irreversible change. Under the chosen lens, one meaningful deepening (the bead fuses, life returns) is present, meeting the minimum for this length, but the felt price remains abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The greenhouse is vividly sketched (frosted panes, twisted vines, ancient gnarled tree) and the bead's placement at the root is spatially clear. The "endless night" and "winter-cracked fields" frame mood but do not constrain a tactical choice. The bead as micro-setting object charges the final image (luminescent tendrils sprout, bead fuses to root), satisfying the 9+ gate partially. However, the setting does not pressure Elara's decision—she moves from observation to compliance without environmental friction.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—saving the orchard—is signaled early. No on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options; the ghost instructs, Elara obeys, the outcome succeeds without obstacle. The bead placement should be a high-pressure beat but reads as ritual fulfillment rather than a choice that forecloses a path. Cost is declared ("mourning the loss of a love she never knew") but not dramatized as a present forfeiture. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening (the surge of warmth, the luminescence) is visible, but protagonist agency is minimal and the escalation is atmospheric rather than volitional.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—love as "both poison and cure," debt across lifetimes—emerges from the ghost's presence and the bead's resonant awakenings. The final image (fruits bearing "sweet bitterness," the ghost's silhouette in future cameos) attempts a non-literal answer but relies on abstraction ("blessing and curse") rather than a specific dramatic irony. The "lovingly venomous" whisper is noted twice but not embodied in conflicting action. The ending offers resonance through mood and motif reprise (bead pulse as reminder) without a concrete on-page cost that reweights the opening question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; Elara's perceptual signature leans heavily on atmospheric description ("breath hitched," "weight of centuries") without character-particular idiom. The ghost's dialogue ("I have come to repay a debt") is formal and generic. Diction remains consistent but elevated throughout—no modulation under pressure. Filter verbs ("felt," "watched") appear frequently without voice-motivated purpose. The prose texture is uniform: every beat receives the same lyric treatment, flattening urgency. No head-hopping or tense drift, meeting baseline competence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Overwriting pervades: "lovingly venomous whisper that both soothed and stung," "mournful elation of a story finally told," "sweet bitterness of a love that had finally found its rest." Mixed metaphors ("twist like lost souls seeking light") and stacked modifiers reduce clarity. Paraphrase loops cluster: "endless night" (line 1), "endless darkness" (line 24); "hush of winter-cracked fields" (lines 2, 13, 25). Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "The ghost [verb]" or "Elara [verb]." Figurative density in nearly every sentence without pattern-teaching or payoff triggers −0.5; paraphrase and stem loops add −0.6; total artifact debt ~−1.1. The closure beat ("orchard flourished, each fruit bearing…") is metaphorically cluttered, lowering impact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—ghost bride repays a mystical debt by instructing a botanist to place a magical bead—is a stock fantasy template (mentor spirit, chosen one, mystical MacGuffin) without transformation. The "ashen-veil ghost bride" and "carved stone bead" are genre placeholders; the bead's "resonant awakenings" function as told magical property rather than lived world logic. The "lovingly venomous" tone is declared but not dramatized in contradictory action. Elara's arc (tending → placing → witnessing rebirth) lacks a non-obvious synthesis. Emotional truth is abstracted into "mournful elation" rather than specific, embodied stakes. No bold risk or fresh angle elevates familiar material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The ghost bride appears in ~6 beats (materialization, speech, reappearance at tree, instruction, dissolution, future cameos). She drives the inciting incident (hands bead, explains debt) and provides the climactic instruction ("Place the bead where the roots meet…"). However, she makes no choices that create turns—Elara enacts her directive without friction. The ghost's "ephemeral cameo appearances" serve as atmospheric frame rather than causal agent. Setup and closure participation are present; middle development is passive observation. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle choice; late payoff is instruction, not decision. Swappability: any mentor spirit could deliver the bead and vanish. Score 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bead appears in ~5 beats: ghost holds it (paragraph 5), Elara feels its pulse sync with her heartbeat (13), she cradles and examines it (14), places it at the tree (17–18), and it fuses to the root as permanent echo (22). Early signal (paragraph 5) frames expectation (+0.6). Beat involvement: appears in inciting, rising, and climactic beats (+0.9). Causal pressure: the bead's pulse and placement trigger the orchard's rebirth (+1.2). Closure linkage: the fused bead becomes the story's final anchor ("permanent echo," "each time the bead pulsed") (+1.4). Specificity: "carved with spirals," unique magical property (+0.5). Visible cost: Elara's tears and mourning are tied to the act (+0.4). Total positive signals ~+5.0. Minor friction: the bead's mechanics (why it works, how debt translates to botanical life) are told, not shown (−0.3). Base 3.0 + 5.0 − 0.3 = 7.7; round to 7.8 for strong causal and closure work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Resonant awakenings is introduced in paragraph 9 ("the bead held resonant awakenings, each pulse reviving a memory of a love lost long ago") and echoed in paragraph 13 ("the rhythm of the bead's pulse sync with her own heartbeat"). It is present in the climax (paragraph 18: "a resonant hum filled the greenhouse") and implied in the ending (paragraph 26: "each time the bead pulsed, it was a reminder"). Setup is clear (+0.5). However, the concept is told ("held resonant awakenings," "resonant hum") rather than shaping Elara's tactics or choices. No on-page action demonstrates Elara remembering or being awakened; the "love lost long ago" is abstract. The concept themes the piece but does not constrain a decision or change options. Closure participation is atmospheric reprise, not causal driver. Two-gate presence (setup, weak payoff) allows ~6.0 max per the gate model; swappability (any mystical charge could substitute) and ornamental use lower it. Base 3.0 + setup 0.5 + weak closure mention 0.6 = 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Lovingly venomous appears twice: paragraph 6 ("her voice a lovingly venomous whisper that both soothed and stung") and paragraph 21 ("the lovingly venomous tone now softened into something like gratitude"). It is a label-only descriptor of the ghost's voice; no on-page action embodies the paradox—no moment where tenderness enables a wound or venom serves care. The trait does not constrain or enable a choice. Setup is present (paragraph 6, ~20% mark, +0.4). No middle or closure beat demonstrates the trait shaping stakes. Ornamental use (−0.7), label-only (−0.3). Base 3.0 + setup 0.4 − 1.0 = 2.4; the trait colors tone, so +0.4 for thematic echo = 2.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Ghost (the action of haunting, appearing, instructing) drives the inciting incident (paragraphs 4–9), the climactic instruction (15–16), and the resolution (20–21, dissolution). Setup is early (+0.7). Beat involvement: three major beats (+1.4). Causal pressure: the ghost's presence and bead delivery enable the entire plot (+1.3). Closure linkage: the ghost dissolves in paragraph 21, and future cameos are promised (27), shaping the final image (+1.0). However, the ghost's action is interchangeable with any mentor-spirit archetype delivering a quest item. Specificity is low (−0.6). The ghost does not make a choice that creates a turn; she instructs and Elara complies. Agency is external to Elara, which lowers narrative necessity. Base 3.0 + 4.4 positive − 0.6 swap = 6.8; round to 6.9 for strong causal presence despite passivity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Ephemeral cameo appearances is signaled in paragraph 11 ("the ghost's presence was fleeting, appearing in ephemeral cameo appearances that lasted no more than a heartbeat") and paragraph 27 ("she would often see the ghost bride's silhouette in the corner of her eye, a fleeting cameo of grace"). The method shapes the ghost's unavailability, creating atmospheric urgency, but does not constrain Elara's tactics—she never struggles with the ghost's vanishing or adjusts her plan. Setup at ~40% (late, −0.3). The method is present in the ending as a thematic echo (future cameos) but does not drive the climactic choice. Two-gate presence (setup, weak payoff) allows ~6.0 max. The mechanic is told, not shown in a way that alters Elara's options (−0.5). Base 3.0 + setup 0.3 + weak closure echo 0.6 + atmospheric pressure 0.5 − late −0.3 − ornamental −0.5 = 3.6; thematic color +0.3 = 3.9. However, the method does frame the ghost's narrative role and recurs meaningfully in the ending, so adjust to 5.3 for purposeful pattern and reprise.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse shrouded in endless night is anchored in paragraph 1 and recurs throughout (paragraphs 3, 10, 18, 24). Early signal (+0.7). Beat involvement: present in inciting (ghost materializes among vines), rising (Elara reaches the ancient tree), and climactic (greenhouse vibrates, luminescence spreads) (+1.4). The setting provides the spatial stage and the ancient tree's root as the target for the bead (+0.8). Closure linkage: paragraph 24 ("the greenhouse, once a place of endless darkness, now glowed") reweights the opening image (+1.2). However, the setting does not constrain Elara's choice or create friction; she moves freely from observation to action. The "alchemical" label is ornamental; no alchemical process is shown (−0.5). Base 3.0 + 4.1 positive − 0.5 ornamental label = 6.6. Spatial clarity and charged reprise support the higher end; cap at 6.2 for lack of tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Over the hush of winter-cracked fields appears in paragraphs 2, 13, and 25. The phrase establishes season and desolation but does not function as a timeframe that tightens decisions. The story unfolds in "one still evening" (paragraph 4) with no clock or deadline. The ghost's ephemeral appearances suggest temporal pressure, but Elara never races against vanishing time or adjusts tactics due to a ticking constraint. Setup is early (+0.5). The phrase recurs as atmospheric motif (+0.4). No causal pressure or closure linkage tied to time (−0.7). Swappability: any seasonal descriptor could replace it (−0.5). Base 3.0 + 0.9 − 1.2 = 2.7; the hush frames tone and recurs purposefully, so +0.5 for lyric reprise = 3.2. Adjust to 3.7 for pattern-taught echo that charges the ending image even without tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>To repay a debt across lifetimes is stated in paragraph 7 ("I have come to repay a debt across lifetimes") and echoed in paragraph 21 ("The debt is repaid"). Setup is early (+0.6). The motivation drives the ghost's presence and the bead delivery, enabling the entire plot (+1.0). Closure linkage: the ghost's dissolution follows the debt's resolution (+0.8). However, the debt is told, not dramatized. No friction between the ghost's desire and a competing cost—she appears, instructs, and dissolves without visible sacrifice or conflicted choice. Elara does not wrestle with accepting the debt's terms. The motivation is functional but passive (−0.6). Base 3.0 + 2.4 positive − 0.6 told-only = 4.8; thematic resonance ("love as poison and cure") tied to the debt adds +0.4 = 5.2. Adjust to 5.6 for causal role and closure linkage despite lack of on-page friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mournful elation is stated in paragraph 23 ("the mournful elation of a story finally told") and paragraph 20 ("tears burn her cheeks, mourning the loss… yet rejoicing for the orchard's rebirth"). The tone is signaled mid-story and recurs at closure. Setup at ~75% is late (−0.4). However, the paradoxical mood—grief entwined with triumph—pervades the final third and charges the ending image (paragraph 28: "each fruit bearing the sweet bitterness"). The tone modulates from dread (endless night) to awe (luminescence) to bittersweet legacy, supporting pressure (+1.0). Closure linkage: the final beat ("blessing and curse") embodies the tone (+1.2). Specificity: the oxymoron is thematically apt (+0.5). Late signal (−0.4). Base 3.0 + 2.7 positive − 0.4 late = 5.3. The tone's coherence and modulation across the final arc justify +0.5 = 5.8.</comment>
