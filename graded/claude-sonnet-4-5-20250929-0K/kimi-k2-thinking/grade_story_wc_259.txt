<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lyra remains a cipher throughout; her interior is filled with label-only emotion ("anguished joy") and therapy-speak ("end of innocence") rather than embodied contradiction. The "personal loss" that motivates her is mentioned twice but never dramatized, leaving her quest abstract. No micro-choices reveal hierarchy of values—she touches the pagoda, memories flood, she withdraws—without visible internal conflict or cost that would foreclose a path. The backstory references to empire and lost innocence exceed 20% of the text without anchoring in present choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who Lyra is and why she's here emerge slowly across the opening third without clear spatial grounding (crystalline shelves, obsidian pillars, bronze pagoda—how do these relate?). The drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural (memory purification through avoidance of pattern), but the closure is ambiguous: she withdraws from the pagoda "reluctantly," carries memories as a "bittersweet burden," and continues her work—no decisive change, and the reconfiguration lacks visible cost beyond vague emotional weight. The Cost Proof Test fails: I cannot point to an exact sentence where a path is foreclosed or an option reweighted with undeniable price at the ending beat. Apply Orientation Test penalty −0.4 and cost-legibility deduction −0.6.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The archive's physical layout is scenic but never constrains a choice: crystalline shelves, obsidian pillars, and amber light are described yet Lyra moves through them without spatial friction or resource pressure. The bronze pagoda appears at twilight as predicted, spinning and casting reflections, but its mechanics (how does she locate it? how does spinning encode purification?) remain atmospheric rather than tactical. Micro-setting option is missed—her saffron veil catches light twice but never alters a decision. No 9+ eligibility.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—purifying corrupted memories—is signaled early but never tightens or forces a trade-off. Lyra's method ("avoid patterns," "breathe irregularly") is asserted rather than tested: no moment where a pattern tempts her, no cost paid for irregular thought, no tactical adjustment when the pagoda responds. The withdrawal from the pagoda is described as reluctant but no live option is foreclosed—she achieved her goal and will continue. Escalation is declarative ("the thrill of healing, the pain of reliving") without on-page pressure that narrows choices.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme is stated rather than emerging: "the end of innocence is not a single moment but a continuum," "forbidden knowledge is a double-edged sword," and "some knowledge is worth the pain" are spelled out in the final paragraphs. The atoms-of-nostalgia conceit never reweights prior material—it functions as a label for "memories" without conceptual friction. The closing image (saffron veil in last light, steadily unpredictable heartbeat) gestures at resonance but the overt thematic summary in the penultimate paragraph (−0.6 for final-paragraph moralizing) undercuts earned insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, but diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("latent energy," "fragile epoch," "mosaic of joy and grief") that reads generic rather than Lyra-specific. Perceptual signature is weak: her way of noticing (historian, scholar, mourner?) is never character-particular. The phrase "steadily unpredictable" appears three times with identical phrasing, creating template cadence. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she realized," "she understood") cluster in the final third without voice motivation, dulling immediacy at closure (−0.5 in Q7 spillover, noted here for distance control).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "atoms of nostalgia" is restated across six paragraphs without added detail; "anguished joy" appears four times with identical structure. Template cadence: "She touched... She felt... She saw... She must..." runs through the middle third. Synonym churn: "fragile epoch," "end of innocence," and "bittersweet burden" cycle without propulsion. Stock metaphors: "double-edged sword," "silent chorus of whispers," "leaf on a stream." The final paragraph stacks these artifacts at closure, triggering −1.7 total and disallowing 9+ globally. Figurative density (dying sun, rose and violet, kaleidoscope, ghostly echoes) appears in most sentences of the pagoda beat without pattern-teaching.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Core premise—lost-civilization memory archive accessed via ritual object—is a widely used SFF template (knowledge-quest with mystical device). The "atoms of nostalgia" label rebrands "encoded memories" without transformation. Lyra's method ("avoid patterns") is asserted as unique but never demonstrated through specific trade-offs or innovations. The story could swap "atoms" for "shards" or "echoes," "bronze prism" for "crystal key," and "historian" for "scholar" with no structural change, signaling high swappability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Lyra is present throughout but her choices do not create turns: she searches (off-page for years), finds the pagoda at twilight as legend foretold, touches it, experiences memories, withdraws. No decision alters tactics or stakes—coincidence (twilight arrival) and assertion (she purifies by thinking irregularly) drive the sequence. Her withdrawal is "reluctant" but no competing option is dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The bronze prism pagoda appears at the 40% mark ("As twilight deepened, she glimpsed..."), touched once ("She touched the cool bronze"), spins and casts reflections in one extended beat, then goes dormant. It returns in the final line ("the bronze prism pagoda now dormant") with reweighted meaning (waiting for next twilight). Three gates met (setup, development via touch/spin, closure callback), but causal pressure is weak—it responds to her thought without constraint. Lyric reprise elevates slightly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Atoms of nostalgia" is named five times but functions as a synonym for "memories" without altering tactics. The concept does not constrain or enable a choice: Lyra's purification method (avoid patterns) is orthogonal to the atomic metaphor. No on-page mechanics—how does subatomic encoding differ from symbolic storage? The atoms "respond" and shift color, but this is scenic rather than stake-shaping.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Steadily unpredictable" is declared three times ("her method became steadily unpredictable," "a steady unpredictable rhythm," "steadily unpredictable heartbeat") but never enacted with visible cost or constraint. No scene demonstrates Lyra resisting a pattern or paying a price for randomness. The phrase is label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Purify" is the stated goal, signaled early and present at closure ("purifying the past one atom at a time"). Two beats: she learns she must purify by avoiding patterns (told); she purifies by letting thoughts drift and breathing irregularly (one extended middle beat). The action shapes the arc but is swappable—"decode," "restore," or "cleanse" would function identically without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Avoiding patterns" is named as the method midway ("To purify... she must avoid patterns") and restated at closure, but its mechanics are abstract: "let her thoughts wander," "breathe irregularly," "mind drift like a leaf." No demonstrated pattern tempts her; no cost for irregularity is shown. The method does not alter tactics in a visible way—it is asserted as effective rather than tested.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The lost civilization archive is described across the opening third (crystalline shelves, obsidian pillars, amber light, ruined halls) and mentioned at closure ("She left the archive"). It provides the locale for the quest but does not pressure choices—Lyra moves freely, and no resource (light, access, danger) constrains her. The archive functions as backdrop rather than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"The end of innocence" appears three times as a thematic label but no timeframe is tracked on the page. The quest "spanned the end of innocence" (told, past tense); "she now walked that fragile line" (metaphorical). No clock or temporal pressure shapes decisions. The phrase is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Forbidden knowledge" is named twice and Lyra's quest is stated as pursuit, but no friction dramatizes the motivation—no authority forbids her, no internal doubt tests her resolve, no cost for knowing is paid beyond vague sorrow. The motivation is declared rather than conflicted in choices. One beat (touching the pagoda) enacts pursuit, lifting the score slightly.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Anguished joy" is labeled four times ("she felt anguished joy," "the anguished joy intensify," "the anguished joy remained") but the tone is told rather than modulated through syntax or image. Emotional charge is uniform (melancholy wonder) across discovery, purification, and closure without variance under pressure. The phrase becomes a descriptor rather than an embodied tonal shift.</comment>
