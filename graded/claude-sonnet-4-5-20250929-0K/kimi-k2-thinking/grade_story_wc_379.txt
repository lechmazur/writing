<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to "prove that listening heals" is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her investigation proceeds smoothly without meaningful internal friction—she collects stories, finds the key, opens the mailbox, all without visible cost to her choices until the ending. The final stance (organizing letters, facing bulldozers) arrives without prior struggle between competing goods. Elena's emotional response is embodied ("eyes filled with tears"), but Mira's arc lacks the on-page tension required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece assembles neighborhood voices and clues across multiple beats (Mrs. Chen, Mr. Dominquez, Samir, Elena) toward an RR/CR ending where the letters become community testimony. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (dawn, courtyard, thrift shop). However, the ending disperses pressure across summary beats (developer arrives, council meetings packed, development stalled) rather than concentrating cost in one on-page image. The mailbox opening itself is a physical act, but the subsequent "display in window → voice found → stalled development" sequence tells rather than shows the closure consequence, diffusing the felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The courtyard at dawn is vividly rendered ("apricot and rose," jasmine, mosaic benches, cobblestones) and recurs across key beats. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (eastern corner, north side jasmine, terra cotta pot). However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the key discovery beneath the pot and the mailbox's rusted lock are the only moments where environment materially constrains action. The vibrant courtyard motif charges the final image ("colors more vivid now"), but does not shape a middle choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—saving the courtyard from development—is declared early via orange survey flags. One meaningful tightening occurs when Samir reveals the grandmother's sleep-talk, narrowing the search to the north-side jasmine. Yet Mira's investigation proceeds without setbacks: every informant freely shares, the key fits perfectly, Elena cooperates, and the letters provide exactly the proof needed. The bulldozers' arrival is resolved off-page through summarized council meetings, not by a protagonist choice with visible on-page cost. Accumulative mode can tolerate linear progress, but escalation requires at least one moment where Mira's tactics are forced to change or a live option is foreclosed with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme—"listening heals"—emerges from the mailbox premise and neighborhood testimony. The final image (letters as "bricks in the wall of community") offers symbolic weight. However, the theme is stated overtly multiple times: "she had to prove that listening heals," "The proof was there, tangible: listening heals," and the closing line's direct assertion. These overt articulations replace earned resonance. The thematic echo penalty (final lines that articulate the thesis in prompt language) applies: the neighbors say "She hears what we cannot," and Mira smiles knowing "the connections you unlock when you simply stop to listen." This reads as a moral summary rather than an image that reweights prior material without stating it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Mira's perceptual signature (reading "secret histories in chipped porcelain") establishes voice. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Elena's whisper and Samir's low voice carry subtext. However, multiple passages drift into elevated register not grounded in Mira's interiority: "the stories woven through these walls were worth more than concrete and glass," "the greatest finds aren't things you can hold, but the connections you unlock." These read as thematic commentary rather than character-particular perception. The phrase "sandstorm calm" is applied to Elena's voice and then to the ending ("The sandstorm had passed, leaving only calm"), but the metaphor's vehicle—sandstorm—contradicts the established atmosphere of a jasmine courtyard at dawn, creating figurative muddle.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence appear across adjacent lines: "She'd been hearing rumors...never understood why" repeats the hearing motif without added pressure; "At the next dawn, the entire courtyard gathered" then "The developer's bulldozers arrived that afternoon" are told in identical summary syntax. The phrase "sandstorm calm" is used twice with identical syntax ("voice a sandstorm calm," "The sandstorm had passed"), and the vehicle contradicts established sensory detail (jasmine, apricot light). Filter-verb stacks ("hearing a baby's cry," "hearing his mother whisper," "hearing his grandmother talk," "She'd been hearing rumors") cluster across high-pressure beats without variation. Stock metaphor: "threads," "echoes," "bricks in the wall" appear without fresh embodiment. These artifacts accumulate to −1.0 in Q7 and disallow 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—community unites to save a place via discovered letters—follows a widely used template (grassroots resistance to development; hidden time capsule reveals forgotten values). The locked-mailbox mystery and listening-heals thesis are enacted without transformation through unexpected particulars or moral friction. Mira's investigation proceeds via predictable turns (old residents remember, teenager knows grandmother's secret, key unlocks locket and mailbox in sequence). The ending (letters displayed, council meetings packed, development stalled) resolves all threads with symmetric satisfaction. No bold risk or non-obvious synthesis elevates the familiar arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mira's curation skill is named in the opening and her decision to investigate is present by the second beat. She organizes the letter display and stands before bulldozers at closure. However, her discerning eye—reading "secret histories"—does not constrain a middle choice with visible cost; the investigation's key turns are driven by informants' revelations, not by her professional judgment. Two beats (opening self-identification, closing display curation) plus closure participation justify mid-band, but the lack of causal pressure from the curator trait caps at 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The locket appears in beat one (discovery), unlocks to reveal a note and address in beat three (Samir provides key), and is worn by Elena at closure. Three distinct beats. The locket's dual compartments drive two causal steps (note → mailbox number, key → address). However, its reappearance at the end (Elena wearing it) is ornamental rather than reweighted; the closure turns on the letters, not the locket. Strong setup, clear development, closure presence without decisive charge: 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mailbox mystery is introduced in beat two, drives the investigation's middle structure (neighbors recall its sealing, Samir's clue, key search), and the opening of the mailbox is the story's climactic physical act. The mystery shapes tactics across multiple beats and the letters inside provide the proof that alters the community's stance. Causal pressure, beat involvement, and closure linkage all present. Scores ≥7.0.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Leads through following" is asserted in narration: "Mira followed them like a tracker...letting the stories lead." The phrase "following the echoes they left behind" labels the method but does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost. Mira listens to each informant in turn without a moment where passive listening conflicts with an alternate tactic she must reject. The attribute is thematically present but does not drive a turn or force a trade-off. Late thematic mentions do not count as development. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Hear" recurs across beats: Mira hears stories, Mrs. Chen and Mr. Dominquez recall hearing sounds, Samir hears his grandmother, neighbors say Mira "hears what we cannot." The action is present in setup, middle (each informant beat), and thematically at closure. However, the verb "hear" is largely interchangeable with "listen" or "learn"; no on-page moment hinges on auditory perception as opposed to any other mode of gathering testimony. Functional across beats, but the lack of irreplaceable specificity (a misheard word, an eavesdropped secret, a sound that contradicts a story) keeps it shy of 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Neighborhood storytelling is signaled early ("investigation through neighborhood storytelling") and structures the middle: Mrs. Chen, Mr. Dominquez, Samir each contribute a story. The method shapes attempts (sitting on benches at dawn, learning to hear pauses). However, the mechanics are generic; Mira does not adapt her questioning, face conflicting accounts, or pay a cost for relying on oral testimony. The method is present and consistent but does not narrow options or generate friction. Two beats plus thematic closure mention justify 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The courtyard at dawn is introduced in the opening image, recurs as the investigation site (mosaic benches, jasmine corners, terra cotta pot), and the final paragraph restates "vibrant courtyard at dawn...colors more vivid now." Early seed, middle use (key location), and a lyric reprise that reweights meaning. The setting does not constrain a middle choice with cost, but the purposeful early–final bracket that charges the closure image qualifies for the lyric-resonance allowance: 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"When the outside world intrudes" is signaled by the developer's orange flags appearing "overnight" in beat two and the bulldozers arriving at the story's climax. The intrusion frames urgency and Mira's motivation crystallizes in response. However, the timeframe does not tighten tactics on the page; the investigation proceeds across "three dawns" without a clock that forces a choice between speed and thoroughness. The developer's arrival is told ("that afternoon") rather than dramatized as a pressure point. Present in setup and closure, but lacks middle escalation via ticking time.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To prove that listening heals" is stated outright in beat two ("Her motivation crystallized") and repeated at closure ("The proof was there, tangible: listening heals"). The desire drives the investigation's direction. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants; Mira never weighs listening against a faster or safer tactic, nor does she doubt the premise under pressure. Label-only motivation with no friction trends low despite narrative presence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Sandstorm calm" appears twice: applied to Elena's voice ("sandstorm calm—hushed but swirling with emotion") and the final line ("The sandstorm had passed, leaving only calm"). The phrase is present at setup and closure. However, the vehicle (sandstorm) contradicts the courtyard's established sensory palette (jasmine, apricot dawn, mosaic, vibrant colors) and the tone does not modulate with pressure—scenes of discovery, revelation, and bulldozer confrontation all proceed in the same declarative register. Static mood with incoherent metaphor and no tonal escalation: 4.8.</comment>
