<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The locksmith's "peripherally focused" trait is invoked repeatedly but rarely constrains choices with visible cost—it flavors perception more than it drives action. Interiority is concrete ("studying reflection angles," grinding lenses) and the seventeen-day arc shows endurance, but internal conflict is minimal; the protagonist never doubts his method or wrestles with competing impulses. The final satisfaction ("satisfied") lands cleanly but feels unearned because no prior mistake or visible struggle tested his competence. Embodied emotion is present in patient observation, yet the lack of contradictory impulses or blind spots keeps this in the solid mid-band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is anchored early (cavern, locksmith, broken timer) and the causal lens holds: he studies angles, discovers temporal echoes, grinds lenses, installs them, and the mechanism clicks. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (release replaces harvest), and the cost is conceptual—wonder stored not in a cellar but in shared flow—legible in the final image of "angled light." One meaningful tightening occurs when he realizes overload caused the break and redesigns the harvest. Minor weaknesses: the seventeen-day span compresses key turns into summary ("spent days grinding," "worked without haste"), and the stakes never narrow options on the page; he completes each step without friction or trade-off, which keeps escalation gentle and caps the high band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The marble cavern is vivid and specific: condensation-sweating limestone bench, veins channeling vibrations, six/twelve/eighteen-degree angles mapped across beats. Tuning forks, rose quartz lenses, and the broken timer are handled tactilely across multiple beats, and the final image—angled light dancing on the workbench—charges the closure. Sensory detail is selective (sound, touch, sight) and filtered through the locksmith's craft lens. No significant setting inconsistency or white-room drift; the environment supplies resources (marble's acoustic memory) and the micro-setting (workbench, lenses) constrains tactics, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring the Echo Chamber's function—is signaled early and tightens once when he discovers overload and redesigns the mechanism. Agency is decision-based (reverse-engineer, grind lenses, install at six degrees), but no on-page reversal or live cost alters tactics; each step succeeds as planned without forced trade-off or visible forfeit. The "wounded season" and its emotional echoes provide thematic pressure but remain abstract; no moment on the page makes the locksmith choose between competing goods or pay a legible price (time, stamina, failed attempts). Closure participation is clear (the mechanism clicks, echoes flow), yet the lack of friction or a narrowing choice keeps this just shy of the 7.0 threshold for felt cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—wonder stored not by hoarding but by understanding and release—emerges organically from the locksmith's arc and the shift from harvest to shared flow. The final image (angled light, echoes layered in marble) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in "peripherally focused," "wounded season," and "let it breathe," avoiding prompt-label echo. One minor slip: "he had not fixed time, but had learned to let it breathe" flirts with direct statement, though it stops short of a thesis. The rose quartz facets and reflection angles recur purposefully, reweighting prior material at closure; the piece resists tidy morals and invites reflection through lived detail.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited is stable, psychic distance controlled, and the perceptual signature—oblique glances, pattern detection—colors every beat. Diction is consistent (chronomantic, temporal residues, acoustic memory) and voice-specific, though register occasionally drifts into elevated exposition ("oblique glances," "architecture so completely"). No dialogue; all evaluation rests on narrative texture. Peak-stress compression is absent because the locksmith never faces crisis; his calm, methodical voice suits the reflective mode but lacks modulation under pressure. Free indirect style is clean, no POV leakage, and the final image maintains focalization ("his own reflection seemed to smile from the periphery").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Prose is clear and rhythmically varied, with strong concrete nouns (tuning forks, rose quartz, mercury pendulum) and vivid phrases ("marble that sweat condensation," "secret rivers"). However, multiple scaffold and loop patterns accumulate: "reflection angles at different times" appears three times nearly verbatim, "peripherally focused" is invoked four times with minimal variation, and "wounded season" recurs without added meaning. Template cadence is visible in parallel constructions ("He decided," "He spent," "He installed"). Paraphrase loops occur ("studying reflection angles" → "charted the cavern's acoustic memory" → "measuring how each angle captured a different era"). Figurative language is occasionally strained ("lull of a wounded season," "cellar of reason") but does not obscure clarity. Information density is high in the angle-mapping beats, yet summary phrases ("spent days," "worked without haste") compress key actions that warrant scene. Apply −0.8 for loop/scaffold accumulation (three distinct issues); final-paragraph artifacts are absent, so no disqualification trigger.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—reverse-engineering a chronomantic timer via acoustic reflection angles—is specific and non-obvious, avoiding template locksmith or haunted-workshop clichés. The transformation from harvest to release offers a fresh inflection on restoration arcs. However, the execution leans on stock metaphors ("wounded season," "wonder in the cellar of reason," "let it breathe") that feel familiar rather than inevitable. The locksmith's peripherally-focused trait and the reflection-angle method are introduced as concepts more than lived constraints; swapping "angles" for "frequencies" or "materials" would preserve the arc with minor edits, signaling mid-band replaceability. Emotional honesty is present but muted; the protagonist's satisfaction at closure lacks the earned struggle that would make the synthesis feel indispensable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The reflective locksmith appears throughout, and his decisions (reverse-engineer, grind lenses, install at six degrees) drive the arc from broken mechanism to restored flow. He is present in the opening, middle discovery (overload realization), and closure (installation, satisfaction). However, many beats summarize his work ("spent days grinding," "worked without haste") rather than dramatizing choice under pressure, and no on-page reversal forces him to alter tactics. The trait "reflective" colors tone but does not constrain a key turn with visible cost. Strong setup and closure linkage, but limited causal pressure and middling cost connection keep this in mid-7s rather than higher.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The broken timer mechanism is handled in the opening (crystal gears cracked, mercury pendulum frozen), studied in the middle (focusing lens for temporal echoes), and transformed at closure (foundation of the release device). It appears in at least three distinct beats and its specific properties (overload from wounded-season echoes) enable the locksmith's redesign. Removing it would break the story's logic. One friction: much of its involvement is described rather than dramatically enacted ("became the foundation of something stranger"), which lowers causal pressure slightly. Strong setup, development, and closure participation with clear irreplaceability, meeting all three gates and elevating to high 8s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The harvest of echoes frames the inciting problem (harvest failed), shapes the middle discovery (timer as focusing lens, overload from dying moments), and is transformed at closure (release replaces harvest). It appears in at least three beats and the locksmith's redesign directly addresses it. However, the concept is more thematic backdrop than tactical constraint; the locksmith never chooses between hoarding and releasing mid-scene, nor does the harvest mechanism impose a visible cost that alters his method. Strong setup and closure linkage with moderate causal pressure, eligible for mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Peripherally focused" is introduced early ("always detecting patterns in the corners of his vision"), invoked in the middle ("At the periphery of his vision, he noticed"), and reprised at closure ("peripherally focused gaze catching the first glimmer"). It appears in three beats and is labeled as essential to his craft ("made him a master"). However, the trait never constrains a choice or imposes a visible cost; it flavors perception but does not force a trade-off or enable a tactic unavailable to a non-peripherally-focused character. The attribute is present and consistent but largely ornamental, capping it below 7.0 despite closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Reverse-engineering is signaled early ("decided to reverse-engineer the timer's function"), drives the middle beats (studying angles, discovering overload cause, grinding lenses), and culminates in the closure installation. The action is causally central and irreplaceable; swapping it for "repair" or "replicate" would require major structural edits. It appears in at least three beats and imposes cost (painstaking seventeen-day process). Strong setup, causal pressure, and closure linkage, but much of the work is summarized rather than dramatized, which slightly lowers beat involvement credit. Eligible for high 7s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Studying reflection angles at different times is introduced early ("studying reflection angles at different times"), demonstrated in the middle (tuning forks at dawn/noon/twilight, six/twelve/eighteen degrees), and paid off at closure (final lens installed at six degrees). The method is specific, dramatized across multiple beats, and its mechanics matter (angles capture different eras, overload discovered via angle study). Removing it would break the story's causal spine. Strong setup, development, and closure participation with high specificity and beat involvement, meeting all three gates and elevating to high 7s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The marble cavern is anchored early (condensation-sweating bench, curved surfaces), supplies resources in the middle (veins channeling vibrations, acoustic memory), and charges the final image (angled light, layered voices in marble). It appears in at least three beats and its specific properties (marble's reflection/vibration behavior) enable the locksmith's method. The cavern constrains his approach (must study angles in situ) and the micro-setting (workbench, lenses) alters tactics. Strong setup, development, and closure participation with moderate causal pressure, eligible for mid-7s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "across the lull of a wounded season" is introduced in the opening and mentioned at closure ("wounded season's scars would remain"). The seventeen-day span is noted but not tracked beat-by-beat; no live clock tightens decisions or alters tactics. The "wounded season" provides thematic atmosphere (dying moments, overload) but does not impose a deadline or visible cost. Present in setup and closure, but development is absent; the timeframe is descriptive rather than tactical. Lyric reprise is visible but does not reweight stakes with cost, capping it below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To store wonder in the cellar of reason, for later" is invoked twice (opening and mid-story: "This was how one stored wonder"), shaping the locksmith's goal. However, the motivation is more thematic claim than dramatized desire; no on-page beat shows the locksmith wrestling with competing wants or paying a cost to pursue this goal. The closure reweights the phrase (wonder stored not in a cellar but in shared flow), which provides lyric resonance. Present in setup and closure with a purposeful reprise, but limited causal friction and no visible cost connection keep this in mid-6s.</comment>
