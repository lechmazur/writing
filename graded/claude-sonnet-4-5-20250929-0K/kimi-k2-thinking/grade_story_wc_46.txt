<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to share starlight is clear and consistent, but her interiority remains abstract rather than embodied—"the weight reminded her of the stars she could not touch" states connection without showing the contradictory impulses that would charge it. The polishing action is meditative but never complicated by doubt, fatigue, or competing desires. Internal conflict is declared ("earthbound...yet her feet remained rooted") but not enacted through simultaneous opposing impulses in scene. The children's mimicry at the end broadens impact but does not emerge from Mira's agency or cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers polishing, placement, and village response to build resonance. Orientation anchors (Mira, grotto, mist) land early. One meaningful deepening occurs when the pearl is placed and draws villagers, reweighting Mira's solitary mission into communal glow. However, closure lacks visible cost—Mira's heart "held a pearl of stillness" is assertion, not a dramatized forfeiture or renunciation. The ending extends into summary ("each piece she polished became a new pearl") rather than a charged final image, diluting the closure moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto provides atmospheric grounding (mist, stone walls, wet sand) and the sea glass is handled on the page (lifted, dipped, rubbed). Spatial choreography is clear: grotto to cliff path to village square. The polishing pool and flat rock enable the central action. However, the grotto does not constrain choice or complicate Mira's mission; it functions as picturesque backdrop rather than pressure. The "pearl of stillness" placed on the pedestal charges the final third but the setting itself remains static.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—sharing light without flame—is signaled early and pursued consistently. The polishing sequence provides one meaningful tightening (frosted haze to pearl), and placement in the square tests the mission. However, no on-page cost or trade-off emerges: Mira encounters no resistance, fatigue, doubt, or competing need. The villagers gather without friction; children mimic without complication. Escalation reads as accumulation of similar actions rather than narrowing options or raising price. Agency is present but unchallenged.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—earthbound souls sharing starlight through reflection—emerges from image and action rather than statement until the final paragraphs, which over-articulate: "the true gift was not the light itself, but the stillness it carried within." The sea glass as vessel for captured light offers a resonant central image. However, the ending dissolves into summary and soft moralizing ("the world turned, carrying the gentle glow") rather than trusting a single charged particular. Subtext is thin; the village's response is unanimously appreciative without tension or counter-reading.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Mira throughout. Perceptual signature is present (star-watcher filtering through celestial comparison) but diction drifts into elevated register inconsistent with a village artisan: "a beacon that needed no flame," "collective glow of countless sea-glass pearls." No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext tests do not apply. Psychic distance is consistent but the voice lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure—polishing, climbing, and placement all carry the same lyric cadence without tightening. Pronoun references and tense remain clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "pearl of stillness" recurs nine times without evolving meaning; "serpentine grotto in mist" appears five times as static anchor. Multiple sentences restate without adding pressure: "She had found a way to give light without flame, a gift of pure reflection. The pearl of stillness remained, a silent sentinel..." Figurative density is high but often redundant: "a quiet mission rising like dawn," "a pearl of stillness," "a universe of stillness." Template cadence in final third: "Each piece...a new pearl. The village grew...Each one a quiet story." These loops dull momentum and obscure the closure image. Syntax varies purposefully in early beats but flattens into summary rhythm late.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core image—polishing sea glass to share reflected starlight—offers a fresh synthesis of earthbound longing and practical alchemy. However, the story retreats into familiar beats: solitary artisan, grateful village, children learning the craft, legacy of light. The final third summarizes rather than dramatizing a fresh turn, and "zephyr bloom" functions as decorative diction rather than a transformation of expectation. Emotional arc (isolation to sharing) is clear but not inflected with a non-obvious cost or complication. Proximity to lyric template (gather, polish, place, inspire) is high without subversion.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira appears throughout and her choices (entering grotto, lifting glass, polishing, placing pearl) drive the sequence. However, these are linear steps without reversal or visible trade-off. Setup and closure participation are present; middle development is observation and meditation rather than decision under pressure. Removing "star watcher" trait would not break story logic—her father's teaching is backstory flavor, not a constraint on present action.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sea glass appears in setup (shard winks), development (polishing sequence with handling in multiple beats: lifted, dipped, rubbed), and closure (placed as pearl, draws villagers). It enables the central action and its transformation (frosted to polished) mirrors thematic arc. However, cost is not tied to the glass itself—Mira encounters no difficulty finding, holding, or working it. The object is necessary but not charged with a specific price or constraint that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Pearl of stillness" is coined mid-story and repeated as label without causal pressure. It describes the polished glass but does not constrain Mira's choices or reweight options—she achieves it without friction. Closure participation is summary-only: "each piece she polished became a new pearl of stillness." The concept frames theme but does not shape on-page stakes or tactics. Swappable with "gem of light" or similar metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Reflectively vibrant" appears once in setup as descriptor: "its reflectively vibrant surface." The attribute is observed, not tested. It does not constrain or enable a choice, and no cost is tied to it. The glass's reflective quality matters thematically, but "vibrant" adds no causal pressure. Label-only mention; easily omitted without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Weigh" appears twice: once when Mira lifts the glass ("let the glass weigh in her palm"), once when children "learn to weigh each piece." Setup and closure echo are present. The action primes noticing and valuation but does not drive a turn or constrain a beat—the weight reminds her of stars but does not alter her tactics. Lyric reprise reweights meaning slightly (from solitary to communal practice). Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Gem polishing is signaled in setup ("prepared for the slow art") and executed in development with mechanical detail (dipped, rubbed with sand, frosted haze clears). The method shapes the central sequence and its duration ("each stroke a meditation") mirrors theme. Closure shows children mimicking the method. However, the mechanics are simple and never complicate—no tool fails, no technique requires adjustment. Present across beats and essential to the transformation, but unchallenged process trends mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The serpentine grotto provides atmospheric framing in setup and closure bookend ("still waits, a quiet sanctuary"). Mira enters it, finds the glass, and polishes there. However, the grotto supplies resources (pool, flat rock) without pressuring choice—it is cooperative backdrop. Mist and stone walls are described but do not constrain Mira's movement or complicate her mission. Functional setting presence but postcard rather than crucible; middle development is passive.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"As memories resurface" appears once in paragraph four, cueing a brief backstory of childhood nights and father's teaching. This primes Mira's motivation but does not tighten present decisions—no clock, no urgency tied to the memory's arrival. Time flows vaguely from mist to sunset to dawn without tactical impact. The timeframe ornaments interiority but is not tracked or pressured; easily replaced with "while reflecting" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to share light without using fire" is stated in setup ("she sought a way") and pursued across beats: polishing, placement, village response. It shapes the dominant stake and is tested through action. Closure shows the mission fulfilled and expanded (children join). However, friction is absent—no competing desire, no cost to the sharing, no moment where ease or solitude tempts her away. Desire is dramatized in consistent choices but not conflicted; trends upper-mid band for linear pursuit.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Zephyr bloom" appears twice: once late in setup ("air carried a zephyr bloom, soft and promising"), once in the final third ("to bloom like the zephyr"). It functions as decorative diction without modulating with pressure or charging the closure. Tone is uniformly lyric and contemplative throughout, with no tension or shift. The phrase does not constrain voice or reflect stake changes. Present but ornamental; swappable with similar soft imagery.</comment>
