<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The painter's insomnia and exhaustion are asserted rather than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. Her motivation to "thresh meaning" remains abstract; the exchange with the scavenger lacks visible micro-choices that reveal competing values under pressure. The final sleep and painting feel like symbolic resolution rather than earned change through on-page cost. Interior experience is told through lyric summary rather than shown through specific perceptual shifts.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece establishes a pattern of convergence through recurring images (brooch, canvas, rain trails) and achieves a cadence shift when the painter sleeps and reengages her work. However, the closure moment—painting over the portrait—carries implied rather than dramatized cost; the final image reweights meaning but lacks a concrete on-page price that forecloses a path. Orientation anchors arrive within the first 120 words (tidal island, water wars, insomniac painter), satisfying the test. The exchange beat functions as a micro turn but does not meaningfully tighten options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The tidal island supplies recurring sensory details (salt-scarred stone, wet sand, rain trails, sodden earth) that anchor the painter's movements and prime the brooch discovery. The watchtower ruin and the studio hut provide spatial grounding for the exchange and closure. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it remains atmospheric rather than causal. The amber brooch and canvas function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image, lifting the score into the 7s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to thresh meaning from silence and memory through art. The painter's sleeplessness and search apply coherent pressure, and the exchange with the scavenger offers a tightening beat. However, the escalation is atmospheric rather than driven by protagonist agency; the brooch appears by chance, and the scavenger's arrival is coincidental. The cost of painting over the portrait is implied but not dramatized—no visible trade-off or foreclosed path on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs but lacks the felt price required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—art as memory and continuity in a ruined world—emerges through the brooch, the portrait, and the rain trails without overt statement. The final image of painting over the younger self offers a resonant reconfiguration that reweights prior material. However, the closing lines ("the story was never truly finished," "the brush dance") edge toward thematic summary rather than letting the image speak. The ant in amber and the rain trails as language are evocative but approach symbolic convenience, introduced late without prior constraint.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single POV; focalization remains stable. Voice carries a consistent lyric register with elevated diction ("haggard awe," "wryly earnest," "thresh meaning") that fits the painter's reflective stance. The scavenger's one line of dialogue ("the rain trails had led him to the ruin, where the paint had bled into the stone") is serviceable but generic. Perceptual signature is evident in the painter's attention to textures and colors, though the syntactic rhythm flattens across emotional beats—many paragraphs open with "She" + past-tense verb, creating template cadence in the middle third.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Clarity and rhythm are generally strong, but repetitive sentence stems ("She walked," "She offered," "She asked," "She understood," "She returned," "She felt," "She realized," "She would remain," "She closed," "She exhaled," "She smiled") create template cadence across a dozen lines, triggering a −0.5 deduction. Several adjacent lines paraphrase the same idea: "the island itself was a canvas" / "the land remembered" / "the island was alive" loop without adding pressure. Figurative density is high ("the island seemed to pulse," "sky a bruised purple," "fingers rough," "swirl of amber and salt") but remains legible. Information density is moderate; some lines advance atmosphere more than story.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The post-apocalyptic artist on a tidal island synthesizes familiar elements (water wars, ruins, scavenger) without a transforming angle. The amber brooch as a time-capture motif and the rain trails as a navigation method offer mild freshness, but the emotional arc—exhausted artist finds lost work, regains purpose, begins to paint again—follows a recognizable template. The exchange (art for jewelry, past for present) is thematically legible but does not surprise in hindsight. Risk-taking in the lyric accumulation mode is present but does not heighten stakes enough to offset the derivative premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The insomniac painter is present throughout and makes decisions (lifting the brooch, walking to the watchtower, offering the exchange, painting over the portrait), satisfying setup, development, and payoff gates. However, the decisions feel reactive rather than causally driven by contradictory impulses; the painter observes and responds to external prompts (finding the brooch, meeting the scavenger) rather than generating key turns through internal conflict. The final choice to paint is thematically charged but lacks visible cost that forecloses a path. Present in closure but not causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The amber brooch appears early (morning discovery in wet sand), is handled in the exchange beat (offered to the scavenger), and returns in the final third ("the amber brooch… now shone in a stranger's hand," "In the amber's glow, the ant seemed to move"). Three distinct beats satisfy the gate. The brooch's golden glow and trapped ant are described, and it functions as a key to unlocking the exchange. However, the brooch does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it is a symbolic token whose meaning is asserted ("a captured sun," "a key") rather than dramatized through cost. Reweighted reprise is present but lacks causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Unearthed convergence is stated explicitly ("The unearthed convergence was not a moment, but a continuous seam where past and present stitched themselves together") and echoed thematically in the exchange of brooch for canvas. Setup occurs late (midpoint declaration); development is thematic rather than tactical—the concept does not shape on-page choices or narrow options. Payoff is present in the final image of painting over the portrait, but the convergence remains a label rather than a dramatized force. Functional but largely ornamental, more theme than stake.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Wryly earnest appears twice: "Her hands moved with a wryly earnest desperation" (early) and "She smiled, wryly earnest" (final paragraph). The trait is asserted rather than enacted through contradictory choices; no on-page action shows the cost of earnestness tempered by irony or vice versa. Present at setup and closure but label-only, without visible trade-off. Does not constrain or enable a beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The exchange (brooch for canvas) is the story's central hinge, occurring at the watchtower and driving the painter's return and renewed work. Setup is mid-story; development is immediate (the exchange alters the painter's emotional state); payoff is visible in the final act of painting over the portrait. The exchange could be replaced with a different transaction (gift, theft, discovery) without breaking the arc, limiting irreplaceability. Present in all three gates and drives two beats, but swappable with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Following rain trails is signaled early ("by following rain trails she found her way") and used once (the painter walks to the watchtower; the scavenger also mentions rain trails led him to the ruin). Setup is present; development is minimal—the trails enable discovery but do not constrain choice or impose cost. Closure participation is indirect (the painter "listened to the rain trails" as a final realization). The method is functional but could be replaced with "following the shoreline" or "following footprints" with negligible impact. Two gates, mild causal role.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The tidal island is established early and supplies recurring details (salt-scarred stone, wet sand, tide, ruins, storms, rain). Setup is strong; development occurs through the watchtower encounter and the studio on the island's spine. The island's tides and storms are described as shaping the painter's work ("each tide a brushstroke, each storm a color"), and the island is declared alive in the final third. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; it provides atmosphere and symbolic resonance rather than causal pressure. Present in closure imagery but not indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>After the water wars is mentioned in the second line ("The water wars had receded like a fever, leaving behind a landscape of salt-scarred stone and rusted debris") and referenced once more late ("The water wars had washed away names, but the land remembered"). Setup is present; the timeframe does not constrain or tighten decisions—no live clock, no urgency tied to the post-war condition. Development and payoff are absent; the wars function as backdrop rather than active pressure. Mentioned but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>To thresh meaning from experience is stated early ("She had come to this island to thresh meaning from the silence, to turn memory into pigment") and reprised in the final paragraph ("the weight of meaning threshed from the chaff of war"). The painter's search and eventual return to painting dramatize the motivation across the arc. However, the motivation is told and summarized rather than shown through conflicted on-page choices; the painter does not face a trade-off between competing wants. Present in setup and closure, with mild development in the exchange beat. Functional but under-dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Haggard awe appears twice: "She felt a haggard awe rise in her chest" (exchange beat) and "the haggard awe of a world remade" / "the world, haggard and awesome, breathed again" (final third). The tone is asserted rather than emergent from rhythm and image. The prose carries a consistent lyric exhaustion, but the tone does not modulate with pressure—cadence remains elevated throughout without breathlessness in high-stress moments or relief at closure. Present at setup and payoff, but static and label-dependent.</comment>
