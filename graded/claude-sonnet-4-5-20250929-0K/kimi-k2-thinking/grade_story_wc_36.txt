<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The keeper's motivation (seeking insights from failure) is declared but never dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. His internal experience remains abstract—"regret," "renewed resolve"—without embodied particularities or micro-choices that reveal a hierarchy of values under pressure. The backstory fragment about the missing artifact arrives late and is told rather than shown, failing to tilt present stance. The final promise to "learn, to protect" reads as label-only resolution without visible cost or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The piece employs an Accumulative/Textural lens: driftwood markers, flute playing, and the canyon hush recur to build density. However, the closure lacks a clear decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with legible cost—the keeper "resolves to return" and "carries the flute as a bridge," but no on-page action or image forecloses a path or reweights prior material with felt consequence. The ending summarizes insight ("failure…was not a wall but a door") rather than dramatizing a crystallized choice. Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately early, so no penalty applies there.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The Thunder-echo range is vividly rendered with sensory specifics—"gravel that sang like broken glass," "bruised purple" sky, "forest of stone pillars"—and the canyon hush modulates with the flute's silence. However, the setting remains largely atmospheric; it does not constrain a key choice or charge the final image with causal pressure. The driftwood markers function more as symbolic guide than tactical resource, keeping the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—harvesting insights from failure—is signaled early but never tightens into a live dilemma with visible cost. The flute playing opens a seam and the keeper glimpses the vault, yet no reversal forces a trade-off or narrows options. The final "renewed resolve" arrives without on-page agency that forecloses a path; coincidence (the canyon hush returning) replaces protagonist-driven escalation. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is sufficient, but here the density does not reweight options with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the flute, markers, and the fracture/door metaphor, resisting overt statement until the late insight paragraph. However, that insight—"failure he had tried to escape was not a wall but a door"—edges toward thematic summary rather than a resonant, non-literal answer embedded in image. The piece invites reflection on guardianship and forgiveness, but the final whispered promise feels abstract rather than rooted in a specific, irreversible choice with conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable, and the prose carries a lyric, elevated register that suits the reflective mode. Perceptual signature is consistent—sensory details filtered through the keeper's regret and wonder. However, diction occasionally slips into generic poetic phrasing ("glittered like forgotten stars," "silent sentinels") without strong character-specific coloring, and some filter verbs ("He wondered," "He recalled") dull immediacy in high-stakes beats. No dialogue is present to assess naturalism or subtext.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rhythm and imagery are often vivid, but the piece suffers from paraphrase loops and template cadence. Multiple adjacent sentences restate the same content: "The canyon hush pressed…a deep, breathless silence" then "the gorge fell into an avalanchingly quiet. Even the wind held its breath. …The canyon hush returned, deeper than before." Synonym churn around "silence" and "canyon hush" recurs without added pressure. Several runs open with "He [verb]" stems, flattening propulsion. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph ("He carried the flute not as a relic but as a bridge"), triggering the higher artifact penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—relic keeper uses a magical flute to confront past failure—follows a familiar redemption-quest template without a sharp transformative angle. The gilded reed flute, driftwood markers, and "weaving between worlds" are present but feel assembled from a prompt checklist rather than organically interdependent. The final reframing of failure as door, not wall, is earnest but predictable, lacking the non-obvious synthesis or bold risk that would elevate originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The driven relic keeper is present throughout and makes two key decisions: to play the flute and to follow the markers back. However, these choices arrive late (past midpoint for the first, final third for the second) and are not shown to narrow options with visible cost—he "resolves" rather than acts with consequence. The keeper observes and reflects more than he decides under pressure, keeping the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The gilded reed flute appears in three distinct beats: uncasing, playing to open the seam, and the final reflection beside the spring. It is handled on the page and its use opens a literal rift, shaping the middle turn. However, it does not constrain the closure choice—the keeper carries it forward as symbol, not as tool that forecloses a path. Strong beat involvement and specificity lift the score, but lack of closure-linkage cost caps higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Weaving between worlds" manifests when the flute's music opens a seam, showing the vault and "a realm of endless stillness." This beat is functional and central, but the concept does not constrain later tactics or reconfigure the ending—no second crossing occurs, and the keeper does not use world-hopping to resolve the stake. Present and logically consistent, but swappable with "glimpsing the past" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Avalanchingly quiet" appears once as a descriptor after the flute's final note: "the gorge fell into an avalanchingly quiet." It amplifies atmosphere but does not enable or constrain an on-page action with cost. The keeper lowers the flute and stares at the markers; silence presses but does not force a choice. Functional sensory beat, but the attribute remains ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Uncase" occurs at the pass when the keeper removes the flute from its velvet box, signaling the story's central turn. The action is specific and irreplaceable in that beat, setting up the music that opens the seam. However, it does not shape the closure—no second uncasing or re-boxing charges the final image. One strong beat and clear setup, but no payoff linkage keeps the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Arranging driftwood as directional markers frames the journey and recurs when the keeper follows them back. The method is signaled early and used twice, but its mechanics are vague—how do the patterns "map a route only he could read"?—and the markers do not alter a key choice or impose cost. They glow faintly and symbolize decisions, yet remain more thematic echo than tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Thunder-echo range provides vivid atmosphere—bruised sky, gravel, dry riverbed, stone pillars—and the canyon hush modulates pressure. The pass "where the thunder echoed longest" is the site of the flute playing, giving the setting a functional role in one beat. However, the environment does not supply a resource or obstacle that alters the keeper's tactics at closure. Strong sensory presence and one causal beat, but no closure constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the guardianship" anchors backstory context and motivates the journey, but the timeframe does not tighten present decisions. No clock or deadline presses the keeper's choices; he pauses, rests, and reflects without temporal cost. The phrase appears early and again in a late reflection, but it functions as thematic marker rather than escalation device.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"To harvest insights from failure" is declared in the opening line and echoed when the keeper realizes "the insight he sought was not in forgetting but in embracing the fracture." The motivation is present across beats, but it remains told rather than dramatized—no on-page choice shows friction between wanting insight and fearing what it costs. Functional framing, but lacks the embodied trade-off that would score higher.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Canyon hush" recurs throughout, modulating from "pressed against his ears" to "returned, deeper than before" to "enveloped him like a cloak." The tone is coherent and charges the flute-playing beat when silence becomes "avalanchingly quiet." However, the final image—walking home under unspoken thunder—does not decisively reweight the hush with new cost; it remains atmospheric rather than conceptually repriced. Strong consistency and one intensification, but closure linkage is glancing.</comment>
