<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The caster's motivation is clear and her journey from self-forgiveness to purpose is tracked, but interiority leans heavily on abstract declaration rather than contradictory impulses in scene. "Technically gentle" appears as a repeated label without embodied cost; the moment where she weeps feels earned, but earlier beats summarize emotional states ("Her heart, once as frozen…") rather than dramatizing them. The final choice to continue harvesting ice is consistent but arrives without visible friction or trade-off that would foreclose another path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates images—aurora, rope, names—and delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: she commits to remain and preserve) with felt emotional cost. Orientation is clear early. However, causality is thin: the rope "clicks into place" and names emerge without prior obstacle or failed attempt, so pressure never tightens through protagonist agency. The closure reweights her exile into calling, but the cost is declared ("thawed") rather than shown as a foreclosed option on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum, aurora, and rope constrain choices and charge the final image effectively; "frozen dome," "workbench," and "aurora's torch" are vivid and purposeful. Spatial choreography is coherent (wall ice, workbench, rope beside her). The rope's glowing braids function as micro-setting that enables the climax. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her artisan POV, though some descriptions ("shifting greens and violets") risk postcard mode.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve forgotten names—is signaled early and remains coherent. The card-and-rope discovery creates one turn, but it arrives without opposition or cost; she succeeds on first attempt with no tactic shift or visible price paid. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is sufficient, and the names' emergence does reweight her exile, but the lack of protagonist struggle or failed move keeps escalation modest. The final commitment to continue is consistent but not tested on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—preservation through absence, forgiveness enabling purpose—emerges from particulars (bell/names, void/voice) and the final image of glowing rope holding voices resonates without stating a moral. "Snowmelt ardor" and the bell/sound motif recur purposefully. However, the final paragraphs edge toward thematic echo ("This was her true calling," "one name at a time") that risks summary rather than letting the image speak. The piece resists tidy morals but occasionally explains its own metaphor.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a consistent artisan register ("lost wax training taught her that absence defines form"). Voice modulates with emotion (weeping, smiling) and diction reflects her craft. However, "snowmelt ardor" and "technically gentle" recur as author-inserted labels rather than character-owned perception; under peak stress, she remains fully articulate without compression. Psychic distance is controlled, but the prose occasionally shifts into elevated summary ("the symphony of the lost") that reads more like narrator commentary than her lived thought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "The sanctum was no longer her prison, but her instrument" immediately followed by "her heart, once as frozen…now beat"; "snowmelt ardor" appears three times in similar constructions. Template cadence: "She touched…she greeted…she would remain" in the final third flattens rhythm. Filter-verb stacks ("she recognized," "she understood," "she wept") dull immediacy in peak beats. Opening and closing lines are strong, but mid-story redundancy and synonym churn ("thawed," "warmed," "melting") reduce density. Artifacts touch the closure sequence, triggering the Q7 cap on 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of lost-wax casting, street-organ cards, and aurora-lit memory preservation is specific and non-obvious. The rope-as-instrument and braids-as-phonemes metaphor is inventive. However, the emotional arc—exile to forgiveness to renewed purpose—follows a familiar template without bold risk or moral ambiguity. The final image of glowing braids is memorable, but the piece explains its own metaphor ("absence defines form") rather than trusting resonance. Transformation is present but modest.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The caster's choices—pulling the card from ice, reconfiguring the rope, beginning new wax tablets—create key turns and frame the closure commitment. She is present throughout and her agency drives the discovery and resolution. However, most choices succeed without friction or cost; no failed attempt or trade-off tests her skill or resolve on the page. She observes and decides but does not struggle.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The punched card appears in paragraph 4, is handled (examined, threaded through rope) in the middle, and returns as a model for future cards at the end—three beats with reweighted meaning. It enables the climax by matching the rope's braid pattern. However, it could be swapped for any grid-like artifact (loom card, weaving template) with minor edits; its street-organ specificity does not constrain tactics beyond providing holes.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Transcribed memory" shapes stakes (preserve dying languages), tactics (threading rope through card holes to unlock sound), and the closure (commit to harvesting more ice-bound memories). It is signaled early ("Monks had once used such cards to capture dying languages"), tested in the rope-threading scene, and reaffirmed in the ending vow. Removing it would break the story's logic. The cost is felt emotionally but not via a foreclosed alternative on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Technically gentle" appears as a label in paragraphs 4, 10, 26, and 27 but is never dramatized through on-page action with cost. We are told her fingers are gentle; we do not see a moment where excessive force would crack something or where gentleness requires painful slowness. It could be replaced with "skilled" or "precise" without altering any beat. Label-only use without tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Illuminate" recurs across beats: the rope glows (paragraph 12), memory illuminates as sound (13), braids hold illuminated voices (28), and the aurora and caster "illuminate the darkness" (38). It enables the climax (rope lighting unlocks the names) and charges the final image. The action is irreplaceable; swapping it for "reveal" or "activate" would lose the light/aurora motif. Strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The method is signaled in paragraph 8 ("reconfiguring those braids could illuminate hidden knowledge"), executed in paragraphs 10–12 ("threading them through the card's holes"), and extended in paragraphs 25–26 ("reconfiguring braid after braid"). It shapes multiple beats and is mechanically specific: the braids must match the card's holes. Removing this exact method would break the story's causal logic. The mechanics matter and alter tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum supplies the punched card (melting from wall ice at dawn), pressures the protagonist (exile, frozen silence), and charges the final image (no longer prison but instrument). Aurora provides light and rhythm across the piece. The setting enables the plot (ice preserves memories) and constrains her physically (chill, isolation). Multiple beats depend on it; swapping for a desert archive would require fundamental rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The timeframe—after forgiving herself for the cracked bell—anchors the opening and motivates her readiness to accept imperfection and continue. "Three winters of exile" establishes duration. The frame enables her arc but does not tighten decisions or create a live clock within the present scene. She works "through the polar night" without urgency or deadline. The timeframe sets up closure but does not pressure tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The motivation is introduced early ("preserve such sounds, believing names held souls"), tested mid-story (weeping as names circle her), and reaffirmed at closure ("preserve the sound of forgotten names before the aurora itself fell silent"). It drives her choice to remain and harvest more ice. The desire is dramatized through embodied reaction (weeping) and action (carving new cards). Friction between want (preserve) and cost (isolation, cold) is felt, though not fully dramatized as a trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Snowmelt ardor" appears in paragraphs 18, 27, 33, and 39, modulating from thaw metaphor to task warmth to river carving. It supports the tone of gradual warming and emotional release. However, the phrase reads as authorial ornament rather than embodied perception; it is told rather than shown through image or syntax. The tone is coherent but static—one mood (reverent, melting) without sharp modulation under pressure. It charges the final image modestly but does not shape a turn.</comment>
