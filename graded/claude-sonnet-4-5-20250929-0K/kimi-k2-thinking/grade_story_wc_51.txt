<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The weaver's interior life remains abstract—"weights of different burdens" and "recursive spirals" feel more conceptual than embodied. Her seventeen-year isolation lacks micro-choices that show struggle or contradictory impulses acting in scene. The final calcification of burdens happens without on-page resistance or the messy irrationality that would ground the metaphysical conceit in recognizable human pain. The daughter's voice and pride are collected too smoothly, without the character visibly warring with herself.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is established by ~120 words (bronze grotto, starlight, seventeen years trapped). The closure—stepping through walls after calcifying all burdens into a sphere—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the trap was always a loom), but the cost remains oblique: what exactly does she forfeit by leaving, or what path is foreclosed? The accumulative/textural lens holds across the piece, yet the final image ("stepped through the wall as though it were woven air") asserts freedom without demonstrating on-page friction or visible trade-off at that beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The bronze grotto with copper veins, melting snow patterns, and kerosene lamp burner supply vivid, recurring anchors. The lamp's "brass wick-holder twisted into a shape that remembered fire" and the "shingled hush" layering silence offer strong textural specificity. The burner constrains her calcification ritual (she must orient it toward stars, turn her back to darkness), charging the final image when the sphere glows with "whalebone light." Spatial choreography is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—escaping the recursive trap by collecting and measuring burdens—is signaled early. The sequence of calcifications (daughter's voice, pride, existence) provides incremental steps, but each burden is collected without meaningful friction or failed attempt. The final revelation ("it had never been a prison, but a loom") reconfigures the frame conceptually, yet no on-page tightening forces a trade-off or narrows live options. The weaver's agency is more receptive than decisive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—transformation through patient accumulation and the reframing of captivity as creation—emerges organically from the fractal tapestries and the loom metaphor. The final image (the trap as loom, the sphere's weightless gravity) offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether she was imprisoned or working. The piece avoids overt moralizing, though phrases like "the weight of her own existence, the fact of being unforgiven" flirt with abstract philosophizing. The whalebone light and shingled hush accrue texture that charges the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable. Diction is consistent and lyric ("boundary-lessly trapped," "shingled hush," "whalebone light"), creating a distinct textural signature. However, elevated register pervades even high-pressure beats without modulation: "by orienting properly" and "calcify each one, transforming ephemeral ache into fossilized record" read more ornamental than urgent. Psychic distance stays controlled, though the narrator's perceptual signature leans toward archetypal wisdom rather than individual quirk.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or elevated diction ("boundary-lessly," "shingled hush," "kerosene lamp burner...twisted into a shape that remembered fire"). While coherent and voice-consistent, the lushness flattens momentum: "slowly, the voice calcified into a translucent crystal, its weight barely that of a sigh, yet dense with unshed tears" stacks modifiers without propulsion. Paraphrase appears: "the grotto exhaled a shingled hush that finally, after all this time, became true silence" restates the hush-to-silence shift already implied. No loops or scaffold break causality, but density dulls urgency in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The fractal-weaver premise and the trap-as-loom reframe offer fresh angles on captivity and creative process. The kerosene burner as ritual anchor and the calcification of ephemeral burdens into measurable crystals are specific, non-generic choices. However, the seventeen-year solitary arc and the final walk-through-walls liberation echo familiar mystic-artisan templates. The piece commits fully to its lyric mode, yet the final turn—"it had never been a prison, but a loom"—feels more declared than earned through prior friction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The fractal weaver's choices—deciding to collect burdens, wrapping each around the lamp burner, orienting it toward stars or darkness—drive the narrative beats. Each calcification alters her toolkit (voice → crystal, pride → black stone, existence → sphere), and the final act of placing the sphere in the burner and stepping through the wall constitutes the closure turn. However, these choices unfold without visible hesitation or failed attempts; the weaver executes a known ritual rather than discovering it under pressure. She is present in all key beats but her agency reads more as enactment than as decision that narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The kerosene lamp burner appears in setup (ledge, brass wick-holder, remembered fire), middle beats (wrapping burdens around it, orienting it, metal warming/cooling), and closure (the sphere placed inside, glowing with whalebone light, carried out). It constrains the calcification ritual: the weaver must align the burner's shadow-spiral, and the burner's temperature shift signals each burden's transformation. Removing it would require a different ritual mechanism. The object is handled across ≥3 beats and its final state—"flameless fire lighting her way"—charges the exit image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Shingled hush" recurs as a textural motif (silence layered like slate tiles, footsteps trapped in acoustic folds, hush thickening as burdens are collected, final exhalation into true silence). It enriches atmosphere and ties to the theme of accumulated weight, but it does not constrain an on-page choice or directly alter tactics. The weaver never adjusts her ritual because of the hush; it remains a lyric echo rather than a stake-shaping force. Present across beats, yet ornamental to the causal spine.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Boundary-lessly trapped" frames the inciting condition (trapped by recursive spirals of her own tapestries) and the final reconfiguration (the boundary-less trap was a loom). The attribute explains why she cannot simply walk out until the ritual is complete, thus enabling the seventeen-year arc and the need to collect burdens. However, the mechanics are asserted rather than tested: we never see her attempt to leave and fail. The phrase appears in setup and closure, shaping the frame, but the tradeoff—what boundary-lessness costs her on the page—is implied rather than dramatized in a middle beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Calcify" drives all three burden-collection beats: the daughter's voice, the pride, and the final existential weight each must be calcified into physical form before measurement. The action is specific (wrapping filaments around the burner, feeling the metal warm or cool, watching crystallization) and non-swappable—terms like "solidify" or "crystallize" lack the fossil/stone connotation that ties to the grotto's geological imagery. The final calcification ("every burden crystallizing into a single, perfect sphere") triggers the closure. The action shapes stakes and appears in setup, development, and payoff, though the weaver's mastery of it removes friction.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"By orienting properly" is named and demonstrated in three beats: aligning the lamp burner's shadow-spiral with the constellation, turning her back to stars to face darkness for the pride burden, and the final tripartite orientation (northstar/grotto/past-future suspension) that completes the collection. The method shapes her ritual mechanics and is explained on the page, not just asserted at the end. However, the phrase "orienting properly" itself is generic; the specifics (shadow alignment, directional stance) do the real work. Swapping "orienting" for "aligning" or "positioning" would change little.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The bronze grotto with starlight filtering through melting snow anchors every beat. The copper-veined walls respond to measured weights ("fractal patterns...began to shift"), the open ceiling supplies the star-alignment constraint, and the bronze shavings become part of the scale. The setting pressures the weaver's choices (she must wait for snowmelt, use the grotto's materials, orient to the visible stars) and the final image—stepping through the bronze wall "as though it were woven air"—depends on the grotto's identity as loom. The micro-setting (ledge, walls, ceiling) alters tactics and charges closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the first snowmelt" anchors the opening and implies seasonal readiness, but time does not tighten decisions or create a live clock. The weaver works "tonight" and the ritual unfolds in a sequence of beats without urgency or deadline. Seventeen years of prior waiting are summarized, not pressuring the present action. The timeframe provides atmospheric context (spring renewal) and a loose why-now, but it is replaceable—any night after snowmelt would suffice. Time does not alter tactics or narrow options on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The desire to collect and measure burdens drives all on-page action: the weaver pulls the daughter's voice, pride, and existence from memory/chest, wraps each around the burner, marks measurements, and completes the sphere. The motivation is declared early and pursued across beats. However, it is never shown in conflict with a competing want or fear—she never hesitates, questions the cost of collection, or struggles with which burden to prioritize. The friction between "precision and surrender" is named but not dramatized through choice. The motivation is functional and enacted, not conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Whalebone reverie" coheres across the piece: the prose is lyric, slow-paced, laden with metaphor ("bronze grotto," "shingled hush," "fractal spirals," "whalebone light"), and maintains a dreamlike, meditative register even in peak beats (calcification, final sphere). The tone modulates slightly—cooling when the weaver confronts pride, warming when the sphere glows—but stays within a narrow tonal band. The final image ("stepped through the wall as though it were woven air") charges the whalebone/reverie palette with the light itself. Tone is consistent and supports theme, though the static elevation prevents urgency from breaking through.</comment>
