<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to act when others freeze is stated early, and the boy's forward step provides a clean choice under pressure. However, interiority leans heavily on abstraction: "Shadows coiled around their boots, anchoring them" and "The calm wasn't emptiness, but a deep listening" tell rather than embody. The shadow-lace trait and "calmly intuitive" label recur without dramatized internal contradiction or embodied cost that would earn higher characterization scores.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who, where, and when within the opening lines (lighthouse orchard, ice floes, Kael, shattered crystal). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece gathers mirrors, blood, and shadow-lace toward the crystal's reconstitution. Closure occurs on the page—the crystal reforms, the community sees the floe pattern—but the cost is declared ("what he'd given, and what he'd gained") rather than shown in a specific forfeited option or visible consequence, weakening the felt price at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard, ice floes, and vintage store are named and spatially clear. The mirrors function in the middle sequence, and the crystal fragment is handled across beats. However, sensory detail remains generic: "amber pools," "frost-etched windows," "dust hung in sunbeams" read as stock imagery without POV-specific perception. The environment does not constrain a tactical choice at closure, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reconstitute the crystal to navigate the floes—is signaled early and drives the middle search. The boy's step forward provides one clear tightening that narrows options. The blood-drop ritual enacts agency at closure. Yet the "weighted breath before reply" recurs as a label without embodied tension, and the final consequence (community can shift with floes) is told in summary rather than tested on the page, limiting escalation clarity.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The empathy-as-action theme is stated multiple times: "Magic without empathy was just control in a finer dress," "Empathy must become action, even when it costs," and the final moralizing paragraph ("Empathy wasn't a soft thing..."). These direct assertions replace earned resonance. The boy's choice could have charged the theme through particulars, but the ending drifts into abstraction and thesis summary instead of a non-literal image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction occasionally elevates beyond Kael's established perceptual signature: "Courage meant mapping empathy onto action despite fear" and "Memory and matter, intertwined by intention" read as authorial framing rather than character thought. Filter verbs ("felt the silence," "letting impressions settle") cluster in reflective beats without urgency. Voice is coherent but not distinctive under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear: "The weighted breath before reply fogged the air" recurs three times with synonym variations but no added pressure. Template cadence runs in the mirror sequence: "The first mirror showed... The second showed... The third mirror flickered." Stock metaphors ("shadows coiled," "tears freezing") and thesaurus inflation ("reconstituting, threads weaving") dull immediacy. The final third stacks abstractions that obscure the closure image's specificity, triggering artifact penalties and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—shattered prophetic tool, blood ritual, mirror-revealed knowledge—follows a familiar template without fresh transformation. The boy's courage could have provided specificity, but his interior remains generic ("fear was a bright, clean thing"). The ending's empathy-as-compass metaphor and the closing watch-keeping tableau echo stock fantasy resolutions. No bold structural or perspectival risk elevates the synthesis beyond its conventional frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Kael decides to retrieve the fragment, descends to the vintage store, and guides the boy's hand at closure—three distinct choices across beats. However, the shadow-lace trait is ornamental (description without tactical constraint), and the final watch stance is told rather than enacted with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The broken crystal ball fragment appears in paragraph 5, is turned over in Kael's hands (beat 1), pulsing warmer when returned (beat 2), and receives the blood drop that triggers reconstitution at closure (beat 3). It drives causality and shapes the ending. Specificity is moderate—"jagged and humming"—but the fragment's unique properties (memory threads) matter to the ritual.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Courageous anomaly" is stated as Kael's trait ("acting when others froze") and then transferred to the boy ("the child who understood"). It frames the premise but does not constrain on-page tactics; the boy steps forward without a visible trade-off cost tied to courage versus another competing value. The concept functions as theme claim more than pressure mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Calmly intuitive" is labeled twice: "Kael stood calmly intuitive, letting impressions settle" and in the final paragraph. No on-page action demonstrates this trait altering a choice under pressure. The attribute remains ornamental—a character descriptor without dramatized cost or enabling constraint.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Reconstitute" is signaled in the vintage store sequence, enacted at closure when the crystal reforms, and the outcome (whole crystal, floe pattern visible) changes the community's options. The action is central to closure. However, the mechanics (blood vaporizes into light, shards remember) are told rather than shown with tactile specificity, and the process feels convenient rather than hard-won.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The vintage store mirrors appear at the story's midpoint (paragraph 12), show three visions across adjacent beats, and reveal the blood-cost requirement. The method is functional but swappable—any prophetic device could deliver the same information. The mirrors do not constrain Kael's choice or return with reweighted meaning at closure; they enable one beat and disappear.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard is named in the opening line and recurs in the final third ("orchard's glow intensified," "lighthouse beam cut through snow"). The ice floes are the external threat but do not constrain an on-page tactical choice. The setting provides postcard atmosphere without altering Kael's moves or shaping the closure image; the crystal's pattern could be revealed in any location.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"The weighted breath before reply" is named three times as a descriptive label but does not function as a ticking clock. No deadline pressures Kael's descent or the ritual timing. The phrase marks mood rather than tightening decisions, making it swappable with any synonym for collective tension.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Map empathy onto action" is stated as Kael's goal and appears in dialogue and the final paragraphs. The boy's choice to offer blood dramatizes empathy-as-cost, linking motivation to closure. However, the friction between empathy and competing desires (self-preservation, efficiency) is told rather than enacted in a scene where Kael must choose between them, limiting the motivation's felt conflict.</comment>
