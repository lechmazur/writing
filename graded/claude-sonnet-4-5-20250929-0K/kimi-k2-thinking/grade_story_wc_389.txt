<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Atlas is established as isolated and mission-driven, but his interior life remains largely declarative rather than embodied under pressure. The piece tells us about seventeen years of work and variant allegiance without dramatizing the contradictory impulses that would make the final transmission choice feel costly on the page. The climactic broadcast reads as fulfillment of a long-held plan rather than a decision forged in the moment, flattening agency. Emotional states are asserted—"loneliness finally a kind of company"—rather than shown through specific behavioral contradictions or micro-choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story establishes Atlas at the observatory and moves toward his final broadcast, but the causal chain is largely expositional: we learn he has always planned this, the prophecy has been building for seventeen years, and tonight he completes the mission. The closure—Atlas disappearing after reshaping the world—gestures at cost (the enforcers will come, he abandons his post) but the price is declared rather than dramatized; we don't see what he loses in the moment of transmission. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural in ambition but lacks a decisive tightening or reversal that narrows options; the broadcast simply happens as foretold. Orientation is delayed (who/where/when arrive piecemeal across the first third), warranting a −0.3 penalty and triggering the Q3 cap at 7.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cobalt glass portico, parabolic dish, and storm-wracked platform are vivid and purposeful, anchoring Atlas's isolation and the transmission work. The setting provides tactile detail—"greasy smell of vacuum tubes," "pocked like a moon"—that grounds the scene. However, the observatory functions primarily as backdrop; the environment does not constrain Atlas's choices or alter his tactics. The final image of the abandoned observatory and ships arriving uses setting to charge closure, lifting the score into the mid-6s despite the orientation delay penalty.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transmitting the prophecy before the Council stops him—is signaled early, but pressure does not escalate on the page. Atlas adjusts the dish, converts shadow-pattern to broadcast, and transmits; no reversal or external obstacle meaningfully tests his commitment or narrows his options. The Council's enforcers are mentioned as a future threat but never arrive to create present friction. The storm scatters his notes but the text immediately assures us "the vision held," deflating the complication. The resolution is predetermined rather than earned through a climactic choice under duress.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges around allegiance, myth versus data, and the birth of a new age, woven through imagery of shadows, frequencies, and the cobalt portico. The final image—"let the old shadows teach the new light"—attempts resonance but veers close to overt thematic statement. The piece resists full didacticism by grounding its ideas in Atlas's specific situation, yet the prophet-as-age metaphor is explained rather than left implicit. The particulars (ancient shadow-patterns, fragmented radio, cobalt etchings) do accumulate meaning, but the ending paragraph's summary—"his lonely vision now everyone's variant allegiance"—flattens subtext into assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The prose establishes a lyric, elevated register—"thunder gnawed," "ionic fracture," "greasy smell of vacuum tubes"—that coheres as Atlas's perceptual signature. Distance remains stable in third-person limited throughout. However, the diction frequently drifts into abstract or poetic elevation ("lyrically prophetic cadence stitching quantum hiss into poetry") that prioritizes sound over clarity and sometimes obscures the mechanics of what Atlas is doing. The voice is consistent but not always anchored in the concrete urgency of the moment; peak beats favor metaphor over embodied action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The prose is rhythmically varied and rich in imagery, but overwriting pervades high-pressure moments: "lightning painting him in static and cobalt," "lonely visionary who spoke only to ghosts in the static," and dense metaphorical phrasing in nearly every sentence of the transmission sequence. Paraphrase loops appear—"variant allegiance" recurs without added nuance; "fragmented frequencies" and "static" are restated multiple times. Template cadence in the final third: "The dawn broke... a child... began to speak... Atlas watched... his work complete, his loneliness finally a kind of company" stacks declarative summary without propulsion. Figurative density in the climax (−0.5) and loops (−0.4) plus modest scaffold in the ending (−0.2) compound to −1.1, dropping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The premise—lone operator at a storm-wracked station receiving transmissions and defying authority—echoes familiar visionary-outcast tropes without sharp transformation. The "prophet is not a person but an age" realization offers a conceptual twist, but it arrives late and is explained rather than dramatized through prior particulars. The cobalt glass portico with hidden circuit diagrams adds specificity, yet the emotional and plot arc (isolated figure completes mission, disappears, becomes legend) follows a well-worn template. Variant allegiance as tunable frequency is an evocative metaphor but remains more ornamental than causally decisive.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Atlas is present throughout and makes the climactic choice to broadcast, satisfying setup and payoff gates. However, his "lonely visionary" status is largely told; the loneliness does not constrain a key choice on the page—he acts as he always planned. The decision to transmit is not dramatized as a moment of internal conflict or external obstacle that tests his isolation. Swappable: a different character archetype (dutiful engineer, rogue scientist) could execute the same broadcast with minimal rewrite. Causal pressure is weak; closure linkage exists but is summary-driven.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The cobalt glass portico appears early (setup ✓), recurs when lightning reveals hidden etchings (middle ✓), and is mentioned in the final paragraph as a threshold between eras (payoff ✓). However, its function is largely atmospheric; Atlas steps onto it and transmits, but the portico does not enable or constrain that action—any platform would serve. The hidden etchings moment adds specificity but does not alter Atlas's tactics or the broadcast's outcome. The element is more symbolic than causal. Early signal +0.5, three-gate presence +1.4, closure mention +0.4, but high swappability −0.7 and ornamental use −0.6 land it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Variant allegiance is named early and restated multiple times ("his allegiance had always been variant," "allegiance... was not a chain but a frequency," "everyone's variant allegiance"). It frames the thematic question—loyalty to Council versus prophecy—and the broadcast embodies that split. However, the concept does not create a dramatic fork; Atlas never wavers or faces a scene where choosing one allegiance costs him the other on the page. The Council's enforcers are mentioned but never arrive to force a live choice. Setup ✓, thematic throughline ✓, but weak causal pressure and no on-page tradeoff. Early signal +0.5, beat involvement (one thematic turn) +0.4, but label-only use −0.5 and lack of visible cost −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The attribute appears in the opening: "fragmented radio frequencies... singing... their lyrically prophetic cadence." It describes the transmissions Atlas receives but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. Atlas decodes prophecies, but the "lyrically prophetic" quality is presented as texture rather than a challenge or tool that shapes his tactics. No middle beat demonstrates how this trait complicates his work; no closure moment hinges on it. Setup weak (descriptive mention), no middle development, no payoff. Late-ish signal −0.3, ornamental −0.7, swappable −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Unfold" appears in the opening ("prophecies unfolded with unusual clarity") and recurs in varied forms: "unfolded from darkness," "unfold in whispers." The final transmission is described as something Atlas has been unfolding for decades, and the story's last line references "the story... would unfold in whispers." This action threads through setup, middle, and payoff, and the act of converting shadow-patterns into broadcast enacts the unfolding. However, the unfolding is more metaphorical than physical; we don't see distinct steps or costs at each stage. Early signal +0.6, three beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, but swappability (could use "reveal," "transmit") −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Fragmented radio frequencies are signaled early ("fragmented radio frequencies had leaked through the ionic fracture") and return throughout: Atlas adjusts the dish, lets "fragmented frequencies pour through the amplifier," and old radios "crackled to life" in the villages. The method shapes his means—he must decode static, tune the dish—but the mechanics are not dramatized as a challenge that alters tactics. The broadcast happens as planned; no frequency glitch or clarity problem forces a mid-scene adjustment. Setup ✓, method present in middle and ending ✓, but weak causal friction. Early +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure +0.7, swappability (any signal method) −0.6, no on-page obstacle −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory above clouds is established in the opening and provides spatial grounding throughout. The storm scatters Atlas's notes (a complication, though immediately deflated), and the platform's isolation underscores his solitude. The final image uses the abandoned observatory as the site the enforcers find. The setting supplies mood and stakes (remoteness, exposure to storm) but does not supply a resource or obstacle that alters Atlas's broadcast tactics—he transmits from the portico as intended. Setup ✓, middle atmospheric presence ✓, payoff ✓. Early +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.8, but no on-page constraint that changes choices −0.7, swappable (any isolated station) −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Time is gestured at—seventeen years of listening, "tonight" the prophecies clarify, "by dawn" the enforcers will come, "weeks that followed"—but these markers do not tighten the on-page window or create urgency. The broadcast sequence unfolds without a live clock; Atlas completes his work before dawn arrives, and the story then summarizes aftermath. No countdown or tracking of minutes that forces a tactical choice. Setup (seventeen years mentioned early) weak, no middle tightening, payoff occurs off-page. Summary-only use −0.6, late resolution −0.5, swappable (any vague night) −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation—"to shape that dawn using these ancient shadows"—is stated early and drives Atlas's broadcast. The desire is clear and consistent, but it is not dramatized as conflicted; Atlas never hesitates or weighs the cost of defying the Council in a scene. The mission is described as "forged in loneliness," yet we don't see a moment where want and fear collide. The broadcast enacts the motivation, satisfying setup and payoff, but the interior friction is told rather than shown. Setup ✓, payoff ✓, but weak dramatization. Early +0.6, closure linkage +0.9, but label-only interiority −0.5, no on-page conflict between wants −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Gritty whimsy" is invoked in the final line as a descriptor of the legend, but the story's tone throughout is elevated and lyric—"cobalt glass," "ionic fracture," "quantum hiss"—rather than gritty or whimsical. The greasy vacuum tubes and rusted antennas nod toward grit, but the prose remains poetic and abstract. Whimsy is absent; the piece treats its material with seriousness and mythic weight. The tone is coherent within its own lyric-prophetic register but does not fulfill the requested tonal duality. No setup of dual tone, weak middle integration, label-only payoff. Late mention −0.7, label-only −0.5, mismatch with on-page texture −0.8.</comment>
