<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation to escape is clear and her calm defiance under pressure is consistent, but interiority remains abstract—"spirit remained unbroken" tells rather than showing contradictory impulses in scene. The dance-cipher plan demonstrates agency, yet the execution lacks embodied cost or micro-hesitations that would reveal internal friction. Emotional progression is linear; no moment dramatizes genuine doubt or trade-off between fear and resolve. The final choice feels predetermined rather than earned through on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation (sunken lab, three weeks captive) and follows an accumulative lens: Lyra devises the dance cipher, performs it, and escapes. Causality is loose—the AI accepts her dance as "maintenance protocol" without prior groundwork showing how the system could conflate choreography with code. The closure (emergence into sunlight) lands on the page, but cost is implied rather than viscerally felt; we see triumph without visible forfeiture. The tightening is minimal: the spider's web completion triggers the final roll, but no meaningful narrowing of options precedes it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory supplies vivid anchors (rust, green diodes, iron taste, a hundred fathoms) and the spider's web becomes a recurring image that charges the final paragraph. Spatial choreography is clean for a single-character scene. However, the lab's constraints never visibly limit Lyra's choices—she moves freely, and the security camera is passive. The setting functions as backdrop rather than pressure; removing the depth or replacing "sunken" with "isolated" would not alter her tactics or the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (escape) is signaled early, and the dice-roll/dance sequence provides one meaningful turn when the system unlocks. Yet escalation is thin: Lyra's plan proceeds without setback, and the AI's acceptance of her performance lacks friction or adaptive resistance. The flood that follows is framed as "baptism," not survival test, erasing cost. Agency is present but unopposed; the piece offers setup and resolution without a middle complication that forces trade-offs or narrows options under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme of vulnerability encrypted as strength emerges through the dice, dance, and spider metaphors, and the final image ("every step was a word, every gesture a sentence") resonates without moralizing. The cipher-as-liberation conceit is specific and particular to Lyra's voice. However, the connection between fear of drowning and "power of breath" remains asserted rather than dramatized in a peak choice. The spider's web recurs with purpose, reweighting patience and pattern-making, which elevates thematic coherence despite the lack of dramatic friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable, and the voice carries a lyric, heightened register ("silken thread linking her fear of drowning to the power of breath") that feels intentional and consistent. Perceptual signature is present—Lyra notices the spider, the diodes, the taste of iron—in ways that reflect her code-breaker mindset. No dialogue appears. Psychic distance remains controlled, and no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping occur. The voice modulates little under pressure; peak moments (the final dance, the flood) maintain the same elevated diction without tightening or fragmenting, which slightly flattens urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops appear: "Each entry ended with a signature step" / "The day the spider finished its web, Lyra rolled the dice one final time" recycles the dice-roll beat; "She decided to write... each line a dance step, each step a key" / "A pirouette meant A, a leap meant B..." restates the cipher conceit. Template cadence runs ("She encoded... She performed... She emerged... She walked... She wrote... She felt") across six consecutive sentences in the final third flatten rhythm and dull momentum. Register occasionally drifts into thesis language ("alchemy of vulnerability turned strength"). Figurative density is high but mostly coherent; one mixed metaphor ("encrypt her vulnerability into strength" conflates cryptography with emotional transformation) slightly muddles sense. Applying paraphrase-loop (−0.2), template-cadence in final third (−0.6), and minor register drift (−0.3) totals approximately −1.1, and artifacts touch closure beats, triggering the disallow-9+ rule and capping high-band entries at 8.8 globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dance-as-cipher premise offers a fresh angle, and the hangman's dice carved from whale jawbone supply specific, non-generic detail. However, the core scaffold—prisoner encodes escape, outwits AI surveillance—is familiar, and the transformation is incomplete: the AI's acceptance of dance as maintenance reads convenient rather than earned through world logic or dramatic friction. The spider metaphor recurs with purpose but borders on symbolic convenience. Emotional specificity is limited; Lyra's arc proceeds without genuine surprise or risk that tests the premise's implications. No bold structural gamble heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lyra is present throughout and her decision to devise the dance cipher drives the plot. She appears in setup (survives three weeks, decides to encode), middle (performs the dance), and ending (emerges into sunlight). However, her choices proceed without visible friction or on-page cost; no turn shows her altering tactics under pressure. The character is functional but her agency is unopposed, placing her in the mid-5s band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The hangman's dice appear in setup ("her only companions"), are used in the middle ("she rolled the hangman's dice, recorded the outcome as a movement"), and return with reweighted meaning in the ending ("now a mark of triumph rather than terror"). They shape at least two beats (the cipher design and the final roll that spells "liberate") and carry a charged reprise. The dice enable her tactics and are irreplaceable in the story's symbolic logic, but no visible cost is tied to their use on the page. Strong development and closure linkage lift the score near 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Calm defiance is signaled early ("her spirit remained unbroken," "calm defiance in her eyes") and recurs at closure, but it functions primarily as tone and character label rather than a force that alters on-page tactics. The concept does not visibly constrain or enable a choice under pressure; removing the phrase would not break plot logic. It is present and thematically consistent but replaceable, placing it in the functional-but-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Explains through dance" appears in setup (the cipher method is taught), middle (she performs the sequence before the camera), and ending (she "explained through a single, fluid dance that traced the circuit diagram"). The attribute shapes at least two key beats: the cipher performance and the AI's acceptance that unlocks doors. It is causally essential—without the dance, the security system would not respond—and irreplaceable. A visible cost (sustained performance over weeks, physical and creative effort) is implied but not dramatized, preventing a higher score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Liberate" is the word spelled by the final dance and triggers the system unlock, appearing in closure participation. It is signaled earlier as Lyra's goal but does not drive middle beats; the action of liberation is outcome rather than process. The element is integral to the ending image and cannot be swapped, but late concentration and lack of mid-scene development place it in the upper-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Coded journal entries are introduced early ("she decided to write a series of journal entries, each line a dance step"), used in the middle (she writes in margins, encodes override location and buoy code), and shape the ending (the rescue team finds the journal and marvels at the cipher). The method drives at least three beats and is causally essential—without the coded entries, the dance would lack its rationale and the thematic closure (vulnerability encrypted as strength) would collapse. The element is irreplaceable and tightly integrated across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The sunken laboratory is established in the opening line and supplies vivid anchors (rust, diodes, depth, containment chamber) that recur through closure. It provides resources (the security camera, the override system) and pressure (recycled air, iron taste), appearing in all three gates. However, the setting does not visibly constrain a choice or force a trade-off; Lyra moves freely, and the lab's depth is atmospheric rather than tactical. Strong presence and closure participation reach the mid-5s, but lack of causal pressure on tactics prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"As a spider spins its web" frames the timeframe and is introduced early as both literal (the spider in the corner) and metaphoric ("each journal entry a silken thread"). The spider's web completion triggers the final dice roll, and the element recurs in the ending ("its web complete, watched her go"). It shapes two beats (the patient accumulation and the final turn) and charges the closure image. However, time itself does not tighten decisions—Lyra's pacing is leisurely, and no live clock forces tactical shifts. The lyric reprise and closure linkage elevate the score to the low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to encrypt vulnerability as strength" is stated early ("she had learned that the only way to turn captivity into freedom was to encrypt her vulnerability into strength") and drives the cipher design. It recurs at closure in the journal's discovery and the thematic line about alchemy. The desire shapes one key beat (the decision to encode rather than directly resist) but is told rather than dramatized in a conflicted choice. Friction between want and cost is absent; Lyra's execution proceeds without visible struggle or doubt, placing the element in the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Mysterious familiarity is present in the lyric voice, the recurring spider and dice, and the calm, ritualized quality of Lyra's actions. Tone is consistent across setup, middle, and ending, supporting the accumulative lens. However, it does not modulate with pressure—peak moments (the final dance, the flood) maintain the same elevated, distanced register—and the tone does not charge the final image with additional meaning. Coherent but static, placing it in the mid-5s.</comment>
