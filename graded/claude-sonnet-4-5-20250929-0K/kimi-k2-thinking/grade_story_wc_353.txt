<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The sculptor's interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("empathy in motion," "symphonically minded") rather than embodied contradiction. Her motivation to create music is declared but never tested against a competing want or cost that would make her final choice feel like a renunciation. The hedgehog and distant animals (fox, rabbit) are noted but exert no pressure on her actions. While she traces cracks and strums porcelain, no micro-choice reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost; the progression reads as smooth accumulation without internal friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (grove, sculptor, morning) arrive early. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the sculptor discovers the sculpture, deciphers its cracks, strums it, and the grove "becomes a resonant chamber." However, the closure lacks a visible cost or decisive change—she "continues her work" and "the world listens" without forfeiting a live option or facing a consequence. The final image ("the silence not empty; it is full of music") offers Conceptual Repricing, but the conceptual cost is asserted rather than demonstrated on the page. One meaningful deepening (strumming awakens the hum) tightens pressure, but the ending's cost remains oblique.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The alder grove is anchored with sensory specifics (slender trunks, moss, alder cones) and the porcelain sculpture's stress cracks are vivid. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters the sculptor's tactics—she wanders, discovers, and strums without spatial friction. The hedgehog and distant animals add atmospheric detail but do not pressure the protagonist's moves. The setting serves as a resonant backdrop rather than an active constraint, keeping the score below the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—to create music in a silent world—is signaled early. The discovery of the sculpture and the act of strumming constitute one meaningful tightening that deepens the stake. However, no reversal or trade-off forecloses a live option with visible cost. The sculptor's agency is present (she fashions a bow, strums, sings) but never tested against a competing pressure or loss. The ending asserts that "the world listens" without showing what she gave up or what alternative she foreclosed, leaving escalation and cost clarity moderate.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—music living within silence, empathy as connective tissue—emerges through the porcelain-hum conceit and the grove-as-chamber image. The final line ("The silence not empty; it is full of music") offers a resonant answer to the central question without moralizing. However, the theme relies on repeated abstract phrases ("empathy in motion," "symphonically minded") rather than rising strictly from concrete particulars. The sculptor's internal arc (she "listens more deeply," "dreams of harmonies yet unheard") is told more than dramatized through specific, conflicted choices.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The narrative voice is lyric and consistent, with controlled diction ("cathedral of slender trunks," "stress cracks that spiderweb across the glazed surface like sheet music"). Psychic distance remains stable. However, recurring abstract labels ("empathy in motion," "symphonically minded," "tree-song sculptor") flatten POV particularity and read as thematic placeholders rather than the sculptor's lived idiom. No dialogue appears. Under peak moments (strumming, singing), the voice maintains its texture without head-hopping, but the reliance on repeated conceptual phrases prevents entry into the 9-band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Template cadence dominates: "She [verb]" and "The [noun]" sentence stems recur across dozens of lines, creating rhythmic monotony. Paraphrase loops appear ("empathy in motion" x3, "intensely quiet" x2, "symphonically minded" x2) without reweighting. Stock metaphors ("breath of cool morning air," "cathedral of slender trunks") and filter-verb stacks ("she feels," "she imagines," "she knows") dull immediacy in peak beats. Information density is low—many sentences restate mood or theme without advancing action. These artifacts pervade the text, including the closure beat ("she continues her work, each day strumming"), triggering the patterned-artifact penalty pack and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The core premise—a sculptor who deciphers stress cracks as musical notation and strums porcelain to create sound—offers a fresh synthesis. However, the execution leans on familiar tropes: the silent world, the artist-as-healer, the closing assertion that "the world listens." The transformation test suggests the plot and arc could transfer to a different medium (e.g., a painter reading brushstrokes as notes) with minor edits, indicating moderate originality. Emotional specificity is thin; the sculptor's journey reads as a lyric meditation rather than a grounded, risky choice with irreversible cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The tree-song sculptor is present throughout and her actions (wanders, discovers, brushes dirt, traces cracks, fashions a bow, strums, sings) drive the sequence. However, her choices are observational and expressive rather than decisional with trade-offs. She never faces a competing pressure or makes a choice that narrows options with visible cost. The character shapes beats but does not create a key turn or renunciation. Gates: setup ✓, middle development (strumming) ✓, closure participation (continues her work) ✓. Swappability: a generic "sound artist" could fulfill the same role with minor edits. Late first specific action (strumming) appears past midpoint. Score: 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The porcelain insulator sculpture appears early (discovery beat), is analyzed (tracing cracks), and is strummed to produce sound. It is present in three distinct beats and shapes the ending image (rests against the tree's roots, waiting for the next dawn). The object's unique property—stress cracks as notation—enables the sculptor's method. However, the object does not constrain a choice or impose a cost; it serves as a tool without resistance. Gates: setup ✓, middle development ✓, closure participation ✓. Closure linkage is weak (cameo mention rather than causal presence). Score: 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Empathy in motion" is a repeated label (three times) but is not dramatized as a tactic or choice with cost. The concept is declared thematically ("she feels the empathy in motion, a wave of connection") without shaping on-page options. It appears as a mood descriptor rather than a mechanic that changes what the sculptor can or cannot do. Gates: setup (second occurrence mid-text), no middle development with choice, closure participation (label only). Score: 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Symphonically minded" appears twice as a label. It does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. The trait is told ("she is... symphonically minded") rather than shown through a trade-off or choice. No beat demonstrates that being symphonic (versus, say, rhythmic or melodic) alters her tactics or forecloses an option. Gates: setup (early label), no middle development, closure participation (final label only). Score: 2.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Strum" is signaled early as a concept ("hands remember the feel of strings"), demonstrated in the middle beat ("with the bow she strums the porcelain surface"), and present in the ending ("each day strumming the porcelain"). The action awakens the hum and cascade, driving a key turn. However, the strumming is not contested or costly—no alternative method is weighed. Irreplaceability is moderate; "tap" or "strike" could produce similar effects with minor edits. Gates: setup ✓, middle development ✓, closure participation ✓. Score: 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The method "by analyzing stress cracks in a long-forgotten sculpture" is present early and explicitly described ("each fissure corresponds to a note"). It enables the sculptor's approach in the middle beat (tracing patterns, strumming based on crack-notation). However, the mechanics are asserted rather than tested—no moment shows what happens if she misreads a crack or faces ambiguous notation. The method does not constrain or complicate her choices. Gates: setup ✓, middle development (tracing) ✓, closure participation (implied continuation) weak. Score: 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The siskin alder grove is anchored early and described with sensory detail (slender trunks, whispering leaves, moss, alder cones). It appears in multiple beats and is present at closure ("the grove will still be singing"). However, the grove does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters the sculptor's tactics. It functions as atmosphere rather than active pressure. Gates: setup ✓, middle development (descriptive) weak, closure participation (atmospheric) ✓. Score: 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the hedgehog uncurls" opens the story and bookends it ("when the hedgehog curls again"). The hedgehog's presence marks a before/after frame but does not tighten decisions or impose a clock. Time is vague ("one morning," "night approaches," "far beyond") and does not pressure the sculptor's choices. The element provides symbolic framing without mechanical consequence. Gates: setup ✓, no middle development, closure participation (bookend mention) weak. Score: 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to create music in a silent world" is signaled early ("searching for a voice that can pierce the silence") and dramatized through the sculptor's actions (strumming, singing). It is present in the ending ("her music is a thread of empathy"). However, the desire is never conflicted—no competing want or cost tests her commitment. The motivation drives her moves but does not force a trade-off or renunciation. Gates: setup ✓, middle development (strumming to fulfill the want) ✓, closure participation ✓. Friction between want and cost is absent. Score: 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Intensely quiet" is signaled early ("the world remains intensely quiet") and woven through the piece ("this intensely quiet world," "quiet pulse," "still air"). The tone is coherent and modulates with the sculptor's actions (hum grows into cascade, then returns to stillness). The final image ("a soft note hanging in the air") charges the tone with the story's central paradox (music within silence). However, the tone is stated rather than entirely embodied in syntax and rhythm. Gates: setup ✓, middle development (modulation) ✓, closure participation ✓. Score: 6.8.</comment>
