<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The genealogist's interior is heavily told through abstract reflection rather than dramatized choice under pressure. The mother's vanishing and his career of forgery are summarized backstory that never concretely constrains a present decision. The final "decision" to cease manufacturing false memories feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle; no visible cost or conflicting impulse complicates the renunciation. Embodied emotion is sparse—most feelings are labeled ("guilt rose," "weight of unspoken words") without specific physical anchoring.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: driftwood fragments and carved images layer toward a final discovery. Orientation anchors who and conceptual premise early, but "where" (cobalt terrace vs. forgotten shore) and "when" remain vague past the 120-word mark without payoff. The closure unit—uncovering the mother's name on a plaque—is a reveal rather than a choice that forecloses options; the protagonist does not act, he passively discovers, and the subsequent "decision" to stop forging is told in summary with no visible cost on the final page. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) applies; Q3 cap at 7.0 is triggered.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace and forgotten shore are named but not concretely anchored in sensory detail or spatial choreography; the transition between them is abrupt and ungrounded. Driftwood carvings and the watch hand recur, but neither meaningfully constrains a choice—the protagonist sifts passively until the plaque appears. The watch hand's symbolic charge at closure ("a reminder that time… could be mended") is asserted rather than demonstrated through action. Cap at 7.0 per Orientation Test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering the withheld truth—is signaled early but pursued through passive searching rather than agency-driven escalation. No meaningful tightening or choice narrows options; the plaque's discovery is coincidental, and the protagonist's subsequent renunciation is summarized without on-page cost. The guilt and regret are told repeatedly but never tested by a live dilemma or visible tradeoff. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure should deepen through density or cadence shift; here it simply repeats the same mood.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Theme of memory, forgery, and reclaiming narrative emerges clearly but is over-articulated in the final third: "memory cannot be forged forever," "time, unlike memory, could be mended." The watch hand and driftwood carvings recur but their symbolic weight is declared rather than earned through choice. The thematic question—can truth be recovered after erasure?—is answered by summary ("he decided") rather than a resonant image that reweights prior material. Abstraction weakens the ending's charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and carries a formal, slightly elevated register appropriate to the reflective mode. POV remains stable third-limited with no head-hopping. However, the prose leans heavily on filter verbs ("he felt," "seemed to") and abstract phrasing ("weight of unspoken words," "sieved hush") that dilute immediacy. No dialogue appears. The watch hand "pulsed" and "ticked softly" in the final lines—contradictory since it is broken—suggests a loose metaphor rather than controlled perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: paragraphs 3, 10, and 11 restate "sieved hush" and "weight" with synonym churn. Template cadence appears in repeated "The [noun], [descriptor], [verb]…" stems. Stock metaphors proliferate: "guilt rose like a tide," "truth struck him with the weight of a collapsing wall." The final paragraph ("And so the genealogist walked…") reads as scaffolding summary rather than scene. Baseline deduction of −1.2 for loops, cadence, and stock images; additional −0.3 for filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The guilt-ridden forger seeking redemption through a coastal search is a familiar template. The driftwood carvings, watch hand, and mother's name on a plaque feel assembled rather than organically necessitated by character or world logic. The final pivot—ceasing forgeries after discovering the plaque—is a predictable moral arc with no fresh inflection. The "sieved hush" concept is evocative but applied decoratively rather than integrated into causality or choice.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The genealogist is present throughout but his choices are summarized rather than dramatized. The career of manufacturing false memories is told backstory; the decision to stop appears in the final third as summary ("he decided") without on-page conflict. He walks the shore and kneels, but these are passive motions rather than agency-driven turns. Setup present, closure mention via summary decision, but no middle development through choice under pressure. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle causality; further reduced for swappability (any guilt-ridden profession could substitute with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The watch hand appears in paragraph 2 (gift, broken), recurs in paragraphs 9, 20, 24, and 30 (pulsed, clenched, ticking). It is handled on the page and charged with symbolic weight. However, it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic—merely a token reminder. The final assertion that it "could be mended" contradicts its earlier broken state without dramatized cost. Setup and closure reprise present; middle use is descriptive rather than causal. Two-gate fulfillment (setup + closure mention) permits ~6.0 ceiling; swappability (any keepsake could serve) and no cost linkage lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Sieved hush" is named in paragraphs 3, 11, and 21 but remains abstract—never shaping a choice, filtering information, or altering tactics. It functions as atmospheric descriptor rather than stake or mechanic. Setup present, no middle development, closure mention decorative. Cap at 2.8 for missing closure participation; raised slightly for three touches, but ornamental use and label-only presence keep it low.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Manufacturing false memories is told as career backstory (paragraph 4) and frames the protagonist's guilt, but it never constrains an on-page action or forces a tradeoff. The decision to cease is summarized in paragraph 22 without dramatized cost. Setup present, closure mention via summary, but no middle beat where the skill is used or tested. Two-gate fulfillment permits ~6.0 ceiling; summary-only use and no visible cost lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Quell" appears twice (paragraphs 15, 26) as the protagonist's hope and the beginning of guilt's reduction. It does not drive a turn—guilt is told to "begin to quell" after the discovery, but no on-page action enacts quelling. The element is abstract and passive. Setup and closure mention present; no middle development. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle involvement and ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Sifting through driftwood carvings is introduced in paragraph 6, executed in paragraphs 8, 11–13, 16, and culminates in paragraph 17 with the plaque discovery. The method shapes three distinct beats and the ending. However, the plaque is "beneath a tangle of seaweed," not carved into driftwood—the method does not fully deliver the find. Setup, middle development, and closure participation all present; causal pressure and specificity are moderate. Partial misalignment (seaweed vs. driftwood) and passive discovery lower the score slightly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The cobalt terrace is named in paragraphs 1, 21, and 26 but never described concretely or used to pressure a choice. The shore is the active location for beats 6–20; the terrace functions as frame only. Setup and closure mention present; no middle development at the terrace itself. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle; swappability (any reflective location could substitute) lowers further.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Weight of unspoken words" appears in paragraphs 1, 10, 19, 23, and 28, functioning as abstract stake rather than temporal pressure. No clock tightens decisions; dusk is mentioned once but never tracked. The element is thematic rather than mechanical. Setup and closure mention present; no middle development that alters tactics under time pressure. Cap at 2.8 for missing closure participation as live constraint; further reduced for ornamental, label-only use.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Discovering the withheld truth is stated in paragraph 5, pursued through the shore search, and achieved in paragraph 19 with the plaque. The desire frames the journey but is never dramatized in conflicting choices or visible cost—he searches, finds, decides. Setup, middle pursuit, and closure participation all present, but the motivation is told rather than tested by friction. Swappability (any redemptive quest could substitute) and lack of on-page tradeoff lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Tempered regret is named in paragraphs 26 and 29, coheres across the reflective passages, and modulates slightly as guilt "begins to quell." However, the tone is static—melancholic throughout—without meaningful shift under pressure. The final image asserts the tone rather than charging it through action. Setup implied, closure mention present, but no middle modulation that heightens pressure. Two-gate fulfillment permits ~6.0 ceiling; static mood and label-only assertion lower the score.</comment>
