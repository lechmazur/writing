<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias exhibits clear motivation (recovering stolen memories) and makes hands-on choices (measuring angles, cultivating spores, placing the mushroom). His character trait "chronically curious" is shown through actions rather than told, and the final realization that some mysteries don't need solving demonstrates earned change. However, the emotional progression feels somewhat mechanical—the "crisp nostalgia" remains a label more than an embodied experience, and the character's internal contradictions (curiosity vs. restraint) don't create enough simultaneous tension in peak moments.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal with lyric accents; the progression from returning → measuring → cultivating → placing completes a motivated chain that unlocks memories. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elias gains his memories but renounces further pursuit, with the cost legible in "some fairy rings should never be disturbed." Orientation anchors (Elias, lagoon, forty years later) arrive early. The tightening from discovery (shipwrecks mirror Pleiades) to solution (complete the constellation) to consequence (memories flood back) follows clean because/therefore logic, though the middle stretch relies heavily on exposition rather than scene pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The sunken greenhouse and shipwreck constellation are vivid, purposeful, and constrain Elias's method—he must climb rusted masts, measure angles through broken glass, and place the mushroom at the precise vertex. The bioluminescent mushroom matching lagoon plankton charges the closure image. Sensory detail (salt, spores, cracking ice) is selective and integrated. The "missing seventh sister" detail elegantly seeds and pays off the central puzzle, making the setting indispensable to the plot's geometry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recovering stolen memories) is clear and escalates through discovery (pattern exists) → obstacle (mushrooms only grow in August) → workaround (cultivate spores) → resolution (place the mushroom). One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias realizes the faeries were "archivists, preserving what he couldn't bear to remember," reweighting the entire pursuit. The cultivation sequence shows hands-on problem-solving under constraint. However, the peak moment—placing the mushroom and memories flooding back—feels slightly inevitable rather than testing a final choice with visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (some truths are broken constellations that cut when reassembled; some mysteries should remain unsolved) emerges organically from the shipwreck geometry, the fairy bargain, and Elias's final restraint. The recurring "chronically curious" refrain and "broken constellations" image reweight at closure without stating a moral. The faeries-as-archivists twist deepens rather than tidies. Minor deduction: the final two paragraphs lean toward thematic summary ("some locks require living keys," "some fairy rings should never be disturbed") rather than letting the image alone carry the weight, risking mild sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice is consistent third-person limited with Elias's scholarly, tactile perspective ("hands-on folklorist," "the chronically curious do not fear tetanus or ghosts"). Perceptual signature (measuring, cataloging, singing sailor chants) is character-specific. Psychic distance remains stable. However, several phrases feel like imposed framing rather than lived interiority: "crisp nostalgia" appears three times but remains abstract, and "the chronically curious are doomed to become the stories they chase" reads more authorial than character-rooted. Under peak pressure (memories flooding back), diction stays measured rather than destabilizing, missing an opportunity for rhythmic fracture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is largely clear with strong concrete images (phosphorescent mushroom, rusted bow, cracking ice). Sentence variety supports rhythm, and technical detail (Pleiades, Midsummer's Eve 1983) grounds the premise. Two frictions lower the score: (1) Template cadence in the middle section—"The chronically curious..." appears three times with identical stem structure, creating a drumbeat; (2) Paraphrase loop in paragraphs describing the fairy ring, where "stored," "encrypted," and "preserved" restate the same idea across adjacent lines. The closure beat itself remains clean, preventing deeper penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—memories encrypted in shipwreck geometry that mirrors a constellation—is inventive and specific, avoiding generic "lost memory" tropes. The "missing seventh sister" detail and the need to cultivate mushrooms out of season add earned obstacles. The faeries-as-archivists reframe avoids cliché. However, the emotional arc (curious man learns to stop seeking) is more familiar, and the final wisdom ("some truths are broken constellations that cut when reassembled") edges toward aphorism rather than irreplaceable insight. The synthesis of folklore, astronomy, and marine decay is fresh enough to lift the score above mid-range.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's "hands-on" approach drives three key beats: climbing the *Mariana* to chalk star maps, cultivating spores in the dinghy's cooler, and physically placing the mushroom to complete the constellation. Each choice alters tactics and enables the next step. Early signal (paragraph 3) and closure participation (paragraph 23 cataloging) are present. The folklorist identity shapes method (singing sailor chants, trading stories) with specificity. However, the character's scholarly remove keeps some beats (measuring angles, scraping spores) from feeling high-stakes; the costs are logistical rather than character-defining until the final renunciation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The fairy ring mushroom appears in five distinct beats: initial trespass (paragraph 5), absence/obstacle (paragraph 18), cultivation (paragraphs 19–21), placement/resolution (paragraph 22), and beacon left behind (paragraph 27). Its phosphorescence matching the lagoon's plankton charges the closure. The need to cultivate it out of season creates the story's central problem-solving sequence. Removing it would break both the fairy bargain premise and the constellation-lock mechanic. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage, though the mushroom's symbolic weight (fairy ring = trap and key) could be more irreplaceable—other objects might serve similar puzzle functions with edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Decades later" shapes the entire frame: forty years of forgetting, the "habit of forgetting finally broke," and Elias now being older inform his stakes and the story's nostalgic tone. The time gap makes the memory loss consequential and the recovery urgent. Present in setup (paragraph 1) and coloring the ending (paragraph 29, "never return again"). However, the concept functions more as premise than active pressure—most beats (measuring, cultivating) would work identically if only five years had passed. The temporal distance deepens theme but doesn't constrain on-page tactics with cost, keeping it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Chronically curious" is explicitly labeled three times and demonstrated throughout: Elias digs despite the hole swallowing his past (paragraph 4), climbs rusted masts despite danger (paragraph 11), and cultivates mushrooms with obsessive care (paragraphs 19–21). The trait enables the entire quest and is finally renounced at closure ("his curiosity finally sated," paragraph 30). The cost—learning "some truths are broken constellations that cut"—is visible. Setup, development (drives multiple beats), and payoff (sated/renounced) are all present. Minor deduction: the repeated phrase "chronically curious" reads slightly templated rather than organically woven, and the trait's internal friction (curiosity vs. self-preservation) could create more on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Detect" anchors the method: Elias returns "to detect what had been stolen" (paragraph 8) and the detection unfolds through measuring angles, mapping constellations, and identifying the missing star. Three beats depend on this action: charting the wreck positions (paragraphs 10–11), discovering the Pleiades pattern (paragraph 13), and realizing the missing vertex (paragraphs 14–15). The detection redefines the problem from abstract loss to geometric puzzle. Present in setup and development. However, once detection succeeds, the story shifts to cultivation/placement; "detect" doesn't directly shape the closure image, and the final cataloging (paragraph 31) is more "record" than "detect," limiting top-band eligibility.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Studying broken constellations" is signaled early (paragraph 8: "the only method the old sailors had whispered"), demonstrated across four beats (paragraphs 9–13: measuring angles, chalking star maps, detecting the Pleiades pattern, identifying the missing sister), and directly enables the solution (paragraphs 15–16: the geometry reveals where to place the mushroom). The method is specific, irreplaceable, and shapes every middle-act choice. It charges the closure image: "shipwreck constellations pointing forever skyward" (paragraph 35). Removing this method would collapse the story's puzzle logic. Strong causal pressure, early setup, and closure linkage with visible mechanical cost (three nights, climbing danger, precise measurement).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The "sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks" is indispensable: the shipwrecks form the constellation (paragraphs 2, 9–13), the greenhouse's broken glass provides sightlines (paragraph 9, 15), the orange tree supplies spores (paragraph 19), and the entire geometry locks the memory encryption. Setting constrains method (must measure from water, climb wrecks) and supplies the resources (spores, glass map) that enable solution. Present in every major beat and the final image (paragraphs 27, 33–35). The setting is not swappable—no other locale could provide this specific puzzle architecture. Strong irreplaceability, causal pressure, and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"When habits break" appears once (paragraph 7: "when the habit of forgetting finally broke") and frames Elias's return, but the phrase itself doesn't create on-page pressure. The story tracks elapsed time loosely (three nights measuring, three weeks cultivating) but no ticking clock tightens decisions—Elias could take longer without cost. The timeframe enables the setup (forty years → memories now recoverable) but doesn't constrain tactics. The "October vs. August mushrooms" obstacle (paragraph 18) is the closest to time pressure, yet Elias solves it with cultivation, neutralizing urgency. Present in setup, weak in development, absent from closure. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To recover stolen memories" is the explicit, dominant stake signaled in paragraph 1 and pursued across all beats: returning (paragraph 7), detecting the pattern (paragraphs 8–15), cultivating the key (paragraphs 19–21), unlocking memories (paragraphs 23–25), and finally renouncing further pursuit (paragraph 30). The motivation is tested when Elias realizes the memories were "what he couldn't bear to remember" (paragraph 25), adding friction. The cost—learning some truths cut—emerges at closure. Setup, development, and payoff are all strong. Minor deduction: the motivation is mostly told/explained rather than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices during cultivation; Elias never visibly hesitates or questions whether he wants the memories back.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Crisp nostalgia" is named three times (paragraphs 6, 24, 34) and colors the narration's scholarly, wistful distance. The tone modulates subtly: detached curiosity (measuring beats), tactile care (cultivation), bittersweet recognition (memories return), and earned melancholy (final renunciation). However, the phrase "crisp nostalgia" itself remains abstract—"crisp" is asserted rather than embodied through syntax or imagery. The tone supports theme but doesn't charge the final image with a distinct emotional texture that lesser diction couldn't achieve. Present throughout, coherent, but not irreplaceable; a near-synonym ("bittersweet distance") would function similarly. Mid-band for consistent presence without specificity-driven necessity.</comment>
