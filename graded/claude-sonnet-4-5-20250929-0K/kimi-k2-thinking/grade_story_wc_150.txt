<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lina's interior life is rendered through concrete sensory contact—brushing soil, fitting stone—and her motivation (restoring faith through rebuilding) drives micro-choices across the orchard. However, her emotional arc lacks contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; the progression from dread-and-hope to quiet certainty reads linear and resolved without visible internal friction. The final renunciation or endurance that would foreclose a path with felt cost is implied rather than dramatized as a choice under pressure. Interiority occasionally drifts into abstract summary ("quiet tremor of faith returning") rather than embodied perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when early (returnee, catacomb orchard, excavation task) and operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases as Lina traces roots, finds fragments, and restores the sundial, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (the sundial whole, her heart mended, journey continuous). The closure lands on the page with felt cost—twenty years, war, lost home—reweighted by the final image of shadows lengthening and a promise of return. One meaningful deepening occurs when the star-map wedge is found and fitted, recharging prior wandering. Minor cost-visibility issue: the conceptual price is strongly implied but the exact sentence where cost is felt at closure is diffuse across the final two paragraphs rather than sharp.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vividly anchored—gnarled roots snake between ribcages, moss and memory, dappled sunlight on bone—and the environment shapes Lina's choices: roots guide her to fragments, the sundial's placement honors the bones below. The orchard functions as a living archive, not mere backdrop, and the final image (shadows lengthening, light moving with deliberate slowness) charges the closure. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Lina's reverence and hope. High-band entry achieved because setting constraints and charges the final image; the sundial as tool and the bones as micro-setting qualify under the expanded allowance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early (restore faith, mend interrupted journey) and pressure accumulates through the search for fragments and the fitting of the wedge, which narrows the path from abstract longing to concrete action. The discovery of the star-map wedge is a meaningful turn that reweights the restoration as guidance from the past. However, the escalation reads primarily as internal affirmation rather than a choice under competing pressures; no live option is foreclosed with visible trade-off. The protagonist's agency is present (she decides to rebuild, wanders, fits the stone) but cost clarity at the tightening moment is muted—no dramatic sacrifice or renunciation on the page, only a quiet accumulation that tips into resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (interrupted journeys, continuity, living archive) emerges organically from the orchard's particulars—roots intertwined with bones, sundial as timepiece of a lost era—and the final image (sundial whole, shadows stretching, journey as continuous unfolding) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stated moral. Subtext operates in gesture (brushing soil, fitting stone) and the orchard as metaphor for collective memory. Minor slip: the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("not just the sundial but the memory of her people, one stone at a time") rather than trusting the image alone. The closing whisper of return and the living-archive conceit avoid overt moralizing and sustain complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, perceptual signature is consistent (Lina's noticing filtered through reverence, archaeology, and longing), and diction remains within her register—concrete, slightly elevated, poetic without jarring academic leaps. Narrative distance modulates appropriately: closer during the fragment discovery, broader during the orchard's description as living archive. Minor register drift: phrases like "cautious enchantment," "living archive," and "continuous unfolding" edge toward essayistic abstraction rather than embodied thought, especially under the emotional pressure of the final paragraphs. No head-hopping, tense is stable, and the prose reflects Lina's mind and state throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, sensory anchors are vivid, and information density is generally high. However, multiple paragraphs in the second half begin with near-identical stems ("Lina saw," "Lina began to understand," "Lina realized," "Lina's faith," "Lina's heart") creating template cadence that dulls momentum during the turn sequence. Paraphrase loops appear: paragraphs discussing the orchard as living archive and the sundial as mended continuity restate the same thematic content across three successive blocks without added pressure. Stock metaphor: "fragile ember" for faith. These artifacts do not obscure causality but flatten propulsion in the final third, triggering cumulative deduction and disallowing 9+ globally per the patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is a vivid, specific synthesis (bones as bookmarks, trees as storytellers), and the restoration of a sundial as metaphor for mending interrupted time offers a non-obvious angle. However, the emotional arc—exile, loss, gradual restoration of faith through symbolic rebuilding—is a widely used template, and the story does not fully transform it through unexpected moral calculus or lived friction. The "broken object mended = broken self mended" parallel is signaled rather than dramatized with surprising cost. The orchard's particulars elevate the premise, but the resolution feels foreseeable from the setup, limiting ingenuity in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Lina (diaspora returnee) is present throughout, her choices create all key turns: accepting the task, deciding to rebuild, tracing the orchard, fitting the wedge, and promising return. Early signal, three distinct beats (arrival, search, restoration), closure linkage (final image of her looking back), and causal pressure (her wandering enables discovery). Cost is tied to her exile and loss, reweighted at closure. High specificity: removing her returnee status would collapse the story's stakes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sundial base is introduced early (uncovered by the team), handled in multiple beats (Lina sees it as mirror, decides to rebuild, finds the wedge, fits it, watches shadow at dawn), and the restored sundial charges the final image as "small sentinel of time." Causal pressure: the decision to rebuild it drives the wandering and discovery. Cost connection: the sundial's brokenness mirrors her interrupted path, and its restoration marks continuity mended. Strong closure linkage and irreplaceability; the sundial's specific function (marking time) is integral.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Interrupted journeys shape stakes from the opening (twenty years of exile, war, closure of borders) and tactics (Lina's purposeful wandering to restore continuity). The concept is dramatized through her actions—tracing hidden contours, finding fragments, fitting the wedge—and the closure directly answers it: the journey home is "not a destination but a continuous unfolding." Early signal, beat involvement across search and restoration, closure linkage, and causal pressure. Cost is visible (lost home, twenty years) and reweighted at the end.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Warmly curious" appears once as descriptor ("warmly curious tug") when Lina brushes the sarcophagus, but the trait does not constrain or enable subsequent actions with visible cost. Her wandering and rebuilding read as purposeful and reverent rather than driven by curiosity's tradeoffs. The attribute is present but largely ornamental; it does not recur or shape a decision under pressure. Setup is met, but development and payoff are weak; it could be swapped for "reverent" or "hopeful" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Rebuild" is the action that defines Lina's arc: she decides to rebuild the sundial, searches for fragments, fits the wedge, and the restored sundial appears in the final image as proof of continuity mended. Early signal, causal pressure (rebuilding drives her wandering and discovery), multiple beats (decision, search, fitting, dawn observation), and closure linkage. Removing rebuild would collapse the plot and theme. High irreplaceability and cost connection (rebuilding as metaphor for mending self and memory).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Purposeful wandering" is signaled early (paragraph 9: "Her method became purposeful wandering, tracing the orchard's hidden contours") and shapes tactics: Lina lets roots guide her to fragments, each step is a small ritual, and the wandering pays off when she finds the missing wedge. The method is specific and constrains her search (patient, reverent) versus a systematic excavation. It appears in at least two beats (method statement, fragment discovery) and charges the theme of interrupted journeys resuming. Cost is tied to patience and time; causal pressure is clear.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is introduced in paragraph 2 and anchors every beat: gnarled roots snake between bones, the air smells of moss and memory, roots guide Lina to fragments, the orchard is a living archive, and the final image places the sundial "amid the bones" with shadows lengthening. The setting supplies resources (fragments hidden among roots), pressures choices (reverence for the dead shapes her method), and charges the closure. Early signal, multiple beats, high specificity (no other setting would allow this exact interweaving of death, growth, and time), and closure linkage. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "across excavating a tomb" is present (Lina assists archaeologists, the team uncovers the sundial base, excavation continues) and bounds the action, but elapsed time is vague—no live clock tightens decisions. The discovery of the wedge occurs "one twilight," the restoration is complete by "the next morning," but these markers do not create urgency or alter tactics. The timeframe is functional (setup, middle, payoff gates met) and consistent, but it does not pressure choices the way a deadline or countdown would. Mid-band: causal role present, but time as constraint is weak.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Lina's motivation "to restore lost faith" is signaled early (dread and hope, faith as fragile ember) and drives her key choices: accepting the task, deciding to rebuild, wandering to find fragments, and the final realization that faith burns brighter. The motivation is dramatized through action (brushing soil, fitting stone) and the final image (heart mended, quiet certainty). Friction between want (faith restored) and cost (twenty years, war, lost home) is legible. Early signal, multiple beats, closure linkage, and causal pressure. High necessity: without this motive, the sundial restoration reads as archaeology, not pilgrimage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Cautious enchantment" is coherent throughout: Lina's reverence (cautious) mixes with wonder at the living archive (enchantment). Tone is established early ("warmly curious tug," "small ritual," "quiet promise") and modulates with pressure—deepening during the fragment discovery ("quiet reassurance") and crystallizing at closure ("quiet smile," "quiet certainty"). The tone charges the final image: shadows lengthen, the journey unfolds quietly. No jarring shifts; the mood supports the accumulative lens. Strong setup, middle consistency, and closure linkage. One minor slip: "cautious enchantment" is named directly in paragraph 22, edging toward label rather than embodiment.</comment>
