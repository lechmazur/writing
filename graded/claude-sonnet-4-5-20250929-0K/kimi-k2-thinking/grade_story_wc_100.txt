<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The undertaker's interior is richly embodied ("hands were permanent wrinkles of silt and sorrow") and their stubborn refusal to abandon the dead drives the arc. However, the transformation into "not quite fish, not quite human" arrives late and feels asserted rather than earned through micro-choices under pressure. The final renunciation—building an eternal occupation rather than escape—lands with conceptual weight, but the undertaker's moment-to-moment decision process during lens assembly lacks the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously that would elevate this to high bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly in the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the lens fragments accumulate pressure through dreams, material gathering, and assembly until the library shudders and transforms into a permanent beacon. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—the undertaker accepts an eternal role with visible cost ("silence that would never quite catch them"). The cost is conceptually legible but lacks a sharp physical or relational price on the page that would push this higher.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The underwater library with its "impossible architecture of air pockets and pressure-bent shelves" and the central atrium where "water and air refused to separate" constrains the undertaker's choices and charges the final image. Materials (silver wire, pearl, blood) are gathered with purpose. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The library itself functions as both crucible and tool, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment/object constrain choice and shape closure—only minor descriptive excess in the middle ("rooms that existed simultaneously at thirty fathoms and sea level") prevents higher placement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—giving rest to the unremembered dead—is signaled early and tightens when the lens begins to hum with distress signals. The undertaker's gathering of materials and assembly work narrows options, culminating in the library's transformation. However, the escalation operates more through atmospheric accumulation than protagonist-driven reversals; the dreams that teach the method feel delivered rather than wrestled for. The final cost (eternal occupation vs. sought silence) is conceptually clear but lacks a sharp on-page trade-off moment where competing goods collide.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: the tension between rest and restlessness, memory and forgetting, stubbornness as both survival and trap. The lighthouse lens fracturing into seven pieces to "address each soul individually" grounds the abstract in concrete image. The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer—the undertaker achieves their goal but loses the silence they craved, a sentence rather than salvation. Only the phrase "revitalizing peace for others while their own chased stillness through the depths like a minnow fleeing a shark that was also itself" edges toward over-articulation, preventing full 9+ entry.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and sustained: elevated diction ("sip from pockets of trapped atmosphere like a miser hoarding coins") anchored in physical specifics. POV remains stable third-limited throughout. The perceptual signature—filtering the drowned city through burial and memory—is consistent. However, register occasionally drifts into abstracting poeticism ("twilight state of neither and both," "marrow" instead of bone) that feels more authorial than character-particular for an undertaker, and some figurative language stacks without pattern-teaching ("minnow fleeing a shark that was also itself"). These prevent 9+ but the voice remains controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high and most lines advance pressure. However, the piece suffers from paraphrase loops and elevated diction clusters: "not quite breathing, not quite drowned" echoes "not quite fish, not quite human"; "the stillness they sought remained chased" is restated in "their own chased stillness" two paragraphs later. Template cadence appears in runs of "They were..." and "The undertaker..." openings across adjacent paragraphs. Stacked metaphors in the final third ("through the depths like a minnow fleeing a shark that was also itself") muddle rather than sharpen. These artifacts touch but don't fully obscure the closure, resulting in −0.8 under the patterned-artifact penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of lighthouse-as-psychopomp in an underwater library offers a fresh angle on the "guide to the afterlife" premise. The lens fractured by design to split signals individually is specific and non-obvious. However, the core arc—caretaker becomes permanent fixture—echoes familiar "monkey's paw" and "be careful what you wish for" templates without sufficient transformation through lived occupational detail. The undertaker's methods (gathering materials in dreams, blood as binding agent) feel more atmospheric than grounded in burial craft or lighthouse mechanics. Strong but not exceptional.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The undertaker is present throughout and their choices (to open the package, gather materials, rebuild the lens) drive beats. Early setup establishes weariness and stubborn refusal; middle development shows material gathering; closure directly depicts their transformation into beacon-keeper. The character's decisions alter tactics across at least three beats and the final state (eternal occupation) is causally earned. Strong integration but the middle assembly phase lacks moment-to-moment pressure choices that would demonstrate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The lens appears in the inciting package, returns in dreams where its design is learned, is physically assembled in the atrium with materials, and when completed transforms the library and undertaker. It is handled across four distinct beats and its fractured-by-design property is essential to the ending's logic. Removing it would collapse the story. Only the somewhat passive dream-delivery of its mechanics (rather than puzzle-solving discovery) prevents higher placement.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Distress signals are named early when the lens hums "in the voices of those they'd interred," return when the undertaker realizes they are "not for rescue, but for rest," and transform at closure into "coordinates—addresses etched in light." The concept shapes the undertaker's motivation and constrains the method (signals must be split individually). However, the signals themselves do not narrow on-page options during assembly; they frame stakes more than alter tactics. Solid integration but not indispensable to moment-level pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Inadvertently stubborn" is labeled in paragraph eight ("inadvertently stubborn, a trait that had kept them alive") and mentioned again near the end ("their stubbornness had built not an escape, but an eternal occupation"). The trait enables the undertaker's survival and refusal to abandon the dead, which grounds the entire premise. However, the story tells us the trait rather than showing a moment where stubbornness constrains a choice with visible cost—we never see the undertaker tempted to leave and refuse. Label-only with conceptual linkage to closure but no dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Revitalize" appears explicitly when the undertaker realizes they must "revitalize something that had never truly lived: the lighthouse's purpose" and again near the end ("revitalizing peace for others"). The action structures the entire middle: gathering materials, rebuilding the lens, and transforming the library into a functioning beacon. The ending turns on this action—without revitalizing the lens's guidance function, there is no eternal occupation or addressed rest. Removing it would require fundamental rewrite. Strong causal integration across beats and closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The method is seeded early (library already "a space between worlds"), taught in dreams where the undertaker learns to occupy "impossible spaces—not quite breathing, not quite drowned," enacted during assembly in "that impossible atrium, where water and air refused to separate," and completed when the undertaker's form becomes "part of the library's architecture." The method shapes both the means (assembly requires hybrid existence) and the ending (permanent fixture in between-state). It appears across setup, development, and closure with causal necessity. Only slight late-arrival of explicit mechanics prevents higher score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The underwater library is named in paragraph two, its "impossible architecture of air pockets" supplies breathable spaces that keep the undertaker alive, the central atrium's water/air refusal provides the assembly site, and the final image places the undertaker within its architecture as permanent keeper. The setting constrains survival, enables the method, and houses the closure transformation. Removing this exact setting (not just "underwater" but this library with phase-state anomalies) would break multiple causal chains. Essential across all three gates with strong specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe anchor "after the mysterious package arrives" is met immediately (paragraph four: "When the package arrived"). The story tracks "days blurred into weeks" during assembly, but no clock tightens decisions—the undertaker has unlimited time and no external deadline pressures tactics. The frame provides sequence but not constraint. Present in setup and vaguely tracked in middle, but absent from closure pressure and easily swappable with "over time" or similar. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The motivation is stated clearly ("to give rest a permanent address") in paragraph twelve and drives the undertaker's entire assembly project. It is dramatized through material gathering, lens rebuilding, and the final achievement (rest now has an address in the impossible library). However, the motivation is never shown in conflict—no moment where the undertaker weighs this goal against their own need for silence until the ending reveals the cost retroactively. Strong causal role across beats and direct closure participation, but lacks on-page friction between want and price during the attempt.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Tone of "chased stillness" is established in the opening ("long since forgotten the sound of silence") and sustained through "quiet that was never quite quiet enough" at closure. The paradox—seeking rest while building a beacon that prevents it—charges the final image. Modulation occurs: contemplative during dreams, textured during assembly, elegiac at the ending. The tone is coherent and meaningfully reweights the premise by the last line. However, some middle paragraphs flatten into exposition ("They told themselves they would leave") without tonal pressure, preventing full high-band entry.</comment>
