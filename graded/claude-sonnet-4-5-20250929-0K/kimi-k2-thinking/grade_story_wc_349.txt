<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The vendor's motivation remains abstract—she measures absences and bottles moonlight but her interiority never surfaces as embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure. The woman customer enters with a goal ("find the place where stories begin") but her renunciation or transformation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses acting in scene. The vendor's final choice to bottle moonlight for herself reads as a gesture without visible cost or prior causal pressure that forecloses a path. Embodied emotion and character-particular decision-making are largely absent; actions remain symbolic rather than rooted in contradictory desire.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when within bounds (vendor in floating library on opening day) but the drive lens remains ambiguous—lyric/accumulative patterns are taught but no single stake tightens or deepens with visible cost on the page. The woman's transformation ("she found it: the unmarked place") is asserted rather than shown as a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt consequence. The final image (vendor among bottles, woman beginning to write) offers atmosphere but no legible before/after cost or option foreclosure. Closure effect is conceptually claimed but not dramatized, violating the on-page closure requirement.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The glass orchard library and swirling clouds establish vivid spatial anchors, and the vendor's bottles function as recurring objects that organize the scene. Sensory detail (glimmering parole, clinking bottles, glass floor) is selective and voice-filtered. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or pressure a decision—the library floats as backdrop rather than shaping the vendor's tactics or the woman's transformation. The bottles' physical handling remains light; they are described and uncorked but their material properties do not alter the outcome, capping the score below high-band entry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—helping customers find story beginnings—is signaled early but never tightens with a visible trade-off or cost. The woman's request and the vendor's response proceed without reversal, complication, or agency-driven escalation; the bottled moonlight simply works as described. No on-page loss (time, resource, relational price) alters later tactics. The accumulative lens teaches pattern but no single beat narrows options or changes knowledge with felt consequence, falling short of the escalation requirement for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>A coherent theme—stories begin in absence, erasure enables creation—emerges from recurring images (moonlight, incision, silence) rather than direct statement. The final image of the woman writing after erasure offers non-literal resonance. However, the vendor's epiphany ("to remain always at the threshold") reads as label-speak rather than earned insight from scene pressure, and the thematic question is resolved tidily without meaningful ambiguity or counter-reading. The piece tilts toward assertion of its conceptual premise rather than dramatizing a reweighting that costs something on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping, and the narrative voice carries a consistent lyric register ("mindfully scattered," "phosphorescence of forgotten names"). The vendor's perceptual signature—quantifying absences, measuring emptiness—is idiosyncratic and held across beats. However, the dialogue ("I need to find the place where stories begin," "Only as much as birth") reads as thematic ventriloquism rather than goal-driven subtext, and the final-paragraph diction ("her purpose floating like the library itself—anchored only by the void it filled") tilts into abstract philosophizing that breaks the embodied texture established earlier.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("glimmering parole," "incise your past," "quantifying absence") without pattern-teaching or payoff that charges closure, triggering overwriting penalties. Paraphrase loops appear: "Each vial glowed with erased stories, blank pages, the phosphorescence of forgotten names" restates the same content three ways without adding pressure. Template cadence runs appear ("She scattered," "She measured," "She uncorked") and synonym churn ("mindfully scattered" recurs without evolving meaning). Stock metaphors ("stars emerging like puncture wounds") and abstract diction in peak beats ("integrated fragmentation," "archive of performed beginnings") dull immediacy. Line-level artifacts pervade the final third, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—a vendor who erases pasts to enable new beginnings via bottled moonlight—reads as allegory with transparent stand-ins (clean slate, blank pages, origin point) that lack narrative surprise. The transformation test fails: swapping "moonlight" for "stardust" or "library" for "archive" would not alter the emotional arc or thematic resolution. The "glimmering parole" coinage and floating-library setting offer surface novelty but the plot and stakes follow a predictable template (customer seeks help → vendor provides magical erasure → customer begins anew). No fresh inflection or risk-taking heightens the premise; the piece stays safely within its allegorical frame without lived-in particularity or non-obvious synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The clean slate vendor appears in all three gates (setup, middle, ending) and handles multiple customers across beats, but her choices do not create key turns—she performs the same action (selecting bottles, scattering moonlight, incising pasts) without variation or cost. The final beat where she bottles moonlight for herself is a gesture rather than a decision that alters options. Present throughout but functionally static, the character shapes atmosphere more than causality.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Bottled moonlight appears in setup (arranged on counter), drives middle action (vendor selects and uncorks bottles for customers), and returns at closure (vendor bottles another fraction for morning). The object is handled across at least four beats and its core property—erasing pasts—enables the vendor's service. However, the bottles' mechanics do not evolve or incur visible cost; they work as described without constraint or trade-off. Essential to the premise but replaceable with any magical erasure device without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Glimmering parole is defined early ("conditional release from one's own narrative") and frames the vendor's offering, satisfying setup. It recurs in dialogue and the ending ("Every story began this way: in glimmering parole"). However, it functions as thematic flavor rather than shaping on-page stakes or tactics—the term could be removed and the plot would proceed identically. The concept is present but ornamental, mentioned rather than causally active.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Mindfully scattered" appears twice as a label ("mindfully scattered" moonlight, "mindfully scattered" attention) but never constrains or enables a visible action with cost. The attribute describes the vendor's manner without altering her choices or the outcome. It reads as atmospheric diction rather than a trait that pressures decision-making, remaining label-only across all beats.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Incise" is signaled early ("I can incise your past"), executed in the middle beat ("the light incised her"), and referenced at closure ("Every story began this way: in...incision that liberated silence"). The action drives the vendor's service and the woman's transformation. However, it is functionally identical to "erase" or "cut away"—the specific verb does not add unique mechanics or cost that another term would not supply. Causal across beats but swappable with minor edits, trending mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Quantifying absence" is introduced early ("She measured emptiness by quantifying absence") and reappears in middle beats ("By quantifying these gaps, she traced the origin backward") and at closure ("she had quantified so much absence"). The method frames the vendor's approach and recurs across three beats, satisfying setup and development. However, it never constrains a choice or alters tactics—quantification is described but not shown to matter mechanically. The method is present but its mechanics remain abstract, lowering integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The glass orchard library floating upon clouds anchors setup (opening line) and recurs at closure ("the library floating like a lantern"). The setting provides vivid spatial grounding and the glass floor is handled once ("footsteps ringing against the glass floor"). However, the environment does not constrain choices or supply resources that affect outcome—it could be a ground-level shop without altering the vendor's service or the woman's transformation. Present and consistent but functionally decorative, capping below 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The timeframe ("during the lull on a store's very first opening day") is signaled in the opening beats and the lull deepens to night by closure, bracketing the action within one opening day. The vendor counts "seventeen bottles" at dusk, marking time's passage, and the final line gestures toward morning. However, the lull does not tighten decisions—customers arrive without urgency and the vendor's work proceeds without time pressure or a live clock altering tactics. The timeframe provides narrative bookends but does not escalate stakes, trending mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The woman's motivation ("I need to find the place where stories begin") is voiced early and drives her request for the vendor's service, satisfying setup and shaping the middle action. The ending gestures at fulfillment ("the woman...began to write, her first word taking root in silence"). However, the desire is not dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost—the woman simply receives what she asks for without friction or trade-off. The motivation is functional but not tested under pressure, capping integration below 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Integrated fragmentation" as tone is taught through lyric phrasing ("mindfully scattered," "glass birds," "shivering second chance") and the collage structure (vendor's observations, customer interactions, reflective asides). The tone modulates lightly from opening wonder to dusk reflection and holds coherence across beats. However, it does not charge the final image with pressure or cost—the fragmentation remains decorative rather than escalating toward a decisive tonal turn. Consistent but static, the tone supports atmosphere without driving closure, trending mid-band.</comment>
