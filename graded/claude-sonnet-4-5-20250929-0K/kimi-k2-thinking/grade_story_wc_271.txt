<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elias's interiority is concrete and purposeful—his forensic architect background manifests as pattern-finding that evolves into somatic preservation. The "freeze" action and palm-to-bark moments embody contradiction (clinging vs. releasing) without therapy-speak. However, the curator remains a voice of exposition rather than applying independent pressure, and the final stance ("optimism anchored in realism") verges on diagnostic self-awareness. The embodied grief work (hand pressure, bark texture) earns the choice to return, but the articulation of that choice occasionally slips into label-only insight.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density increases through repeated somatic contacts (cypress, eucalyptus, ferns) that reweight the photograph's meaning, culminating in the final metaphor (body as lighthouse tower). Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elias's decision to return daily and his embodied reframing of the photograph constitute visible cost (he accepts the shadow will remain) and a new stance (survival through sensation, not erasure). Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. The two-shard structure (arboretum visit, then conservatory/eucalyptus sequence) coheres under one window with minimal transition. One meaningful deepening occurs when he realizes stillness preserves touch, not trauma. Cost is legible: he stops needing constant tactile comfort from the photograph, substituting embodied ritual.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The arboretum's cliff edge, wind-scarred cypress, and exposed orchid roots charge the ending image (body as lighthouse, somatic markers as beam). The Monterey cypress and eucalyptus bark constrain Elias's method—he needs tactile surface to anchor memory. Sensory hierarchy reflects his forensic eye (grooves, pressure, cool roughness) filtered through grief. The automated lighthouse vs. human arboretum contrast supports his thematic shift. However, occupational detail (forensic architect) is mentioned but never operationalized in a choice; the skill becomes metaphor rather than constraint. Spatial choreography is clear across beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: can Elias integrate trauma without erasure? Pressure accumulates through repeated somatic contacts, each reweighting his relationship to the photograph. The eucalyptus beat narrows options—he chooses to hold both shadow and smile, foreclosing the path of avoidance. Agency is renunciation (he stops constant touching) with visible cost (acceptance that the drone's shadow is permanent chemistry). The tightening is meaningful: from chaotic grief (daily handling worn the photo to velvet) to deliberate ritual (returning tomorrow to sketch roots). No antagonist required; the situational pressure (trauma, cliff, trees) coheres. The final decision—becoming the keeper of his own light—crystallizes his stance with undeniable cost (full feeling, no retreat).</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through somatic specificity: the body as archive, stillness as active preservation. The pearl-of-stillness motif deepens from the curator's invitation to Elias's realization (not peace, but perfect memory encased) to the final layered image (nacre from grit). However, the closing passage ("optimism anchored in realism meant remembering fully, feeling completely, and standing still when stillness was the only true movement") borders on thematic echo—it articulates the premise in near-prompt language. The lighthouse/keeper metaphor charges the ending without stating a moral, but the penultimate paragraph's explicit gloss ("healing wasn't loud or heroic") flattens earned resonance into summary. Subtext operates well in the somatic beats (palm to bark, wind as laughter) but the final lines over-explain.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with close psychic distance. Perceptual signature is consistent: Elias notices grooves, pressure, paths (forensic architect's eye repurposed). Diction matches his interior idiom ("somatic marker activated," "anchored in nerve endings") without register drift. The curator's dialogue ("The body remembers what the mind cannot bear to hold") fits her soil-under-nails authority. Filter verbs ("feeling," "realized") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy. No head-hopping. Purposeful compression in the conservatory sequence (hours of sketching summarized) serves momentum. The final paragraph's metaphor stack (body as tower, markers as beam, pearl as lens) is dense but legible, teaching the pattern through parallel structure. POV modesty holds—Elias infers but does not claim omniscience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, image, or thematic pressure. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully (short declaratives at crisis—"Then he froze"—longer cumulative syntax in reflection). However, the closing paragraph deploys a template cadence: three metaphoric equations in parallel ("his body the tower, his somatic markers the beam, his pearl of stillness the lens") that, while thematically coherent, verge on mechanical stacking. The phrase "pearl of stillness" recurs five times, functioning as motif but occasionally as filler when the concept is re-explained rather than deepened. Minor paraphrase loop: "optimism anchored in realism" appears twice in near-identical phrasing. No mixed metaphors; figurative language (lighthouse, nacre, roots) remains coherent. Proofreading is clean. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of somatic memory, arboretum setting, and lighthouse metaphor feels purposeful rather than checklist. The forensic-architect-turned-grief-keeper arc offers a fresh angle on trauma narrative. However, the core emotional trajectory (survivor learning to integrate loss through embodied ritual) follows a familiar template; the transformation hinges on specificity of setting (cliff, bark, wind) rather than a non-obvious premise. The final lighthouse-keeper metaphor is vivid but borders on over-determined—every element maps neatly onto the thesis. Risk-taking is moderate: the accumulative structure and somatic focus elevate the material, but the closure articulates its own meaning rather than trusting image alone. No close echoes of famous work, and the wedding-drone detail provides verifiable contemporary grit.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elias (drone strike wedding survivor) is present throughout and his trauma drives the dominant stake. His choices—palm to bark, holding the photograph against eucalyptus, deciding to return—create key turns. Setup clear (photograph, wedding detail in opening). Middle beats: he traces grief into sketches, tests somatic freezing. Closure: his decision to become his own keeper and return tomorrow is motivated by survivor identity. However, the wedding/drone detail is largely backstory fuel; the on-page choices (sketching, freezing, returning) could arise from other traumas with minor edits. The survivor status enables but does not uniquely constrain the arboretum method. Causal role present but not indispensable to closure mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The crumpled photograph appears in four distinct beats: carried in pocket (setup), held against bark at eucalyptus (middle turn), "seemed less crumpled" after stillness (reweighted), and "heartbeat in his pocket" at descent (closure). Its physical state (edges worn soft, creases) signals obsessive handling, and the shift from constant touching to occasional presence marks cost. The photograph enables the somatic experiment (held against bark) and the final line's "heartbeat" charges the ending image. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage. However, it could be replaced by another tactile keepsake (ring, letter) with modest rewrites; the photograph's visual properties (drone's shadow, wife's smile) matter thematically but do not mechanically constrain his method.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Pearl of stillness" is introduced via the curator's letter (setup) and returns in Elias's realization ("wasn't peace; it was the perfect memory of her touch, encased") and the closing metaphor ("layers of nacre formed from grit"). It frames the thematic question but does not alter tactics on the page—Elias's somatic work (freezing, palm-to-bark) proceeds identically whether labeled "pearl" or not. The concept functions as thematic overlay rather than stake-shaping constraint. Present in closure image (pearl as lens) but as metaphor, not causal driver. Lyric resonance is purposeful, but the element remains conceptual rather than operational.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Quietly talented" is established early (forensic architect, pattern-finding) and referenced at closure ("being quietly talented meant recognizing healing wasn't loud"). The trait enables his sketching and hummingbird-path prediction but does not constrain a specific choice with visible cost—his grief work succeeds because he applies the skill, not because the skill's limits force a tradeoff. The attribute colors his method (reconstruction becomes preservation) but could be replaced by "observant" or "detail-oriented" without breaking story logic. Functional across beats but not indispensable; the closure insight about quiet healing is thematic echo rather than dramatized consequence of the trait's friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Freeze" drives the eucalyptus beat (he freezes completely still, letting somatic markers cascade) and is referenced at closure ("freeze another moment"). It enables the somatic method and creates the pearl-of-stillness effect. However, the action itself is more metaphor than physical constraint—standing still at a tree does not mechanically narrow options or impose cost the way a riskier act would. The freeze is purposeful and charges the middle turn, but it could be replaced by "breathe deeply" or "meditate" with modest edits and similar thematic effect. Present in two beats, causally relevant, but not irreplaceable in mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Somatic markers" is mentioned five times: introduced early (blog about somatic memory), activated at cypress (fingers remember hand pressure), explained in conservatory (mapping grief into form), and referenced at closure (markers as beam). The method is signaled but its mechanics remain vague—what differentiates somatic markers from ordinary sense memory is not dramatized in a way that alters his approach. He touches trees and recalls sensation; the label adds clinical texture but does not constrain or enable a choice that simpler "touch memory" would not. Thematic presence is strong, but operational impact is modest. Functional but largely ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The arboretum on a seaside cliff supplies the trees (cypress, eucalyptus, ferns) that enable Elias's somatic experiments, the wind that scars bark and becomes laughter-memory, and the cliff edge that sets up the lighthouse contrast. Setup is immediate (opening line). Multiple middle beats occur within the setting (conservatory orchids, tree ferns at dusk), and the setting charges the closure image (cliff, lighthouse, descent). The specific features—bark texture, salt air, exposed roots—constrain his method (he needs rough surfaces, liminal space). Spatial choreography is clear. The arboretum vs. automated lighthouse provides the thematic backbone. Essential across beats and indispensable to closure; removing this exact setting would break story logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the last lighthouse keeper" is established in the second paragraph (three winters ago, beam now automated) and returns at closure (Elias as the new keeper, "after the last lighthouse keeper, someone had to keep the light"). The timeframe sets thematic context (human vs. automated, silence after the foghorn) but does not tighten on-page decisions—no clock pressure, no seasonal constraint affecting Elias's arboretum visits. The reference bookends the piece and supports the lighthouse metaphor, but it remains atmospheric rather than tactical. Lyric reprise reweights meaning modestly, but the historical detail could be omitted or shifted without altering Elias's arc. Present in setup and closure; mid-band for thematic resonance, low for causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"To anchor optimism in realism" is stated explicitly ("The optimism he'd been chasing needed anchoring in realism") and drives his final stance (accepting shadow and smile together, boat anchored in what happened). The motivation is dramatized through his shift from chaotic handling (photograph worn to velvet) to deliberate ritual (returning tomorrow). Friction is visible: he must accept the drone's shadow as permanent to preserve the memory of her hand. However, the desire is told more than shown in conflicted action—his sketches and somatic work illustrate the resolution rather than the struggle between optimism and realism. Closure linkage is strong (anchored boat metaphor, final descent decision), but the motivation functions as thematic frame rather than on-page dilemma that alters a specific choice under pressure.</comment>
