<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The gardener remains thinly sketched; his interiority consists largely of interpretive gestures ("quiet resolve," "wondered") without contradiction or embodied cost. The piece tells us he seeks peace and honor but never dramatizes a micro-choice that forecloses a path or reveals hierarchy of values. Motivation is declared ("to discover the shape of intentions") but operates as atmospheric decoration rather than a lived pressure that drives visible trade-offs. The final walk-away feels asserted rather than earned by prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational framing. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive piecemeal—cemetery, gardener, silo—but the chess-clock frame remains unexplained past the opening, creating minor disorientation debt. The tapestry-decoding supplies a potential closure structure, yet the ending offers only a recirculation of prior images without a decisive reweighting or visible cost; the gardener walks away unchanged, and the "uncharted echoes" remain abstract rather than dramatized consequences. No meaningful tightening or deepening narrows options between midpoint and close.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The cobalt silo is vividly anchored (metal skin, curving walls, dust, starlight) and returns at closure. Spatial choreography inside the silo is clean. However, the cemetery grounds and the chess-clock opening remain disconnected from the silo action—no causal bridge links them—and the silo itself does not constrain a choice; it functions as backdrop rather than active pressure. The final star-pulse and velveteen gloom charge the atmosphere but do not alter tactics or options.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering intentions woven in the tapestry—is signaled early but never tested by a counter-pressure or cost. The gardener untangles threads without obstacle, loss, or trade-off; no reversal or deepening narrows options. The ending recycles the same contemplative stance with no escalation, and the sovereign case's warmth in his pocket is asserted rather than earned by dramatized consequence. Accumulative texture does not substitute for escalation when no beat alters the protagonist's capacity or path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme (unspoken intentions, silence as fabric) emerges from recurring images—tapestry, threads, knotted sorrow—and avoids overt moralizing until the penultimate insight ("Intentions, he realized, were not always spoken"). That line edges toward thematic statement but remains grounded in the object. The final image (warm case, cobalt walls) offers resonance, yet the lack of causal pressure earlier prevents the ending from reweighting prior material with cost. The piece gestures toward complexity without dramatizing it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature (the gardener's attention to threads, colors, weaver's calloused fingers) is consistent but generic—any archivist might notice these details. Diction remains elevated and slightly formal throughout ("velveteen gloom," "cobalt," "sovereign case"), which fits the tone but lacks modulation under pressure. The repeated phrase "tenderly organized" and "uncharted echoes" signal voice tics rather than organic perception. No dialogue present to assess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the text: "shape of intentions" recurs five times with minor variation; "velveteen gloom" appears four times in identical phrasing; "tenderly organized" is used twice in near-identical constructions. Lines 11–13 restate the same idea (decoding threads to seek hidden language). Template cadence in the mid-section ("He traced," "He felt," "He wondered," "He pictured," "He sat," "He placed," "He stepped") flattens rhythm. Stock metaphors ("silent plea," "labyrinth," "whispered confession") cluster without fresh vehicle. Figurative density in the silo sequence (lines 16–30) does not teach a pattern or pay off at closure. Apply −1.4 for pervasive loops and template stems, plus −0.3 for filter/label churn = baseline ~4.2. Artifacts touch the closure paragraph (line 40 recycles "uncharted echoes"), triggering the −1.7 threshold and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The cemetery-gardener-as-archivist and the tapestry-as-mystery-map are familiar templates executed without fresh synthesis. The chess-clock opener promises a frame but is abandoned without payoff. The weaver's "calloused yet gentle" fingers appear twice (lines 22, 36) as stock detail rather than earned specificity. The silo's cobalt color and the sovereign case offer texture but do not transform the underlying plot: gardener finds artifact, decodes it, honors the past. No bold structural or perspectival risk heightens stakes; the piece occupies the safety middle.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Present throughout; the gardener performs all on-page actions (lifts case, untangles threads, walks away). However, no choice alters tactics or forecloses a path—he proceeds without obstacle or trade-off. His final decision to return nightly is declared rather than dramatized with cost. Functional but replaceable; any contemplative figure could serve the same role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: appears at line 7. Development: opened at line 9, handled again at line 29 when placed back on bench. Closure: felt warm in pocket at line 34, signaling persistence. Three beats, but the case itself does not constrain a choice—it is a container for the tapestry, the true driver. Swappable with "wooden box" or "leather pouch" with minor edits. Mid-band for presence across beats without causal irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The phrase "uncharted echoes" recurs four times (lines 12, 19, 33, 40) but remains abstract; no on-page moment dramatizes what these echoes are or how they alter the gardener's options. The concept is declared rather than demonstrated through choice or cost. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The phrase "tenderly organized" appears twice (lines 6, 18) as atmospheric label. Line 6 applies it to shelves (static description); line 18 applies it to the gardener's method (summary). No on-page beat shows this trait enabling or constraining an action with cost. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setup: signaled at line 10. Development: lines 11–14 dramatize the untangling with concrete detail (twist, clue, knotted threads). Closure: line 26 traces the final thread. The action drives three beats and shapes the middle revelation (lines 15, pattern revealed). However, the untangling proceeds without obstacle, so cost is absent. Strong presence, moderate causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Setup: "decoding frayed threads" named at line 11. Development: the method structures lines 11–18 (trace color shift, map story). Closure: line 27 completes the decoding. The mechanics are shown (threads, dye stains, color shifts) and shape the middle section. Swappable with "translating faded ink" or another decipherment frame without fundamental story breakage. Present across beats but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: introduced at line 4, detailed at lines 6, 16, 25, 30, 40. The silo provides spatial coherence and recurs at closure. Its cobalt walls and starlight filtering create atmosphere that charges the final image. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it is a vivid container rather than active pressure. Presence and closure linkage without causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>The phrase "after the chess clock runs down" appears at line 3 and is echoed at line 35 ("each night after the chess clock runs down"). The timeframe is declared but never tracked or tested; no ticking pressure shapes decisions within the scene. The chess-clock metaphor is abandoned after the opening and does not return with reweighted meaning. Present but inert.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Stated explicitly at line 13 ("his purpose to discover the shape of intentions"). The desire frames the middle action (untangling threads to read intentions), but no friction or competing want tests it. The gardener succeeds without cost or trade-off. Told rather than dramatized through conflicted choice. Functional setup without pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The phrase "velveteen gloom" recurs at lines 5, 16, 25, 31, with consistent texture (soft darkness, starlight, quiet). Tone is stable and coherent through the piece, modulating slightly at closure (line 31, "softer than before"). The final paragraph sustains the contemplative mood. However, the tone does not shift under pressure—no peak beat disrupts or charges it—so it reads as static atmosphere rather than dynamic modulation. Consistent presence with modest closure charge.</comment>
