<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lina's interiority relies heavily on label-only trait mentions ("affectionate skepticism," "willowglass hope") without embodied contradiction or genuine struggle. Her choices follow a research-curiosity path but lack competing impulses or visible cost; the geode experiment proceeds smoothly without meaningful obstacles from her own flaws or doubts. The final "fragile optimism" and whispered thank-you read as asserted emotional states rather than earned shifts. No foreclosed path or renunciation with weight on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the story layers sensory and conceptual material around the geode resonance experiment. The closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) with the fractal-tree image, but no visible cost or option-narrowing occurs on the page—Lina ends with method, hope, and notebook intact, facing an implied future conversation without dramatized friction. Orientation is clean. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early, but the final image reweights prior material only abstractly; the "willowglass hope" brightening and the fractal tree feel decorative rather than pressured by a trade-off or sacrifice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The light-painting studio anchors who/where/when early and supplies concrete tools (dimmer switch, metal table, chemicals, software) that Lina uses in the experiment. Sensory detail—acetone smell, fluorescent buzz, geode hum—grounds the action. The setting enables the experiment but does not constrain a choice or force a trade-off; Lina has unfettered access to materials and time. The geode as micro-object charges the final image (fractal tree on canvas), lifting the score into mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled: map the pill's hidden pathways and offer a diagnostic tool. The experiment proceeds without complication—dust settles, hum matches lattice, threads appear, software sketches—so there is no on-page reversal or tightening that narrows options. Lina's agency is research curiosity, not a choice between competing goods or under external pressure. The anticipated recall-team skepticism is mentioned but not dramatized, and no cost (time, risk, doubt) alters tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme of hidden-pathway illumination and hope-from-failure emerges through the geode/pill resonance, but it arrives via assertion ("willowglass hope," "fragile optimism") rather than a non-literal final image that reweights prior material with cost. The fractal-tree canvas and grandmother's-gift gratitude gesture toward resonance, yet the piece states its theme explicitly ("not just a recalled pill's failure, but a doorway") instead of trusting the image. Subtext in the grandmother gift and somatic-marker method adds specificity without full thematic charge at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Single-POV third-limited is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (studio artist's eye, geode appreciation) but diction drifts into elevated register ("fractally precise," "resonant reconfiguration," "somatic marker") that feels imported rather than voice-native under the established sensory focus. Psychic distance is consistent. The final paragraphs repeat syntactic stems ("She [verb]," "The studio's [noun]") and recycle phrases ("fractally precise," "willowglass hope," "hidden pathways") without variation, creating template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "fractally precise" appears six times, "hidden pathways" five, "willowglass hope" four, "somatic marker" three—often in adjacent or nearby lines without added pressure. Sentences frequently restate the same content with synonym churn (e.g., "The hum matched the fractally precise lattice" followed by "each vibration echoing the pill's nanotech design"). Template cadence runs: "She [verb]" x5 in the final third, "The [noun]" x4. The loops and scaffold dull momentum and flatten the closure image. Figurative density is high but coherent (fractal lattice, glowing threads, fractal tree).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The telepathy-pill-recall premise is widely used in speculative-fiction templates; the geode-as-diagnostic-tool twist offers a specific angle but does not transform the core through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The somatic-marker method and light-painting profession add texture, yet the experiment proceeds without friction or surprise. The fractal-tree image is evocative but not inevitable from prior causality. No bold risk or unconventional structure elevates the piece.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Lina is present throughout and makes the central decision to experiment, but "affectionate skeptic" functions as a label rather than a lived contradiction that creates a turn. Her skepticism softens without on-page cost or competing impulse dramatized in action.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The geode appears in beats 1 (pocket), 2 (on table), 3 (dust application & hum), and 4 (final image as fractal tree source). Its mica lattice enables the resonance experiment and charges the closure canvas. Swappability is moderate—a different crystal could serve similar function with edits—but the geode's fractal structure ties to the thematic architecture, lifting integration above mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The pill recall frames stakes (analyze nanotech feedback loops) and supplies the dust sample for the experiment. It does not constrain a choice or create a mid-scene complication; Lina faces no external pressure from the recall beyond her own curiosity. The concept is present and logically consistent but functionally swappable with any mysterious tech artifact.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Fractally precise" is used as descriptor for nanotech, mica layers, and architecture but does not enable or constrain an on-page action with cost. The label recurs frequently (six times) without tradeoff or tactical consequence; it reads as thematic ornament rather than a causal lever.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Devise a plan" appears explicitly and launches the experiment sequence (geode on table, vial placement, dust application). The devising itself is summary; the plan's execution occupies the middle. The action is present in two beats (conception and execution) and shapes the arc, but it could be replaced with "conduct" or "attempt" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Through somatic markers" is named twice (once in setup, once in execution) as the method by which Lina tracks resonance. The static-shock thumb mark is mentioned but does not alter tactics or create a complication. The method is present and logically consistent but does not drive a turn or constrain a choice; it functions as a label for the tracking process.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The light-painting studio provides concrete setting (chemicals, software, canvas, metal table) and enables the visualization of the resonance data via the software sketching patterns. It does not pressure a choice or force a resource trade-off. The studio's specificity (long-exposure canvases, acetone smell) grounds the action, and the software payoff in the ending lifts integration to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After the static shock" anchors the timeframe at the opening, and the shock's thumb mark is referenced as a somatic anchor. No ticking clock or temporal pressure narrows Lina's options; the experiment proceeds at her pace. The shock serves as inciting prompt but does not constrain later choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"To illuminate hidden pathways" is stated explicitly as Lina's goal and drives the experiment sequence. The motivation is single-strand research curiosity without competing wants (e.g., doubt vs. hope, caution vs. ambition) that create friction. No on-page cost (time, risk, doubt) tests the desire; it proceeds smoothly to the notebook and anticipated sharing.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Willowglass hope" is named four times and described as flickering, brightening, and made solid. The tone label recurs but does not modulate under pressure; Lina's emotional arc moves from skepticism to optimism without complication. The final image (fractal tree, swelling heart) asserts the tone rather than charging it through a pressured reversal or cost.</comment>
