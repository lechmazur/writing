<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to "resurrect the terminal" is declared but her interiority remains abstract—"stoic wonder," "puzzling out equations for hope"—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. The narrative summarizes her emotional arc ("she felt," "she realized") rather than dramatizing internal conflict under pressure. No other character is on the page until children briefly appear, so relationship and status bullets do not apply. The final walk-away suggests transformation, but the path from curiosity to fulfillment lacks visible cost or foreclosed alternatives.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece accumulates Mira's repairs (water, solar panels, sextant transmitter) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration: the terminal shifts from ruin to launchpad for community imagination. Orientation is clear early (abandoned terminal, post-carnival). However, the closure lacks felt cost—Mira "walks away" with no visible price paid, no option foreclosed, no trade-off dramatized on the page. The accumulative lens holds through the ending, but the final image ("already sketching the next set of flows") asserts renewal without undeniable pressure or sacrifice, weakening the closure unit.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The abandoned terminal is anchored early with concrete detail (cracked tiles, rusted pipes, dust-covered festival flyers). Mira's engineering actions (rerouting water, scavenging solar panels) integrate setting into her problem-solving, and the sextant's geometry constrains her transmitter design. However, the environment does not narrow her choices under pressure or charge the final image—she completes each task without setback, and the terminal functions as backdrop rather than crucible. Sensory detail remains selective and purposeful throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—resurrecting the terminal as a beacon of hope—is signaled early, but escalation is minimal: Mira encounters no obstacle, resource scarcity, or failure that tightens her options. Each repair succeeds on first attempt (water flows, lights glow, pulse resonates), and the children's arrival confirms success without complication. The accumulative lens allows for deepening via density increase, yet the story adds tasks in sequence without raising cost or narrowing paths. No reversal or tightening forecloses a live option, and the ending walks away from achieved success rather than a hard-won trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme of renewal emerges from Mira's repairs and the terminal's transformation, supported by the sextant motif (navigation, charting dreams). However, the final paragraphs state theme overtly: "Hope equals Flow times Purpose divided by Time," "a different kind of launchpad—one for imaginations." The ending offers no non-literal answer or resonant friction; instead it explains its own symbolism. The equation and "resurrect wonder" language read as prompt-label echo rather than earned insight from specific struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person limited on Mira; no head-hopping. Diction carries some perceptual signature ("maze of intentions," "quiet engine") that reflects her engineering mindset, and the narrative voice modulates with her mood. However, register drifts into elevated/abstract phrasing at emotional peaks ("stoic wonder," "apneic stillness," "soft thunder of tiny engines") that reads ornamental rather than character-particular. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she realized," "she knew") cluster in reflection without adding immediacy, and the prose leans on metaphor where concrete action would sharpen pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Clarity and grammar are clean; no major loops or causality breaks. Yet the prose carries template cadence: "She [verb]...She [verb]...She [verb]" runs through paragraphs 11–16 without variation, and several beats paraphrase the same content ("the terminal inhale," "reborn," "resurrecting wonder"). Figurative density is high without always advancing pressure: "soft thunder of tiny engines," "heart a quiet engine," "numbers sing of renewal." These patterns dull momentum in the middle third, though they do not obscure the closure image. Information density is moderate; many sentences do double duty, but scaffold phrases like "she decided," "she realized" pad transitions.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—engineer intern revives abandoned spaceport as community hub—follows a familiar arc: lone visionary transforms neglected space, inspiring children and rekindling hope. Mira's functional creativity and the "maze of intentions" metaphor add surface texture, but the emotional beats (discovery, wonder, fulfillment) track template stages without friction or surprise. The sextant's recurrence and the "equations for hope" tagline feel ornamental rather than transformation of trope. No bold risk or non-obvious synthesis; the story chooses safe, uplifting resolution without moral calculus or ambiguity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and her decisions (map pipes, reroute water, scavenge panels, connect sextant, invite children) drive each beat. However, most choices are sequential problem-solving without on-page friction or cost; curiosity leads to action but does not constrain or force trade-offs. She appears in the closure unit (final walk-away), but that moment asserts next steps rather than crystallizing a choice under pressure. Early signal and beat involvement are strong; causal pressure and closure linkage are weak.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The sextant piece appears in three beats: discovery (paragraph 5), use in transmitter calibration (paragraph 15), and final glass-case sealing (paragraph 26). However, its mechanics are asserted rather than dramatized—"using its precise geometry to calibrate" tells rather than shows constraint. The final sealing reframes it as "relic of navigation" but does not reweight prior stakes or charge the closure decision. Early signal and spaced beats are present; specificity and cost connection are minimal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Maze of intentions" appears once (paragraph 7) as extended metaphor ("each corridor a line of code...each gate a choice") and recurs obliquely in paragraph 21 ("maze of intentions now pulsed with laughter"). It functions as thematic label rather than shaping on-page choices—Mira does not navigate competing intentions or constrain paths through labyrinth logic. Swappable with "network of possibilities" or similar; does not alter tactics or closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Functionally creative" is declared in paragraph 8 ("Her mind was functionally creative, seeing not a ruin but a network of latent flows") but remains label-only. The attribute does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost; Mira's repairs succeed without trade-off between functional pragmatism and creative risk. The trait is consistent with her actions but could be replaced with "resourceful" or "inventive" without changing beats. No on-page friction or payoff tied to this exact phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Resurrect" anchors the dominant stake (paragraph 9: "decided to resurrect the terminal's purpose") and recurs in paragraph 20 ("resurrecting wonder") and paragraph 28 ("the next ruin to resurrect"). Each repair beat (water, power, pulse) enacts resurrection, and the ending reframes the terminal as reborn launchpad. However, the action succeeds without complication; Mira resurrects via accumulation rather than decisive turn. Early signal, beat involvement, and closure presence are strong; causal pressure (narrowing via failure or cost) is absent.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Redirected flows" is signaled in paragraph 8 ("network of latent flows...waiting to be redirected") and enacted in water reroute (paragraph 12), energy channeling (paragraph 14), and pulse transmission (paragraph 15). The method shapes her tactics across three beats and appears in the final formula (paragraph 23: "flow of people, water, light, and sound"). However, the mechanics are told rather than shown—no on-page constraint or trial-and-error. Beats involve the method but do not test its limits or force adaptation. Strong beat involvement; moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport terminal is established in the opening line and supplies spatial anchors (main concourse, central plaza, roof, gates) and resources (pipes, solar panels, announcement system) that Mira uses across multiple beats. The setting enables her repairs and hosts the children's workshop, shaping the closure image (terminal glowing as lantern). However, it does not pressure her choices—she encounters no locked doors, structural failures, or rival claims. Early signal, beat involvement, and closure presence are strong; constraint on tactics is weak.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"After the carnival leaves town" appears in the opening line and is referenced once more (paragraph 25: "The carnival had left, but its spirit...lingered"). The timeframe sets mood (post-event emptiness, popcorn scent) but does not create urgency or tighten decisions—Mira works at her own pace with no deadline, rival, or decay forcing choices. The carnival's departure is backdrop rather than active clock. Present in setup; absent from development and closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Mira's motivation "to puzzle out new equations for hope" is declared in paragraph 10 and recurs in paragraph 23 ("equations...not hidden in textbooks but written in the flow"). It frames her engineering as quest for meaning, but the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or costs. She pursues this goal without internal friction, failure, or sacrifice; each step confirms her vision. Early signal and thematic presence are solid; friction and cost are absent.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>"Stoic wonder" is named in paragraph 6 and paragraph 24, and the tone holds across beats: Mira observes ruins without despair, works without urgency, and invites children with quiet generosity. The prose maintains measured, elevated register throughout. However, the tone does not modulate under pressure—no escalation into frustration, doubt, or exhilaration—and the final image repeats the opening mood rather than reweighting it. Coherent and stable; does not charge the closure.</comment>
