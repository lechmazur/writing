<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist shows interior contradiction (scavenger versus dreamer ghost) and embodied emotion (stone in throat, fingers tracing cracks). However, the final transformation—"we have become collaborators"—feels asserted rather than earned through specific on-page choices that foreclose prior options. The ghost's gift of "a clear image of myself, unburdened" reads as convenient absolution without visible cost or sacrifice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens inferred as Accumulative/Textural: fragments accumulate until the ghost offers collaboration. Orientation anchors (carousel, lagoon, scavenger role) arrive early. The closure—"weaving my own narrative" and "negotiating peace"—constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost remains abstract; the text does not show what path is foreclosed or what specific price the protagonist pays for this peace.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon and frozen carousel create vivid atmosphere, and the camera wheel functions as a tactile anchor. However, the environment remains postcard-descriptive; the lagoon and carousel do not constrain choices or supply resources that alter the protagonist's tactics. The setting charges the final image but does not pressure the middle beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reconciling with the ghost of eroded ambitions—is signaled early. The discovery of the child's fragment ("The sky is a canvas...") provides one tightening moment, and the ghost's invitation offers a second. However, escalation relies on the ghost's arrival rather than protagonist agency, and the cost of accepting collaboration is told ("unburdened") rather than shown through a visible trade-off or forfeiture.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (weaving fragments into wholeness, negotiating with lost selves) emerges organically from the scavenging and ghost imagery. The ghost's line "You cannot undo what is eroded, but you can weave the fragments into a new vessel" flirts with explicit statement but remains grounded in the action. The final image—spinning the wheel to weave narrative—offers non-literal resonance, though the shift from haunting to collaboration feels slightly too tidy.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable and first-person interiority is distinct ("chronologically confused," "memories drifting like leaves"). Diction is purposefully lyric and compressed. The ghost's dialogue ("You cannot undo what is eroded...") reads as voice-motivated rather than expository. However, phrases like "a narrative of redemption" and "negotiating peace" drift toward abstract summary that slightly flattens the texture under peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and mostly coherent ("echoes of abandoned wishes," "stone in my throat"). However, several near-paraphrase loops appear: "fractured by the silence" / "fractured stillness," "fragments" / "shards" / "pieces" recur without reweighting, and "eroded ambitions" / "ambitions I had let erode" within short spans. Template stems ("I [verb]" openings) cluster in the middle third, reducing propulsion by ~−0.6.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The premise—scavenging overheard stories above a halted carousel to reconcile with one's ghost—offers a fresh synthesis of setting and motivation. The camera wheel as talisman and the shift from haunting to collaboration provide specific texture. However, the emotional arc (regret → acceptance → weaving wholeness) follows a familiar redemption template without a sharp turn or non-obvious moral calculus that would elevate ingenuity into the high band.</comment>
