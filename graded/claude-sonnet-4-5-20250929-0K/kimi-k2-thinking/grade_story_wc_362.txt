<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Seraphine's motivation is clear and her scientific methodology grounds her, but her interior life remains largely declarative. The shift from "proof" to "communion" is told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The final stance—needing "only to find the language that would let others hear"—arrives as assertion without the embodied cost of renouncing her original goal. Minor: "she must first become an object herself, porous and receiving" edges into metaphorical self-diagnosis that flattens pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when early and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered imagery (frost, prism, quartz) toward a final reconfiguration where Seraphine becomes "instrument" rather than discoverer. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing—"the discovery had made itself known through her"—that reweights her agency with felt cost (empty hands, transformed motivation). One minor causality slip: the condensation words "She was already gone before the impact" appear without clear mechanism, reading as convenient rather than earned by prior prism mechanics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The quartz arbor, mist, frost patterns, and abandoned Volvo are vivid and purposeful, filtering through Seraphine's scientific attention. The prism's warming and the frost's geometric spirals constrain her communion attempt and charge the final image of the arbor seeming "less solid." Spatial choreography is clean. The setting does not cap at 8.8 because while the prism and frost are handled across beats, the quartz arbor itself functions more as atmospheric backdrop than a constraint that alters a key choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving objects absorb emotions—is signaled early and tightens when Seraphine shifts from seeking proof to seeking communion, forecloses the scientist role with visible cost (empty hands, no conclusions in her report). However, the escalation is more thematic deepening than pressure-driven; no live antagonist or external resistance tests her commitment, and the key turn (placing the prism back) feels inevitable rather than forced by competing costs. The accumulative lens allows this, but the piece trends mid-band because agency is more receptive than decision-driven.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the prism/frost/quartz motif: attention as instrument, the limits of proof, memory as residue. The final lines—"the discovery had made itself known through her" and "the truthful lie was this: that she had discovered anything at all"—offer a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Minor penalty: "truthful lie" is named repeatedly in exposition (twice in final third), which risks thematic echo, though the paradox is enacted through her empty-handed certainty rather than merely stated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The prose carries a distinct, slightly elevated register ("shifted hush," "autonomic responses," "neural pathways") that fits Seraphine's scientific mystic persona. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("deception could reveal truth, that fiction could be more honest than fact") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. The narrative voice is confident and controlled but lacks the perceptual signature—selective, biased noticing—that would push it into the 8+ range.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in the prism-frost communion sequence. However, the piece carries pervasive template cadence in exposition: "The prism had belonged..." / "The prism grew warm..." / "The prism held no magic..." and paraphrase loops in the final third ("She no longer needed to prove... she needed only to find" restates the shift already shown). The frost-into-words beat ("She was already gone before the impact") is vivid but edges into convenient symbolism. Apply −0.6 for loops and stems; no closure-scene harm, so cap deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of mystic + scientist, quartz-as-recording-medium, and emotion-imprinted objects is specific and committed. The final paradox—discovery as passive reception—transforms the premise. However, the core frame (scientist tests fringe theory, finds ambiguous proof) is familiar, and the piece does not take structural or perspectival risks beyond its lyric-accumulative design. The "fourteen times before" setup and the convenient condensation message lean toward template beats. Within-band: no boldness bonus applies.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Seraphine's attentiveness drives the prism placement, the three-hour vigil, and the final decision to return the prism, shaping multiple beats. However, her choices are more receptive than decisive; she observes and records rather than forcing turns. The character is present across setup, middle communion, and closure, but agency reads as witness rather than protagonist who narrows options through conflict.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glass prism appears early (beneath the driver's seat), is handled in the communion sequence (angled to catch sun, grows warm, refracts colors), and returns in closure when Seraphine places it back, closing the loop. It enables the key turn (communion via refraction) and carries reweighted meaning (from proof-tool to autonomous conversant). Strong beat involvement and closure linkage; not quite indispensable because the frost patterns do much of the thematic work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Shifted hush" is named twice—once mid-story ("silence rearranged, the moment when emptiness becomes presence") and again in the final report description—but it functions as atmospheric label rather than a stake-shaping concept. It does not constrain choices or alter tactics; Seraphine's actions (placing prism, standing unmoving, photographing frost) would proceed identically without this phrase. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Firmly grounded" is asserted early ("despite her esoteric methods; she recorded every variable") and shown through her instrument readings and refusal to let speculation outpace data. It reappears in the closing frame ("firmly grounded in method"). However, the trait does not constrain a choice with visible cost; her grounding coexists with mysticism without friction. Functional label that colors voice but does not drive a beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Commune" is the climactic action: Seraphine communes with stored memory through prism/frost for three hours, yielding the condensation-words and her motivational shift. The action is present in setup (implied by "theory that objects absorb emotions"), executed in the middle, and reweighted at closure ("their ongoing conversation"). It drives one major turn but could be rephrased as "interpret" or "witness" with minor edits, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The frost-pattern method is seeded early (frost on greenhouse windows, frost mapping grief), executed in the communion beat (prism angled against frozen glass, colors refract into patterns), and returns in the condensation-words moment. It enables the communion action and charges the final image (frost will return tomorrow). Present across all three gates and shapes the central beat, but the prism does more mechanical work; the frost is more medium than method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The quartz arbor structures the entire piece: it houses the laboratory, provides the recording medium (quartz as "a page"), inhales mist in spirals during communion, and becomes "less solid" at closure. It is present in all three gates and subtly pressures Seraphine's theory (legend that mist preserves memory). The setting constrains method (she must work where quartz and car coexist) and charges the ending. Strong integration; not quite indispensable because the prism and frost carry more causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"When assumptions shatter" appears in the opening as a temporal anchor ("On the morning when assumptions shatter") but does not function as a tightening timeframe. No clock pressures Seraphine's choices; the three-hour vigil is duration without urgency. The phrase reappears implicitly at closure (her assumptions about proof/communion reverse), giving it a lyric reprise, but it does not shape tactics. Functional as thematic marker; replaceable as time constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation to prove objects absorb emotions is established early, tested across fourteen prior failures, and drives the prism experiment. It is reweighted at closure when Seraphine shifts from needing proof to needing "the language that would let others hear." Present in all three gates and causally active in middle and end. However, the friction between proof and communion is told more than dramatized through competing costs in scene, limiting the felt price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Truthful lies" is named explicitly twice in the final third ("This was the truthful lie at the heart of her work" and "The truthful lie was this") and enacted through the prism-has-no-magic / yet-produces-undeniable-results paradox. The tone modulates from scientific observation to mystic communion to paradoxical certainty, coherent across turns. However, the explicit naming in exposition undercuts the tonal work; the piece tells the paradox rather than letting it resonate implicitly, and the label arrives late (after 60% mark).</comment>
