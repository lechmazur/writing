<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael's initial survival and wound establish stakes, but his interior life is rendered through stock phrasing ("newfound clarity," "quiet resolve") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The discovery of the father's furnace and inheritance feels declared rather than earned through micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Agency at closure—shaping the glass vessel—reads as solitary craft without visible cost or a path foreclosed; the walk toward horizon with "luminous shard" and "quiet promise" substitutes lyric assertion for embodied consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (canyon, glass artist, recent attack) arrive early. The piece attempts a two-shard accumulative structure: canyon discovery → workshop return, but the closure lacks visible cost—Kael walks out with ledger, shard, and resolve intact, no option foreclosed on the page. The frost-as-map and furnace discovery feel convenient rather than motivated by prior choices. Under an Accumulative lens, the final vessel creation and departure should reweight the dominant stake (survival vs. vengeance vs. inheritance), but the ending offers parallel satisfaction without a decisive tightening or felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The canyon under stars, frost patterns, and father's furnace are vivid and anchored early. The frost constraining Kael's path (matching ledger numbers, guiding steps into the chamber) and the warm furnace enabling glass-shaping elevate this toward the 7-band, but the final act—melting the shard, shaping the vessel—lacks tactile specificity in how tool, temperature, or material properties constrain his choices. Sensory detail is present but leans visual; the "dew-kissed grass" and "soft amber" sky remain postcard description rather than pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (survival from smugglers vs. discovering father's legacy) is signaled early, but the piece never forces a trade-off between them. The frost-map discovery and furnace visit feel like serial reveals rather than escalating pressure; Kael's decision to create the glass vessel and leave with both ledger and shard avoids foreclosing a path. One tightening moment—realizing "his father's legacy was not in the charcoal trade, but in the glass"—reweights understanding but does not alter tactics or narrow options with visible cost on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme (purpose in pauses, resilience/light vs. darkness) emerges from the glass artistry and canyon setting, and the vessel creation offers a concrete embodiment. However, the final paragraphs lean toward thematic echo: "his story would shine on," "beacon of truth," "drifting resonance...purpose could be forged" approach summary statement rather than letting the image resonate. The "scorched testament" as call-to-action and the vessel as "testament to resilience" are close to symbolic convenience, introduced late and harvested for theme without deep character friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Kael. Perceptual signature is present but generic: "luminous," "drifting resonance," "quiet resolve" recur without character-specific idiom. The prose carries elevated diction throughout ("luminous echo of his own artistry," "quiet canvas for creation") that fits a lyric mode but does not modulate under pressure—early canyon reflection and final workshop resolve share identical register. No dialogue. Purposeful compression is attempted in the two-shard structure, but filter verbs and summary statements ("He understood," "Kael felt," "He knew") dull immediacy in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Template cadence and paraphrase loops pervade: "The canyon remained quiet, the stars above echoing his quiet resolve" / "quiet canyon under stars" / "In the quiet of his workshop"; "luminous glass artist" appears four times, "drifting resonance" three times, "scorched testament" four times without reweighted meaning each mention. Sentence stems repeat: "He [verb]" openings cluster in the final third. Stock phrases—"newfound clarity," "beacon of truth," "testament to resilience"—appear in closure beats, dulling specificity. The frost-to-ledger code and vessel-shaping lack concrete procedural detail, relying on summary ("shaped it into a vessel") rather than showing hand, heat, or material resistance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The glass artist + charcoal smuggling premise and the frost-as-map twist offer modest freshness, but the inheritance-in-hidden-furnace and artist-as-beacon-of-truth arc follow familiar templates. The emotional progression—survival → discovery → resolve to expose crime through art—is linear and unambiguous, avoiding the messy calculus of whether to flee, destroy the ledger, or confront the smugglers directly. The vessel creation, while thematically apt, arrives as symbolic closure rather than a risky choice with visible tradeoff. Specificity in glass technique or charcoal-trade mechanics could elevate; as written, the core turns feel median rather than inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael is present throughout and makes two key choices: following the frost-map into the chamber and shaping the vessel. These drive the structure but feel serial rather than escalating. His final decision to walk out with ledger and vessel, "prepared to face them," declares intent without on-page cost or tactic shift. Early presence and two beats place this in the 5–6 range; lack of visible tradeoff and swappability (another artisan role could function similarly) cap it below 7.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The ledger strip is introduced early (second paragraph), mentioned in the discovery beat ("folded safely," "weight of responsibility"), and carried in the final departure. It does not constrain a mid-scene choice or evolve in use—Kael never decodes it on-page, and the frost-map functions independently. Present in three touches (pocket, realization, coat), but its role is static: a MacGuffin that justifies the hunt without altering tactics or charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Scorched testament" (father's burnt will) appears early, frames the inheritance stake, and reappears in the vessel-shaping paragraph as "testament to the scorched testament." It enables the hidden-furnace discovery and Kael's thematic pivot from vengeance to legacy. Three beats (ashes, realization, vessel) and closure linkage push this toward the 6-band, but the "testament to the scorched testament" line leans meta rather than causal. The concept shapes stakes but does not constrain a choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Steadily adaptive" is labeled twice: "He was steadily adaptive, letting the melting ice reshape his understanding" and "steadily adaptive, ready to retrace a path." The trait is told rather than enacted—Kael's plan (follow frost, shape glass, depart) proceeds without setback or revision. No on-page moment shows him adapting tactics under pressure or trading off one approach for another. Label-only, no visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Retrace" is signaled early ("He needed to retrace his steps...how they had found his hidden workshop") and recurs in the final paragraph ("ready to retrace a path illuminated by frost"). The action motivates the canyon exploration, but the story does not show Kael retracing steps—instead he follows the frost-map forward into a new chamber. The stated goal and the executed action diverge; the verb is present but does not define the major turn (discovering the furnace). Functional but replaceable with "follow" or "pursue."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Frost patterns appear in paragraph 13, match the ledger numbers (paragraph 15), guide Kael's steps (paragraph 19), and their imprint "remained in his mind's eye" in the final third, shaping his glass designs. Four beats (appearance, code, guide, design template) and closure linkage place this solidly in the 6–7 range. The mechanics—how frost encodes ledger numbers—remain vague, limiting irreplaceability, but the method drives the discovery and charges the final vessel.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The canyon is established early and supplies the frost-map, hidden chamber, and father's furnace—resources that enable the discovery arc. It also provides cover from smugglers (implicit constraint). The setting participates in three structural beats (escape, map, furnace) and the final departure, but the "quiet canyon under stars" functions more as backdrop than micro-constraint on Kael's choices. No moment where canyon terrain forces a tactical tradeoff or alters the closure image directly.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"After surviving the attempt" anchors the opening, and "just hours earlier" plus the throbbing wound establish immediacy. However, the timeframe dissolves: "As dawn approached" signals one night, yet Kael explores the canyon, finds the chamber, melts and shapes glass (a process requiring hours), and departs at sunrise without time-pressure affecting his choices. The clock is declared but not tracked or used to tighten decisions. Setup only; no middle or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Discover purpose in the pauses" is stated in paragraph 11, restated in paragraph 27 ("found his purpose in the pauses"), and echoed in the final line. The desire is told rather than dramatized—Kael's choices (follow frost, shape vessel, depart) proceed without friction between wanting purpose and other costs (safety, time, resources). The motivation labels the theme but does not create on-page conflict or a visible tradeoff at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Drifting resonance" is introduced in paragraph 17, recurs in paragraphs 23 and 33, and is woven into the final image ("drifting resonance...followed him"). The tone is coherent and lyric throughout, modulating slightly from survival-urgency (early wound description) to contemplative resolve (final departure). It supports the accumulative design and charges the ending with a recurring phrase, but the single-register lyricism does not shift under peak pressure (discovery, creation). Present across structure and ending; fits but does not intensify meaningfully.</comment>
