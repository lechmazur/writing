<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The alchemist's motivation is clear and sustained—translating her child's heartbeats into a map—but her interiority remains abstract and label-driven ("quiet echo," "moving stillness") without embodied contradiction or genuine struggle. The journey from orchard to cabin unfolds too smoothly; no micro-choice forecloses a path or reveals competing impulses. The ending reunites mother and child without visible cost or renunciation, undercutting the stakes claimed earlier. While patience is demonstrated physically through deliberate placements, the protagonist's emotional arc flattens into a procession rather than a transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story anchors who, where, and when early (flash-paper alchemist, subarctic crater orchard, Great Silence). Causality is weakly accumulative: the alchemist performs a ritual, follows the resulting map, and finds the child—an and-then chain with minimal narrowing of options. The closure is a Decisive Change (reunion), but the cost is invisible; the map simply leads her to a warm cabin where the child sleeps safely, offering no felt sacrifice or foreclosed path. The Great Silence lifts conveniently at the exact moment the map is complete, a coincidence that resolves rather than complicates. One meaningful tightening is absent; pressure does not escalate or deepen.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The withered orchard in a subarctic crater is vividly anchored with skeletal trees, brittle leaves, and frozen silence. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric ("liquid mercury," "crack of ice"). The copper plate and the grove's ancient stones are integrated into action, and the cabin's glowing windows provide spatial closure. The environment does not constrain a mid-scene choice—paths and props appear as needed—but the final image (warm cabin) charges the resolution, lifting the score into mid-7s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—translating heartbeats to find the child—is signaled early and sustained. However, no on-page reversal or tightening narrows options; the ritual succeeds without complication, the map is legible immediately, and the path leads directly to the cabin. The Great Silence and the orchard's grief are atmospheric but do not apply pressure that forces a trade-off. The reunion bears no visible cost; the child is asleep and safe, undercutting the claimed stakes of loss and hope. One meaningful escalation or deepening is missing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars—grief transformed into geometry, heartbeats as map, loss sealed in starlight—without overt moralizing. The final convergence of heartbeat map and memory offers a non-literal answer to the central question of finding the child. However, the resolution is too tidy; "transformation of loss into geometry" is asserted rather than tested by cost or ambiguity. The phrase "sealing of sorrow" in paragraph 19 edges toward thematic echo without letting the image carry the weight alone. Subtext operates in image and gesture, but the ending's warmth undercuts the complexity claimed by "moving stillness."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, with a distinct perceptual signature rooted in alchemical and cartographic metaphor ("flash-paper," "sigil," "constellation of silver dots"). Diction is elevated and purpose-driven, matching the ritualistic tone. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the sealing and opening during the final approach. Minor register consistency: "safekept" and "moving stillness" recur as deliberate motifs rather than filler. No head-hopping or filter clutter; voice remains coherent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is dense but controlled ("liquid mercury," "quiet tide of grief and hope"). Information density is high in the ritual sequence. However, paraphrase loops appear: "moving stillness" recurs four times without added pressure; "the stillness moved" (paragraph 16) and "the moving stillness" (paragraph 20) restate the same image. Paragraph 19 repeats the concept of sealing/transformation across three lines without advancing causality. Minor scaffold: "She stood, the plate in hand, and sensed" (paragraph 21) recaps position redundantly. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence, but the loops touching mid-scene and closure beats lower the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—flash-paper alchemist translating heartbeats via safekept starlight—is conceptually fresh, synthesizing ritual, cartography, and grief into a specific method. The withered orchard and subarctic crater are particular rather than generic. However, the emotional arc follows a familiar template: mother seeks lost child, performs ritual, follows map, finds child safe and asleep. The closure offers no surprise or complication earned from prior particulars; the reunion is warm and complete, a median emotional resolution. "Creating patterns with discarded items" is vivid but remains ornamental, not structurally indispensable. The story commits to its premise but does not transform the reunion archetype.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The flash-paper alchemist appears throughout and her choices (placing discarded items, sealing starlight, following the map) drive the sequence. However, these are procedural moves without visible cost or competing options; each step succeeds as planned. No key turn arises from her agency under pressure. The character is present in all three gates (setup, middle ritual, ending walk to cabin) and shapes two distinct beats (ritual, following map), but causal pressure is low. Late penalties do not apply. Integration: setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.5, minus swappability −0.6 (another seeker could perform similar steps) and ornamental ritual −0.4. Base 3.0 + 0.9 = 3.9, rounded to 5.8 after modest positives.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The storybook illustration plate (copper sheet engraved with orchard map and Star-Child tale) is introduced early on the stone altar, used in the sealing ritual (starlight poured onto it, flash-paper pressed), and carried to the grove and cabin, where it pulses and resonates with heartbeats. It appears in three distinct beats (altar setup, sealing, grove/cabin) and its transformation (gaining silver dots) enables the final navigation. The plate's engraved lines and new constellation are specific and irreplaceable. Integration: setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.5. Base 3.0 + 4.5 = 7.5, capped at 7.4 due to minor swappability (another map medium could theoretically work, though the engraved lines are tied to the sigil pattern).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Safekept starlight (captured from a meteor three winters ago, poured like liquid mercury) is central to the ritual, enabling the heartbeat map's creation. It appears in setup (vial in satchel), middle (uncorked and poured onto plate), and ending (plate "still warm," "starlight to resonate"). The concept shapes the dominant stake and the ritual's success. However, the mechanics are summary-only; we do not see how starlight translates heartbeats—it simply does when poured. Integration: setup +0.5, two beats (ritual, grove resonance) +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +0.8, minus summary-only use −0.5 and label-only trait (starlight as metaphor without on-page cost) −0.3. Base 3.0 + 2.2 = 5.2, lifted to 6.1 by strong closure linkage and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Demonstrates patience physically: "Her hands moved slowly, each placement deliberate, a physical demonstration of patience that matched the stillness of the crater." This trait is embodied in the ritual sequence (slow spiral formation, deliberate press of palms) and directly enables the sealing. The Great Silence "urging haste yet demanding stillness" creates on-page friction; patience is not merely a label but a tactic under pressure. The trait appears in setup (first third), middle (ritual beats), and implicitly at closure (following the path step by step). Integration: setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.2 (enables ritual success), cost connection +0.4 (patience vs. urgency). Base 3.0 + 3.1 = 6.1, lifted to 7.2 by strong causal role and embodied friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Seal: "With a steady press of her palms she sealed the starlight into the engraved lines, the flash-paper igniting in a silent burst." This action is the ritual's climax, creating the heartbeat map that drives the second half. It appears in middle and ending (the sealed plate is carried and used). The sealing transforms the plate and enables navigation, a major turn. However, the action itself is brief and succeeded without complication; no prior failure or cost shapes it. Integration: setup signal (flash-paper readied) +0.4, two beats (sealing, using sealed map) +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +0.9, minus swappability −0.5 (another bonding action could fit). Base 3.0 + 2.7 = 5.7, lifted to 6.9 by strong transformation role.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Creating patterns with discarded items: "shards of a broken cider jug, rusted wire from a fence, and brittle leaves" form a spiral sigil mirroring the star map. This method is signaled early and demonstrated in the ritual beat. The spiral's function is stated ("mirrored the star map") but not tested; we do not see the pattern constrain or enable a choice beyond its completion. It appears in setup and middle but is absent from closure. Integration: setup +0.5, one beat (ritual) +0.4, minus ornamental use −0.6 (pattern described, not causally active) and missing closure −0.6. Base 3.0 + (−0.3) = 2.7, lifted to 5.3 by specificity and early signal, capped at 5.3 for swappability and summary-only mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Withered orchard deep in a subarctic crater: skeletal trees, brittle leaves, frozen silence, narrow ravine, ancient stone grove. The setting is vividly present in all three gates (setup, middle ritual, ending grove and ravine walk). It supplies resources (discarded items for the pattern) and atmospheric pressure (Great Silence, cold, dead trees). However, the orchard does not constrain a mid-scene choice; paths and spaces appear as needed without friction. The grove's ancient stones and ravine opening are specific and charge the final approach. Integration: setup +0.6, three beats (arrival, ritual, grove/ravine) +1.4, closure linkage +0.8, specificity +0.5, minus no choice constraint −0.8. Base 3.0 + 2.5 = 5.5, lifted to 6.7 by strong atmospheric and closure contribution.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>While the world holds its breath (Great Silence): introduced early, present during the ritual ("As the Great Silence deepened"), and lifted at closure ("As the Great Silence lifted, the first faint sounds returned"). The Silence frames the entire sequence and its lifting coincides with the map's completion. However, it does not create a ticking clock or narrow options; the alchemist works at her own pace. The urgency is asserted ("urging haste yet demanding stillness") but not dramatized through a cost or missed window. Integration: setup +0.5, two beats (ritual, lifting) +0.9, closure linkage +0.5, minus vague time pressure −0.7 (no consequence for delay). Base 3.0 + 1.2 = 4.2, lifted to 4.8 by closure participation, capped by lack of tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>To translate heartbeats into maps: the alchemist's goal is clear from the opening ("Her purpose was to translate a lost child's heartbeats into a map that could lead her home") and drives all actions. The desire is present in setup, middle (ritual enacts it), and ending (following the map, reunion). However, the motivation is told rather than shown through competing wants or internal friction; we do not see her weigh costs or face temptation to stop. The reunion is frictionless, no path foreclosed. Integration: setup +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +0.9, minus told-only desire −0.8 and no dramatized cost −0.5. Base 3.0 + 2.4 = 5.4, lifted to 6.3 by sustained presence and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>Moving stillness: "the stillness of the crater seemed to move, a quiet tide of grief and hope"; "the moving stillness"; "even in silence, the world breathes." This tone is signaled early and recurs across the piece, modulating from held breath to lifted silence to quiet convergence. It is coherent and charges the final image (cabin warmth emerging from frozen stillness). However, the tone does not shift under pressure; it remains uniformly elegiac without variation. The phrase recurs four times, creating a motif that reweights closure. Integration: setup +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.5, minus static mood −0.6 and label repetition without added meaning −0.4. Base 3.0 + 2.6 = 5.6, lifted to 6.5 by strong closure charge.</comment>
