<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation to honor overlooked histories is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Interior processing relies heavily on abstract phrasing ("weight of untold histories," "eternal instant") that doesn't land as embodied emotion under pressure. The final choice to become "the keeper of their light" reads as epiphany rather than a decision forged from prior struggle with visible cost. Micro-choices throughout feel more observational than pressured, with the fragment guiding rather than the translator wrestling with competing wants.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation (market, translator, fragment) within the opening third and follows an accumulative lens: fragment → painting → journal → realization. However, the core "unfastening" beat (tracing the outline, finding the latch) occurs without prior setup of the mechanism or any failed attempt, reducing causal grounding. The closure reads as Conceptual Repricing (the translator becomes keeper), but the cost—placing the fragment back, walking on—feels more symbolic than felt; no live option is visibly foreclosed on the page. The accumulative design holds but the ending reconfigures meaning through assertion rather than a pressure-charged image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The alchemist's market—rope bridges, swaying stalls, sulfur and spice—anchors early and returns at closure ("market swayed in the wind"). The lighthouse lens fragment constrains the translator's choices (running thumb over it triggers memory, holding it to canvas reveals hidden figure) and charges the final pocket image. Spatial choreography remains mostly clear (market → stall → canvas corner → descent), though the painting's exact location and the alchemist's proximity shift without anchoring movement. Sensory detail is vivid but occasionally generic ("scent of salt," "storm-tossed coast").</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—honoring overlooked histories—is declared early but doesn't face meaningful on-page opposition or trade-off. The sequence proceeds smoothly: find fragment → see painting → open canvas → read journal → understand purpose. No reversal or tightening narrows options; the fragment "urges," the canvas "swings open," and the journal "waits." The final act of placing the fragment back reads as tribute rather than renunciation with felt cost. Under the accumulative lens, one deepening occurs (translator becomes keeper), but escalation lacks friction or a price that alters later tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme of honoring overlooked histories emerges through the lens fragment, Elias Thorne's journal, and the translator's vow to "become the keeper of their light." However, the final lines state the theme overtly ("honoring overlooked histories meant not just preserving names, but also becoming the keeper") rather than letting the image resonate. The lighthouse-as-language motif recurs but doesn't constrain choice or shift meaning under pressure—it decorates rather than complicates. The ending offers a clear thematic answer but leans toward summary over earned subtext.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable first-person throughout with consistent psychic distance. The voice carries a lyric, market-inflected texture ("elusively tangible," "between-worlds translator," "whisper-soft click") that fits the alchemist-market milieu. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("eternal instant," "anchors of intuition") that feels prompt-adjacent rather than organically voice-driven. The alchemist's brief dialogue ("such anchors...formed only when a keeper's will imprints") reads more expository than goal-driven. Perceptual signature is present (memory, salt, grandmother's voice) but not deeply particularized under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops appear: "eternal instant" recurs five times without functional variation; "elusively tangible" is restated as "shift from cool stone to warm glass"; "honoring overlooked histories" is rephrased across three paragraphs. Template cadence pervades the final third: "I realized / I felt / I closed / I placed / I thought / I slipped / I became" stacks identical sentence stems without rhythm variation. The figurative language ("flicker of memory surged," "weight of an eternal instant," "heartbeat of memory") clusters densely in high-pressure beats, reducing clarity. Pronoun reference remains clean and no major grammar errors, but momentum drags under synonym churn and scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The alchemist's market above rooftops and the between-worlds translator offer a fresh frame, and the lighthouse lens as memory anchor is a specific synthesis. However, the core sequence—find artifact, decode hidden message, inherit purpose—follows a familiar pattern without transformation through unexpected cost or moral calculus. The fragment's mechanics (touch → memory → reveal) are introduced and resolved in a single pass with no complication. Emotional beats (grandmother's voice, keeper's promise) lean on stock evocations of memory and inheritance rather than lived, particular detail that makes the choice feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The translator appears early and frames the market walk, but most key turns are triggered by the fragment rather than the translator's decisions. The choice to honor the keeper by placing the fragment back and continuing as "bridge between the forgotten and the living" is declared in the final third without prior friction. Functional role, but the character's agency doesn't drive reversals.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The fragment is handled in four beats: protagonist runs thumb over it (memory surge), holds it to canvas (figure clarity), reads about its hiding (Elias's act), and slips it into pocket (walks on). It shapes two middle choices (examining canvas, reading journal) and charges the final image. Early signal, middle development, and closure presence all met, with causal pressure in the canvas reveal. Specificity is moderate—"anchor of intuition" properties matter but remain somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Anchors of intuition" is named by the alchemist and echoed thematically ("anchored my intuition to a history"), but it doesn't constrain on-page tactics—the fragment works smoothly without requiring the translator to navigate competing intuitions or test the anchor's limits. Present and consistent, but more thematic echo than stake-shaping force.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Elusively tangible" is used as a descriptor for the fragment in three lines ("shimmered between solid and sigh," "shift from cool stone to warm glass"), but the quality doesn't enable or constrain an action with visible cost. The trait is told rather than tested—nothing fails or succeeds because of its elusive nature. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Unfasten" appears twice with specific function: tracing the outline / latch beneath pigment / "whisper-soft click" opens the canvas to reveal the journal. This turn is essential to accessing Elias's story and drives the middle beat. However, the action is introduced without prior setup (no earlier mention of hidden seals or unfastening as a method), reducing its integration. Present in middle and thematically reprised at end ("unfastened a secret"), but late first concrete use limits score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Hidden details in paintings are signaled early ("Through hidden details in paintings, the alchemist had taught me") and the method shapes the key middle beat: holding the fragment to the canvas reveals the keeper's outline and unlocks the journal. The mechanics matter once but are introduced just before use, reducing early integration. Functional in one major beat with closure echo, but not developed across attempts.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The market is established in the opening paragraph (rope bridges, swaying stalls, sulfur and spice) and returns at closure ("market swayed in the wind"). It supplies the fragment and alchemist, shaping the inciting choice, and the descent/bustle below provides spatial grounding for the final walk. The setting doesn't constrain tactics during the key unfastening beat (canvas corner is generic), but it frames and charges the ending. Early, final, and thematic—moderate causal role.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Between childhood and now" is invoked four times as a thematic phrase but never functions as a ticking clock or decision pressure. The timeframe anchors the grandmother's memory and the lighthouse's witness, yet no urgency or countdown alters the translator's choices on the page. Vague span; no tracked pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to honor overlooked histories" is declared early ("My own motivation rose like a tide") and drives the decision to examine the fragment and pursue Elias's story. However, it's never tested against a competing want or cost—no friction between honoring the past and present obligations. The final vow ("I realized that honoring...meant becoming the keeper") restates rather than dramatizes the desire. Present and causally linked to one choice, but told more than conflicted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Eternal instant" appears five times, creating a recurring tonal marker of suspended time and memory convergence. The tone remains lyric and contemplative throughout without modulating under pressure—early market wonder and final realization share identical register. The phrase charges the thematic layer but doesn't shift with escalation. Coherent static mood with thematic reprise; mid-band for consistency without pressure-driven modulation.</comment>
