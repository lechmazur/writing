<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The protagonist's claustrophobia is stated but not embodied in contradictory impulses that create scene-level friction. Her collecting behavior appears as a series of declarative actions rather than choices under competing pressures. The father remains a function rather than a presence who complicates her stance. Interior voice leans on abstract labels ("flavor of stillness," "stretched knot") rather than concrete sensory particulars that would ground her psychological state.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The gravity-inversion premise arrives without prior constraint or cost, functioning as a convenience gate rather than earned escalation. Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration ("prison could hold a garden") but the cost remains asserted rather than dramatized—no visible forfeiture or path foreclosed on the page. The accumulative lens is suggested by the silence-collection motif, yet the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure; it summarizes theme. Orientation is delayed past 120 words without teaching a pattern that pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The bunker's concrete walls and porcelain doll provide tactile anchors, and the xenial trellis offers spatial specificity during the inversion hour. However, the gilded hush and silence flavors remain abstract; no sensory hierarchy filters detail through the protagonist's claustrophobic urgency. The trellis does not constrain a choice—it is climbed without obstacle—and the doll's "silvery threads" are declared invisible, reducing their capacity to charge the final image with concrete cost.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (collecting silences to ease claustrophobia) is signaled but never tested by a choice that narrows options or imposes visible cost. The gravity inversion grants access without friction; no loss or trade-off alters her tactics. The final assertion that "even a prison could hold a garden" offers thematic summary rather than a turn earned by protagonist agency. Escalation reads as spatial relocation (bunker → trellis → bunker) rather than pressure that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme (confinement vs. liberation, silence as refuge) emerges from the premise but resolves into a tidy moral stated in the final line. The porcelain doll and silence motifs recur but do not accumulate contradictory pressure or reweight prior material; they function as tokens. The ending epiphany ("prison could hold a garden") is asserted rather than dramatized through a non-literal image with felt cost, lowering thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable in third-person limited, and diction ("intangibly tangible," "stretched knot") attempts a lyric texture. However, abstract phrasing dominates peak beats where concrete sensory particulars would sharpen pressure. The father and protagonist lack distinct speech patterns; no dialogue appears to test voice differentiation. Perceptual signature is present (silence-tasting) but mechanically repeated without modulation under stress, and the phrase "intangibly tangible" contradicts itself without purposeful ambiguity that charges the closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence appear frequently: "She tasted the silence of the morning, the silence of the night, the silence of the inverted hour" exemplifies list-structure repetition without added pressure. Mixed metaphors ("flavor of stillness," "symphony of hush") and abstract modifiers ("gilded hush," "stretched knot") recur in high-stakes beats, reducing clarity. The final paragraph stacks declarative summaries rather than propelling toward a concrete closure image. Baseline deductions: paraphrase loops −0.4, template cadence −0.5, abstract diction in peak beats −0.4.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The gravity-inversion mechanic offers a speculative frame, and the silence-collection conceit provides a fresh angle on sensory experience. However, the emotional arc (claustrophobic child finds freedom) follows a familiar template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The porcelain doll and trellis function as genre furniture rather than irreplaceable elements that shape the turn. The ending's garden-in-prison metaphor is anticipated rather than earned in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The child is present throughout and her collecting behavior frames the narrative, satisfying setup and closure. However, her actions are declarative rather than decision-driven; she climbs the trellis without obstacle or cost, and no choice narrows options. Development involvement is weak—no middle beat where her claustrophobia constrains or complicates tactics. Adjustments: setup +0.3, closure mention +0.4, swappability −0.6, ornamental beats −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The doll appears early (behind a rusted pipe), is handled in the trellis climb, and glimmers in the final paragraph, satisfying all three gates. It enables the silence-collection mechanic and receives specific treatment (silvery threads, sealed glass case). However, its properties do not constrain a choice with visible cost; it functions as a vessel rather than an active pressure point. Adjustments: setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, causal pressure +0.4, swappability −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Gilded hush is mentioned in the opening and final third but does not shape stakes or alter tactics on the page. It remains a thematic label rather than a mechanic that constrains choice or enables action. Setup is present, but middle development and closure participation are ornamental—no beat where the hush's gilded quality changes options. Adjustments: setup +0.3, label-only −0.6, missing development gate (cap 3.4).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Intangibly tangible appears twice as a descriptor of the doll but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. The phrase is contradictory without purposeful ambiguity that alters a beat. It functions as abstract texture rather than a trait with mechanical consequence. Adjustments: setup +0.2, label-only −0.6, missing all gates (cap 2.8).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sprouting appears in three contexts: the doll's threads, the imagined seed, and the secret garden metaphor. Setup occurs early, middle beats involve the doll sprouting threads at the trellis, and the final image references sprouting. However, the action is largely metaphorical; no major turn traces causally to a sprout-driven choice. Adjustments: setup +0.4, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.6, causal pressure +0.3, summary-only −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Limiting exposure is signaled early (doll behind pipe, sealed bunker), shapes the middle beat (sealed glass case), and appears in the penultimate paragraph. The method provides a mechanical logic for preserving silence flavors and constrains her tactics (she must seal the doll). Adjustments: setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, causal pressure +0.8, cost connection +0.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The trellis is introduced at the gravity inversion, climbed in the middle, and referenced in the final image. It provides access to high-altitude silence but does not constrain her choice—no obstacle or cost during the climb. Setup is delayed to second third. Adjustments: late arrival −0.3, one beat +0.4, closure mention +0.4, causal pressure +0.2, ornamental climb −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The one-hour inversion is stated, shapes the trellis-climb beat, and recurs as a future promise in the ending. The timeframe provides a mechanical gate (access window) but does not tighten decisions—no clock pressure or trade-off during the hour. Adjustments: setup +0.4, one beat +0.4, closure linkage +0.5, causal pressure +0.3, missing live-clock tension −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The desire to collect silences is stated early, pursued in multiple beats (ventilation shaft, trellis, morning/night), and affirmed in the ending. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants; no friction arises between her collecting urge and a competing cost. Adjustments: setup +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.7, causal pressure +0.5, told-only friction −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Stretching/contracted appears in "stretched muscle," "stretched knot," and "stretching, contracted moment" across the narrative. The tone attempts a compression of opposing states but applies mechanically rather than modulating with pressure. The final image does not charge the tone with new cost; it repeats the paradox. Adjustments: setup +0.3, three mentions +0.6, closure mention +0.4, static mood −0.5, label-only treatment −0.4.</comment>
