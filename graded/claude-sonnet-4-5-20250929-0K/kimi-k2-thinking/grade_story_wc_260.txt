<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Elara's interiority is concrete and character-particular—her shame is embodied through trembling fingers, and her pivot from complicity to accountability tracks through micro-choices (feeding brochures to the stove, drafting a new mission statement). Internal contradiction surfaces when self-respect conflicts with the urge to rebuild immediately, and her decision to call the wildlife officer costs her dignity on the page. Minor slip: the gecko and turtle receive summary care rather than dramatized choices, slightly diluting the earned arc, but the chameleon work anchors the transformation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors by the second paragraph (workshop, Elara, post-fraud timeline). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered actions (burning brochures, tending Veridian's tail, drafting the statement, calling the officer) that deepen Elara's stance crystallization. Closure lands as Charged Poise—she opens the door to the officer carrying "the shimmering stillness of the night's work," a reconfiguration of her relationship to honesty and dignity with the cost (public shame, legal consequences) made undeniable. One meaningful tightening occurs when she decides to request keeping the animals, narrowing her options and foreclosing retreat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The workshop is vividly anchored (fogged windows, cedar shavings, jasmine) and micro-setting elements constrain choices: the amber jar of salve enables the tail-tip care, the wood stove consumes the fraudulent brochures, and the enclosures structure her sequence of attention. Sensory hierarchy reflects her professional priorities (texture of scales, pulse under her thumb). The gravel road car arrival tightens the temporal frame and charges the final image, ensuring the setting participates in closure rather than merely decorating it.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Elara's self-respect versus compassion for the animals) is signaled early and escalates through her choices: burning lies, tending Veridian's injury, drafting honest mission language, and calling the officer. The tightening occurs when she decides to face public shame while requesting custody—a trade-off with visible cost (legal exposure, reputation loss). Agency is decision and renunciation (she forecloses the option of hiding or fleeing), and the cost is legible on the page when she hears the car and steadies herself to tell "the whole truth."</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme (fragility of conviction, reconstruction through honest care) emerges organically from Elara's actions and the chameleon's healing tail. The story resists tidy morals—she doesn't forgive herself or erase the fraud, only commits to "growing around the wound." The final image (chameleon's tail curled in trust, Elara moving toward the officer) offers a resonant answer without stating a lesson. Minor slip: "healing is not forgetting, but growing around the wound" in the notebook edges toward thesis statement, but it's framed as private armor rather than sermonizing, so the penalty is light.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with tight focalization on Elara; perceptual signature is wildlife-handler specific (she reads Veridian's color shifts, gauges gecko injuries). Diction remains character-bound and modulates under pressure (short clauses when she hears the car). No head-hopping. Minor slip: "shimmering stillness" and "liquid silver" in the opening paragraph push briefly toward elevated lyricism that feels slightly imposed rather than fully Elara's idiom, but the voice settles into her professional register and holds through closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high (each paragraph advances her stance or the animal care), and rhythm varies to support pressure. Clean grammar and spatial choreography. Two minor issues: "The workshop smelled of cedar shavings and the quiet vividness of night-blooming jasmine" has a slightly mixed register ("quiet vividness" feels abstract); and "the shimmering stillness" recurs as a motif but borders on stock lyricism rather than concrete image. No loops or paraphrase, but figurative density in the opening paragraph slightly exceeds function. Deduction within non-closure band: −0.5 for elevated-diction drift in two spots.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The premise (wildlife handler after fraud, tending injured chameleon as metaphor for self-reconstruction) is not wholly novel but transformed through specific professional detail (tail-tip injury mechanics, salve application, enclosure care) and Elara's refusal of easy redemption. The ending avoids the explain-everything trap and commits to uncertainty with cost. The chameleon's tail as literalized metaphor for balance is effective but not entirely unexpected. Solid synthesis, but the overall arc follows a recognizable template (fall from grace, humble care, acceptance of consequences) without a fully non-obvious turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elara (gentle wildlife handler) is present throughout and her choices create key turns: burning brochures, tending the chameleon, calling the officer, requesting custody. Early signal, drives two major beats (tail care, officer call), and shapes closure. Gentle demeanor is dramatized in her slow, deliberate movements and "honest hands." High causal pressure and closure linkage justify ≥7.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The chameleon's tail tip is handled in multiple beats (initial observation, salve application, final twitching test) and its scarred state carries forward as metaphor for balance. Early signal, middle development (she applies salve with visible cost to her focus and time), and payoff (tail flexing with "cautious strength" and curling in trust as she answers the door). High irreplaceability and closure linkage push above 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Fragile convictions shape stakes (her belief system shattered by the fraud) and tactics (she discards the lies, drafts honest mission language). Early signal ("convictions, once sturdy as oak, felt thin as morning frost"), middle development (she tests new honesty by calling the officer), and payoff (she carries forward "fragile and vivid" convictions). Two beats, some causal pressure, closure linkage. Swappable with "shattered trust" or similar, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Quietly vivid appears in description (night-blooming jasmine, "shimmering stillness") and Elara's professional attention to the chameleon's color shifts. It constrains her approach (slow, deliberate care) and charges the final image ("shimmering stillness of the night's work"). Early signal, modest middle use, closure linkage. Somewhat swappable with "calm intensity" or "muted clarity," limiting score above 6.5.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Reconstruct drives the entire arc: she sorts supplies, burns lies, tends animals, drafts a new statement, and calls the officer to rebuild credibility. Early signal ("She needed to reconstruct something"), drives three beats (physical cleanup, care work, public accountability), and shapes closure. High causal pressure and irreplaceability (swapping for "repair" or "rebuild" would require rewriting multiple beats).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>By shedding layers is signaled early (brochures curl and shed into ash, "each one a shed layer of the person she'd pretended to be") and used mechanically in two beats (burning papers, drafting honest words). The method shapes her approach (discarding false identity) and participates in closure theme. Early signal, modest middle use, closure linkage. Somewhat literalized (actual paper shedding) rather than deeply metaphorical, capping at 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The misty workshop under stars provides resources (amber jar, wood stove, enclosures) that enable her reconstruction and charges the atmosphere. Early anchor, middle development (workshop "breathed easier" as she worked), and closure participation (mist lifts to reveal "shimmer even in stillness"). The setting constrains her movements and supplies the tactile frame for her decisions. High specificity and closure linkage justify ≥7.0.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>After the con is revealed anchors the timeline ("Three hours ago, the con had unraveled") and creates urgency (she must act before dawn, before the world "demands answers"). Early signal, middle pressure (dawn approaching tightens her window), and closure participation (first light finds her ready for the officer). The timeframe shapes tactics but could be replaced with "after the betrayal" or "in the aftermath" with minor edits, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>To balance self-respect and compassion is dramatized in friction: self-respect demands she report the fraud and accept shame; compassion demands she care for the animals despite how they were used. Early signal ("The balance hung between them like a spider's thread"), drives two key beats (tending Veridian despite shame, calling the officer while requesting custody), and shapes closure (she carries both forward). High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Shimmering stillness is established early (starlight, mist, quiet breathing) and modulates with pressure (the workshop "breathed easier" as she worked, mist lifts at dawn, stars remain "sharp and distant"). Tone coheres through turns and charges the final image ("shimmering stillness of the night's work"). Early signal, consistent modulation, closure participation. Slightly abstract as a descriptor but purposefully woven through sensory anchors, justifying ≥7.0.</comment>
