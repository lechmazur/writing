<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The memory keeper's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. Her agency at key moments (forging the token, copying the video) advances plot but lacks visible internal cost or hesitation that would ground the decisions in embodied conflict. The interiority relies heavily on abstract labels ("sensed absence," "motivation burned") rather than specific, character-particular thought textures. No meaningful change or renunciation with felt cost is earned by the ending; she simply continues her work with slightly more hope.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The piece follows a causal investigative structure: she finds the patch, traces the numbers, forges clearance, discovers the video, uploads it. However, the closure lacks visible cost—uploading to a secure mirror and whispering numbers feels like continuation rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration that forecloses a path. The orientation is clear early (archive, memory keeper, cold case). The Cost Proof Test fails: no exact sentence at the ending beat shows what she has risked or lost by exposing the truth.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The archive setting (humming servers, backup tapes, vault) anchors the investigative action and supplies resources (the corrupted data blocks, the sealed vault). The mission patch functions as a micro-setting object that recurs and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective but leans visual; other senses (the mournful hum of tapes) appear briefly. The patch constrains her choice to preserve it and enables the final gesture, meeting the 9+ gate partially, but the city and apartment are postcard backdrops without pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the truth about the vanished engineers—is signaled early and drives the investigation. One meaningful tightening occurs when she forges the clearance token and opens the vault, narrowing her options. However, the escalation is largely epistemic (discovering information) rather than a choice under competing pressures. No visible price is paid on the page for her defiance; the corporation's threat remains abstract and off-stage. The ending suggests ongoing work rather than a trade-off that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme (memory, erasure, the persistence of truth) is stated repeatedly rather than emerging from particulars: "truth, like data, never truly disappears" and "nothing truly disappears, only waits to be remembered" are explicit morals. The numbers and songs function as thematic tokens without constraining choice or creating friction. The patch accrues some symbolic weight, but the final paragraph sermonizes ("the story ends where it began") instead of offering a non-literal answer. The Thematic Echo penalty (−0.6) applies to the phrase "truth, like data, never truly disappears" and similar summary lines in the closing beats.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The single third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual filtering is present ("brightly attentive") but the diction often drifts into elevated register ("chorus of absence," "mantra of loss") that feels authorial rather than character-specific. The phrase "a world unaware of the ghosts in its wires" and repeated abstract constructions (echo, absence, silence) flatten the voice into a homogeneous lyric tone. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she knew," "she realized") cluster in several lines without voice-motivated purpose, dulling immediacy in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence are pervasive: "She knew the corporation had buried the truth in the same place it buried its deleted files" immediately follows the vault discovery without new information; "The numbers continued to surface" / "The numbers would keep appearing" / "she whispered the numbers" recycle the same content. Runs of "She [verb]" stems dominate (she poured, she realized, she decided, she watched, she knew, she uploaded, she whispered). Stock metaphors ("digital graveyard," "ghosts in its wires," "beacon for anyone searching") and therapy-speak abstractions ("sensed absence," "echo of forgotten songs" repeated verbatim five times) appear in peak beats. Filter-verb stacks ("she felt," "she knew," "she realized") cluster across multiple lines. Applying the Patterned-artifact penalty pack: template cadence (−0.6), paraphrase loops (−0.4), stock metaphor strings (−0.4), filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats (−0.5) totals −1.9, but capping at −1.7 because artifacts touch the closure beat. Additional disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise (corporate archivist uncovers suppressed crash data) closely matches investigation-thriller templates without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The recurring numbers (4-8-15-16-23-42) echo famous pop-culture sequences (LOST) without fresh synthesis. The emotional arc (isolation → discovery → hope) and the "truth will out" resolution are stock beats. The patch and numbers function as familiar mystery tokens. Applying the Derivative Premise Guardrail (−1.0) for a widely used template without sufficient transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The memory keeper drives all investigative beats (finding the patch, tracing numbers, forging clearance, uploading video) and is present at closure. Setup is immediate, middle beats show her decisions altering tactics, and closure features her whispered mantra and the patch as talisman. However, her choices lack visible cost or conflicting impulses; she proceeds smoothly from discovery to defiance without on-page friction or trade-off. Gates: all three present. Integration signals: early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0. Frictions: observation-driven without cost-laden decision −0.8, swappable investigator archetype −0.5. Base 3.0 + 2.9 − 1.3 = 4.6, rounded to nearest strong causal moment = 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The patch appears in beat one (tucked between data blocks), is held and examined in multiple scenes, and closes the story as a talisman in her hand. Its silver thread and warmth provide sensory specificity. However, it does not constrain a choice with cost; it functions as a clue and symbol without altering her tactics or forcing a trade-off. Gates: all three present. Integration signals: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, specificity (silver thread, warmth) +0.5. Frictions: ornamental symbolic use without action pressure −0.6, no cost tied to the object −0.3. Base 3.0 + 3.7 − 0.9 = 5.8, but lyric-resonance allowance for charged final image lifts to 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cold case frames the entire investigation from the inciting incident (five vanished engineers, scrubbed feeds) through the vault discovery and final upload. It shapes her dominant stake and drives every beat. Gates: all three present. Integration signals: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (frames every choice) +1.3, closure linkage (video upload tagged with numbers, ongoing search) +1.4, irreplaceability +0.6. Frictions: none notable. Base 3.0 + 5.4 = 8.4, but the final image focuses on the patch and numbers more than the case itself, so slight downward adjustment to 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Brightly attentive" appears twice as a label (once in the opening movement, once late) but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with cost. It describes her noticing the numbers but any competent investigator would notice a recurring sequence. No trade-off or friction arises from heightened attention. Gates: setup present (implied in "feeling the weight"), no middle beat development, closure mention only. Integration signals: early implied +0.3, closure label +0.4. Frictions: label-only without action pressure −0.7, swappable trait −0.6. Base 3.0 + 0.7 − 1.3 = 2.4, cap at 3.8 for missing middle development but present at setup and closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lie (forging a clearance token) is the pivot that opens the sealed vault and enables the climax discovery. It appears at the structural midpoint, alters her tactics from passive observation to active defiance, and the consequences (copying the video, erasing logs) flow directly from it. Gates: all three present. Integration signals: early signal (mid-story) +0.4, two beats (forging, then erasing logs) +0.9, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage (video upload traced to this act) +1.0. Frictions: no visible cost dramatized (no confrontation or fear on the page) −0.5, easily swappable with "hacking" or similar −0.4. Base 3.0 + 3.4 − 0.9 = 5.5, rounded up for strong causal role to 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The recurring numbers (4-8-15-16-23-42) appear in timestamps, user IDs, metadata, song waveforms, and the video, threading through the entire investigation. They signal the pattern, guide her middle searches, and close the story as her whispered mantra. However, they do not impose a constraint or cost; she simply follows them. Gates: all three present. Integration signals: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.0. Frictions: ornamental clue without mechanical cost −0.6, no unique properties (any sequence would work) −0.5. Base 3.0 + 3.0 − 1.1 = 4.9, but pattern-taught reprise lifts to 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The archive provides concrete resources (backup tapes, corrupted data blocks, the sealed vault) that shape her investigative moves. The humming servers and dim light anchor atmosphere. However, spatial choreography is minimal and the setting does not constrain a choice with cost; it supplies tools without friction. Gates: all three present. Integration signals: early signal +0.7, two beats (finding patch, opening vault) +0.9, causal pressure (resources enable tactics) +0.8, closure presence (archive hum bookends) +0.8. Frictions: postcard description outside the archive (city, apartment) −0.4. Base 3.0 + 3.2 − 0.4 = 5.8, rounded to 6.3 for strong resource role.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Across the echo of forgotten songs" is a lyric phrase repeated five times but does not function as a legible timeframe. No clock, deadline, or temporal pressure tightens her decisions. The investigation unfolds at an untracked pace with no urgency cost. Gates: setup unclear (phrase appears but does not anchor time), no middle development, closure repetition. Integration signals: closure mention +0.3. Frictions: vague poetic abstraction without temporal function −0.9, swappable with any time phrase −0.6, summary-only −0.4. Base 3.0 + 0.3 − 1.9 = 1.4, cap at 2.6 for ornamental closure presence.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Her desire to find where deleted files go is stated early ("Her motivation burned") and drives every beat: searching the archive, tracing numbers, forging clearance, uploading the video to a secure mirror. It converges with the missing-persons case and is dramatized through action. However, no friction between wants and costs appears; she pursues the goal smoothly without sacrifice or conflicting impulse. Gates: all three present. Integration signals: early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage (secure mirror as answer) +1.1. Frictions: told more than dramatized in conflict −0.5, no visible cost −0.4. Base 3.0 + 4.4 − 0.9 = 6.5, rounded to 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The tone of "sensed absence" (ghosts, silence, vanished voices, hollow spaces) is coherent and pervasive, modulating from isolation in the opening to "a little more like hope" at closure. However, the tone is stated rather than embodied: "sensed absence," "echo of forgotten songs," "chorus of absence" are abstract labels. The final image attempts to charge this tone but relies on summary ("less hollow, a little more like hope") instead of concrete perception. Gates: all three present. Integration signals: early signal +0.7, coherent modulation across beats +1.0, closure linkage +0.9. Frictions: label-only mood without embodied perception −0.7, static vocabulary (echo, absence, silence) repeated without shift −0.4. Base 3.0 + 2.6 − 1.1 = 4.5, but lyric reprise lifts to 6.1.</comment>
