<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Aldric's interior remains abstract throughout—"withdrawn," "shivering bliss"—with no embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The vow he speaks at the climax is told rather than dramatized through hesitation or cost, and his final "step forward" reads as passive submission to the pull of infinity rather than an earned agency decision. The marionettes and orchard lack distinct knowledge states or flaws that would drive inevitable mistakes. Motivation is declared ("capture the shape of possibility") but never tested by conflicting impulses on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test penalty applied: who/where/when remain vague past 120 words (endless night, glass cathedral, no concrete spatial anchor or time marker). The closure image—Aldric drifting in void, marionettes now still—suggests Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis or Charged Poise), but cost is asserted rather than legible: "withdrew" heart becomes "never alone" without on-page evidence of what path was foreclosed. Lens ambiguity: accumulative texture competes with causal "unsnap" action; no single lens dominates at closure. Per Orientation Test, Q3 capped at 7.0.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse supplies vivid texture (silver vines, luminescent fruit, glass cathedral) but does not constrain a choice or charge the final image with micro-setting pressure. Spatial choreography is coherent (potting shed, hidden door, chamber, doorway) yet the "endless night" and shifting reality remain atmospheric without affecting Aldric's tactics. Per Orientation Test cap from Q2, this category is capped at 7.0; the score reflects functional setting that remains largely decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"capture the shape of possibility"—is signaled early but remains abstract; no concrete trade-off or narrowing of options occurs on the page. The "unsnap" action triggers a cascade of light and a doorway, yet Aldric's hesitation is told ("feeling the pull") rather than dramatized as a choice with visible cost. The marionettes' "murmured allegiance" vow is spoken without friction or sacrifice legible in the moment. One tightening (pulling the final thread) does not foreclose a live path or force a felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Possibility" and "allegiance" recur throughout but remain abstract labels; no concrete particular reweights them at closure. The final image—Aldric as guardian, marionettes animated by his will—asserts thematic satisfaction ("never be alone") without a non-literal answer earned by prior events. The piece leans on prompt vocabulary ("shivering bliss," "factually mystical," "shape of possibility") in place of scene-specific resonance. Thematic drift: the "withdrawn" knight's loneliness is declared solved off-page rather than dramatized through cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is thin: Aldric's noticing defaults to generic fantasy diction ("luminescent," "transmuted," "harmonic") without character-specific bias. Register drift appears in phrases like "factually mystical truth" and "fluid geometry that defied logic but felt utterly true," which read as prompt echo rather than lived perception. Psychic distance remains constant without purposeful modulation. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Template cadence and paraphrase loops cluster throughout: "the abandoned marionette theater program" (repeated verbatim four times), "shivering bliss" (three times), "murmured allegiance" (three times), "shape of possibility" (five times). Synonym churn: "withdrew" → "withdrawn" → "loneliness" without fresh texture. The final third contains heavy scaffold: "And so," "And the marionettes," "And though," "And the greenhouse"—five consecutive paragraph openers. Per artifact penalty pack, baseline −1.0 for loops and template stems; artifacts touch closure (final paragraph), triggering cap at 8.8 globally and disallowing 9+ in all categories.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Core premise—isolated alchemist-knight discovers reality-bending artifact—follows a widely used template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The "unsnap" verb and "marionette theater program as map" offer minor freshness, but the turns (hidden door, vow, doorway, cosmic drift) proceed predictably. "Shivering bliss" and "factually mystical" read as prompt labels rather than earned synthesis. No bold risk-taking; the piece hedges into abstract fantasy generalities. Derivative Premise Guardrail: −0.8 for untransformed template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Aldric is present throughout but makes only one decision on the page: pulling the final thread and speaking the vow. His "step forward" at the doorway is passive (responding to the pull) rather than a turn that alters tactics. Observation dominates; no mid-story choice shifts his approach. Present in closure (drifting, becoming guardian) but causally inert there—the marionettes animate "by his will" off-page. Functional but replaceable with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The marionette theater program appears in three beats: discovery beneath roots, Aldric tracing its knots, and final mention ("had found its purpose once more"). It functions as a map, enabling the "unsnap" action. However, it does not return with reweighted meaning; closure focuses on Aldric and the doorway, not the program itself. Setup and development present; payoff is summary-only. Causal pressure +0.5, but swappable with another artifact map (−0.4). Round down to 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Murmured allegiance" seeds early (whisper from marionette), recurs at midpoint (ancient guardians' vow), and Aldric speaks it before stepping through the doorway. It enables the final cascade but does not constrain a choice with visible cost—Aldric's vow is told, not dramatized. Present in all three gates (setup, development, payoff) but functions as a password rather than a stake that shapes tactics. Functional but mid-replaceable; no felt cost tied to speaking it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Factually mystical" appears once as a label ("The words resonated with a factually mystical truth") without constraining or enabling an on-page action. No visible tradeoff or cost tied to this attribute. Ornamental use; does not alter Aldric's choices or the orchard's mechanics. Introduced early but remains a descriptor. Cap at 2.8 for label-only mention without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Unsnap" appears in four beats: forgotten patterns to unsnap (setup), Aldric seeking the knot to unsnap (development), pulling the final thread to unsnap the cage (climax), and unsnapping the final barrier (closure). It drives the major turn—triggering the cascade, doorway, and Aldric's passage. Causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +0.9. However, the mechanics remain vague (what exactly is unsnapped?), reducing specificity. Strong integration but not indispensable; could be "unlock" or "release" with minor rewording.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Forgotten patterns" seeds early (map of forgotten patterns), recurs at midpoint (Aldric tracing knots), and the marionettes dance them at closure. The method enables the unsnap action and charges the final image. Setup, development, and payoff present; causal pressure +0.5. However, the patterns' mechanics remain abstract—no specific cost or constraint shown. Lyric reprise (early → final) with moderate integration; swappable with "ancient knowledge" or similar. Round to 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse is present throughout, frames all action, and its "endless night" reclaims at closure. The hidden chamber and doorway are setting subdivisions. The orchard's fruit and trees "reshape possibility" (stated cost), and the greenhouse's glass walls tremble during the cascade, supplying sensory pressure. Setup, development, and payoff all present; causal pressure +0.7, closure linkage +0.9. However, the setting does not constrain a micro-tactic—Aldric's choices proceed unimpeded by spatial or resource limits. Essential to tone but not indispensable to plot logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"As reality shifts" appears in the title frame and recurs throughout (greenhouse trembles, reality shifted, vines twist, doorway pulses). Time is marked by these shifts rather than a clock. The timeframe complicates (reality in flux) but does not tighten Aldric's decisions—no deadline or urgency alters his tactics. Present across beats but does not pressure choices. Functional atmospheric marker; no felt cost tied to timing. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle constraint; score 4.3 for vague tracking.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Capture the shape of possibility" is stated early, recurs at climax ("Aldric had finally captured"), and frames closure. The desire motivates the unsnap action and the step through the doorway. However, it remains told rather than dramatized—no on-page friction between this want and a competing fear or cost. Setup and payoff present; development is summary-only (no moment where the desire is tested and shifts his choice). Functional but lacks embodied conflict. Lyric reprise without causal pressure; score 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Shivering bliss" appears three times (discovery of marionettes, witnessing possibility materialize, drifting in void) and establishes a consistent affective tone. However, the tone does not modulate with pressure—Aldric experiences "shivering bliss" in discovery, climax, and resolution without tonal shift or friction. Static mood trends mid-low per the rubric. Present in closure image but does not charge it with new meaning. Functional atmospheric consistency without dynamic range; score 4.7.</comment>
