<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The alchemist remains a cipher whose motivation ("to capture the density of presence") is asserted rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses or embodied struggle. Interiority consists of abstract declarations ("she felt the weight of that promise settle into her bones") rather than character-particular perception. Kael exists only as a philosophical sounding board with no distinct interiority or pressure of his own. The final "choice" to return differently carries no visible cost or foreclosed path—no prior desire is renounced, no competing value system abandoned.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piece signals Accumulative/Textural intent through lyric repetition but never narrows options or delivers visible cost at closure. The "secret" remains abstract throughout; no specific information changes tactics or knowledge states on the page. The ending loops back to the opening's language ("density of presence," "return differently") without reweighting those terms through dramatized pressure—mere recurrence, not Resonant Reconfiguration. The Orientation Test passes by ~120 words, but the closure unit lacks the felt or conceptual cost required for RR or CR under any lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The ember nexus supplies vivid atmosphere ("dying stars breathed their last," "swirling embers") but never constrains a choice or alters tactics. Spatial choreography is vague—two characters stand in a visually rich but functionally static location. The nautilus curl and vials are handled but do not impose physical limits or enable a tactical shift; they serve as symbolic props rather than setting elements with mechanical consequence. Sensory detail is present but ornamental, failing to narrow options or charge the final image with environmental pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake ("capture the density of presence") is declared but never tested by a competing cost or narrowed option. No reversal or tightening occurs; the alchemist mixes pigments, the curl glows, and both characters affirm the same abstract goal without friction. Kael's arrival and the ritual unfold without opposition, mistake, or visible price—no live choice forecloses a path. The piece lacks escalation under any lens: no causal linkage narrows options, no accumulative deepening reweights the stake, no situational pressure forces stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme is overtly stated in the final paragraphs ("Presence is the only treasure worth returning for") rather than emerging from dramatized conflict. The nautilus curl and pigments are symbolic tokens without earned resonance—they appear, glow, and are sealed without prior setup that would let them reweight meaning. The closing image recycles prompt language ("density of presence," "return differently") as moralizing summary. No coherent question arises from character goal and central conflict; abstract philosophizing replaces scene pressure at every turn.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Voice defaults to elevated, abstract register ("scientifically romantic," "directed spontaneity," "palette of resolve") that remains constant regardless of pressure. Dialogue is indistinguishable between characters—both speak in the same quasi-mystical idiom ("By letting the past fold into the present like ink into water"). POV distance is stable but the perceptual signature is generic: no character-particular way of noticing or filtering detail. Filter verbs and summary interiority ("she felt," "she understood") flatten immediacy throughout, and the final paragraph slips into thesis statement rather than embodied thought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade the text: "to capture the density of presence" appears in multiple forms across adjacent paragraphs without added pressure; "return differently" is restated five times. Template cadence dominates ("She [verb]... She [verb]... She [verb]...") across runs of three or more sentences. Stock metaphors ("ink into water," "wind through leaves") and therapy-speak abstractions ("resolve," "intention," "presence") cluster in peak beats. The final third repeats the opening's language mechanically, triggering artifact penalties that disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The core premise—mystic encounter at a liminal site to discuss abstract philosophical goals—follows a widely used template without fresh transformation. Prompt elements appear as labels rather than lived specifics: "pocket-sun alchemist," "scientifically romantic," "directed spontaneity" read as borrowed vocabulary rather than a singular vision. The nautilus curl and pigment vials function as interchangeable mystical props; removing them and substituting crystals or runes would require only cosmetic edits. No bold structural or perspectival risk heightens stakes; the piece retreats into safe abstraction at every decision point.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>The pocket-sun alchemist observes, mixes pigments, and seals a vial, but no choice alters tactics or forecloses a path. Her decisions are cosmetic—selecting indigo over other pigments carries no visible cost or competing desire. She is present throughout but does not create key turns; the ritual unfolds without opposition or mistake. Late penalties (−0.6) and ornamental use (−0.8) apply.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The nautilus shell columella curl appears early, is handled in the middle (mixed with pigment), and glows in the final image. However, its specific properties—"spiral catching ember glow," "echo of the first star's heartbeat"—are descriptive rather than causal; any small object could be mixed and sealed with minor edits. No cost is tied to the curl itself; it does not narrow options or enable a tactic under pressure. Two-beat involvement (+0.9) and closure linkage (+0.7) are offset by swappability (−0.7) and ornamental mid-use (−0.6).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"A palette of resolve" is embodied by seven vials of pigments introduced late (second half) and used in a single decorative beat. The vials do not constrain choice—selecting indigo over crimson carries no dramatized cost or tactical consequence. The concept is told ("each hue a promise she'd made to herself") rather than shown through conflicting options. Late introduction (−0.4), ornamental use (−0.8), and swappability (−0.6) apply.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Scientifically romantic" is asserted twice as a label ("Kael, scientifically romantic in his own right"; "felt scientifically romantic, a fusion of heart and hypothesis") but never constrains or enables an action with visible cost. No on-page choice demonstrates the tension between empirical rigor and emotional openness; the trait exists as thematic decoration. Label-only use (−0.3 × 2 = −0.6) and no causal pressure drop the score below functional.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Revalue" is thematized throughout ("to revalue the simplest fragments," "we revalue the past not by forgetting") but the action itself—mixing the curl with pigment—does not turn the plot or redefine options. The shell's meaning is declared to shift ("from a mere relic to a catalyst") rather than dramatized through competing interpretations or a choice that forecloses a path. Present across beats (+0.9) but swappable with "transform" or "reimagine" (−0.7); no specific cost tied to revaluation (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"By returning differently" is invoked in dialogue and the final paragraphs but its mechanics remain abstract. The method is not dramatized—no prior attempt to return the same way is shown, so "differently" has no anchor. The piece asserts the method will guide future action ("Tomorrow, we will return differently") but does not employ it to shape present attempts or choices. Summary-only use (−0.8), no causal pressure (−1.0), and missing middle development cap at 3.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The ember nexus at twilight is established early and frames the entire scene, but it supplies only atmospheric backdrop—no environmental feature constrains the alchemist's ritual or alters her tactics. The "glow intensifying" at the end is reactive description, not a resource or obstacle. Present in closure (+0.7) and early signal (+0.5) are offset by ornamental use (−0.8) and no causal pressure (−1.0).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "in the moment a secret is whispered between friends" is declared once ("the moment a secret is whispered between friends carried a weight") but the secret itself is never specified or timed. The ritual unfolds without temporal constraint—no clock tightens decisions, no urgency shapes tactics. The "moment" is asserted thematically but not tracked on the page. Ornamental use (−0.8), no causal pressure (−1.0), and missing middle development cap at 2.9.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to capture the density of presence" is told early ("The alchemist's motivation thrummed in her chest") and repeated in the final lines, but it is never dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. No prior desire (safety, efficiency, companionship) is renounced in favor of presence; the goal faces no opposition. Setup (+0.5) and closure linkage (+0.9) are offset by told-only execution (−0.8), no friction (−1.0), and ornamental mention (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Directed spontaneity" is asserted once ("feeling the directed spontaneity of the moment—each gesture deliberate, yet unfurling like wind through leaves") but tone remains uniformly elevated and abstract throughout. No modulation occurs under pressure; the prose does not shift cadence or register to reflect spontaneity versus deliberation. Static mood (−0.6), label-only use (−0.3), and no causal work (−1.0) push the score to mid-low functional range.</comment>
