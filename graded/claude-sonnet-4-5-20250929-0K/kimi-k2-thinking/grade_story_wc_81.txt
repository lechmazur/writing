<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to trace the book's origins is clear and sustained, and her logical indexer trait shapes her methodical approach. However, interiority remains generic ("felt a surge of reclaimed stillness") rather than character-particular, and the resolution—finding Aldric's name and restoring order—arrives without meaningful internal contradiction or cost that forecloses a path. The piece tracks her actions competently but lacks embodied emotional complexity or a choice that genuinely tests competing values.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation is established (sunken library, blackout, Mira alone), and the story follows a causal thread: Mira finds stamp → matches watermark → discovers guild registry → identifies Aldric. However, the closure lacks felt cost; the blackout lifts conveniently, power returns, and Mira simply smiles as her work concludes. The final image ("light held steady and the water outside receded") reclaims stillness but does not demonstrate what was foreclosed or transformed by her choices. The lens reads Causal but the ending delivers restoration without visible sacrifice or renunciation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The sunken library, murky water, oil lantern, and silt-filled vault anchor the setting vividly and early. The lantern's sputtering and Mira's need to readjust the wick provide tactile pressure in one beat. However, the environment does not constrain her final success—the blackout lifts at the moment of resolution, removing obstacles rather than forcing a choice under duress, preventing the setting from charging the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—tracing the book's honest origins—is clear and sustained. Mira formulates and tests an alternative hypothesis (deliberately hidden vs. lost), which provides a tightening of inquiry. Yet the escalation is cerebral and the final turn (discovering Aldric's name, the council secret) arrives without forcing a trade-off or visible cost; the blackout's end grants success rather than demanding renunciation or endurance. No on-page price is paid to achieve the reclaimed stillness.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of reclaimed stillness and honest record-keeping emerges through Mira's actions and the library's symbolic restoration. The antique stamp functions as a motif of authenticity. However, the thematic question is answered by convenient resolution—power returns, truth is cataloged—without ambiguity or a non-literal resonance that reweights prior material. The final paragraph ("one stamp at a time," "dappled resolve against the dark") states the theme rather than embodying it through a charged image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable, and Mira's professional lexicon (indexer, hypothesis, registry) anchors voice. Psychic distance is consistent. However, diction peaks into elevated register at emotional beats ("dappled resolve," "tranquilly perceptive calm," "exhalation of musty breath") that feel imposed rather than character-particular. The prose reads competent but lacks a distinct perceptual signature or rhythmic modulation under pressure; syntax remains uniform throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Clarity and grammar are clean, and spatial choreography tracks across beats. However, figurative language is dense and often ornamental: "dappled shadows," "dappled resolve," "reclaimed stillness" recur without reweighting meaning or constraining choice. Phrases like "the silence around her was a dappled resolve" and "tranquilly perceptive calm" elevate register without adding pressure. Template cadence appears in multiple "She [verb]" stems, and paraphrase loops ("reclaimed stillness" appears six times with minimal variation). These artifacts dull momentum in the final third, preventing entry into high bands.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The sunken-library premise and archivist-restoring-order frame are familiar motifs executed competently but without a fresh inflection. The alternative-hypothesis method and guild-mystery discovery follow genre conventions; the ending—power returns, order restored, protagonist smiles—offers tidy resolution without risk or non-obvious synthesis. Mira's role as logical indexer and the antique stamp's use are functional but could be replaced by similar detective-scholar figures and authentication tools without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira as logical page indexer is present throughout and her methodical approach (comparing watermark, testing hypothesis, consulting registry) shapes tactics. However, her choices do not create key turns; the discoveries (stamp, watermark, Aldric's name) arrive through search rather than decision under pressure. Her final action—placing a stamped sheet in the book—is symbolic but does not alter stakes or options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The antique ink stamp is discovered early, handled in multiple beats (examining the sigil, pressing it into margins, comparing with registry, final stamping ritual), and its guild emblem links to the watermark and Aldric. It enables authentication and appears in the closure paragraph ("gazed at the antique ink stamp"). However, it does not constrain a choice or force a cost; Mira uses it successfully without friction, and it could be replaced by another authentication tool with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Reclaimed stillness" appears as a phrase six times, framing Mira's emotional state and the library's symbolic restoration. It is present at closure ("reclaimed stillness of the corridor," "small act of reclaimed stillness"). However, it functions as thematic summary rather than shaping stakes or tactics on the page; Mira does not wrestle with stillness as a constraint or resource, and the concept remains abstract rather than altering options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Tranquilly perceptive" appears once as a descriptor of Mira's calm and again implied in "tranquilly perceptive clarity." It characterizes her manner but does not constrain or enable a choice with cost; her perceptiveness allows her to notice details without tradeoff. The trait is ornamental, a label rather than a visible friction or advantage that shapes a beat's outcome.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Readjust" appears twice: Mira readjusts the lantern wick when the flame sputters, and she considers readjusting her approach if her first theory fails. The wick adjustment is functional and specific, providing a moment of tactile pressure. However, she never needs to readjust her theory—the hypothesis is confirmed without forcing a pivot. The action shapes one beat but does not redefine options or drive the major turn at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The "alternative hypothesis" is signaled early ("She formulated an alternative hypothesis: perhaps the volume had not been lost, but deliberately hidden") and tested via the guild registry comparison. Its mechanics—compare evidence, weigh competing theories—are visible and shape Mira's investigative method. However, the hypothesis is confirmed rather than requiring a pivot, and it does not force a choice under pressure; it remains a successful intellectual tool rather than a constraint with cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The forgotten library inside a sunken city is anchored early and sustained: three fathoms of water, murky darkness, water-stained walls, silt-filled vault, blackout-induced darkness. The setting provides atmospheric pressure and the lantern's fragility, and the final line ("water outside receded") links setting to resolution. However, the sunken condition and blackout are lifted by external forces rather than constraining Mira's final success; the environment does not force a tactical adaptation at closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The blackout is established early ("blackout had silenced the generators") and provides the initial obstacle (darkness, reliance on lantern). It is present at closure when power returns ("blackout lifted, power returning in a flicker"). However, time is not tracked—duration is vague, and the blackout's end is coincidental rather than urgent. The timeframe complicates setup but does not tighten decisions or force Mira to race against a deadline.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to trace the honest origins of the enigmatic volume is signaled early and sustained across beats (examining the stamp, matching watermarks, consulting the registry, linking to Aldric). The motivation drives her choices and is rewarded at closure. However, it is not dramatized under friction; no competing want or fear creates tension, and the resolution fulfills her desire without visible cost or sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Dappled resolve" appears as a phrase three times, describing the interplay of light and shadow and Mira's emotional state. The tone is lyric and contemplative, modulating slightly when the lantern flickers and when power returns. However, the diction feels imposed rather than organic to Mira's professional voice, and the tone remains static—quiet determination throughout—without sharpening under peak pressure or charging the final image with undeniable weight.</comment>
