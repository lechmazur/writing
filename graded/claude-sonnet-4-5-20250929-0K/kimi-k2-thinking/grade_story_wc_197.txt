<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's resourcefulness is asserted more than dramatized through contradictory choices under pressure. Her swallowing the crystal reads as a clever plot move rather than an earned character decision rooted in prior on-page conflict. Internal contradictions are largely absent; she remains competent throughout without meaningful struggle against her own limits. The final choice to scatter drives lacks visible cost that forecloses a path—she simply executes her plan and escapes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture. Closure reads as Decisive Change (she retrieves the data and escapes), but the cost is thin—the System marks her erased, yet she reappears unscathed three days later with the network intact. The key-in-water mechanism arrives unearned; no prior beat establishes that the lagoon responds to objects or that her grandfather's key holds this property. Orientation is clean by ~120 words, and the escalation from theft to flight to reappearance traces a because/therefore chain, but the final image dilutes rather than tightens the stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The auric lagoon supplies a vivid, purpose-driven anchor that enables the climactic turn when the key activates the hidden door. Spatial choreography (city streets, compost bin, lagoon shore, relay station interior) remains clear throughout. Sensory detail is selective—golden bioluminescence, humming water, flickering screens—and filtered through urgency. The phone booth key functions as micro-setting, constraining choice and charging the final image as a totem.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—preserve uncorrupted history—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure escalates through stolen code dissolving, location purged, drone pursuit, but the tightening lacks trade-offs; Mara's resourcefulness solves each problem without visible sacrifice until the swallow-and-scatter beat. The final cost (marked erased) is declared rather than felt, and her reappearance undercuts the stakes. Coincidence (key unlocks a door it was never meant for) resolves the central obstacle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme—resistance to systemic erasure—emerges clearly but relies on direct statement ("tyranny of indifference," "holding the line") rather than accumulated particulars. The phone booth key recurs with shifting weight (grandfather's legacy, map tool, totem), yet the final image's whispered coordinates read as a late symbolic add-on rather than an earned resonance. The ending offers a straightforward triumph without ambiguity or conceptual repricing; no counter-reading is invited.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single POV with stable third-limited distance. Voice carries a consistent lyric-noir texture ("flickering like dying stars," "starlight coded in water"), and diction remains within Mara's plausible register. Perceptual signature is present but not deeply character-specific; descriptions could fit any resourceful rebel. No dialogue on the page to assess. Psychic distance holds steady; no head-hopping or filter clutter.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies adequately, but template cadence appears in middle beats: "She waited…crouched…sketched…" stems repeat without taught pattern. Figurative language is dense in non-peak moments ("revised histories flickered across screens like dying stars," "concrete slab shuddered, split, and a steel door rose from the shallows like a promise"), creating mild overwriting without payoff. Paraphrase loop: "Her plan had unravelled completely" immediately follows a paragraph demonstrating that fact. Information density is moderate; several sentences serve primarily as transit scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Core premise—rebel retrieves backup to counter memory-erasure regime—follows a familiar template (underdog vs. authoritarian system, MacGuffin quest). The puddle-reflection map and key-activated lagoon door offer surface novelty, but their mechanics arrive unearned and feel convenient rather than inevitable. Emotional arc (competent rebel succeeds) lacks complexity or transformation. The story does not transform its tropes through specific, grounded choices; the ending restores the status quo ante with Mara still underestimated and still holding the line.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mara as underestimated rebel is signaled early and present across beats (theft, evasion, retrieval, escape), but her decisions feel competent rather than pivotal; the story could function with a differently motivated protagonist. Setup and development present; closure participation is observational (she spreads data) rather than a choice that transforms stakes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Phone booth key appears in setup (grandfather's funeral), middle (she carries it), and closure (totem, coordinates whisper). Used twice on-page: unlocking the relay door and hanging as a totem. The unlocking beat is causal and essential, but the late coordinates function reads as ornamental. Strong integration overall, but the key's lagoon-activation property is unearned.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Revised histories frame the stakes (System erasing memories) and shape Mara's goal (retrieve uncorrupted backup). Present in setup, drives the quest, and the closure depicts histories "flickering back to life." Does not constrain on-page tactics; functions primarily as thematic backdrop.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Carefully resourceful is asserted in narration ("Mara was carefully resourceful") and illustrated through improvisation (puddle map, key use, swallow-and-scatter). Present across beats, but the trait enables solutions without visible trade-offs; no on-page moment where resourcefulness costs her another option.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Reappear structures the ending and fulfills the arc (marked erased, then returns). Setup and payoff present; middle development absent. The action redefines her status (from erased to active) and enables the data spread, but the reappearance itself is summarized rather than dramatized, and no cost is visible in the moment.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Puddle-reflection map appears once in the middle third, shapes one beat (finding the lagoon), and is sketched onto her palm. Method is present and functional but not essential—any navigation aid could substitute with minor edits. No setup or closure reprise.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Auric lagoon is setup (goal destination), middle (she arrives, key activates door), and closure (flooding circuitry, jumpsuit floating). Setting supplies the resource (hidden relay station) and pressures the climax (drone arrival). The lagoon's bioluminescence and water-activation property are specific and irreplaceable; removing this exact setting breaks the key-unlock logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>When plans unravel is signaled early (code dissolves, location purged) and tightens decisions in the first half. The four-hour trek and "minutes, perhaps seconds" at the lagoon impose time pressure, but the clock is not tracked in the ending beats; the reappear moment occurs "three days later" without constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Hold the line against tyranny of indifference is stated explicitly and drives Mara's quest. Present in setup, middle (retrieval attempt), and closure (spreading histories). The motivation remains stable and is tested by obstacles, but no on-page friction between this want and a competing cost; she pursues it without internal conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Coded freedom as tone is present in imagery (water and starlight, whispered coordinates, reflections as maps) and modulates from oppressive (Archives, drones) to liberated (lagoon, underground network). The tone supports the concept and charges the final image, but remains somewhat static—lyric throughout rather than shifting with pressure.</comment>
