<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Rhen remains a label-only construct throughout. The "dueling philosopher" title, mechanical arm, and "diplomatically fierce" descriptor are mentioned repeatedly but never constrain a choice or reveal internal contradiction under pressure. The duel opponent appears as a shadow figure with no distinct interiority, and the finale—"decisive, yet courteous, final thrust"—reads as narrated competence rather than earned agency with visible cost. Motivation is asserted ("turning questions into destinations") but never dramatized through conflicting impulses or micro-choices that foreclose a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when early enough, but causality remains decorative rather than propulsive. The needle card "reveals" coordinates, the sundial "confirms" the path, and the duel concludes because Rhen "seized the moment"—all outcomes arrive by authorial convenience rather than because/therefore linkage or accumulative pressure that narrows options. The closure unit lacks visible cost: the duel ends with a bow, the card goes back in the pocket, and Rhen walks away with "newfound direction" asserted rather than reweighted on the page. Orientation Test satisfied; closure form (Decisive Change or RR) not demonstrated with legible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The glass atrium, brook, sundial, and needle card are vividly described with concrete detail, but they function as stage dressing rather than constraints that shape choice. The sundial's "coded angles" and the card's "etched patterns" are mentioned in multiple beats, yet neither limits Rhen's options or alters his tactics—he simply decodes and proceeds. The brook's murmur bookends the piece as atmosphere, not pressure. Spatial choreography during the duel remains clear, meeting baseline requirements, but the environment does not charge the final image or enable a forfeiture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>A dominant stake is asserted—"turning questions into destinations"—but never tested on the page with a meaningful tightening or trade-off. The duel escalates in description ("more fluid," "decisive thrust") without dramatizing a reversal, cost, or choice that forecloses a path. The opponent "stumbles" by convenience, and Rhen's victory arrives without visible price or alteration of stance. Under any drive lens (Causal, Accumulative, Situational), the pressure remains static narration rather than accumulation or deepening that reweights options or knowledge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The motif "turning questions into destinations" is repeated five times but never emerges from concrete particulars—it remains an abstract thesis statement rather than a resonant answer discovered through scene work. The needle card, sundial, and mechanical arm recur as potential symbols but do not shift meaning or charge the closure; they simply fulfill their initial function and exit. The final paragraph ("turning waiting into an art, questions into destinations, and chaos into grace") explicitly moralizes rather than letting the image speak, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty. No thematic complexity or counter-reading is invited.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature exists—focus on coded patterns, mechanical arm details—but diction remains generic and interchangeable across beats, lacking the idiosyncratic texture required for high scores. Peak moments default to stock phrasing: "restless moment," "shadow of a smile," "silent applause of the brook." Purposeful elision of the actual mechanics of decoding and the duel's intellectual parry-and-thrust creates a distance that flattens immediacy. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are not applicable. Narrative stance is consistent but lacks rhythmic modulation under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade the piece: "turning questions into destinations" and variations echo across five separate beats without added pressure or detail. Template cadence dominates sentence openings in the duel sequence: "Rhen's mind raced," "Rhen glanced," "Rhen pressed forward," "Rhen lowered," "Rhen walked away." Stock metaphor strings appear unchallenged: "dance of intellect and steel," "words sharp as a rapier," "silent applause of the brook." Filter-verb stacks cluster in the opening third ("believed," "noted," "studied"). The final paragraph loops synonym variants of the core thesis across four sentences, dulling closure momentum. Apply patterned-artifact penalty pack and disallow 9+ globally per the stated rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The "dueling philosopher" frame and steampunk-adjacent mechanical arm read as stock genre furniture without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The needle card cipher, sundial angles, and willow grove coordinates function as decorative quest tokens rather than a fresh synthesis that charges stakes. The duel itself—fencing as intellectual debate—is a familiar trope executed at surface level, with no risk-taking or perspectival ingenuity. Emotional truth and human complexity are absent; Rhen remains competent and undisturbed throughout, his victory foretold by the framing. The piece could be rewritten with a different profession, object, and setting without altering the emotional or thematic arc, failing the Transformation Test.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Rhen (dueling philosopher with mechanical arm) is present throughout and named repeatedly, satisfying setup. The mechanical arm extends, whirrs, and traces sundial lines in early beats, and "hummed a soft whir" near the end, touching three beats. However, none of these actions constrain a choice or alter tactics under pressure—the arm is described as "precision" enabling parries, but no on-page decision turns on its presence versus a flesh limb. The character's philosopher identity is asserted but never dramatized through a question-based tactic or intellectual constraint during the duel. Late first appearance is not a factor, but causal irreplaceability is: the story would function identically with a swordsman and an ordinary arm. Cap at 4.6 for minimal causal pressure; apply swappability (−0.6) and ornamental-use (−0.8) adjustments for a neighborhood near 3.0; raised slightly by multi-beat presence to 2.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The Danish tin sewing needle card appears in three beats: held in the opening, "revealed" coordinates midway, and slipped back into the pocket at closure. This satisfies setup, development, and payoff gates, making the element eligible above 6.0. However, the card's involvement is summary-only in the key middle beat ("The hidden overture revealed itself as a series of coordinates")—the mechanics of decoding are narrated, not dramatized, weakening causal pressure. At closure, the card is pocketed with the phrase "its purpose fulfilled," a tell rather than a charged image that reweights prior material. The card enables a single plot move (finding the willow grove path) but does not narrow options or impose cost. Apply summary-only (−0.6) and closure cameo (not causally active at the end, −0.4) adjustments from an eligible baseline of ~6.0, landing near 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The "hidden overture" is mentioned in the opening third and described as "a secret melody that could guide his next move," satisfying setup. It reappears as "The hidden overture revealed itself" in the middle and "now a clear melody in his heart" at closure, touching three beats and meeting all gates for eligibility above 6.0. However, the concept functions purely as metaphorical labeling—"overture" and "melody" are synonyms for "solution" or "plan" without any musical mechanics or thematic constraint shaping stakes or tactics. The reveal is narrated summary ("revealed itself as coordinates"), not dramatized pressure. At closure, "the hidden overture now a clear melody" is a restated abstraction without visible cost or reweighted meaning. The element reads as ornamental theme-claim rather than a driver of on-page choices. Apply ornamental-use (−0.8), label-only (−0.6), and summary-only (−0.5) adjustments from ~6.0 baseline, capping by swappability at 3.8; the net effect lands near 3.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Diplomatically fierce" is introduced early ("known for being diplomatically fierce, his words sharp as a rapier, his courtesy a shield") and echoed at the duel's end ("decisive, yet courteous, final thrust"), meeting setup and payoff. However, the trait remains label-only in both instances: no on-page action demonstrates the friction between diplomacy and ferocity, no choice is constrained by balancing courtesy with aggression, and no visible cost accrues from this dual stance. The duel itself is narrated in summary ("each parry would turn a question into a destination of thought"), not dramatized through dialogue or tactical trade-offs that show the attribute shaping behavior. Missing middle development and causal pressure. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle gate; apply label-only (−0.6), ornamental (−0.5), and swappability (−0.8) adjustments, landing near 2.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Fencing is signaled early ("preparing for the inevitable duel"), occupies the story's second half with multiple beats (raising the foil, parrying, delivering a riposte, the final thrust), and concludes the action at closure, satisfying all three gates and making the element eligible above 6.0. The action is central and not easily swappable—removing fencing would require a structural rewrite. However, the duel is narrated in summary rather than dramatized blow-by-blow, weakening immediacy and cost legibility: "Rhen's mind raced," "pressed forward," "delivered a decisive...thrust" are all told outcomes rather than moment-to-moment choices under pressure. The fencing does not impose a visible price (injury, exhaustion, tactical sacrifice) that alters Rhen's stance or tactics at closure. Apply summary-only (−0.6) and missing cost-tie (−0.4) from a baseline near 7.0, landing at 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The "coded angles in a half-painted sundial" is introduced early, with Rhen studying and tracing the angles, and reappears in the middle ("the sundial's shadow crept...marking hidden time") and at closure via the phrase "beyond the sundial," satisfying all three gates. The mechanics are named ("coded angles that spelled a message") and the sundial "confirms" the needle card's coordinates midway, showing development involvement. However, the actual decoding method is summarized, not shown: "His mechanical arm extended...his mind decoded the pattern" tells rather than demonstrates how the angles work. The sundial does not constrain a choice or impose a cost—it simply provides information that Rhen uses without friction. At closure, "beyond the sundial" is a spatial reference, not a reweighted causal presence. Apply summary-only (−0.6) and swappability (the "coded angles" could be runes, a map, or a cipher with minor edits, −0.6) from ~6.0, landing near 4.3.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The glass atrium is anchored early with vivid detail (glass ceiling, marble pedestal, brook outside the stone wall) and remains the sole location throughout, satisfying setup and continuous presence. The setting provides the stage for the duel (glass ceiling fracturing sunlight, echoes off glass panels), and the brook bookends the piece as atmosphere, touching closure ("the quiet brook reflecting his newfound direction"). All three gates are met, making the element eligible above 6.0. However, the atrium does not constrain a choice or supply a tactical resource—the duel could occur in any indoor space with similar narrative effect. The glass and brook function as descriptive backdrop rather than pressure or cost. Spatial choreography is clear, but the setting does not charge the final image with undeniable stakes. Apply swappability (−0.5) and ornamental closure (−0.4) from ~6.5, landing near 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"While waiting" is established in the opening line ("had been waiting for hours") and recurs in the middle ("The mechanical philosopher had turned waiting into an art") and at closure ("those patient enough to listen while waiting"), satisfying all three gates. However, the timeframe functions as thematic backdrop rather than live constraint: the hours of waiting do not tighten decisions, escalate pressure, or impose a deadline cost. The duel itself unfolds without time friction—no fatigue, no approaching limit, no choice forced by the clock. "Waiting" is repurposed as metaphor ("waiting into an art") rather than dramatized duration that narrows options. Apply ornamental-use (−0.7), missing causal pressure (−0.6), and thematic-only (−0.5) from ~6.0 baseline, landing near 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"To turn questions into destinations" is named early ("each restless moment into a question that ached for a destination") and repeated across five beats, including at closure ("turning questions into destinations"), meeting setup, development, and payoff. The motivation is stated as Rhen's core drive. However, it remains abstract assertion throughout: no on-page scene dramatizes a question being tested or a destination choice forcing a cost. The duel is described as "each parry would turn a question into a destination of thought," but this is narrated summary, not embodied friction between competing wants. The element functions as thematic claim rather than a causal stake with visible trade-offs. Apply label-only (−0.6), summary-only (−0.6), ornamental (−0.7), and template repetition (−0.3) from ~6.0 baseline, landing near 3.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Dignified chaos" is introduced midway ("a dignified chaos that commanded respect") and echoed at closure ("dignified chaos" named again, "turned...chaos into grace"), satisfying setup and payoff but arriving after the first third. The tone is asserted through description of the duel's sensory effects (kaleidoscope of color, echoes off glass) rather than modulating with narrative pressure or shaping the POV's perceptual filter under stress. The piece maintains a single elevated register throughout—no tonal shift between waiting, decoding, and dueling—so the "chaos" half of the pairing is not felt on the page. At closure, the phrase is restated as summary rather than charged by the final image. Apply late first appearance (−0.3), label-only (−0.6), and static mood (−0.6) from ~6.0 baseline, landing near 4.6.</comment>
