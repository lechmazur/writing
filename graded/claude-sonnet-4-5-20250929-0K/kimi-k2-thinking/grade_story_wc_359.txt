<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation is declared rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses—she proceeds linearly without internal friction. The synesthetic trait is label-only; we're told she sees color ribbons but no micro-choice depends on that perception. The sculptor appears as ornamental framing without relationship pressure. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("her mission fulfilled," "newfound reverence") rather than embodied perception under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the opening. The closure unit—wonder "unfettered" and spreading—is asserted rather than earned by visible cost; Lyra lowers the bells and visitors later describe effects, but no on-page sacrifice or foreclosed path materializes. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural (bell sequence building toward release), yet the final third summarizes aftermath in exposition rather than crystallizing pressure in a charged image. Under the inferred lens, a meaningful tightening occurs (the hush fractures) but cost remains abstract.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ice cavern pressures the ritual (sculpted hush as weight) and the aurora provides the color palette Lyra requires. Sensory detail is vivid but somewhat catalog-like; the bells' arrangement and the glowing ice create atmosphere without deeply constraining a tactical choice. The sculptor's marble studio lacks spatial grounding—his location relative to the cavern is never clarified. The amber music sheet is handled twice but its warmth and glow serve symbolic rather than mechanical pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—certifying wonder as essential—is signaled early. One tightening occurs when the hush begins to fracture, driven by Lyra's bell sequence. Yet the resolution is convenience-routed: the hush simply yields without visible trade-off or loss. No live option is foreclosed; Lyra completes the ritual and afterward "remained," with no cost exacted. The sculptor's pause mid-stroke is reactive, not a consequence of protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme—wonder as essential—emerges from the ritual but is stated overtly in summary: "certified by a bell ringer's brave act," "wonder was no longer a fleeting dream." The final paragraphs moralize rather than letting the image resonate. The recurring motif of sculpted hush shifts meaning (from oppressive to living), a valid accumulative move, but the ending's exposition ("A story of silence shaped into sound") replaces scene pressure with thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Lyra; no head-hopping occurs and the sculptor's segment is cleanly externalized. Diction is elevated and consistent but leans abstract ("oscillating repose," "luminous tide," "impossible dreams") without grounding in Lyra's embodied perception. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture, yet internal voice converges toward poetic summary in the final third. Dialogue is absent; no test available.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops: "sculpted hush" is re-defined across four lines without new pressure; "wonder" and "essential" recur in synonym clusters. Template cadence in the final third: "She knew that wonder…" / "And so the ice cavern…" / "And the sculptor…" Figurative density is high ("ribbon of shifting hue," "cascade of amber light," "cathedral of oscillating repose") with mixed vehicles (ribbons, cascades, cathedrals) that blur rather than sharpen. Sentence openings vary until the ending, where "And" stems stack. Information density is moderate; many lines reiterate rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The core premise—synesthetic bell ringer unfetters wonder—combines elements in a novel configuration, yet emotional truth is undercut by abstraction. The sculptor's simultaneous chisel strike is coincidental convenience without causal integration. The ending's moral summary ("certified by a bell ringer's brave act") retreats into template resolution. Proximity check: "first word of creation" and "cathedral" echo familiar metaphors without fresh specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Lyra arranges bells, waits for the cue, rings the sequence, and lowers them—decisions that structure all three acts. However, her choices proceed without friction or trade-off; she executes the plan as conceived. Present in setup, middle, and closure, but no on-page reversal or cost tied to her agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Amber music sheet appears in paragraph 4 (setup) and glows at the climax (middle/closure participation), but its mechanics are static—it holds the composition and glows when the final bell rings. No evolving use or tactical constraint; swappable with "ancient scroll" or similar. Two touches across beats, but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sculpted hush is introduced as the antagonist force (paragraph 7), pressures Lyra throughout (weight threatening to smother), and fractures at the climax when her bells succeed. It shapes stakes (the hush must be broken to release wonder) and alters tactics (she must match aurora colors to crack it). Present in all three gates with causal pressure, though the resolution is asserted rather than costed.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Synesthetic blessing is mentioned in paragraph 3 and referenced when she rings bells ("sound-color synesthesia painted a shimmering path"), but the trait never constrains a choice or imposes cost. She closes her eyes before ringing, so the colors do not guide her hand. Label-only; swappable with "gifted musician."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Unfettering is the climactic action: paragraph 23 states "The resonance unfettered wonder, releasing it from the sculpted hush." The ritual's entire structure aims toward this release, and the aftermath (wonder spreading, cavern transformed) traces directly to it. Present across all gates with closure linkage, though the mechanics are abstract.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Aurora colors are seeded in paragraph 9 ("the aurora's palette") and paragraph 11 (bells tuned to aurora shades). Lyra uses them as conduit when ringing (green and violet matched to bells). The method shapes her preparation and execution, though the mechanics remain vague. Present in setup and middle; closure participation is implicit (colors continue to dance afterward).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Ice cavern frames the entire story and applies pressure via the sculpted hush that fills it. The frozen walls and glowing ice provide atmosphere; the space becomes a pilgrimage site afterward. The setting constrains (she must perform the ritual there) and supplies resources (ice reflects colors), though spatial micro-tactics are absent. Present in all gates with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The sculptor's chisel strike is mentioned in paragraph 13 as the cue for Lyra's first bell, and it occurs in paragraph 16 ("When the chisel struck"). The timeframe tightens Lyra's wait but does not create tension—she simply waits for the signal. The sculptor pauses mid-stroke afterward (paragraph 25), but the simultaneity is ornamental. Setup and middle presence; no closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation "to certify wonder as essential" is declared in paragraph 6 and restated in the summary (paragraph 33: "certified by a bell ringer's brave act"). The desire drives her preparation and execution, but no friction or cost tests it—she completes the ritual as planned. Told-only; no dramatized conflict between want and obstacle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Oscillating repose appears twice: paragraph 26 ("cathedral of oscillating repose") and paragraph 32 ("In the oscillating repose of that frozen world"). The phrase gestures toward a tonal blend of stillness and movement, yet the prose mostly sustains elevated lyricism without modulation. The tone does not tighten under pressure or charge the final image; it remains static ornamentation.</comment>
