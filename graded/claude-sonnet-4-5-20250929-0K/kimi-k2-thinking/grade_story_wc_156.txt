<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is articulated but never tested by a concrete choice with cost. Her "methodically playful" trait is labeled repeatedly but does not constrain any action or force a tradeoff. The visitor's question arrives without prior setup and Elena's final question to them feels like a prompt echo rather than a character-driven turn. Interior experience remains abstract ("felt herself awaken, a third layer") with no embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who/where/when are anchored by ~100 words; no penalty. The piece lacks a legible closure unit with cost. The mural "reveals" layers and Elena "realizes" restoration is wonder, but no option is foreclosed and no visible price paid. The visitor's laugh setting "the next layer aglow" is a coincidence-driven continuation, not a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration. Inferred lens: attempted Accumulative/Textural, but the final image does not reweight prior material with undeniable pressure—it simply extends the pattern. Apply −0.8 for closure validity failure and −0.5 for cost illegibility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is vividly described (steel sculptures, wind-to-melody mechanism) and the hobo nickel is handled across multiple beats. However, the garden's acoustic properties do not constrain a choice or alter Elena's tactics; she places the chime and angles the nickel without friction. The nickel reappears on the pedestal at the end but does not charge the final image with cost. Micro-setting potential is present but not leveraged for pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"exchange certainty for curiosity"—is declared but never tested by a live choice. No reversal narrows options; the mural layers simply unfold in sequence. The visitor's arrival does not escalate pressure, and their laugh enables the next layer without cost to Elena. Coincidence drives the ending (reflected sound "bewitched" paint; visitor's laugh sets next layer aglow) rather than protagonist agency. No visible price or forfeited path on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Theme is over-articulated: "exchange certainty for curiosity," "certainty is a surface that can be bewitched," "true restoration was not of paint but of wonder." The final paragraph moralizes rather than offering a resonant image. The nested-awakenings concept is announced repeatedly but does not emerge from particulars or reweight prior material. Thematic Echo in the penultimate line ("the true restoration was not of paint but of wonder") triggers −0.6; overall thematic statement density lowers the score further.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. However, diction drifts into elevated register ("bewitched," "nested awakenings," "boundless curiosity") that feels more thematic than character-particular. The visitor's single line of dialogue is not distinct from narrative voice. Perceptual signature is weak: Elena's noticing does not reveal bias or professional priority. Filter verbs ("felt," "watched," "realized") stack in high-pressure beats without voice motivation, applying −0.5 in Q7 and capping 9+ eligibility.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and thematic repetition pervade: "nested awakenings" appears six times, "pause between question and reply" three times, "methodically playful" twice, all without added pressure. Template cadence: "She [verb]" opens five consecutive sentences mid-story. Stock metaphor: "shimmer and shift as if alive," "secret revealed in a dream within a dream." These artifacts dull momentum and touch the closure beat ("nested awakenings ripple through her own chest"). Apply −1.2 for spread and closure contamination, disallow 9+ globally, and cap high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>Core premise (sound restores hidden art) has potential but execution is generic: the hobo nickel's carved face and the chime's echo function as magical convenience without cost or constraint. The nested-layers motif (mural, mirrors, text, Elena herself) reads as checklist recursion rather than earned transformation. The visitor's laugh catalyzing the next layer is a forced Beat that does not arise from prior causality. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the piece hedges toward abstract wonder without grounding stakes in specific loss or friction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>Elena is present throughout but makes no choices that alter tactics or foreclose options. She places the chime and angles the nickel without resistance, then watches results unfold. Her final question to the visitor does not shift her stance or the story's outcome. Observation-dominant role; no decision with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The hobo nickel is handled in multiple beats (tilted to catch light/sound, angled to bend echo, placed on pedestal) and returns with reweighted meaning in the final image. However, its specific properties (carved face) do not constrain a choice or create cost; any reflective object could substitute with minor edits. Functional across beats but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Nested awakenings" is announced six times but remains thematic assertion. The concept does not shape stakes or tactics on the page—Elena does not choose between awakening one layer versus another, nor does a nested structure impose cost. The mural's layers and Elena's own "third layer" are told outcomes, not pressure points that alter options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Methodically playful" is labeled twice ("her methodically playful nature," "methodically playful approach") but does not constrain or enable an action with tradeoff. Elena pauses at sculptures and places a chime without friction; the trait is decoration. No visible cost or tactic shaped by this attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Bewitch" appears three times: the reflected sound "bewitched the mural's surface," "bewitched not only paint but also the very air," and "a methodically playful bewitching of the soul." The action is passive transformation (sound causes shimmer) rather than protagonist choice. Easily swappable with "activate" or "awaken." Present across beats but does not redefine options.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Reflected sound is signaled early (hobo nickel catches chime's echo, bends sound back) and its mechanics are described. However, the method does not face friction or force Elena to adapt; the setup works on first attempt. The visitor's laugh reflecting off the nickel to set the next layer aglow is coincidental payoff, not shaped by Elena's tactics. Functional but not pressure-generating.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The sound wave garden frames the scene and supplies the chime's echo as a resource. However, the garden's acoustic properties do not constrain Elena's choices or supply friction; she places the chime without testing alternate positions. The sculptures "respond with a chorus of echoes" at the end but this is atmospheric rather than causal. Shapes one beat (initial setup) but does not alter tactics or charge the closure meaningfully.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"The pause between question and reply" is invoked three times as a thematic marker but does not function as a live timeframe. No clock tightens decisions; Elena can pause indefinitely without cost. The phrase is lyric texture, not temporal pressure. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The motivation "to exchange certainty for curiosity" is articulated twice and drives the thematic arc. However, it is never dramatized through conflicted choice. Elena does not face a moment where clinging to certainty would solve a problem or where curiosity imposes visible cost. Told desire without friction or tradeoff.</comment>
