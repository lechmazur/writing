<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's core motivation (seeking the ghost to find inspiration) is clear, but her interior life leans heavily on abstract constructions: "lately inspired pulse quicken," "meaning in decay." The decision to play the final note is dramatized, yet the pivot—understanding the diva wanted remembrance not freedom—arrives via narrated insight rather than embodied contradiction. Embodied emotion appears sporadically (cello neck cold against palm, bow hovering), but peak beats favor poetic summary over micro-choices that reveal competing impulses in action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—water-stain imagery and recurring "in between spaces" build toward a reconfiguration at closure. The ending offers Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): Mara plays the note, the ghost departs, possibility replaces mourning. Cost is legible (the ghost is gone, the muse no longer external), though the shift from ghost-as-muse to self-sustained inspiration is narrated more than felt. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (flooded pit, lanterns, antique program). One minor causality question: the program "began to bleed fresh ink" and forms images during play, but the mechanics of how ink blooms under sound are asserted rather than established.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The flooded pit, lanterns, and waterlogged program supply vivid, purposeful detail that constrains Mara's movements and charges the atmosphere. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (shin-deep water, submerged stands, half-collapsed balcony). The antique program functions as micro-setting, returning with reweighted meaning when it dissolves at closure. Sensory selection (water lapping, lanterns flickering, cello neck cold) reflects the contemplative urgency. The environment directly shapes the final choice: water patterns and lantern flares respond to her playing, making the space an active participant in the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: unravel the ghost's code and decide whether to free or preserve the haunting. Mara's agency is visible in the decision to play the sequence and complete the aria. Pressure tightens across the note sequence (water moves, lanterns dim, program bleeds ink), and the final choice—play the last note—narrows options with cost (ghost departs, muse vanishes). However, the deepening ("understood the ghost's true message") is told rather than earned through prior friction, and the either/or (free or destroy) is resolved by a late insight that reframes the stakes without dramatized struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—memory, completion, and the relationship between inspiration and loss—emerges organically from the flooded opera house, the diva's unfinished aria, and Mara's silence. The "in between spaces" motif accumulates meaning: physical (pit, balcony), temporal (folded time), and creative (silence and suggestion). The ending offers a quiet, non-literal answer: Mara will compose the aria, letting the spaces "sing for themselves." Subtext operates in the wordless conversation and the water-stain cipher. Minor slip: "lately inspired in a way that needed no ghost to sustain it" edges toward thematic summary, restating rather than charging the image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single POV, third-person limited, stable throughout. Perceptual signature is present (water as "tide of forgotten melodies," shadows "danced between notes not yet played"), but the voice occasionally drifts into elevated, abstract register ("spectral diagrams," "temporal pockets where time had folded") that risks floating above Mara's immediate experience. Filter verbs ("She understood now," "She had learned") are frequent in reflective beats. Psychic distance widens during explanation ("The diva hadn't wanted to be freed; she wanted to be remembered"), flattening the final turn. No dialogue on the page to assess. Texture is lyric and consistent, though some constructions lean toward narrative summary under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with lyric texture, but several issues accumulate. Template cadence appears in the note sequence ("The first note... The second note... The third note...") without taught pattern payoff. Paraphrase loops: "amid the hush of unstruck chords" recurs verbatim three times; "in between spaces" appears six times, some ornamental. Mixed metaphor: water as "tide of forgotten melodies" clashes with "water damage creating images" as mechanical process. Register drift: "spectral diagrams," "temporal pockets," "code fulfilled" elevate diction beyond the visceral scene. Figurative density is high throughout without clear escalation or pattern. Applying patterned-artifact penalties: loops and template runs total −0.8 in Q7; slight register drift adds −0.3. Information density is moderate; some beats ("lately inspired," "wordless conversation") repeat without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The flooded opera house and ghost-as-code premise offer a fresh angle on haunting-as-muse. Water-damage-as-cipher and sound-disrupting-time are specific, non-obvious choices. However, the emotional arc—artist seeks external inspiration, realizes she must internalize it—follows a familiar template. The transformation test reveals moderate originality: swapping opera for another art form and flood for another decay would leave the arc largely intact. The "ghost wanted to be remembered, not freed" turn is signaled late and relies on insight rather than a synthesis of prior particulars. Risk-taking (lyric voice, accumulative structure) is present but does not fully elevate the material into indelible territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara (orchestra pit musician, cellist) drives all key turns: she traces the code, plays the sequence, hesitates, then chooses to play the final note. Her decision to compose the unfinished aria provides closure participation. Present early, involved in multiple beats, and her identity as musician is causally essential (only her cello can complete the diva's performance). Cost is visible: she relinquishes the ghost-muse and accepts self-sustained inspiration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The antique opera program is introduced early, handled (held to lantern, traced with bow), and returns at closure (dissolves when code is fulfilled). It maps the cipher onto the pit's architecture and bleeds fresh ink during play. Present in three beats (discovery, tracing, dissolution), but middle use (tracing with bow) is gestural—Mara follows water-stained pathways, yet the program itself does not constrain her choice as much as reveal information. Closure linkage is strong (dissolves when fulfilled), but the program functions more as key than obstacle.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"In between spaces" is introduced early and recurs throughout: physical (pit, balcony, void), temporal (folded time), and metaphysical (boundary between past and present). It shapes the premise and charges the final image ("in between spaces remained, now filled with possibility rather than mourning"). However, it primarily functions as thematic accent rather than tactical constraint—Mara does not navigate competing spatial options or lose access to a space. The concept reweights meaning at closure but does not narrow her choices in prior beats.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Lately inspired" is mentioned twice (opening and penultimate paragraph) as a label for Mara's state. It does not constrain an on-page action or create visible cost. The phrase describes her motivation to seek the ghost, but the seeking itself is driven by the custodian's whisper and the ghost legend, not by a conflict between inspiration and another value. At closure, "lately inspired in a way that needed no ghost" recaps her arc but does not tie the trait to a trade-off. Swappable with "recently moved" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Disrupt" appears throughout: Mara's playing disrupts "the delicate equilibrium," the third note "sent ripples that disrupted the stillness," and the code's resolution ends the haunting. The action is causally central—without disruption, the ghost cannot depart and the aria remains incomplete. Signaled early (equilibrium that could be destroyed) and executed across the note sequence. The final note is the decisive disruption that frees the diva. Cost is visible (ghost gone, spaces emptied of mourning). Irreplaceable: "complete" or "release" would not capture the breaking of boundary.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Water damage creating images is introduced early (program "swollen and translucent," ink blooms into diagrams) and recurs when the program bleeds fresh ink during play, forming face and gesture. The means is specific and shapes the cipher Mara must decode. However, the mechanics are asserted rather than demonstrated—how sound causes fresh ink to bleed is not established, weakening the causal link. Present in two beats (discovery, transformation during play) and linked to closure (program dissolves when code is fulfilled). Moderate irreplaceability; another medium (fire, light) could convey the ghost's message with edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The flooded opera house with flickering lanterns is introduced immediately and remains present throughout. Water depth (shin-deep), submerged stands, and half-collapsed balcony supply spatial choreography. The setting directly affects action: water patterns respond to sound, lanterns dim and flare with the notes, and the physical architecture maps the cipher. The pit's submersion is the reason the program survived (water damage) and the reason the ghost lingers (in between space). At closure, the lanterns die and emergency lights replace them, marking the shift from haunted to mundane. The setting is indispensable to the story's logic and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Amid the hush of unstruck chords" is the timeframe phrase, recurring three times. It evokes stillness and anticipation but does not function as a clock or deadline. The note sequence unfolds without time pressure—Mara hesitates ("her bow hovered"), but no external force tightens the window. The phrase is more tonal than temporal; it describes atmosphere rather than constraining decisions. Present early and at closure, but does not alter tactics or create urgency. Swappable with "in the silence before music" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Mara's motivation—to unravel the code left by a ghost—is stated early and drives her actions: she examines the program, traces the cipher, and plays the sequence. The desire is dramatized through her physical choices (holding program to light, drawing bow). However, friction between this want and a competing cost is thin: the text tells us she hesitates (free or destroy), but the stakes of that choice are narrated ("power to either free or destroy") rather than felt as competing goods. At closure, the motivation shifts (complete the aria, not just solve the puzzle), but the shift is insight-based rather than choice-tested. Present across beats and linked to closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Wordless conversation" is introduced early (ghost doesn't speak, built from silence and suggestion) and recurs four times. Tone is coherent—quiet, contemplative, layered with implication—and modulates slightly (lanterns flicker "as if breathing," ghost manifests as "pressure"). The final image integrates it: Mara "learned to listen to what wasn't there, to read the wordless conversations written in damage and decay." However, the tone remains largely static; no sharp tonal shift marks the peak choice. The phrase charges the ending but does not escalate with pressure. Moderate irreplaceability; "silent exchange" would preserve most of the effect.</comment>
