<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mira's core motivation (cataloging silence) is present but largely told rather than dramatized through difficult choices. Her method of "tuning frequencies" resolves the diary lock without meaningful internal conflict or visible trade-off; the epiphany "Silence is the shape of love when words fail" arrives as a revelation rather than being earned through embodied struggle. The neighbor's arrival in the final beats adds a character without pressure. Interiority leans on abstract phrasing ("the path to empathy," "her growing catalogue") rather than character-particular contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers silences and frequency imagery toward a thematic reconfiguration. Orientation anchors (Mira, workshop, stars, pre-fireworks stillness) arrive early. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Mira unlocks the diary, reads her father's insight, invites the neighbor, and the final image reweights "silence" from catalogued varieties to shared empathy. However, the cost is conceptual rather than felt: no on-page choice forecloses a live option or exacts a visible price. The lock opens via frequency-tuning without friction, and the neighbor's inclusion feels ambient rather than a turn that narrows Mira's path. The reconfiguration lands but lacks undeniable pressure at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The shadowed workshop under stars is anchored early with vivid, purposeful detail ("shadows pooled like ink," "worn workbench"). Sensory elements (radio crackle, starlight spill, fireworks overhead) are filtered through Mira's focus on silence and frequencies. The workshop's tools (tuning forks, vintage radio, diary clasp) are present but function more as thematic props than constraints that alter her tactics. Spatial choreography is clear (workshop interior, door opening, sky visible). The setting does not force a choice at closure; instead it provides atmosphere that supports the thematic work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recovering her father's locked memory/empathy—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through the frequency-tuning attempt, the voice discovery, and the clasp opening, but the escalation is mechanical: each step succeeds without genuine setback or forced trade-off. The diary opens because Mira finds the right frequency, not because she renounces another path or pays a visible cost. The neighbor's arrival offers potential for secondary pressure but instead diffuses tension into shared listening. One tightening (the voice discovery) narrows focus but does not foreclose options or raise stakes in a way that charges the final image with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme—empathy as tuned listening and the varieties of silence—emerges through imagery and Mira's father's line "Silence is the shape of love when words fail." The piece avoids overt moralizing in most beats, but the final third summarizes thematic payoff rather than letting the image speak: "empathy was not a destination but a constant tuning," "unlocked her own capacity for empathy." The fireworks-as-symphony metaphor and the neighbor's inclusion gesture toward universality but feel added rather than earned from prior particulars. The ending's quiet resonance is present yet diluted by expository passages that tell the reader what has been achieved.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV anchored to Mira is stable; no head-hopping. Psychic distance varies purposefully (close during frequency-tuning, slightly wider during reflection). Diction is consistent but leans toward elevated, poetic register ("thin as starlight," "hush of a held breath") that occasionally feels more authorial than character-particular. The narrative voice is distinct and lyrical, though sentence openings recur ("She…" begins many paragraphs) and some beats use template phrasing ("Mira realized," "She imagined"). Filter verbs ("she imagined," "she realized") appear frequently but are voice-motivated and do not obscure immediacy. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose is clean with vivid imagery ("shadows pooled like ink," "each bloom of color hummed with its own quiet resonance") and varied sentence rhythm in most beats. However, recurring scaffold patterns degrade momentum: "She realized" appears three times, "Mira [verb]" opens many paragraphs, and adjacent lines paraphrase the same content ("cataloguing the varieties of silence" / "describing each silence"). The workshop-silence-empathy thread is restated across multiple beats without adding new pressure. Mixed metaphor risk: "fireworks as a symphony of silence" and "explosion was the opening of empathy" blend abstract and concrete in ways that blur rather than sharpen. Stock phrases ("heart raced," "held her breath") appear in key beats. Template cadence across several "She [verb], [object]" constructions lowers density. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template cadence; −0.3 for stock metaphor in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—unlocking a diary via radio frequencies tuned to varieties of silence—offers a fresh angle on grief/empathy. However, the execution leans on familiar beats: dead parent's wisdom, locked memory device, epiphany via found recording, symbolic fireworks, and the neighbor as witness to newfound connection. The "silence as empathy" conceit is poetic but remains abstract; the frequency-tuning method is asserted rather than grounded in plausible radio mechanics or constraint. Emotional truth is present but wrapped in decorative language that softens specificity. The transformation test suggests the arc could transfer to other settings (locked box, different method) with minimal loss, indicating moderate originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira (eclectic pacifist) is present throughout. Her pacifism is label-only; her eclecticism is shown via her tool collection. She makes the decision to tune frequencies and to invite the neighbor, but neither choice involves visible cost or conflict between her pacifist stance and another pressure. Setup and closure participation are present; middle development is functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The locked diary clasp is introduced early, described multiple times ("small steel puzzle," "hidden spring," "pulse with rhythm"), and opened at the climax. It appears in at least three beats (initial description, imagining each pin as a silence, the unlock). The clasp's opening enables the thematic payoff but does not itself constrain a prior choice or exact a cost; it yields when the right frequency is found. Closure linkage is strong; causal pressure is moderate (the lock resists, then opens). Specificity is high (steel puzzle, pins, spring). The element is essential to the plot but slightly swappable (any locked container with thematic resonance could serve).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"The path to empathy" is the stated core concept and frames Mira's goal. It is present in narration ("the path to empathy lay in hearing the silence") and recurs in the ending ("the path to empathy was long"). However, it functions more as thematic label than on-page stake that alters tactics. Mira's method (frequency-tuning) and outcome (sharing silence with the neighbor) illustrate the concept but do not dramatize a conflict between empathy and another competing value. The concept shapes the thematic resolution but does not narrow options or create visible friction in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Intuitively descriptive" is mentioned once ("intuitively descriptive in her notes") and shown through Mira's cataloging of silence types ("metallic, cold, waiting"). It enables her note-taking but does not constrain or cost her in a visible way; no scene shows her intuition leading to a mistake or trade-off. The trait is functional (she describes silences) but could be replaced with "meticulous" or "poetic" without structural change. One beat involvement, minimal causal pressure, no closure linkage beyond thematic echo.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Recover" (a memory/empathy locked in the diary) is the central action driving the plot. Mira's entire effort—tuning frequencies, listening for her father's voice, opening the clasp—serves this goal. The action is present in setup, developed through the middle beats (frequency adjustment, voice discovery), and paid off at closure (reading the diary, inviting the neighbor). It is essential and irreplaceable; the story would collapse without it. Causal pressure is strong (the recovery enables the thematic turn). However, the recovery itself is achieved without visible cost or setback, slightly lowering the score from the highest band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"By tuning frequencies" is signaled early (learned from radio manuals, adjusting the dial) and used in at least two beats (listening for the right frequency, finding the one that resonates with the clasp's spring). The method is specific and irreplaceable (no other method is attempted). It shapes tactics (Mira adjusts the dial incrementally) and enables the climax. However, the mechanics are asserted rather than grounded in plausible constraint; the frequency simply "resonates" with the lock without clear cause. Causal pressure is moderate; closure linkage is strong. Early signal, two-beat involvement, moderate specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The "shadowed workshop under stars" is anchored early with vivid detail (workbench, tools, starlight spill, fireworks overhead). It provides atmosphere and houses the radio and diary, but does not constrain Mira's choices or alter her tactics. The workshop is a container for action rather than a pressure. The stars and fireworks add thematic texture (silence vs. light/sound) and are reprised in the ending image, charging the final beat. Three-gate presence (setup, middle description, closure backdrop). Moderate closure linkage via the final image; minimal causal pressure. The micro-setting (radio dial, workbench) is more functional than the macro (workshop/stars).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"In the final stillness before fireworks ignite" is present in the opening line, repeated mid-story, and paid off when fireworks burst overhead. The timeframe creates a poetic frame and a loose deadline (fireworks are imminent) but does not tighten tactics or force a rushed decision. Mira's process unfolds at her own pace; the fireworks arrive after the diary is opened, serving as symbolic punctuation rather than a clock that alters her moves. The element is more atmospheric than causal. Setup and closure reprise are strong; middle development (time pressure on choices) is absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To catalog the varieties of silence" is Mira's stated motivation, introduced early ("spent years cataloguing") and referenced multiple times. It drives her method (listening, tuning, describing) and connects to the thematic payoff (silence as empathy). However, the desire is mostly told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost. No scene shows her cataloging impulse clashing with another need (e.g., grief, impatience, fear of what she'll find). The motivation enables the plot but does not generate internal friction. Three-gate presence; moderate causal linkage; low cost visibility.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Theatrical sincerity" is present in the elevated, lyric register and the operatic imagery (fireworks, symphony of silence, "explosion of empathy"). The tone is consistent and purposeful, modulating slightly (quieter during frequency-tuning, wider during fireworks) but remaining earnest throughout. However, the sincerity occasionally tips into over-statement ("the true explosion was the opening of empathy within her") and the theatrical elements (fireworks as punctuation, neighbor as witness) feel staged rather than organic. Tone supports the thematic work but does not constrain a choice or charge the final image with additional pressure beyond what the events themselves provide. Coherent presence across the piece; minimal causal role.</comment>
