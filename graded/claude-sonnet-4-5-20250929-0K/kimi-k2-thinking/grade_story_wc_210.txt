<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kael remains a vessel for concept rather than a character with contradictory impulses. His "refusal to accept false comfort" is declared but never tested against an opposing desire on the page—no moment where restoring the literal past tempts him against his stated philosophy. The final choice to "release collective memory" feels inevitable from paragraph one rather than earned through dramatized internal conflict. Interiority consists of abstract philosophical positions ("the greatest alchemy was not transmutation but imagination") without embodied emotion or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The story establishes who/where/when by the opening paragraphs and infers an Accumulative/Textural lens. However, closure remains diffuse: the bottle "shimmers," voices fill the cove, then fade, leaving "only the lanterns, the water, and Kael's steady breath"—no decisive change in Kael's situation, no visible cost (the bottle remains sealed as intended), and the claimed transformation ("reborn as a seed") is asserted in narration rather than demonstrated through a concrete image that reweights prior material. The final paragraphs summarize weeks of settlers arriving and a civilization growing, which functions as epilogue rather than on-page closure. The cost-proof test fails: no single sentence in the ending beat makes cost legible.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cove is anchored early with "paper-lantern," "boardwalk," "bay," and sensory particulars like "rain-slicked morning" and "amber reflections that danced on the water." The setting supplies the amber bottle on Kael's doorstep and provides the bay for the lantern ritual. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or meaningfully alter tactics—Kael could perform his ritual in any location. The cove functions as atmospheric backdrop rather than active pressure, capping the score below 7.0 per the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"reimagine an entire civilization"—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page obstacle tests Kael's blueprint; he paces, conceives, sketches, places the bottle, whispers an incantation, and settlers arrive. The bottle's sealed nature is framed as a reminder rather than a problem requiring a turn. The story offers summary of conceptual transformation ("not revived, but reborn") without a reversal, tightening, or trade-off that narrows options. Agency is entirely internal and unchallenged, so escalation under the Accumulative lens depends on density or cadence shift—neither materializes in a peak beat. No visible price is paid; the epilogue grants success without complication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme—memory as generative rather than restorative—emerges through the amber bottle's sealed state and Kael's sketches. The final image of the bottle on a pedestal with lanterns glowing offers a non-literal emblem. However, the closing paragraphs ("true alchemy is not in gold, but in the courage to remember and to dream anew") state the thesis overtly rather than trusting the particulars, triggering the Thematic Echo penalty. The piece resists nostalgia in concept but does not dramatize competing pulls or cost, so the theme floats above the action rather than emerging from pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, anchored to Kael. Distance is consistent. Diction elevates at moments ("condensed breath of the town's final wish," "tapestry of possibilities") in a way that fits an alchemist-philosopher voice. However, syntactic variety is limited: many paragraphs open with "He" or "Kael" + verb, creating template cadence. Perceptual signature is generic—Kael notices concepts and symbolic objects rather than idiosyncratic sensory priorities. No dialogue appears. The voice reads competent but not distinct or rhythmically controlled under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops abound: "He refused to accept the false comfort" / "He would not settle for false comfort"; "not to resurrect" / "not a resurrected past" / "not with a resurrection"; "ghost town" recurs six times without reweighting. Template cadence runs through the middle third ("He could not crack it, but he could conceive..." / "He imagined..." / "He sketched..." / "He placed..." / "He whispered..." / "He knew..." / "He walked..."). Stock metaphors appear: "tide-worn shells," "seed of a new civilization," "scaffolding of futures." These artifacts cluster in the closure sequence, triggering the −1.7 penalty and disallowing 9+ globally. Information density is low; many sentences restate theme rather than advance situation.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The "sealed container as catalyst for transformation rather than opening" offers a modest twist on relic-quest templates. However, the ghost-town-revival frame, alchemist-as-visionary, and paper-lantern setting read as assembled genre furniture. The emotional arc—solitary philosopher conceives utopia and settlers arrive—follows a familiar Lonely Visionary Vindicated template without friction or surprise. No turn subverts expectation; the ending delivers exactly what the opening promises. Specificity is thin: "new districts," "shared memory," "blueprint of a future city" remain abstract placeholders. The derivative-premise guardrail applies: −0.8 for close match to template without lived transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Kael is present throughout and his choices (pacing, conceiving, placing the bottle, whispering the incantation) structure the plot. However, these are serial observations and enactments of a pre-formed philosophy rather than decisions that alter tactics or foreclose options. No moment shows Kael choosing between competing goods or paying a visible cost. He is functionally unopposed, so his agency does not create turns. Swappability test: a scholar, priest, or inventor could perform the same arc with minor edits. Caps at 3.8 per the swappability cap; present across all three gates but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The amber bottle appears early (rain-slicked morning), recurs in the middle (Kael trains his mind to hold its shape, weight, glow), and is placed at the center of the cove in the climax, where it "shimmers" and "glows." Three-gate presence achieved. Its sealed nature is thematically charged ("some things must remain whole to inspire new creation") and it anchors the final image on the pedestal. However, the bottle does not constrain or enable a choice with cost—it functions as talisman and symbol, not tool. Kael never struggles with it; it validates his philosophy. Strong lyric reprise and closure linkage lift the score to 6.2, but lack of causal pressure or visible trade-off prevents higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Ghost town revival frames the story and is the stated goal. Kael's sketches, lanterns, and the epilogue's arriving settlers illustrate the concept. However, the revival itself is summarized in the final paragraphs ("the ghost town revival began," "Kael's civilization grew") rather than dramatized as a choice or event with cost. The concept shapes Kael's motivation but does not generate on-page tactics or obstacles. It reads as premise and theme rather than a stake tested under pressure. Functional but largely ornamental in execution.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Rejects false comfort" is declared in paragraph five and echoed in the final third ("He would not settle for false comfort"). The trait colors Kael's philosophy—he refuses simple restoration—but it is never tested by an opposing desire or obstacle that would make rejection costly. No scene shows Kael tempted by an easy path and choosing difficulty. The attribute operates as a label rather than a constraint that enables or forecloses action. Present in setup and payoff but ornamental in development.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Conceive" appears explicitly in paragraph nine ("he could conceive a way to unlock its memory") and implicitly throughout: Kael imagines festivals, weaves memories into a tapestry, sketches blueprints, and "convinced that the greatest alchemy was...imagination." The action structures his method and recurs across beats. However, conceiving is internal and unobstructed—no moment where conception fails or costs him something tangible. The epilogue's success (settlers arrive, civilization grows) validates his conception without friction. Strong beat involvement and thematic integration, but lack of visible trade-off or obstacle prevents entry to higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Working memory" is named once in paragraph ten: "Through working memory, he trained his mind to hold the bottle's shape, weight, and faint inner glow all at once." The method is setup but not developed or paid off—no later beat shows Kael using this technique under pressure, and the climax (whispering an incantation, the bottle shimmering) does not reference memory training. The mechanics do not shape tactics or outcome. Present in setup but absent from development and payoff, triggering the missing-middle cap of 3.4. Late first appearance (past the 40% mark in a reflective paragraph) raises the score slightly to 4.6 per the late-arrival cap, but it remains functionally ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paper-lantern cove is named in the opening line and recurs throughout: the boardwalk, the bay, the water's edge, the stone pedestal. Kael places fresh lanterns around the bottle, and the cove's amber glow becomes the final image. Three-gate presence. However, the cove does not constrain Kael's choices—he could perform his ritual anywhere with lanterns and water. The setting provides atmosphere and symbolic resonance (lanterns = memory) but does not alter tactics or supply resources that affect outcome. Solid setup and payoff, weak development, lands in the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"After the last wish was granted" anchors the timeframe in the opening paragraph and establishes a post-catastrophe stasis. The phrase recurs in the penultimate paragraph ("the moment after the last wish"). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—Kael has unlimited time to pace, conceive, and build. No clock or deadline pressures his choices. The "after" functions as premise rather than constraint. Setup and payoff present, but the timeframe is inert in development, earning mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Reimagine an entire civilization" is stated in paragraph thirteen and repeated in variations throughout ("reborn as a seed of a new civilization," "reimagining of an entire civilization," "Kael's civilization grew"). The motivation frames all of Kael's actions. However, it is declared rather than dramatized through conflicting wants—no scene shows Kael desiring something smaller or easier and choosing the harder path. The epilogue grants him success without cost or friction. Strong presence across all three gates, but told-only execution and lack of on-page conflict between desire and obstacle keep the score in the low-5s.</comment>
