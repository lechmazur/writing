<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Miriam's interiority is specific (decorating with silence, using sound design as theology) and her micro-choices drive the exorcism; however, Elias remains functionally passive, a vessel rather than an agent. The entity's defeat reads as Miriam's achievement, not a conflict requiring both characters' choices. Internal contradiction is visible in Miriam's blending of faith and experimental method, but the final beat lacks visible emotional cost—she simply begins recording again without alteration or foreclosure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors solidly by the second paragraph (tower, Miriam, Elias, possession countdown). The piece teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens early—layered silence, looping questions—and closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the monastery's certainties are "subtly shaken," silence taught to speak in paradox. Cost is conceptual (undermining assumptions) but felt; the final image reweights the premise. One meaningful tightening occurs when the entity slips away under paradox pressure, satisfying the length's demand.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The bell tower and loop pedal constrain Miriam's method (she layers silence *in this space*), and the dimensional anchor monastery charges the ending by holding "between breaths." The indigo palette recurs with shifting meaning (limitation → focus → doubt's shadow), and the pedal's mechanics shape the exorcism tactics. Micro-setting qualifies: the tower's confined space and the pedal as tool both drive choices and charge the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear and urgent: save Elias before the entity settles in seven hours. One meaningful tightening occurs when the entity hesitates, confused by Miriam's paradoxes, then slips away. However, Elias exercises no agency—Miriam's method resolves the conflict without his participation, reducing the protagonist-driven pressure. Cost is present (the entity departs, Elias's hidden stillness is exposed) but the victory feels enacted upon him rather than earned through joint struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: silence as weapon, questions as levers, stillness as wound versus peace. The final image—"indigo spread across the air like a shadow cast by doubt itself"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing: certainty is the true vulnerability. The loop pedal and rhetorical devices avoid symbolic convenience by shaping tactics throughout, and the monastery's dimensional instability provides a fresh frame for faith-as-sound-design theology.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds cleanly to Miriam's perceptual signature (sound, color, theological framing). However, elevated diction at peak beats—"rhetorical device sharp enough to cut assumptions from their roots," "dimensional anchor groaned"—drifts from intimate craft voice toward abstract register. The loop pedal's mechanics are legible and voice-motivated, and psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during the exorcism, wider for the monastery frame). No head-hopping, but some phrases read as writerly ornament rather than Miriam's lived idiom under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high and sentence rhythm varies, but figurative language clusters heavily in the first half without pattern-teaching ("decorating the air with unasked questions," "a rhetorical device sharp enough to cut assumptions," "a secret so long held it had calcified into silence"). Template cadence appears in paired constructions: "She dipped... decorating," "She pressed... began to play," "She looked... now seeming." Several lines restate concepts adjacently ("stillness wasn't peace—it was a wound dressed in quiet, a secret so long held it had calcified into silence"). These accumulate to −0.6 under the patterned-artifact penalty, capping the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis—exorcism via sound design, silence as accumulated paradox, loop pedal as theological tool—feels specific and non-obvious. The priest-as-experimental-musician frame transforms the possession trope, and the dimensional monastery avoids generic gothic. However, the entity's defeat follows a recognizable pattern: enigmatic threat dissolved by specialist's method without the possessed character's participation, echoing common exorcism templates. The risk of blending theology with audio technology elevates the score, but the closure's inevitability once Miriam deploys her technique keeps it mid-high band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Miriam appears early, drives the exorcism across multiple beats (recording silence, questioning, painting circles, triggering loops), and her choices shape the closure. Her method and role are irreplaceable; swapping her for a generic exorcist would collapse the story's logic. The loop pedal priest is causally essential.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The palette appears in three beats (early description, mid-scene reflection, final image) but its one-color constraint does not visibly alter tactics—Miriam never lacks a needed color or makes a trade-off because of it. The indigo recurs with thematic weight (pigment/absence, limitation/focus, shadow of doubt) but remains ornamental to the exorcism mechanics. Removing it would weaken the lyric texture but not break the plot.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Unraveled stillness" names Elias's wound (false quiet harboring the entity) and provides the diagnostic target. It shapes Miriam's strategy (distinguish true quiet from armored secret) and reappears in the closure ("true quiet, not the armored secret"). However, the concept is primarily thematic—Elias's stillness is identified and exposed, but the exorcism mechanics (paradox, loops, questions) do not hinge on stillness versus motion as a tactic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Decorates with silence" defines Miriam's method and appears across beats: recording silence, painting circles of it, decorating the tower. The trait constrains her tactics (she uses sound design, not incantation or force) and the cost is conceptual—her work subtly shakes the monastery's certainties. The attribute is action-specific and causally active, though the visible trade-off (what she sacrifices by this method) remains implicit.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Plumb" appears explicitly in the pivotal beat: "the question plumbed depths the entity had disguised as surface," triggering Elias's momentary clarity. The verb shapes the turn—Miriam's rhetorical probing uncovers the hidden architecture—but the exorcism's success also relies on loops, silence, and paradox. Swapping "plumb" for "expose" or "penetrate" would weaken specificity but not fundamentally alter the logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Rhetorical devices are signaled early ("rhetorical device sharp enough to cut assumptions") and their mechanics drive the exorcism: unanswerable questions loop and layer, creating paradox that starves the entity of certainty. The method appears in multiple beats (the bell question, the prayer question, the ring/listening question) and the entity's defeat hinges on this exact tactic. Removing rhetorical questioning would require a full rewrite of Miriam's approach.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dimensional anchor monastery frames the setting and charges the climax ("the monastery's dimensional anchor groaned, holding firm as twelve realities briefly heard the same unanswerable question"). It provides thematic resonance (suspension between certainties) and the bell tower confines the exorcism spatially. However, the dimensional mechanics do not constrain Miriam's choices or supply resources that alter her tactics—she would perform the same exorcism in a non-dimensional chapel.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The seven-hour deadline is declared early but never tracked or tightened on the page. Miriam does not race the clock, adjust her method due to time pressure, or mention elapsed hours. The possession's completion threat provides initial urgency but does not shape tactics or escalate the middle beats, functioning as static motivation rather than a live constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Illuminating hidden assumptions is dramatized through Miriam's questions and the entity's confusion when certainty is denied. The motivation shapes her tactics (rhetorical probing rather than force) and the closure (the monastery's certainties subtly shaken, assumptions made visible). Friction appears when her method risks destabilizing the monastery itself, and the cost—exposing Elias's "hidden architecture of faith"—is legible. The motivation is specific and causally active.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Muffled clarity" is embodied in the loop pedal's effect ("every word meant itself and its opposite at once") and sustained through paradoxical phrasing, layered silence, and the final image of indigo as doubt's shadow. The tone modulates under pressure—becomes denser and more paradoxical as the exorcism intensifies—and charges the closure by reweighting certainty as vulnerability. The tonal signature is coherent and purposeful throughout.</comment>
