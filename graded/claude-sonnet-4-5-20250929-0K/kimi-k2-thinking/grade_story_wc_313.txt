<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Nora's motivation to "spin stories into shared meaning" shapes her gathering of evidence, but her interior life remains thin—we see observation more than contradiction or embodied struggle. The decision to "expunge the official report" arrives without visible cost or competing impulse; she moves through discovery with vigilant competence but no dramatized friction between her grandmother's stories and her present role. Embodiment is sparse: "quiet resolve" and "weight of the past lift" are abstract labels rather than physical states. The closing lantern metaphor feels imposed rather than earned through prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: Nora gathers fragments (label, photographs, memory) toward a final writing act that reweights the town's history. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure unit—writing the truth and stepping back into the night with resolve—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: she commits to a path), but the cost is asserted ("weight of the past lift") rather than shown in a forfeited option or tactile price. The tightening from discovery to documentation is present but gentle, without a sharp turn that narrows her choices on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ridgeway, reservoir, mud, and levee station provide concrete spatial grounding. The sapphire label and photographs function as micro-setting objects that guide Nora's path and charge the final writing scene—the lantern casting blue glow across workers' faces directly shapes the closure image. Sensory detail (damp earth, old wood, coyote call) is selective and filtered through her warden's attention. Minor slip: "midnight ridgeway at twilight" is a temporal contradiction that slightly muddies the opening anchor.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: correct the hidden crime and share the truth. Nora's agency moves from discovery to resolve without meaningful opposition or a choice that forecloses an alternate path with visible cost. The trail of photographs deepens her understanding (mother's memory surfaces), but no reversal tests her commitment—no competing pressure from remaining residents, no risk articulated on the page. The writing act is purposeful but unfolds without friction; we're told she feels "quiet resolve" rather than witnessing a trade-off or sacrifice that alters her tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—truth submerged and the power of shared narrative—emerges through concrete images (drowned town, sapphire label, mirrored hush) rather than overt statement. The closing image of Nora carrying truth "like a lantern" and weaving it "into the shared fabric" leans slightly toward metaphor assertion but remains anchored in her writing act. The poisoned-water reveal and the authorities' cover-up raise moral stakes, yet the piece never dramatizes a counter-reading or complicating friction; the theme resolves cleanly without the ambiguity promised by "stories...teeming beneath."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV third-person limited with stable distance and a measured, slightly formal register ("precisely humane," "mirrored hush") that suits Nora's vigilant role. Perceptual signature is consistent—she notices labels, photographs, structural remains—but the lexicon occasionally drifts into elevated diction ("expunge," "perfume of resurrection") that feels authorial rather than character-rooted. No dialogue appears. Focalization is clean; no head-hopping. The prose rhythm remains steady but doesn't modulate sharply under pressure, maintaining a lyric evenness even at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Clarity and grammar are strong; spatial choreography tracks cleanly. Overwriting appears in stacked metaphor and near-paraphrase: "mirrored hush" recurs three times with slight synonym variation ("silent sky," "mirrored hush outside had deepened"); "spin the fragments...into a story" and "weave the fragments into a narrative" are conceptual loops. The closure paragraph ("she carried the truth like a lantern, ready to spin it") echoes prior phrasing without added pressure. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she imagined") are present but not excessive. Line-level density is moderate; several beats narrate observation without advancing choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The drowned-town premise and the uncovering-hidden-crime arc follow familiar template patterns (environmental disaster as cover-up, lone investigator restores truth). Nora's warden role and the sapphire label provide texture, but the emotional and plot trajectory—discovery, memory, resolve, documentation—is predictable. The mirrored-hush motif and the lantern-as-truth metaphor gesture toward lyricism but do not transform the premise into a surprising synthesis. No bold structural risk or non-obvious angle reshapes the material; the ending delivers the expected resolution without complication or counter-pressure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Nora is present across all beats and makes the final choice to write and share the truth. However, her decisions are observational and resolute rather than conflicted or costly; she walks, discovers, remembers, writes—each step is additive rather than a turn that forecloses an alternate path. She is the protagonist, but vigilance without dramatized internal friction or external obstacle keeps her score mid-band. Frictions: no visible cost tied to her warden role (−0.6), late-story writing act (−0.4), swappable with another truth-seeker archetype (−0.5).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The sapphire-hued label appears in three beats: discovery in mud, memory link to grandmother's stories, and final scene where lantern light casts blue glow across photographs. It functions as a recognition cue and charges the closure image. Setup early (+0.6), three beats (+1.4), closure linkage (+0.9). Frictions: does not constrain a choice or narrow options (−0.7), primarily observational rather than tactical (−0.4). The label's vividness and color motif elevate it above ornamental, but it does not alter Nora's path—removing it would weaken atmosphere but not break causality.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The resurfacing reservoir frames the entire story and provides the inciting access to Oakhaven's remains. It shapes Nora's goal (preserve drowned history) and supplies the trail of evidence. Setup immediate (+0.8), beat involvement across discovery and memory (+0.9), closure participation (mirrored reservoir in final paragraph, +0.8). Frictions: the concept is backdrop more than active pressure—water recedes passively, enabling discovery without complicating her choices (−0.6), swappable with other disaster-reveal scenarios (−0.5). It is essential to the premise but does not dynamically constrain tactics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Precisely humane" is introduced early as a defining trait. It guides "inspection logs and quiet conversations" and implies care in her documentation. Setup by paragraph three (+0.4). Frictions: label-only with no on-page action where precision or humanity forecloses an option or incurs cost (−1.0), no scene where the trait is tested against a competing impulse (−0.8), easily swappable with "diligent" or "compassionate" (−0.6). The attribute colors her character but does not drive a beat or choice; it remains descriptive rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Expunge" appears once in the resolution phase: "Nora resolved to expunge the official report that blamed a flood and to preserve the truth." It names her goal and drives the writing act at closure. Setup mid-story (+0.3), closure linkage as stated intent (+0.7), beat involvement in final writing scene (+0.4). Frictions: late introduction (second half, −0.4), the action is declared and then narrated in summary ("She began to write...she wrote of...") rather than dramatized with tactical choices (−0.7), swappable with "correct" or "revise" (−0.5). It shapes her resolve but is not irreplaceable or tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The trail of photographs structures the middle: Nora follows them from crate to memory to writing table. Setup after label discovery (+0.5), two beats (discovery, memory trigger, +0.9), closure participation (spread on table, blue glow, +0.9). Frictions: the trail is spatial rather than a puzzle or obstacle—she gathers them without complication (−0.6), swappable with letters or ledgers (−0.5). The method provides concrete steps and charges the final image, but does not impose a challenge or cost; it is a delivery mechanism rather than a contested means.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The midnight ridgeway frames the entire walk and anchors spatial movement from porch to levee station. It provides the vantage over the reservoir and the path Nora traverses. Setup immediate (+0.8), beat involvement across discovery and transit (+0.9), closure touchpoint ("end of the ridgeway," +0.5). Frictions: temporal contradiction ("midnight...at twilight," −0.4), primarily scenic rather than constraining choices—Nora walks unimpeded (−0.5). The ridgeway is integral to the story's geography and atmosphere, but does not pressure her decisions; removing it would require re-mapping but not re-plotting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The wind chime falling silent opens and closes the story as a symbolic marker. It signals the start of Nora's walk and returns in the final paragraph as "still silent," suggesting alignment of past and present. Setup first line (+0.8), closure reprise (+0.7). Frictions: no middle development—it does not constrain pacing or choices (−1.2), purely atmospheric without causal pressure (−0.8), swappable with any liminal signal (−0.5). The timeframe functions as a lyric bracket rather than a ticking clock; it does not alter tactics or impose urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Nora's desire "to spin the fragments of Oakhaven's past into a story the whole valley could share" is stated early and drives her gathering and writing. Setup by paragraph seven (+0.5), beat involvement in collection and documentation (+0.9), closure linkage ("weave the fragments," "carried the truth," +0.9). Frictions: told more than dramatized—no scene where sharing conflicts with another goal or incurs a visible cost (−0.9), swappable with generic "preserve history" (−0.5). The motivation is clear and consistent, but lacks friction or competing impulse to elevate it above functional.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Mirrored hush" recurs as motif and governs the story's atmosphere: silent wind chime, still reservoir, quiet night, lantern-lit writing. Setup early (paragraph one's silence) and reprised multiple times, including closure ("mirrored hush outside had deepened"). The tone is coherent and modulates subtly—discovery is measured, memory is reflective, writing is resolute. Frictions: the hush is consistent but static, not shifting sharply under pressure (−0.6), repetition of "mirrored hush" and synonyms ("silent sky") edges toward motif-checking (−0.4). The tone charges the final image effectively but does not transform or tension the concept.</comment>
