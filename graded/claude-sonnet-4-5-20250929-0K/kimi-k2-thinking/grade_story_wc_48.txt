<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The protagonist is assigned clear motivation (collecting abandoned hopes) and the final gesture of planting the shell offers a visible choice. However, interiority relies heavily on abstract claims ("lucidly watchful," "conflicted no longer") rather than embodied contradictions acting simultaneously in scene. The younger-self encounter hints at internal friction but dissolves before it can pressure a dramatized trade-off. Emotional progression flattens into declarative resolution without the messy irrationality that would earn the transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: mist and shell recur, ghosts multiply, density increases toward the shell-planting moment. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first lines. Closure exists—shell into earth, transformation declared—but the cost remains asserted ("lighter," "finally free") rather than shown through a forfeited option or visible constraint. The piece teaches its pattern (lyric recursion of prompts) but the final reconfiguration lacks the sharp felt price that would elevate it beyond competent execution.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The feral nexus and mist anchor the setting early and recur throughout. The shell is handled twice (raised to lips, pressed into earth), which offers micro-setting function. However, the environment remains atmospheric backdrop—no door, tool, or terrain choice narrows the protagonist's options or alters tactics. The final image involves the shell-as-seed, but the nexus itself does not constrain the planting decision; the protagonist could perform the same act anywhere misty.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (witness and release abandoned hopes) is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through cameo encounters, each adding density. One tightening occurs when the younger self appears, prompting the shell-crack release. Yet no live option is foreclosed on the page—no character refuses a safer path, no resource is spent that changes later tactics. The soldier's song and mother's smile deepen texture but do not narrow the protagonist's choices or impose a trade-off with legible cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme (the cost of artistic editing, redemption through witness) emerges from particulars: burned novel, footnote mother, clipped-wing boy. The shell-as-key and the spiral-hope motif recur with shifting resonance. However, the final paragraph states the theme overtly ("finally knows the difference between writing lives and living them"), which replaces scene pressure with summation. The piece resists moralizing until the end, where it tilts toward thematic echo, reducing the non-literal charge of the closure image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Single-POV with consistent third-person limited; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (ink metaphors, writer-world diction) but the voice converges on a uniform lyric register across all emotional beats—grief, recognition, release sound identical in syntax and rhythm. Under peak stress (younger-self encounter, shell-crack moment), the prose does not compress or shift cadence; it maintains the same swirling, decorative texture throughout. Psychic distance remains stable, but the lack of modulation flattens emotional progression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Severe loop and scaffold debt. Prompt phrases recur as decorative anchors without advancing pressure: "lucidly watchful" (lines 3, 14, 24, 34), "against the current" (lines 4, 10, 20, 25, 36, 38), "ephemeral cameo appearances" (lines 5, 19, 28), "swirling hush" (lines 14, 15, 23, 30, 37), "inside the whisper of closing pages" (lines 3, 10, 19, 29, 33, 39). Template cadence runs across multiple paragraphs: "He + [verb]" stems repeat without variation. Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence (mist coils, ink wades, laughter spirals, paper turns to fog) without coherent vehicle logic—mist as question mark, shell as period, nexus as reader. Mixed metaphors and synonym churn ("ephemeral," "fleeting," "brief") obscure propulsion. The closure beat ("pressed the shell into earth as a scribe presses a final period") is itself a metaphor, reducing the physical act's immediacy. Apply −1.4 for pervasive loops and template cadence; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per artifact rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Core premise (writer confronts abandoned characters in liminal space) is a familiar metafictional trope. The piece transforms it through specific details: the burned soft novel, the boy who dreamed flight, the mother as footnote. However, the resolution—planting the shell to seed wild stories—reads as symbolic convenience rather than an earned physical or social consequence. The spiral-shell fragment and feral-nexus combination feel ornamental rather than inevitable. The piece commits to its lyric frame but hedges the final emotional cost with abstract declarations of freedom, avoiding the bold specific choice that would make this angle singular.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Present throughout; conflict (artist vs. human) is declared but not dramatized through competing on-page choices. The novelist observes ghosts, nods, touches a shoulder, plants the shell—actions that align rather than clash. The younger-self encounter hints at a turn but dissolves without forcing a trade-off. Mentioned in final paragraph as "conflicted no longer," signaling resolution via summary. Setup clear, middle touches present, closure references the transformation, but no single beat shows the novelist choosing between two live options with visible cost. Two gates met (setup, payoff); development is observational. Band: functional role, not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Introduced in paragraph 2, handled twice (raised to lips paragraph 13, pressed into earth paragraph 24), and referenced as seed in paragraph 25. Three distinct beats: arrival, solemnization gesture, planting. The shell's spiral properties recur (memory of alien tides, calcium whorls, ancient spiral) and it serves as the mechanism for collecting and releasing hopes. Closure linkage strong: the planting transforms it into "seed for new stories." However, the shell does not constrain a choice—the protagonist could witness and release without it. Cost is claimed but not shown as forfeited option. Setup early, development in middle beats, payoff at closure; causal role present but swappable with another ritual object. Apply +0.9 (two beats), +0.8 (closure linkage), +0.4 (early signal), −0.6 (swappability). Band: essential across beats, not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Phrase recurs eight times as lyric anchor: "against the current of forgetting" (line 4), "against the current of expected endings" (line 10), "against the current of his cynicism" (line 20), "against the current of finality" (line 23), "against the current of his hardened craft" (line 27), "against the current of all he was taught" (line 36), "against the current" (line 39). Operates as theme rather than tactic—no on-page moment where swimming against a literal or social current changes the protagonist's options. The concept charges the final image philosophically but does not narrow a choice. Setup implicit, development thematic, closure participation as motif reprise. Apply +0.8 (closure reprise), +0.3 (early signal), −0.7 (ornamental in middle beats), −0.5 (thematic rather than tactical). Band: lyric resonance without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Appears four times as label: "lucidly watchful" (paragraphs 3, 14, 24, 34). Described but never dramatized—no moment where heightened awareness enables a perception others miss or costs the protagonist an emotional buffer. The trait is claimed at closure ("lucidly watchful, into whatever story comes next") without prior on-page tradeoff. Setup present as descriptor, middle use repetitive without cost, closure mentions it. No causal constraint or enabling act tied to the attribute. Apply +0.3 (early signal), −0.8 (label-only across all uses), −0.5 (no cost). Band: present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>First mentioned paragraph 7 ("came to solemnize them"), enacted paragraph 13 ("breathing a solemnization"), repeated paragraph 18 ("nods...solemnizing the dream"), and referenced paragraph 32 ("to solemnize the ephemeral"). The action frames the narrative goal and recurs across multiple encounters. However, it remains gestural—raising the shell, nodding—without imposing cost. The shell-planting is the decisive act; "solemnize" is the thematic gloss rather than the causal engine. Setup early, middle beats touch it, closure references it but the climax is "planting," not "solemnizing." Apply +0.9 (two beats), +0.4 (early signal), +0.5 (closure linkage), −0.6 (swappable with "honor" or "witness"), −0.4 (summary-only in key beats). Band: functional frame, not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Ghosts introduced paragraph 5, recur paragraphs 8–11 (girl, old man, soldier), 21–22 (young mother, boy), and 32 (younger self). Method is signaled early and sustained: each cameo supplies a hope-fragment that the novelist collects. The mechanics matter—each ghost prompts recognition, solemnization gesture, then dissolution—but the method does not constrain tactics; the protagonist could collect through memory or manuscript. Final ghost (younger self) triggers the shell-crack release, strongest causal link. Setup early, development across multiple beats, closure participation indirect (ghosts "seed new stories" off-page). Apply +1.4 (three beats), +0.8 (early signal), +0.5 (closure linkage), −0.7 (swappable with flashbacks or visions), −0.4 (summary of involvement). Band: essential method, not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Introduced paragraph 1, recurs in paragraphs 14, 19, 24, 29, 34. Described as responsive ("leans closer, listening") and transformed (becomes seed-ground for shell). The nexus supplies atmosphere and symbolic charge but does not constrain choice—no locked door, impassable terrain, or resource the protagonist must locate within it. The setting houses the action rather than pressuring it. Setup immediate, middle beats reference it, closure links it (nexus fades after shell planted). Apply +0.8 (early signal), +0.7 (closure linkage), −0.8 (postcard function, no tactical constraint), −0.3 (could occur in any liminal mist-space). Band: atmospheric container, not causal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Phrase recurs six times: paragraphs 3, 10, 19, 29, 33, 39. Time is metaphorical ("inside the whisper of closing pages") rather than a live clock. The urgency is claimed ("last page turns") but no on-page countdown or tightening window forces faster choices. The protagonist moves at contemplative pace throughout; no moment where time pressure alters tactics. Setup early, middle beats repeat the phrase, closure mentions it. Apply +0.8 (early signal), +0.5 (closure reprise), −0.8 (metaphorical rather than tactical), −0.5 (no urgency constraint). Band: lyric frame without causal tightening.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Stated paragraph 7 ("came to...collect"), enacted across ghost encounters (paragraphs 8–22), and referenced at closure (paragraph 32, "to collect shapes...and let them breathe"). Motivation is clear and sustained, driving the sequence of cameo meetings. However, it operates as thematic goal rather than conflicted want—no moment where collecting a painful hope costs the protagonist comfort or safety. The desire is friction-free; all ghosts cooperate. Setup early, middle beats dramatize collection acts, closure fulfills it. Apply +0.9 (two beats), +0.8 (early signal), +0.7 (closure linkage), −0.7 (told desire without on-page conflict or cost). Band: functional driver, not pressured by friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Phrase recurs five times: paragraphs 14, 15, 23, 30, 37. Tone is consistent—elegiac, lyric, measured—across all beats including peak moments (younger-self encounter, shell-crack). Coherence is high but modulation is absent; no cadence shift when pressure should spike. The final image uses "swirling hush" to carry the protagonist forward, charging the closure with the established mood. Setup early, sustained in middle, closure reprise strong. Apply +0.8 (early signal), +0.7 (closure linkage), +0.4 (coherence), −0.6 (static mood without modulation under pressure). Band: coherent but unchanging.</comment>
