<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's interior world is richly evoked through her telepathic plant connection and her dream of a sanctuary archive, but her final choice feels predetermined rather than genuinely conflicted—she never seriously weighs the empire's offer on the page, only performs the refusal. The decision to hide the violin and plant the seed arrives without visible cost or foreclosed paths; the "mulberry ache" is named but not embodied as competing impulses acting simultaneously. Her expertise as a provenance researcher shapes atmosphere but doesn't constrain her climactic choice in a legible way.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when early (provenance researcher, velvet observatory, midsummer) and teaches an accumulative/textural lens through layered imagery. However, the closure—planting the seed and denying the empire—lands with asserted rather than dramatized cost: the "mulberry ache" softens into "quiet certainty" without on-page friction or a visible price paid. The envoy's departure is narrated in summary ("told the envoy... the envoy left"), eliding the refusal beat that should carry weight. The final image reweights prior material but the cost remains conceptual and oblique, preventing full resonance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The velvet observatory at midsummer is vividly rendered with night-blooming jasmine, brass dish, and velvet-draped telescope; these details anchor POV and create a lived-in sensory world. The jasmine plant constrains Lira's final choice by whispering "Plant the seed in the heart of the observatory," directly shaping her action. Spatial choreography is mostly clear, though the "central garden" appears only at the planting beat without prior establishment. The setting charges the final image and the micro-setting (plant as informant) alters tactics, meeting the 9+ gate criteria for constraint and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Lira's dream of a free archive versus the empire's exploitation—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, the story lacks an on-page tightening or reversal: the envoy arrives, Lira refuses (off-page), and the resolution unfolds as planned without a visible tradeoff or narrowed options. The seed's discovery provides new information but doesn't force a difficult choice; Lira's decision to plant it and hide the violin feels like the only path she ever considered. The "promise losing its glow" timeframe is declared but never tested with urgency or a live clock that alters her moves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of autonomy versus exploitation emerges organically from the ice-crystal violin, the seed, and Lira's choice to plant rather than surrender. The final image of the seed growing and the violin waiting offers a resonant, non-literal answer to whether dreams can resist empires. However, the closing lines drift toward overt thematic statement: "some dreams are worth more than empires, and some seeds must be planted before the promise loses its glow" reads as a summary moral rather than an image that trusts the reader to infer. The perforated-destiny motif is poetic but remains more decorative than causally essential.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Lira with distinct sensory filtering (telepathic plant whispers, coffee-stain divination). The prose carries a lyric, slightly elevated register that fits the velvet-observatory setting but occasionally drifts into ornamental phrasing: "the mulberry ache of a decision," "promise that had once glowed like a dewdrop on a spider's web." The envoy's dialogue is summarized rather than dramatized, missing an opportunity for subtext and voice distinction. Purposeful compression is evident but at peak beats—the refusal and the planting—the narrative summarizes rather than dramatizing, dulling immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The prose is often lush and image-rich, but density of figurative language in nearly every sentence creates texture overload: "velvet shadows," "ghost-lines," "dewdrop on a spider's web," "torn veil," "mulberry ache," "golden cage" accumulate without propulsive pressure. Several beats loop conceptually: the promise "losing its glow" is restated three times without added specificity. Key action beats (finding the seed, confronting the envoy, planting the seed) are summarized rather than dramatized, reducing momentum. Filter verbs ("she saw," "she felt," "she knew") stack in the final third, dulling immediacy. Template cadence in the closing paragraphs ("The stain showed... Her telepathy... Lira smiled... She picked up...") flattens rhythm. Artifacts touch the closure sequence, disqualifying 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ice-crystal violin housing a frozen seed is a fresh synthesis, and the accidental plant telepathy adds specificity. However, the core conflict—lone researcher defying corporate empire to preserve autonomy—follows a familiar template without a sharp moral calculus or non-obvious turn. The coffee-stain divination and perforated-destiny framing are poetic but feel ornamental rather than causally essential. The ending's quiet refusal and sanctuary vision are emotionally honest but predictable; Lira's choice is foreshadowed from the opening and never seriously tested by a credible temptation or cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's role as provenance researcher frames her twelve-year search and her dream of a library-sanctuary, shaping her motivation throughout. Her expertise informs her discovery of the hidden compartment in the violin (a key middle beat) and her final choice to preserve the seed's autonomy rather than surrendering it. However, her professional skills don't constrain her climactic decision in a visible way—her choice is driven more by ethical stance than by any provenance-specific insight or cost. The role is present across setup, middle, and ending, but the causal pressure it exerts on her final action is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ice-crystal violin appears in the opening line, anchors the empire's interest (biotech key), and houses the hidden seed that Lira discovers in the middle. It reappears in the ending as a "transparent memorial" on a pedestal, now hollow and silent, charging the final image with the cost of its emptying. The object is handled in at least three distinct beats (opening, seed discovery, final placement) and its evolving state—full, then emptied, then enshrined—reweights its meaning. However, the violin itself is not played or used in a tactile, pressure-laden way; it functions more as a container and symbol than as a tool that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Perforated destiny is introduced early ("the perforated destiny that hung like a torn veil") and returns in the final sequence ("the perforated destiny... was simply a pattern of choices, each hole a place where something new could grow"). It frames Lira's sense of agency and choice, but it never constrains her options on the page—she reads it via coffee stains and reflects on it, yet her tactics and final decision would work identically without this concept. The closure thematically reprices the metaphor, but the concept remains decorative rather than causally load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira's accidental telepathy with plants is established early (laboratory accident, leaves murmuring history) and directly enables the jasmine plant's instruction: "The seed sleeps within the scroll" leads her to discover the hidden compartment, and "Plant the seed in the heart of the observatory" shapes her final action. The trait constrains her choices by providing knowledge unavailable through ordinary means and charges the ending when "the young shoot... murmured gratitude." The telepathy is present in setup, middle discovery, and closure, with visible on-page consequences. Cost is implied (the burden of hearing plant histories) but not foregrounded; the trait mostly enables rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Propagate appears as the empire's goal (propagate drought-resistant flora via the seed's genetic key) and as Lira's counter-action (planting the seed to "propagate a garden of memory"). The concept drives the central conflict: the empire wants to exploit the seed, Lira wants to preserve it. Her final choice to plant the seed in the observatory's garden is the climactic act, and the closing image shows "the seed grew... the future... was no longer a veil but a garden." The action is present in setup (empire's aim), middle (seed discovery), and closure (planting), shaping two major turns and the ending's charge. Without propagation, the story's stakes and resolution collapse.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Reading the future in coffee stains is introduced early as the grandmother's method and Lira uses it twice: pouring espresso into a brass dish before the envoy arrives (sees "a shape like a broken crown") and again after planting the seed (sees "a single, unbroken circle"). The method signals her attempt to foresee outcomes and the final reading offers closure validation. However, the coffee divination doesn't constrain her tactics—she doesn't adjust her plan based on what she sees, and the readings feel more like thematic commentary than plot drivers. The mechanics are present but the method is more atmospheric than causally essential.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The velvet observatory at midsummer is established in the second line and anchors every scene: velvet shadows, night-blooming jasmine, brass dish, velvet-draped telescope, and the central garden where Lira plants the seed. The observatory's garden provides the resource that enables her climactic choice (a place to plant the seed), and the "midnight sun of midsummer" marks the timeframe. The jasmine plant within the observatory whispers instructions, directly shaping her action. The setting is present in setup, middle, and ending, and the micro-setting (plant as informant, garden as sanctuary) alters tactics and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "before the promise loses its glow" is declared early ("Tonight, the promise... was dimming") and returns in the final paragraph ("some seeds must be planted before the promise loses its glow"). However, the clock is never made urgent—there's no on-page evidence of how much time remains or what happens if the promise fades. The envoy's arrival could represent the deadline, but Lira's response is calm and the timeframe doesn't visibly tighten her decisions. The element frames emotional stakes but doesn't function as a live constraint that alters moves.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lira's desire to weigh her dream of a free archive against the empire's offer is stated early and drives the central conflict. She reflects on the trade-off ("funding for her library, security for the violin, but at the cost of the seed's autonomy") and makes a choice at the climax (hiding the violin, planting the seed). However, the weighing is told rather than dramatized—Lira never seriously considers the empire's offer on the page, and her decision feels preordained. The motivation is present across setup, middle reflection, and closure, but the friction between wants and costs is conceptual rather than embodied in contradictory impulses or visible hesitation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Mulberry ache is named once in the middle ("the mulberry ache of a decision that was both loss and liberation") and reprised near the end ("The mulberry ache in her chest softened into a quiet certainty"). The tone aims for wistful melancholy but is asserted via label rather than built through rhythm and image. The prose throughout is lush and slightly elegiac, which coheres with the intended tone, but "mulberry ache" itself is ornamental—the story would carry the same emotional charge without this specific phrase. The element is present in setup (implicit in "dimming promise") and ending (explicit reprise) but doesn't modulate with pressure or distinctly shape the final image.</comment>
