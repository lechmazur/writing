<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Adrian's motivation is declared but not embodied through contradictory impulses under pressure. His "quiet obsession" with ethical storytelling remains abstract exposition rather than lived conflict; we're told he grew "sick of beautifying lies" but never see him struggle with that choice in scene. The audience members (trucker, dealer, woman) experience micro-epiphanies but their reactions are summarized rather than enacted through concrete choices with visible cost. Interior life defaults to elegant description ("traced phantom serifs") rather than messy, pressured thought.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increase through layered backward-told tales building to the final image of Adrian tracing "a signature in negative space." Closure qualifies as Conceptual Repricing—the final act of un-telling reweights the premise—but the cost remains conceptual and oblique rather than felt; we're told the audience reacts but the price to Adrian himself (beyond "the hush now his only companion") is asserted, not dramatized. The because/therefore linkage between individual puppet tales and audience transformation is loose; coincidence (the right people happen to be present) enables rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The decommissioned radar dome is vividly rendered with purposeful detail: "cracked parabolic ceiling," "rusted girders," "single functioning CRT monitor." The setting meaningfully constrains the final image—"the parabolic dish above them concentrating the quiet like a prayer"—charging the closure moment. Spatial choreography remains clear (curtain of parachute silk, front row, bar) and the Cold War relic functions as both literal stage and thematic echo of Adrian's project to reverse manufactured truths.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Adrian's project to "reverse something fundamental about stories themselves"—is signaled early but remains abstract. One meaningful tightening occurs when the puppet show begins and audience members experience backward narrative; however, escalation is delivered through summary ("the trucker saw," "the dealer saw") rather than dramatized choices under mounting pressure. Agency at closure is minimal: Adrian packs his stick and traces a serif, acts of completion rather than renunciation with visible cost. The reversal method (backward tales strip moral certainty) is conceptually interesting but does not narrow Adrian's options or force a trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—ethical storytelling as un-telling, erasure of justification—emerges from the backward puppet structure rather than statement. The final image ("a signature in negative space," "un-tell the world into clarity") offers a resonant answer without moralizing. However, thematic claims ("every story is a series of erasures") are stated mid-text rather than fully dramatized, and the piece toggles between showing the method and explaining its philosophy. The woman's realization and the meteor-hush moment carry genuine weight, but Adrian's arc defaults to demonstration rather than conflicted discovery.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single-POV third-person focalization holds; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present ("traced phantom serifs," "knotting fishing line with deliberate clumsiness") but diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels authorial rather than Adrian's lived thought ("epiphanies of the dome's flickering bulbs," "meteor hush fell—not from space, but from realization"). Free indirect style is mostly clean, though filter verbs ("he intended," "he had grown sick") cluster without clear voice motivation. Purposeful compression in the puppet-show sequence works, but some lines read as thematic essay rather than Adrian's immediate perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; no major loops or scaffold. However, figurative language clusters heavily in descriptive passages ("fury still smoking in the corners like spent cordite," "shadows that seemed to swallow the present and exhale the past") without clear pattern-teaching or payoff at closure. Template cadence appears in the audience-reaction sequence: "The trucker saw... The dealer saw... The woman... saw" repeats structure across three beats. Minor register drift into abstract diction ("moral certainty," "raw choices," "narrative gave her permission") in peak moments. The final paragraph's metaphoric density ("bruised with dawn," "signature in negative space") charges the ending but borders on overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—subversive puppet shows that tell stories backward in a decommissioned Cold War radar dome—is specific and fresh. The reversal structure (grave to cradle, reconciliation to first glance) transforms a familiar trope (artist-as-truth-teller) through concrete method. Execution is committed and coherent, with the parabolic dish charging the closure image. However, the core emotional arc (Adrian's personal stake in ethical storytelling) remains under-developed; he demonstrates rather than risks. The seedy-bar-as-laboratory setup and the artist-wandering-to-next-venue frame are familiar beats elevated by specificity of setting and method.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Adrian appears early and his choices (preparing the show, selecting tales, knotting fishing line) drive the sequence. However, his decisions lack visible cost or friction; he executes his plan smoothly without obstacle or internal conflict that would test commitment. The final choice to "find another Dish" is iterative rather than transformative.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The campfire story stick is introduced early with backstory, handled physically across multiple beats (knotting fishing line, held up to the bulb, packed at the end), and charged with ancestral weight. It shapes the method—no brushes or parchment—and appears in the final image ("packed his single stick, its work done"). Specificity (bark worn smooth, notches for fishing line) makes it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Half-lit epiphanies" is mentioned once as a phrase ("in the half-lit epiphanies of the dome's flickering bulbs") and governs the audience's experience, but it does not constrain Adrian's choices or alter tactics. The concept is present thematically but not as a pressure that changes on-page options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Uncommonly serene" is applied as a label ("uncommonly serene grace") but does not constrain or enable action with visible cost. Adrian's serenity is asserted, not tested; it never clashes with the environment or forces a trade-off in a high-pressure moment.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The act of reversing—telling tales backward—is central to the method, shapes every beat of the puppet show, and defines the closure concept (un-telling the world into clarity). The reversal structure drives audience reaction and the final image. Removing it would collapse the story's logic entirely.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Subversive puppet shows in seedy bars are signaled early ("The method was through subversive puppet shows in seedy bars"), enacted in the middle beats (paper silhouettes, fishing line, backward tales), and the seedy-bar setting (The Dish) is active throughout. However, the "subversive" quality is thematic rather than mechanical; the story could function with minor edits as straightforward puppet performance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The decommissioned radar dome provides vivid detail (parabolic ceiling, rusted girders, CRT monitor) that charges the closure image: "the parabolic dish above them concentrating the quiet like a prayer." The setting enables the performance space (curtain of parachute silk) and the Cold War relic motif reinforces the theme of manufactured truth. It constrains the atmosphere and shapes the final beat.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The timeframe "in the hush left behind by a heated argument" is invoked early and the hush recurs as "meteor hush" at closure, but it does not tighten decisions or function as a live clock. The temporal window is vague (one evening, untracked duration) and does not alter Adrian's tactics or audience choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The motivation to explore ethical storytelling is declared in exposition and referenced again mid-text ("grown sick of beautifying lies"), but it is never dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost on the page. Adrian's project succeeds without friction; we do not see him tested or forced to trade one value for another.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" is introduced as "that heavy silence when truth enters atmosphere and burns away your certainties" and anchors the closure paragraph ("the meteor hush, his only companion"). The tone modulates with pressure—early tension, performance focus, quiet realization—and the hush charges the final image. However, the metaphor is explained rather than embodied, reducing its potency.</comment>
