<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's face blindness is conceptually vivid and her methodical ritual (photographing, logging) shows embodied process. However, the core character arc—from "empathy died" to "empathy wasn't dormant anymore"—is asserted rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final image presents her realization as a tidy epiphany ("waiting for her blindness to become a different kind of sight") without the visible cost or foreclosed path required for meaningful change at this length.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors orientation cleanly (quarry, Elara, studio sequence) and the inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of details (ribbon, portrait work, vendor alibi) accretes toward the arrest. Yet the decisive moment—the arrest based on Catherine's height correction—arrives via off-page inference rather than on-page pressure that reweights Elara's stance. The Orientation Test penalty is waived; the closure effect (return to quarry, ribbon ritual) reads as Resonant Reconfiguration but the cost is conceptual and oblique, not felt or foregrounded in the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The quarry setting is evocative ("furrowed hush of stone," "mist coiled between limestone walls") and the ribbon fragment constrains discovery. The studio and quarry return bracket the narrative, and the ribbon's placement in the fissure charges the ending. However, the middle beats (portrait work, vendor scan) lose spatial anchoring and the micro-setting does not alter Elara's tactics; the environment illustrates mood more than it pressures choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—solve Catherine's disappearance and awaken empathy—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the ribbon trace leads to the vendor, but this reversal happens largely off-page ("scanned," "alibi photos showed"). The arrest itself is summarized in a single line with no on-page agency from Elara; the final quarry visit offers Earned Stasis but the cost (laying the ribbon) feels ritualistic rather than a foreclosed path with visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme of seeing through blindness and unifying opposites emerges organically from Elara's process. The portrait work—building a face from negative space—embodies the concept without overt statement. However, the final paragraph moralizes ("her blindness to become a different kind of sight") and the empathy arc resolves into a tidy binary (dormant/awakened) rather than complex ambiguity. The ribbon as motif constrains discovery and charges the ending, but its conceptual weight is diluted by explicit articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV is stable and Elara's perceptual signature (geometries of grief, ratios of loss) is distinct. Register control is strong in the opening and studio sections. However, the final paragraphs drift into elevated abstraction ("the furrowed hush had lifted, replaced by something quieter") that reads authorial rather than character-particular. Diction remains within plausible lexicon and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The opening lines establish vivid texture and rhythm varies across beats. However, paraphrase loops appear in the studio sequence: "She didn't see faces; she saw geometries" is restated as "her precision wasn't habit—it was armor" and again as "her face blindness had always been a subtraction; now it became an addition." Template cadence in the portrait beat ("She drew…then lanced…By unifying") and metaphor density ("river flowing from a childhood scar," "constellation the victim had named") cluster without payoff. The closure beat is clean but prior artifacts lower momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The face-blind portrait artist premise is conceptually fresh and the negative-space painting method offers specificity. However, the breakthrough (height discrepancy in alibi photos) arrives via forensic convenience rather than Elara's unique skill, making her blindness ornamental to the solution. The empathy arc follows a familiar template (loss → numbness → ritual → reawakening) without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. Risk-taking in structure is minimal; the piece plays safely within its premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her face blindness shapes her portrait method (negative space, geometric detail). However, her key turn—identifying Catherine's true height—is explained off-page ("The vendor's alibi photos showed…"). Her decision to return to the quarry and lay the ribbon is ritualistic but does not alter tactics or foreclose a path with visible cost. Present in setup, middle (portrait work), and ending (quarry return), meeting two gates, but causal pressure is low.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ribbon fragment is discovered early (setup), drives the forensic breakthrough via theatrical glue trace (middle), and returns in the ending when Elara places it back in the fissure. Three distinct beats with clear causal involvement: discovery anchors the investigation, trace enables the arrest, and final placement charges the closure ritual. However, the ribbon's role in the arrest is mediated through off-page scanning rather than on-page choice, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Cold cases frame Elara's work ("twenty years painting the dead," "backlog of unsolved faces") and the disappearance at the quarry is the inciting incident. However, the concept does not constrain tactics on the page; Elara's process (portrait, ribbon trace, arrest) would function identically in a fresh case. The theme of unsolved loss is present but the mechanics of cold-case work (witness memory decay, evidence gaps) do not shape her choices. Setup and thematic echo only; no middle development or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Very methodical" is dramatized through Elara's process: photographing the ribbon from sixteen angles, logging GPS coordinates, sealing in a numbered envelope. This precision enables the forensic trace (theatrical glue) that leads to the arrest, meeting setup and middle gates. However, the trait does not constrain a choice with visible cost—her methodical approach succeeds without friction or tradeoff. The ending shifts to emotion ("desperate," "letting it bleed") without reconciling the tension, lowering irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Lance" appears in the portrait beat: "Each detail was a needle, piercing the opaque veil of her condition" and "Elara was lancing the wound of her own apathy." The metaphor frames her method (piercing blindness, wounding apathy) and the emotional breakthrough, meeting setup and middle gates. However, the action is figurative rather than physical; the arrest turn does not trace to lancing but to forensic scanning. Swappable with "pierce" or "penetrate" without structural loss, capping at mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"By unifying opposites" is explicitly stated in the opening ("her secret, her method") and repeated in the portrait beat ("by unifying opposites—what she could not see with what she could not forget—she built the portrait"). However, the mechanics are asserted, not demonstrated: the story does not show how blindness and testimony unify in her process beyond metaphor. The arrest relies on forensic trace, not unification. Present in setup and middle summary; no closure participation or causal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The quarry is the discovery site (ribbon in fissure), the victim's last location (masquerade at the preserve), and the setting for Elara's opening and closing visits. Three beats with clear presence. The mist and shadowed walls establish tone and the fissure anchors the ribbon discovery. However, the quarry does not constrain tactics—Elara's studio work and the forensic breakthrough occur elsewhere. The final return charges the ritual but the environment itself is postcard mood rather than a pressure that alters choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the evidence disappears" is the inciting premise (body vanished, tape flapping, detectives gone) and frames urgency. However, the timeframe does not tighten on-page decisions: Elara's process (photograph ribbon, paint portrait, await forensic results, return to quarry) is methodical without a live clock. The arrest occurs "that evening" with no cost tied to elapsed time. Setup gate met; no middle development or closure participation. The temporal constraint is premise-only, not tactical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—"to awaken dormant empathy through the one ritual that still worked: standing where victims last stood"—is stated early and drives her quarry visits and portrait work. The middle beat shows her empathy returning ("she felt the cold arithmetic of her art give way to warmth"), meeting setup and middle gates. However, the shift is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choice; no visible friction between the cost of feeling and the cost of numbness. Present in the ending (empathy "wasn't dormant anymore") but as summary rather than charged consequence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Furrowed hush" opens the story ("The quarry waited in predawn silence, a furrowed hush of stone and memory") and returns at closure ("The furrowed hush had lifted, replaced by something quieter"). The tone is consistent—muted, introspective, layered with sensory restraint—and modulates appropriately when Elara's process intensifies ("painted faster now, not methodical but desperate"). Setup and closure gates met; the reprise reweights the opening image with cost (hush lifted, empathy restored). Lyric resonance justifies mid-6s despite no middle development beat.</comment>
