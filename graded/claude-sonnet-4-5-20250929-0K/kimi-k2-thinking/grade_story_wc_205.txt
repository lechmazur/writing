<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is stated rather than enacted through contradictory impulses; his poet's heart and revolutionary past are told labels without embodied pressure. The final choice to preserve the poem feels symbolic rather than costly—no on-page foreclosure of alternatives, no visible trade-off. Voss enters late and his silent nod is acceptance without struggle, undercutting relational crucible potential. Interiority leans heavily on abstract nouns ("burnished sorrow," "quiet grace") instead of specific perceptual particulars under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who Kael is, where the baroque asteroid sits in relation to governance, and what "visible time" means remain unclear past the opening third. The piece announces an archaeological dispute but never dramatizes a live constraint—Voss's archive filter is mentioned, not tested. Closure reads as thematic resonance (the poem revealed, Voss nodding) without a decisive on-page cost; Kael's options remain unchanged, his exile and chronicling project unchanged. Under an Accumulative lens, the pattern of covering mirrors recurs but does not tighten or reweight stakes at the end—it simply repeats.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid's spires, visible time layers, and cracked marble boulevards create vivid atmospheric specificity. The mirror and shard function as micro-setting elements that charge the climactic storm beat. However, spatial choreography during the storm scene is vague—Kael's position relative to Voss, the hall's dimensions, and the mechanics of pressing the shard against the covered mirror lack concrete grounding. Sensory detail is primarily visual and ornamental rather than filtered through urgency or POV bias.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—revealing truth about the empire—is declared but never tested by a live opposition that forces trade-offs. Kael waits for the storm, presses the shard, and the poem appears; Voss sees it and nods. No reversal narrows options, no tactic shifts under resistance. The final moment reads as symbolic validation rather than earned escalation with on-page cost. Agency is limited to waiting and ritual gesture, not decision under conflicting pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The theme of truth versus curated history emerges clearly from the shard and archive dispute, and the mirror-covering ritual offers a charged metaphor. However, the ending tells theme rather than earning it through scene particulars: "the shard's power" and "quiet resolve of a poet who knows words can outlast empires" are direct thematic statements. The poem inscription flickering into view is a symbolic reveal without a non-literal answer to the central question. Closing lines drift into abstraction ("burnished sorrow that polished each word") rather than concrete image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable, but perceptual signature lacks character-specific bias—descriptions read like neutral catalog ("gilded skull," "translucent veils"). Diction drifts into elevated register ("restless specter," "crucible," "cipher") that feels authorial rather than earned by Kael's voice. The storm's "chorus of lost moments" and "burnished sorrow" repeat abstract poetic gestures without grounding in Kael's particular idiom. No dialogue is present. Filter verbs ("saw," "felt," "knew") appear frequently without voice motivation, dulling immediacy in key beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "He covered the mirror...the same cloth that had shrouded...He pressed the shard...the crystal resonated" restates actions without added pressure. Synonym churn ("specter/echo," "burnished sorrow/quiet grace," "reimagine/decode") inflates word count. Template cadence ("He stood...He waited...He pressed...He lowered") across the storm sequence. Stock metaphors: "gilded cage," "sea of lies," "beacon for a new age." Mixed vehicle: "translucent veils" layering over time is coherent, but "burnished sorrow" mixing metal-finishing with emotion is strained. These artifacts touch the closure beat ("He lowered the shard...his poet's heart still burning"), triggering high-end penalty in this category and disqualifying 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The baroque-asteroid-with-visible-time premise offers surface novelty, but the execution follows a template: oppressed truth-seeker performs ritual to reveal hidden knowledge, authority figure grudgingly accepts. The shard-as-cipher and mirror-covering are symbolic props rather than integrated invention. The emotional arc—failed revolutionary finds validation—reads familiar without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. "Reimagine an entire civilization" is declared ambition rather than demonstrated ingenuity on the page.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kael's defunct-revolutionary status frames expectation and appears in the final paragraph's resolve to draft a new chronicle. However, his choices are largely waiting and symbolic gesture (pressing shard, covering mirror) rather than decisions that narrow options. The attribute shapes tone but does not create causal turns or visible trade-offs. Present in setup and closure but not development.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The crystal vase shard is introduced early, handled in the storm ritual, and reappears in the final beats as Kael traces its edge. Its jagged edge, hidden inscription, and role as "key to the past" give it specificity. It enables the poem's revelation during the storm and is causally active in the climax. However, it resolves a problem (revealing truth) without prior friction—Kael never loses it, doubts its use, or pays a cost to obtain or deploy it. Three gates met with causal participation but limited cost linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The archaeological dispute is announced as backstory and shapes the premise (Kael versus Voss over empire's truth). It appears in exposition and Voss's silent nod at the end. However, the dispute is never dramatized as live conflict—no on-page debate, resource competition, or tactical shift. Functional setup but ornamental in development; closure participation is passive (Voss's acknowledgment). Swappable with "political dispute" or "historical controversy."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Kael is labeled "poetically inclined" and his perceptions include metaphors ("gilded cage," "visible time as veils"). The trait colors narration but does not constrain or enable a decisive on-page action with cost. He sees the mirror ritual as metaphor, but this insight does not alter his tactics or foreclose an alternative. Present in voice texture but does not drive a key turn.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Devise" appears mid-story as Kael formulates a plan to harness the storm. The plan—pressing shard against covered mirror—structures the climax and leads to the poem's revelation. However, the mechanics of devising are summarized ("He began to devise") rather than shown through trial, error, or trade-off. The action shapes one major beat (storm ritual) and contributes to closure, but could be replaced with "discover ritual" or "remember technique" without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Covering mirrors during storms is introduced early as cultural ritual, explained as metaphor, and enacted twice (pre-storm and post-resolution). The method's mechanics—fabric blocking temporal distortion—are signaled and matter during the climax when Kael uses the covered mirror to channel storm energy and reveal the poem. It constrains his tactic (he must wait for a storm, use a cloth) and charges the final image (mirror remains covered to preserve the poem). All three gates met with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid with visible time layers, cracked marble boulevards, and grand hall creates atmospheric specificity. The temporal storms supply the energy Kael needs for his ritual, and the archive's sepia filter is a stated obstacle. However, the setting does not constrain choices in micro—Kael moves freely, Voss enters without spatial friction, and the storm's mechanics are abstract. Present across beats with thematic charge but limited tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"After time becomes visible" is stated as context (past overlays present in ghostlight and storms) and appears in descriptions of temporal distortion. It colors atmosphere and justifies the mirror-covering ritual. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—Kael waits for a storm but faces no deadline or cost for delay. Time layers add texture without escalating pressure or altering tactics. Setup and closure presence but no development constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Kael's desire to "reimagine an entire civilization" is declared in exposition, restated in his plan to use the shard as cipher, and reappears in the ending's resolve to draft a new chronicle. The motivation frames his goal but is never dramatized through friction—no on-page moment where reimagining clashes with another want or exacts a visible cost. Told desire rather than enacted conflict. Present in setup and closure but ornamental in development.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Burnished sorrow" appears in exposition ("Kael felt the burnished sorrow of a lifetime of failure") and final lines ("His poet's heart ached with the weight...a burnished sorrow that polished each word"). The tone is consistent through turns—melancholy without rage—and modulates slightly at closure when sorrow mixes with resolve. However, the phrasing is abstract and repeated verbatim, reducing specificity. It charges the final image but leans on label rather than embodied texture under pressure.</comment>
