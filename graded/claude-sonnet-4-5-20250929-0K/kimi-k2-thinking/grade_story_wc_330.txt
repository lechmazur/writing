<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Silas is characterized primarily through poetic description rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. His "quietly persistent" nature is asserted through repeated labels ("quietly persistent" appears verbatim twice) rather than demonstrated through micro-choices under competing pressures. The singing moment arrives as declarative action without prior internal conflict between silence and voice. Embodied emotion is largely absent; we get "his heart humming" and a smile but no contradictory physical states that would ground the transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens with a final Resonant Reconfiguration (the carousel spinning, train breathing). Orientation is clear by the opening lines. The closure effect—carousel restored, train reanimated—lands on the page, but the cost is conceptual and oblique rather than felt; we see no visible price Silas pays (no fatigue, sacrifice, or foreclosed path). The "wrong turn" discovery reads as convenient coincidence that enables rather than complicates. The Cost Proof Test is not satisfied: no specific sentence shows Silas losing, renouncing, or trading anything at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: "peeling paint, shattered mirrors," "rust-eaten corridor," "cracked glass" filtering sunlight. The hidden garden car and silver spring constrain the halo fragment's location, shaping Silas's path. The final image of the spinning carousel and breathing train charges the closure. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the train's maze. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric, filtered through the lyric lens rather than a close third-person urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restoring the carousel—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation is thin: Silas encounters no meaningful obstacle or cost. The "wrong turn" provides the solution without complication. No live option is foreclosed; the halo fragment pulses responsively, the horses rise, the train exhales—all cooperative. The tightening required by the Accumulative lens (a density increase or pattern break that reweights the stake with cost) is gestured at but not dramatized with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—silence as possibility, restoration through patience—emerges organically from image and action rather than statement. The recurring motifs (misting hush, whispering gleam, wind bells) gain cumulative weight and the final image of the train as "sanctuary where silence sang" reweights prior material. However, the thematic question lacks friction; silence is framed as purely generative without dramatized cost or counter-pressure. The ending offers resonance but borders on sentimental wish-fulfillment: "possibility bloomed in every shadow" without the felt price required for full thematic depth.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited to Silas with a lyric, elevated register. Voice is distinct and purposeful: "ghost-light of forgotten spotlights," "whispering gleam," "the silence spoke a secret only he could hear." However, the diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("field of possibility," "dormant melody") that distances rather than grounds. Psychic distance is controlled but uniformly remote; we never drop into close embodied interiority. The prose maintains its lyric texture under pressure without modulation, which fits the Accumulative design but flattens emotional progression.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often stacked: "misting hush," "whispering gleam," "ghost-light," "breathing stillness" appear in most high-pressure beats without clear delineation. Paraphrase loops are present: the train "breathing" and "exhaling" recur across multiple paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence is evident in repeated "The [noun] [verb]" constructions. "Quietly persistent" appears verbatim twice, a scaffold phrase. Mixed metaphors: "silence sang" and "possibility bloomed" blur vehicles. The density penalty (−0.5) and loop penalty (−0.4) apply; the final third contains these artifacts, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—silent craftsman restoring a forgotten carousel—is familiar and the arc follows a template of patient labor rewarded without complication. The "wrong turn to hidden oasis" and "lost fragment" are stock fantasy beats. The lyric voice and atmospheric detail elevate execution, but the emotional arc is predictable and lacks a non-obvious turn. Transformation test: swap names and setting, the arc remains unchanged. No bold risk heightens stakes; the story retreats into safe lyricism rather than confronting genuine cost or moral calculus.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Silas is present throughout and his action (singing, fitting the fragment) appears in the closure. However, his choices do not create key turns; the halo fragment is discovered by coincidence, and the restoration proceeds without decision points. He is quietly persistent (label) but we see no on-page moment where that trait constrains a harder choice or forecloses an alternate path. Observation and labor dominate; agency is passive. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but functionally replaceable with any patient craftsman.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The halo fragment is introduced early ("shattered years ago"), discovered in the hidden garden, and fitted at closure. It appears in three beats and its restoration enables the carousel to spin. However, its meaning does not evolve; it remains the missing piece throughout. The fragment "pulsed" in Silas's palm and "shivered" when fitted, but these are passive responses rather than reweighted significance. Causal role is functional but the object itself is swappable with any lost component.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Misting hush" is a recurring atmospheric phrase ("the misting hush of the train," "misting hush returned, softer now") but it does not shape stakes or constrain tactics. It is a tonal layer, not a driver of choice. The concept is present in setup and ending but functions as descriptive gloss rather than pressure. Silas does not navigate or overcome the hush; it simply "dissolved" and later "softened." Label-only usage without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Quietly persistent" is mentioned verbatim twice ("Silas was quietly persistent," "Silas, quietly persistent, carried the fragment back"). It describes his return each dawn to the same bolt, but we do not see a scene where persistence costs him something or enables a specific tactical choice under friction. The attribute is asserted rather than enacted with visible tradeoff. Present in setup and middle, but static label without felt price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Silas sings once, and the text frames it as the first time in years: "For the first time in years, Silas opened his throat and sang." The singing resonates with the wind bells and the halo fragment pulses in response, but the turn is not decisive—he carries the fragment back and fits it; the singing does not redefine options or create a cost. The action is present in the middle and the ending alludes to it ("his silence now a song"), but it is more symbolic flourish than plot engine. Swappable with another gesture of breaking silence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The wrong turn is signaled: "took a wrong turn through a warped door that should have led to storage." It leads to the hidden oasis where the fragment is found. The method matters structurally—it is the discovery mechanism—but it arrives as convenient coincidence rather than shaping prior attempts or creating friction. Introduced in the middle, used once, and not revisited. Functional but replaceable with any discovery mechanism (e.g., persistent searching).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The abandoned circus train is established early and provides spatial structure (maze of cars, hidden garden car, carousel's heart). The setting supplies the resource (halo fragment) and the train's transformation ("seemed to exhale a long-held breath") participates in closure. However, the train does not pressure choices; Silas navigates it without obstacle. It is a stage more than a constraint. Present in setup, middle, and ending, with some causal work (the hidden oasis is inside the train), but micro-setting (the oasis itself) does more work than the train macro-frame.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Inside the chime of wind bells" appears twice as a poetic phrase framing moments of resonance. It does not function as a ticking clock or constrain decisions. Time is vague throughout: "three seasons," "one dim afternoon," "years ago." The wind bells chime at Silas's voice and again at closure, but the timeframe is metaphorical atmosphere, not tactical pressure. Ornamental mention without beat involvement or cost linkage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Silas "believed that silence was not emptiness but a field of possibility" and later "understood that every silence was a seed." The motivation is told rather than dramatized in conflicted choice. We do not see a moment where interpreting silence as possibility costs him something or competes with another desire. The motivation is thematically present in setup and ending but does not drive on-page friction or visible tradeoff. Label-only with no enacted cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Whispering gleam" recurs throughout: "whispering gleam of the sun," "whispering gleam of possibility," "whispering gleam of the oasis," "legend of whispering gleam." The tone is lyric, atmospheric, and consistent. It modulates slightly (from discovery to closure) and charges the final image. However, the tone is a single static mood—soft, reverent, hushed—without sharp contrast or pressure-driven shift. Present across all beats and coherent, but without the dynamic charge that would lift it into high bands.</comment>
