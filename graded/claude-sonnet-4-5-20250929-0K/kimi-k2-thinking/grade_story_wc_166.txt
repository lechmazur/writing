<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation to "pen a cosmic verse" is declared rather than earned through contradictory impulses or difficult trade-offs. Her "choice" to remain anchored reads passive—the garden holds her, she surrenders—without embodied struggle or a hierarchy of competing wants. Interior states are labeled ("motivation burned clear," "obsidian grace") rather than shown through micro-decisions under pressure. The final transformation lacks visible cost; she simply becomes "a new creature" without forfeiting a live option on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: attempted Accumulative/Textural, but the piece never teaches a coherent pattern or pays off elision with cost. Orientation is delayed: "who" (Lyra) and "what" (tide dancer) arrive early, but "where" (the garden's stakes, the world's ban) and "when" (timeline relative to the ban) remain vague past the 120-word mark without functional payoff. The closure unit—Lyra stepping beyond the garden as a living poem—arrives as summary assertion ("her skin a map of celestial poetry") rather than a decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with felt cost. The "spontaneous anchor" that roots her is released off-page with no visible price. Orientation penalty (−0.4) applied here; Q3 capped at 7.0 per the test.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The garden is named and evoked repeatedly but never constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome. Spatial choreography is unclear—silvered leaves, dew-laden petals, and star-iron exist as atmospheric tokens without affecting Lyra's movements or tactics. The moonstone dust is handled twice (reach, grind) but the garden itself remains a postcard backdrop. No environmental pressure forces the tattooing decision or the final departure. (Capped at 7.0 per Q2 orientation debt.)</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving memory against the ban—is declared but never tested by an on-page antagonist or choice with trade-offs. Lyra's "elective exile" is a surrender, not a decision that narrows options. The garden releases her without visible cost, and the final dance is asserted rather than shown under pressure. Coincidence (the dust speck catches starlight) initiates the sequence, and no reversal tightens her position or forces a sacrifice. No meaningful escalation under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme of memory versus erasure is stated overtly ("testament that memory could not be erased," "no ban can silence") rather than arising from specific, conflicted action. The final image—"living poem," "bridge between what was and what could be"—is asserted in abstract language instead of earned through a non-literal resonant detail. Motifs (moonstone dust, garden, stars) recur but do not constrain choice or reweight meaning at closure; they are decorative. The piece tells its thesis rather than dramatizing it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Narrative distance is stable third-person limited, but diction drifts into elevated register ("obsidian grace," "perpetual fledging," "cosmic tapestry") that exceeds Lyra's plausible lexicon under stress. Perceptual signature is generic; Lyra notices "silvered leaves" and "dew-laden petals" without character-specific bias. Template cadence pervades: "She had learned…," "She realized…," "She danced…" recur without variation. Filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") cluster in reflective passages, dulling immediacy. The prose reads as a narrator explaining Lyra rather than inhabiting her.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops dominate: "memory could not be erased" / "memory is a tide" / "keep the cosmos alive in a world that had forgotten"; "living manuscript" / "parchment of the cosmos" / "canvas" recycle the same metaphor without progression. Template cadence: "She [verb]" opens nine sentences in the final third. Stock phrases ("obsidian sky," "whispered secrets," "ancient galaxies") replace specific detail. Mixed metaphor: the garden is "manuscript," "parchment," "ink," and "canvas" within four lines. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("living poem," "bridge," "tapestry" in final paragraph). Penalty: −1.2 for pervasive loops and template stems; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per the patterned-artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Core premise (banned nostalgia, tattooed memory-verse) echoes familiar "art as resistance" templates without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. "Tide dancer" and "moonstone dust" are ornamental labels without world logic or stakes-specific function. Turns feel telegraphed: the anchor, the tattooing, the release all follow a predictable arc. The final image—dancer as living poem defying the ban—restates the setup without fresh inflection or earned risk. Derivative premise penalty: −0.8 within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Lyra is named early (setup gate met) and present in the ending (payoff gate met), but her "choices" are passive: she is held by the garden, surrenders, is released. The tattooing decision is narrated in summary, not shown as a turn with options. She dances at the end, but the dance is described rather than enacted with agency. Middle development gate: weak, as her mid-story action (grinding dust, tattooing) does not constrain later moves. Two gates met allow eligibility to ~6.0, but swappability (another exiled artist could occupy the role) and lack of on-page decisional pressure lower the score. No causal pressure or closure linkage evident; she is present but not driving the ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dust is handled twice (Lyra touches it in paragraph 5, grinds it in paragraph 13) and reappears in the ending ("moonstone dust pulse in time with her heartbeat," paragraph 32). Setup and payoff gates met; middle development gate weak, as the dust does not constrain a choice between beats. Its properties (shimmers, lunar resonance) are decorative rather than specific enablers. It is present across the arc but swappable for any enchanted pigment. Causal pressure minimal; it does not narrow options or charge the ending image with unique cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Elective exile" is named in paragraph 8 and restated in the ending ("her elective exile became a sanctuary," paragraph 24). Setup and payoff gates met, but middle development is absent—no on-page choice dramatizes the election. The "exile" is passive surrender, not a decision that trades one option for another. The concept is ornamental, a thematic label rather than a stake-shaping force. No causal pressure or visible cost tied to the "elective" aspect; the garden holds her and then releases her. Swappable with "chosen solitude" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"Spontaneously anchored" appears twice (paragraphs 7 and 16) describing the garden's hold and the ink's effect. Setup gate met; middle and payoff gates weak. The attribute does not constrain a choice—Lyra does not struggle against or leverage the anchoring; it simply happens and then ends. No visible trade-off or cost; the roots retreat off-page. The trait is a passive condition, not an enabler or obstacle. Ornamental mention without action pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Fledge" is invoked four times (paragraphs 9, 24, 26, 38) but never as an on-page action with stakes. The verb is used metaphorically ("to fledge into something new," "perpetual fledging") without a literal or dramatized moment where Lyra attempts flight, leaves a nest, or transforms visibly. No setup gate: the action is not present or primed in the first third. No middle beat where fledging constrains a choice. Payoff gate weak: the ending asserts "fledged spirit" as a label, not an act. Easily swappable with "transform" or "emerge."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"Observing gaps" is named in paragraph 9 ("observe the gaps between the stars") and recounted in paragraphs 10 and 27 ("observed the gaps in the world"). Setup gate met; middle development weak (the observation does not shape a tactical choice); payoff gate present but passive (she "filled them with starlight" in summary). The method is described rather than enacted—no on-page beat shows Lyra using gap-observation to solve a problem or narrow options. Swappable with any contemplative method. One beat of functional use (learning "the language of the void") but no causal pressure or cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The garden is named in the opening line (setup gate met), present throughout, and invoked in the ending (payoff gates met). Middle development: the garden "holds" Lyra and later "releases" her, but neither moment is shown as a choice-point with environmental constraint. Spatial details (leaves, petals, dew) are decorative; no resource or obstacle alters Lyra's tactics. The garden functions as atmosphere rather than pressure. Causal presence across beats but no specific cost or tactic-shaping moment. Swappable with any secluded natural setting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"After the nostalgia ban" is mentioned in paragraph 3 and recounted in paragraphs 19, 28, 33. Setup gate met; middle and payoff gates weak. The ban is a thematic backdrop, not a ticking clock or pressure that alters Lyra's moves. No on-page enforcer or consequence dramatizes the ban's threat. Time is vague—no indication of how long the ban has been in place or how Lyra's timeline tightens. The timeframe could be removed with minor edits; the story's arc would remain intact. Ornamental context without escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The motivation is declared in paragraph 12 ("to pen a cosmic verse on mortal skin") and enacted in paragraphs 14–16 (tattooing) and restated in the ending (paragraphs 24, 29). Setup, development, and payoff gates met. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices—no visible friction between the cost of tattooing and a competing want. The motivation drives the tattooing beat but does not narrow options or face on-page resistance. Causal involvement in one beat; no closure linkage with felt cost. Functional but replaceable with any art-making goal.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>"Obsidian grace" is named in paragraph 20 and recurs in paragraph 29 ("obsidian sky"). Setup gate missed (absent in first third); payoff gate met. The tone is asserted via the label rather than built through diction, rhythm, or sensory texture. "Obsidian" suggests darkness and polish, but the prose is elevated and abstract rather than controlled and dark. No modulation under pressure; the register remains uniform. The tone descriptor is ornamental, not integrated into voice or pacing. Swappable with "starlit elegance" or similar.</comment>
