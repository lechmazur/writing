<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena's interiority shows embodied response to plants and storm, with micro-choices (pausing, stepping back, allowing vines freedom) that reveal her evolving stance. Internal contradiction between control and surrender operates on the page through action rather than summary. However, the metamorphosis remains largely described rather than enacted in high-stakes choices with visible cost; her decision to "let go" feels thematically asserted more than dramatically forced. The final image of standing in rain lacks a foreclosed path or visible trade-off that would sharpen the change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates images (linden leaf, mossy trellis, rain, vines) and modulates through Elena's shifting relationship to control. Orientation is clear early (nursery, storm season, Elena's role). Closure attempts a Resonant Reconfiguration (she moves from resistance to acceptance), but the cost remains abstract—no specific opportunity, relationship, or capability is forfeited on the page. The final paragraph's "transformation sustained her" tells closure rather than showing a reweighted stake with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The mossy trellis constrains Elena's repair attempts (vines resist, wood won't hold) and returns charged in the final image. Rain functions as both atmosphere and pressure (forces her outside, soaks her in the climactic moment). Sensory detail (damp earth, cool leaf surface, drip rhythm) is selective and voice-filtered. The nursery setting enables the central conflict and supplies the recurring objects (leaf, trellis, vines) that drive beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Elena's need to control versus the plants' autonomous growth, braided with her internal resistance to personal change. One meaningful tightening occurs when forcing the lattice causes vines to curl away, prompting her to release control. However, escalation lacks a visible price—no customers lost, no plants damaged, no relationship strained. The choice to step back is framed as insight rather than a forced trade-off, and the resolution grants symmetric satisfaction (nursery flourishes, she feels at peace) without foreclosing a live option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme of control versus surrender emerges through image and action (forcing wood, vines resisting, rain as renewal). The linden leaf recurs purposefully, shifting from survival lesson to pressed talisman. "Circuitously sincere" as a character trait mirrors the narrative's spiral structure. However, the final third drifts into overt theme statements ("the most profound changes often happen in quiet surrender," "transformation sustained her") that assert meaning rather than trust the dramatized particulars. The old farmer's parallel metamorphosis in the penultimate section feels like thematic echo rather than earned complication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and grounded in Elena's observational mode; diction ("circuitously sincere," "reluctant metamorphosis") matches her studied, reflective stance. Perceptual signature (leaf edges, vine posture, root grip) is character-specific. Psychic distance remains stable third-close. No dialogue to evaluate. Minor slips: "a quiet ceremony of renewal" and "gentle chaos of nature" edge toward elevated register that slightly exceeds Elena's established lexicon under pressure, but the effect is contained and does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths modulate with Elena's emotional state. Information density is solid in the trellis-repair sequence. However, paraphrase loops appear: "reluctant metamorphosis" is named four times with minimal reweighting; "circuitously sincere" appears twice in near-identical phrasing. The final third stacks summary-like reflections ("Her study of plant behaviors had taught her," "she learned to sustain the transformation") that slow momentum. Stock metaphor "green blanket" and the line "her heart, too, had become a mossy trellis after rain" edge toward ornamental figuration without clear causal work.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The nursery-as-crucible frame and control-versus-surrender arc follow familiar templates (woman learns to let go, nature teaches patience). Specific details (linden leaf pressed in journal, vines curling away from forced repair) elevate the premise above generic execution. The trellis-repair beat offers a fresh physical correlative for internal struggle. However, the emotional arc and final insight (surrender brings flourishing) arrive at a predictable destination without a non-obvious moral calculus or risk that would make the outcome feel inevitable in hindsight rather than pre-determined by the prompt.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Elena's decisions to inspect vines, attempt reconstruction, pause, step back, allow vines freedom, and stand in the storm create multiple turns. Her observation mode drives documentation beats. Her shift from control to trust alters nursery operations (customers notice, gardening club invitations). Present in setup, middle choices, and closure image. Scores mid-6s because observation slightly outweighs high-cost decision; her letting-go moment feels thematically necessary but lacks a visible forfeited option (no damaged crop, no lost income, no strained relationship).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Linden leaf appears in four distinct beats: Elena finds it in trellis (observes survival), feels its surface (wonders at resilience), presses it in journal (documents lesson), places it in nook during final storm (ceremony of renewal). Returns with reweighted meaning at closure. However, its function remains largely symbolic; it does not constrain a tactical choice or supply a resource. Removing it would weaken thematic resonance but not break plot logic. Mid-6s for purposeful recurrence and closure charge without mechanical necessity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Reluctant metamorphosis" is named in paragraph four, recurs in paragraph twenty-one and twenty-nine, and anchors the ending's emotional arc. It shapes Elena's interiority (she resists, then allows the change) and alters her behavior (speaking more slowly, listening to plants, sharing observations). Present in all three gates. However, the concept functions more as theme than on-page stake; no single beat shows her refusing a concrete opportunity because she fears change, then choosing differently. Scores mid-5s for thematic coherence and closure participation without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Circuitously sincere" appears twice: friends note it in paragraph five, Elena's talks embody it in paragraph forty. The trait matches her narrative voice (reflective, spiral observations) and her teaching method (weaving stories). However, it does not constrain or enable a high-stakes choice with visible cost. Removing the label would not alter any beat's outcome. Low-4s for consistency with voice and one late callback, but no mechanical work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Reconstruct" anchors the central beat: Elena tightens lattice joints, vines resist, frustration mounts, she recalls the linden lesson, pauses, steps back. This sequence triggers her shift from force to release, which alters all subsequent action (allowing vines to weave freely, standing in rain, nursery flourishing). Present in setup (broken lattice mentioned), development (the repair attempt), and closure (trellis stands taller in new arch). Mid-to-high 6s because the action drives the turn but could be replaced with similar repair tasks (prune, replant, stake) without breaking the arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"By releasing control" is signaled in the trellis-repair beat (she steps back, allows vines to find their path) and recurs in the rain scene (she lifts her face, no longer battles the flow). The method shapes her nursery management (trust replaces meticulous control) and is echoed in the farmer conversation. Present in development and closure. However, the mechanics remain abstract; no specific technique or protocol is tested and refined. Scores low-6s for consistent presence and closure linkage without tactical specificity or visible cost tied to the release itself.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mossy trellis is introduced in paragraph one, supplies the central constraint (vines resist forced repair, lattice breaks), enables Elena's observational beats (documenting shifts in posture), and returns charged in the closure image (stands taller, arms cradling vines in graceful arch; Elena's heart becomes a mossy trellis). The moss itself holds moisture for roots, a functional detail that supports the ecosystem. Present in all three gates with causal pressure and closure transformation. Low-7s because the trellis drives the turn and anchors the final image but could be replaced with another nursery structure (greenhouse frame, raised bed) with moderate rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Storm season" is named in paragraph one, supplies recurring weather events (fresh rain, thunderstorm rolls in, each storm brings lessons), and provides the temporal frame for Elena's arc. The timeframe allows iterative learning (each gust a teacher) and seasonal rhythm. However, no individual storm imposes a deadline or alters tactics; the season functions as backdrop rather than tightening clock. Mid-5s for purposeful framing and thematic coherence without urgency or tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"To study plant behaviors" is stated in paragraph three, drives her documentation beats (filling notes with observations, sharing with gardening club), and is reflected in her choice to observe rather than control. However, the desire never conflicts with a competing want or cost. She pursues study throughout without friction; no grant deadline, no failing crop, no skeptical partner forces a trade-off. Mid-5s for consistent presence and thematic alignment without on-page conflict or foreclosed alternative.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Sustaining transformation" anchors the closure sentence and is prefigured in repeated language (reluctant metamorphosis, slow unfurling, ripple through her). Tone modulates from resistance (frustration mounts) to acceptance (humming while working, lifting face to sky) to integration (transformation sustained her). The contemplative, patient register holds across turns. Scores low-6s for coherent arc and closure charge; however, the tone flattens slightly in the final third when summary-like reflections (each storm a lesson, growth in quiet surrender) replace scene pressure.</comment>
