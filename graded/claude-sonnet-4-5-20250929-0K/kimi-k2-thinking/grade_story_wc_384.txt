<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's core motivation (forgiving her father's incomplete work) is present but remains largely abstract. Her emotions are frequently labeled ("quiet satisfaction," "heart light") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses under pressure. The decisive act of unlinking the tyrant's seal occurs on the page, but the interior cost of this "calibrated treason" never crystallizes into a visible trade-off or foreclosed path—she completes the mission and walks away unburdened. Diagnostic label-speak does not appear, but the interiority skews toward poetic summary rather than character-particular contradiction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story anchors who/where/when early and presents a clear causal chain: Elara forges a scroll, inserts the thorn into the altar mechanism, and triggers the unlinking of the tyrant's seal. However, the closure effect—"the tyrant's power waned like a fading star" and Elara's return to her studio—occurs largely in summary across multiple paragraphs rather than a single on-page moment with felt cost. The final image ("the unfinished was at last forgiven") offers a Conceptual Repricing, but the cost remains conceptual and diffuse rather than sharp and visible. The drive lens reads as Causal with a lyric overlay, held consistently, but the ending's off-page summary dilutes the immediacy required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The marble sanctuary, aurora, and stalactites are vividly rendered and establish a strong sensory baseline. The heritage rose thorn functions as both tool and recurring object, and the hidden altar mechanism provides a spatial constraint that Elara must navigate. The setting charges the final image through the pearl twilight motif, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. However, the environment does not force a mid-story tactical choice; it serves primarily as atmospheric backdrop until the climactic altar interaction, which limits the setting's role in shaping escalation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unlinking the tyrant's power through forgery—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Elara's insertion of the thorn into the altar and the disc's spin provide one meaningful on-page tightening. However, the escalation lacks a visible cost that forecloses options: Elara completes each step without friction, mistake, or trade-off, and the resolution unfolds as a sequence of successes rather than a choice that narrows her path. The phrase "calibrated treason" promises precision and risk, but no on-page consequence tests her commitment or alters her tactics.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme of forgiveness—specifically forgiving the unfinished—emerges through image and action rather than statement, and the heritage rose thorn's transformation from wound to tool carries symbolic weight. The final image reweights the scroll and thorn with the line "the unfinished was at last forgiven," offering a non-literal answer to the thematic question. However, the theme lacks complexity or tension: Elara's forgiveness is untroubled by doubt, and the story does not explore competing goods or the moral calculus of "calibrated treason." The resonance is present but not deepened by ambiguity or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyric register with a fairy-tale distance ("a calligraphy forger," "a gardener of legends") and purposeful compression in phrases like "ink and memory" and "key with no apparent lock." Free indirect style is clean, and the perceptual signature remains stable. However, the voice trends toward generic lyricism rather than character-particular diction; under pressure, the syntax does not tighten or fracture to reflect Elara's urgency, and filter verbs ("felt," "seemed") appear frequently without voice motivation. The final paragraphs shift into summary mode, diluting the immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The prose is generally clear and free of grammar errors, but it suffers from pervasive ornamental stacking and paraphrase loops. Lines like "The marble sanctuary glowed…a pearl twilight that turned stone into silk" and "stalactites dripped…each drop marking time like a slow heartbeat" appear multiple times with minor variation, and the phrase "marble sanctuary under aurora" recurs four times without functional reweighting. Template cadence is visible in repeated "She [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" stems across adjacent sentences. Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching or payoff, particularly in the closure paragraphs where "fading star," "silent storm," "chains…sundered," and "shadow among shadows" stack without advancing the image. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase loops and template cadence, plus −0.4 for closure-paragraph metaphor stacking, totaling −1.2.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core premise—a calligraphy forger using a rose thorn to commit treason against a tyrant—offers surface novelty, but the execution follows a familiar quest-complete arc without complication or transformation. The "key with no apparent lock" and hidden altar mechanism feel like puzzle elements imported from adventure templates rather than organic to Elara's emotional stakes. The story does not transform the forgiveness-through-art trope with lived detail or moral ambiguity; Elara's success is unchallenged, and the tyrant remains an abstract villain. The pearl twilight and aurora imagery are vivid but not specific to this character's vision.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and makes decisions (forging the scroll, inserting the thorn, pressing the page against the disc), but her choices do not create reversals or escalate stakes—they execute a preordained plan. Setup is clear; middle development shows her enacting each step; closure returns to her studio. However, her agency does not narrow options or face friction; removing her interiority and replacing her with a different forger would not alter the plot's structure. Causal pressure is low, and the cost is conceptual rather than tactical. Apply −0.5 for swappability and −0.3 for summary-only closure participation: 5.0 − 0.8 = 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The heritage rose thorn appears in five distinct beats: introduction as quill, whispered phrase trigger, insertion into altar, warm in palm during exit, and resting in velvet case at closure. It is signaled early, constrains the altar mechanism's unlocking (only the thorn fits), and charges the final image by linking past (grandmother) to future (peace). Its specificity—rose thorn from a gardener of legends—makes it irreplaceable. However, its role is primarily mechanical rather than forcing a choice under pressure; Elara never risks or sacrifices the thorn. Setup +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.5 = 4.2 base + 4.2 = 8.4, rounded down to 8.4. Minor swappability (another family heirloom could serve) −0.3: 8.4 − 0.3 = 8.1, but the thorn's unique fit into the aperture and its charged reprise at closure tip it slightly higher within discretion: 7.1 after reviewing that closure participation is present but not decisively transformative.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Calibrated treason is named four times and frames Elara's mission, but it does not constrain her tactics or present an on-page dilemma about precision versus betrayal. The concept is thematic rather than mechanical; removing the phrase and calling it "rebellion" or "sabotage" would not alter the plot. Setup is present; middle shows the act; closure alludes to it ("silent storm"). However, the "calibration" is never dramatized—no cost, no mismeasurement, no price for precision. Apply −0.5 for swappability and −0.3 for ornamental use: 5.5 − 0.8 = 4.7, rounded to 4.8 within band discretion.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Wisely enduring" appears once in the phrase "Elara was wisely enduring the cold of the stone floor." It is a label rather than a dramatized trait; the cold does not constrain her actions or force a trade-off. No setup, no middle development beat, no closure participation. Ornamental mention −0.8: 3.0 − 0.8 = 2.2, but the single action (kneeling on cold stone) provides minimal functional presence, lifting it slightly to 3.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Unlinking is the mission's goal and the climactic action: Elara presses the scroll against the disc, the mechanism spins, and the tyrant's power begins to crumble. Setup frames it, middle builds toward it, closure hinges on it. The act is specific to the story's logic—removing "unlink" would require rewriting the entire mechanism. However, the unlinking itself is described rather than felt; no on-page resistance or visible cost accompanies the moment. Causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, irreplaceability +0.6 = 3.0 + 3.2 = 6.2, but summary-only execution −0.3 and lack of visible cost −0.0 (already penalized in Q4) yields 6.9 after band adjustment for centrality.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"A key with no apparent lock" appears three times: as the ancient phrase Elara whispers, again when the altar shifts, and again when the disc spins. It is set up early, enables the middle turn (unlocking the altar), and is present at closure. However, its mechanics are vague—what makes it a "key" beyond the phrase's mystical invocation is never clarified. Removing the phrase and calling it "a spell" or "the trigger" would not change the plot. Setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure participation +0.7 = 3.0 + 2.9 = 5.9, minus swappability −0.5 = 5.4, rounded to 5.8 for its centrality to the mechanism despite vagueness.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The marble sanctuary under aurora is present throughout, anchors all action, and provides the altar mechanism that Elara must navigate. It is set up in the opening line, shapes the middle turn (altar compartment), and charges the closure image ("pearl twilight deepening"). The setting constrains Elara's access (hidden aperture) and supplies the aurora light that makes the hidden script visible. Setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2 = 3.0 + 4.3 = 7.3. However, the setting does not force a tactical choice under pressure—it is a stage rather than an obstacle. Deduct −0.4 for insufficient pressure constraint: 7.3 − 0.4 = 6.9, adjusted to 6.2 after recognizing that the aperture and aurora are functional but not urgent.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"As stalactites drip" appears in the title-like timeframe and is echoed three times: "marking time like a slow heartbeat," "continued their patient drip," "drip, a timeless rhythm." It establishes mood but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics; the drips mark time poetically but impose no clock pressure. Setup present, no middle development, closure reprise. Lyric resonance +0.3, but no causal pressure or urgency. Apply −0.5 for ornamental use: 3.0 + 0.3 − 0.5 = 2.8, adjusted to 3.9 for the motif's consistent presence and closure echo within lyric tolerance.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"To forgive the unfinished" is stated twice explicitly and threads through Elara's mission: her father left the scroll incomplete, and she seeks to forgive that wound. Setup is clear, middle shows the completion, closure lands on "the unfinished was at last forgiven." However, the motivation is told more than dramatized; Elara never hesitates or doubts, and no friction between forgiveness and cost appears on the page. Setup +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2 = 3.0 + 2.6 = 5.6. Summary-only interiority and lack of conflicted choice prevent higher scoring despite centrality.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Pearl twilight is introduced in the opening line, recurs five times ("pearl light," "pearl twilight wrapping," "pearl twilight deepened," "pearl twilight of memory"), and modulates with the aurora's shifts. It is coherent across turns and charges the final image. The tone supports the lyric, meditative register and remains stable through the mission. Setup +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.3 = 3.0 + 3.4 = 6.4. The tone does not tension or modulate with urgency (remaining static and elevated throughout), which limits it from higher bands, but its consistency and closure charge meet the 7.0 threshold guidance. Final score 6.4 after recognizing that modulation under pressure is absent.</comment>
