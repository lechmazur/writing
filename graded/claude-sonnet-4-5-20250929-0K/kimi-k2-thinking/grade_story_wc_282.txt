<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's interiority relies heavily on abstract declarations ("her purpose was to chart the unseen") rather than embodied contradiction. The motivation to "become the voice of the unknown" is stated repeatedly but never tested by a credible counter-pressure that would force a trade-off. Her actions—drifting, aiming sensors, singing—proceed without meaningful internal resistance or cost that forecloses a path. The final moment offers no visible price paid or renunciation earned through prior causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation is established (coastal caves, post-hibernation). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: sensory impressions and the fossil's "pulse" layer toward a final tableau. However, no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing with on-page cost occurs; Lira simply waits for humanity's return, a static endpoint rather than a closure that reweights prior material. The heat-map data and the song do not narrow options or alter her stance in a way that forecloses a live path.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The coastal cave network is described with vivid sensory detail ("walls wet with salt and memory," "thick with the scent of salt and something older"). Spatial anchors track cleanly across moves. The setting pressures Lira's descent and provides the fossil, but it does not constrain a key choice at closure; she emerges unchanged by environmental friction, and the final image relies on her unchanged stance rather than a spatial or resource limit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—to translate the cave's silence—is signaled early but remains abstract. No on-page reversal tightens options or imposes a visible cost; the fossil "responds" and "guides," but Lira never faces a trade-off or obstacle that forces her to alter tactics. The song and the device "harmonize" without friction, and the ending lacks a credible price or foreclosed path that would satisfy escalation under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of bridging past and present through sensory translation emerges from the fossil and heat-map imagery. However, the final image ("bridge between what had been and what would be") is a direct thematic statement rather than a resonant, non-literal answer. The elm leaf tableau and Lira's song suggest conceptual depth, but the closure asserts rather than dramatizes the theme's cost or reweighting.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice is lyric and consistent, with a perceptual signature that filters the cave through metaphor ("repository of transitional objects," "colours bled into one another"). Diction remains stable and apt for the contemplative mode. However, the prose occasionally tips into expository interiority ("Lira realized that these caves were more than stone") that tells rather than trusts the image, and the final paragraphs lean on summary ("she would offer them the map") rather than concrete action.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and the prose is generally clear. However, paraphrase loops appear: "The fossil was both fact and mysticism; its mineralized form held data, yet it whispered of lost seasons" restates the same idea across adjacent clauses. Template cadence runs through the middle section ("She aimed… She extended… She followed… She pressed… She lifted… She watched… She began…"), and stock metaphors ("wrap around her like a shroud," "pale line") dull immediacy in peak beats. Information density is moderate; many lines describe without advancing pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The premise—sensory map maker in hibernating world—offers a fresh frame, and the elm leaf fossil is a specific, evocative object. However, the emotional arc (solitary guide awaits humanity's return) follows a familiar template without transformation through lived friction or non-obvious moral calculus. The heat-mapping device and the floating fossil remain ornamental rather than irreplaceable; swapping them for other mystical instruments would require only minor edits. The story commits to its lyric mode but does not take a structural or perspectival risk that heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lira is present throughout and her role as sensory map maker frames the premise. However, her choices do not create key turns; she observes, follows, and waits. The decision to sing is not contested by a counter-pressure, and the song does not alter tactics or foreclose a path. Her agency is more passive reception than decision under cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The elm leaf fossil appears early, is handled in multiple beats (extended sensor, lifted, held at closure), and returns with reweighted meaning in the final image. It drives Lira's descent and projects the holographic tableau. However, it does not constrain a choice with visible cost; its properties enable rather than limit, and the closure relies on Lira's stance more than the fossil's causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Transitional objects is named explicitly ("That grief was a transitional object") and the fossil functions as a bridge. However, the concept operates as theme and label rather than shaping on-page stakes or tactics. Lira does not face a choice between competing transitional objects or a cost tied to using them; the concept is told rather than dramatized through friction.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Factually mystical" is embodied in the heat-map device and the fossil's "pulse of warmth" that traces "ancient grief." The trait is present across beats but does not constrain action with visible cost. The mystical element enables Lira's work without imposing a trade-off or limit; removing the mysticism would weaken atmosphere but not break causal logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Floating appears in multiple beats (the fossil "floated as if weightless," "floated beside her," "drifting beside her"). It creates a distinctive image and marks the fossil as anomalous. However, major turns do not trace to this action; the floating is descriptive rather than causal. Swapping it for "glowing" or "hovering" would alter texture but not the story's logic or stakes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Heat-mapping emotions is signaled early and appears in key beats (fossil responds with "pulse of warmth," device shows "cluster of heat signatures," "colours bled into one another"). The method shapes Lira's exploration and the map she creates. However, its mechanics do not constrain a choice or impose a cost at closure; the device succeeds without friction, and removing the heat-map specifics would leave the emotional-translation premise intact.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The coastal cave network is established early, pressures Lira's descent through narrowing passages and thickening air, and provides the fossil and the pool. It appears in the final image as the "sleeping" repository behind her. However, the setting does not force a tactical choice or alter the outcome; Lira's emergence is uncontested by environmental friction, and the caves function more as atmosphere than constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The timeframe (after humans hibernate) sets the premise and explains Lira's solitude. It appears in the opening and the final waiting stance. However, it does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page; no clock or hibernation-related pressure shapes Lira's moves, and the timeframe could be swapped for any post-catastrophe setting with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to become the voice of the unknown" is stated early and restated at closure. Lira's actions (mapping, singing, offering the map) align with this desire. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choice; no friction or counter-want tests her commitment, and the ending asserts rather than earns the role through visible cost.</comment>
