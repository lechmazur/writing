<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lira's motivation is clear and drives consistent action across the story—she seeks quiet in the storm and pursues it through concrete methods (humming, aligning the stone, studying cracks). However, interiority remains largely abstract: "felt the vibrations in her chest," "her heart a quiet drum" are generic embodiments that could describe any contemplative character. The final choice to place the stone and walk on lacks meaningful internal contradiction or visible cost that forecloses a path; she simply continues her established pattern. Micro-choices are present but do not reveal a hierarchy of competing values under genuine pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive by line 2. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through repeated efforts (stone application, humming, crack alignment) toward a "bloom of hush" that unfurls twice. A Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) lands when "the bloom of hush would return, again and again, as promised"—the cave's cyclical nature is crystallized, and Lira's acceptance of the pattern reweights her role. However, the second bloom and the ending retread the first bloom's beat without meaningful cost or narrowing; the closure image ("She walked on, the caves humming softly") feels like a soft reset rather than a decisive tightening. Cost is implied but not legible in a specific sentence or image at the ending beat, triggering the cost-proof penalty.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The harmonic caves are vividly realized through sensory particulars: "discordant storm," "frozen pool reflected the chaotic light," "fractured lines" in ice, and "intricate shadows on the frozen walls." Spatial choreography is coherent (deep caves, ice pool, pedestal). The echo chamber stone and crack patterns constrain Lira's choices—she must align the cracks to conjure silence, and the ice's response shapes her tactics. The setting charges the final image ("the caves humming softly, a lullaby for the world"), qualifying for the 9+ test. Minor deduction: the energy beings above remain abstract placeholders without spatial grounding, and "harmonic caves" as a phrase is repeated without evolving texture.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—find quiet in the storm—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the first bloom fails ("the stone alone was insufficient") and Lira must adapt by harmonizing the cracks. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens is undermined by the second bloom, which repeats the first's mechanism (humming, stone alignment, crack response) without additional cost or trade-off. The resolution is Lira's acceptance of the cycle rather than a decisive choice that narrows options. The energy beings pause but remain indifferent, so external pressure does not genuinely test Lira's will. Agency is present but does not foreclose a path with legible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme—silence as presence, cyclical reprieve, the mapkeeper's role in a living instrument—emerges from concrete actions (crack alignment, stone use) and images (the bloom, the hammered repose). The final image ("silence was not the absence of sound, but its own presence") offers a thematic restatement but comes close to direct assertion rather than non-literal answer. The echo chamber stone's recurrence reweights its function from tool to promise, a positive. However, "bloom of hush" and "hammered repose" are repeated as labels without evolving connotation; the second bloom does not deepen the question, only restates it. No overt moralizing in the final paragraph, but the passage "as long as the caves resonated, she would find silence again" edges toward comfort rather than resonant ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Lira with controlled distance. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices vibrations, traces cracks, listens to the stone. Diction is elevated and poetic ("hammered repose," "gentle luminescence," "ripple-mark mapkeeper") and remains voice-coherent across the text. However, register is uniform and somewhat abstract; under peak pressure (the first bloom's failure, the second bloom's initiation) syntax and rhythm do not modulate—every beat reads at the same lyric pitch. No head-hopping. Purposeful compression is present (the energy beings' nature, the ancient mapkeepers) and legible. Minor penalty: "hammered repose" and "gentle luminescence" recur as static labels rather than evolving in context, creating slight template cadence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Rhythm is controlled and varied; sentence openings shift. Information density is moderate—many lines do double duty (e.g., "The stone's gentle luminescence brightened, casting intricate shadows on the frozen walls" advances both stone state and visual texture). However, several paraphrase loops and synonym cycles flatten momentum: "The echo chamber stone began to vibrate, its glow intensifying" is followed two paragraphs later by "The echo chamber stone resonated, its glow now a pulsing heartbeat," then "the stone's gentle luminescence brightened"—three adjacent beats repeat the same content (stone glows/pulses) without added pressure. Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "Lira [verb]" across the middle third. Stock metaphors: "bloom of silence," "hammered repose," "gentle luminescence" recur as labels without fresh connotation. These artifacts do not obscure causality but dull the closure image's charge, triggering pattern-artifact penalties and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—a mapkeeper conjuring silence in living caves—offers a fresh synthesis of setting, object, and action. The "bloom of hush" as a recurring event rather than a one-time victory is a non-obvious angle. However, the emotional arc (seek quiet, fail, adapt, succeed, accept cycle) follows a familiar template without deep transformation. The crack patterns and humming method are specific but not irreplaceable; the second bloom's mechanics mirror the first without fresh inflection. "Hammered repose" and "gentle luminescence" are vivid coinages but deployed as static labels. The energy beings remain generic disruptors. No close echoes of famous lines, but the piece does not take bold structural or perspectival risks that heighten stakes beyond the expected arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lira (ripple-mark mapkeeper) is present throughout and makes key decisions: to press the stone to her ear, to study the cracks, to hum and harmonize, to place the stone on the pedestal, to continue her journey. Her choices shape all major beats and drive both blooms. Setup is immediate (line 2). Development: she adapts tactics after the first bloom fails. Closure: she walks on, ready to chart the next hush, though this is more continuation than transformation. Her role is specific and irreplaceable. Deductions: her decisions do not foreclose a path with visible cost; she simply iterates her established method. No swappability penalty, but the lack of trade-off or sacrifice limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The echo chamber stone is introduced early ("In her satchel she carried the echo chamber stone, a relic from the deep"), appears in multiple distinct beats (listening, first bloom attempt, pedestal placement, final tucking away), and its state evolves (glow intensifies, dims, becomes faint pulse, remembered). It enables Lira's tactics and is causally linked to both blooms. Closure participation: it is mentioned in the final paragraph as "gently luminous, for the next call" and "a quiet companion," reweighting it from tool to promise. Specificity is high—its "gentle luminescence" and resonance are unique properties. Deductions: the stone does not impose visible cost or constrain a choice that Lira must work around; it functions as a reliable aid. Still, irreplaceability and beat involvement place it solidly in the essential range.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Bloom of hush" is the story's central concept, signaled in paragraph 10 ("Legend told of a moment when silence blossomed like a flower, smothering all noise") and dramatized twice on the page. It shapes Lira's stakes and tactics: she must conjure it, realizes the stone alone is insufficient, and adapts by harmonizing the cracks. Development: the first bloom fails, forcing a tactical shift. Closure: the concept is reaffirmed as cyclical ("the bloom of hush would return, again and again, as promised"). Deductions: the second bloom repeats the first's mechanism without deepening the concept or introducing new cost. The phrase "bloom of hush" recurs as a label rather than evolving in meaning. Still, it is indispensable to the plot and thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Gently luminous" describes the echo chamber stone throughout ("gently luminous, casting a soft blue glow," "gentle luminescence," "gently luminous, for the next call"). Setup is early. However, the trait functions as atmospheric description rather than a constraint or enabler of on-page action. The glow intensifies and dims in response to Lira's actions, but this change does not alter her tactics or impose cost—she does not, for example, need to hide the light or rely on it to navigate. The trait is inseparable from the stone, so removing it would weaken texture, but it does not shape a key turn. Label-only mention penalty applies; no visible tradeoff tied to luminosity itself.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Conjure" is introduced mid-story ("To conjure that quiet, she needed to examine the crack patterns") and enacted twice: "Lira focused her will, conjuring a sphere of silence around the stone" (first bloom) and the second bloom initiated by humming and stone alignment. The action shapes both major turns and defines Lira's method. Specificity is moderate—conjuring reads as intentional effort plus tool use, distinct from passive observation. Deductions: the action is not irreplaceable (one could substitute "summon," "invoke," "call forth" with minor edits), and the second conjuring repeats the first's mechanics without fresh complication. Still, it is causally central to escalation and closure, earning solid integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Examining crack patterns in ice" is signaled early ("To conjure that quiet, she needed to examine the crack patterns in the ice"), dramatized in multiple beats ("Lira knelt, her breath frosting the surface as she studied the fractured lines. She traced them with her finger"), and its mechanics matter: the cracks mirror the storm's tremors, and Lira must harmonize them to achieve the bloom. The method enables her tactical shift after the first bloom fails ("harmonize the cracks, and silence would flower"). Closure participation: "The crack patterns in the ice responded, shifting into a more ordered lattice" directly shapes the second bloom. Specificity is high—crack patterns in ice are a unique, irreplaceable detail. No swappability or ornamental use. The method is essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The harmonic caves are introduced in the opening line and appear throughout. They provide the frozen pool (resource for examining cracks), the pedestal of ice (tool for aligning the stone), and the resonance that Lira must harmonize. The setting's "frequency" and "heartbeat" pressure Lira's choices—she must match it to succeed. Closure: "The harmonic caves settled into a deeper repose" and "the caves humming softly, a lullaby for the world" charge the final image. Deductions: the caves' mechanics (how resonance works, why alignment matters) are asserted more than dramatized; Lira's actions succeed without visible constraint from the environment (e.g., unstable ice, limited access). Still, irreplaceability and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"After the energy beings arrived" frames the inciting event and is referenced throughout ("the energy beings' presence shattered the quiet," "the chaotic light of the energy beings," "the energy beings above seemed to pause," "the energy beings shimmered, indifferent"). Setup is immediate. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency—Lira's actions proceed at a contemplative pace without a live clock or escalating threat. The energy beings' storm is constant background rather than a narrowing window. Development: their presence motivates Lira's quest but does not force tactical shifts. Closure: they remain indifferent, so the timeframe does not pay off with a decisive interaction or deadline. Functional but replaceable; one could substitute "after the storm arrived" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To find the quiet in the storm" is stated explicitly ("Lira's motivation was clear: find the quiet in the storm") and dramatized through her actions: listening to the stone, studying cracks, humming, conjuring blooms. The motivation shapes all her choices and is present from setup through closure ("ready to chart the next hush"). Friction between want and cost is implicit—she must endure the storm's chaos and adapt when the stone alone fails—but not deeply embodied. Her internal state remains calm and purposeful throughout; no contradictory impulse (e.g., temptation to flee, doubt in the method) complicates the pursuit. The motivation is indispensable but lacks the layered conflict that would elevate it to the highest band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Hammered repose" is introduced mid-story ("Her voice, low and steady, became a hammered repose against the storm's fury") and recurs in the ending passages ("a hammered repose," "The hammered repose was her guide"). The phrase evokes a tonal quality—quiet forged under pressure—and modulates slightly (from voice to guide to lingering presence). However, tone across the narrative is uniformly lyric and contemplative; no shift in rhythm or diction under peak stress (the first bloom's failure reads at the same pitch as the second bloom's success). The phrase "hammered repose" functions more as a thematic label than a lived tonal texture. Closure: it appears in the final third and charges the ending image, but its static deployment limits full integration. Functional with charged reprise, but not indispensable to story logic.</comment>
