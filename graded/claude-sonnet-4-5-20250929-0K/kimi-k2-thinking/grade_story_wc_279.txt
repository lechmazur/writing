<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The chalk artist remains a collection of labels ("whimsical," "socially perceptive") without genuine contradiction or earned struggle. Her motivation to "discover meaning in the mess" is asserted repeatedly but never dramatized through competing wants or visible internal friction. The climactic choice—drawing the seventh spiral and interjecting a violet line—arrives without prior pressure that would make this decision costly or conflicted. Interiority consists of abstract claims ("her socially perceptive mind calculated the implications") rather than embodied thought under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who-where-when anchor arrives piecemeal across the opening third without clear grounding until well past 120 words (−0.4). The closure unit—completing the sand mandala with a violet interject at the seventh turn—lands on the page, but the cost reads as conceptual assertion ("she'd given the silence a vocabulary") rather than felt consequence; no visible price or foreclosed path appears in the final image. Causality is functional: tile flake whispers → artist draws → grotto responds, but the "unlearning" frame and villagers remain ornamental set-dressing that does not constrain tactics. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens with a Conceptual Repricing attempt, but the ending reconfiguration is told rather than charged through image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The grotto is vivid in opening texture ("lilac unease," "damp stone walls breathing") but does not constrain a meaningful choice or supply resources that alter the outcome. The sand mandala and tile flake appear as symbolic objects rather than tools that shape tactics; the artist's chalk and scraper are mentioned but never handled in action. Spatial choreography is loose—her position relative to the mandala and walls shifts without clear blocking. The "whispering grotto in mist" charges the tone but does not pressure the protagonist's moves; it remains atmospheric postcard rather than micro-setting crucible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"discover meaning in the mess of whispers"—is declared early but never tested by opposition or cost. No reversal or tightening occurs; the artist arrives, draws, and succeeds without friction. The tile flake's instruction ("Complete the circle, but break it at the seventh turn") is obeyed immediately with no competing option or sacrifice dramatized. The villagers' warning and the grotto's "ravenous" quality vanish without consequence. Pressure flatlines: the artist's whimsical confidence remains unshaken, and the ending gift ("the grotto's whispers had finally learned to listen") reads as reward without trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Theme is over-articulated throughout: "gave the silence a vocabulary," "understand their fear as a map rather than a void," "rewritten what silence could mean." The final paragraph ("the grotto's whispers had finally learned to listen, and that was gift enough") delivers a tidy moral rather than resonant image. The "unlearning" and "necessary paradox" concepts are asserted as prompts rather than emerging from concrete action. Recurrence of chalk, spiral, and violet is ornamental—no image returns with reweighted meaning to charge the closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Diction drifts into elevated, abstract register ("socially perceptive as any diplomat's," "emergent hush crystallized into pure silence") that clashes with embodied urgency at peak beats. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is generic: the artist notices symbolic objects (tile flake, mandala) but her way of seeing lacks character-specific bias. Voice modulation is minimal—tone remains uniformly lyrical and declarative without rhythmic shift under pressure. Free indirect access is clean but delivers exposition ("Her motivation had never been mere curiosity") rather than live thought.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "whispering gallery tile flake" is glossed three ways in adjacent lines; "emergent hush" recurs without added pressure; "socially perceptive" appears twice in template cadence. Figurative density is high without clarity—"lilac unease," "violet mist," "chalk fossils of ancient stories"—creating atmospheric blur rather than propulsion (−0.5). Sentence stems repeat: "The grotto [verb]," "She [verb]," "The tile flake [verb]." Key closure beat ("she'd given the silence a vocabulary") tells rather than showing the change through concrete image. Stock metaphors ("ghost fingers," "question mark") and filter-verb stacks ("felt its secret shiver," "recognized the method") dull immediacy (cumulative −0.9).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The premise—artist completes a mystical sand mandala to give "silence a vocabulary"—reads as a median response to a fantasy-craft writing prompt without specific transformation. The "whimsical chalk artist" and "unlearning season" are generic quest-fantast labels. The turn (interjecting violet at the seventh spiral) is a surface gimmick without earned character pressure or world-logic cost. Tropes (mystical artifact, forgotten monk, prophetic whisper) are assembled without fresh synthesis. No bold risk or durable insight; emotional specificity is absent beneath ornamental diction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Whimsical chalk artist is present throughout but her choices do not create key turns. She obeys the tile flake's instruction without competing desire or on-page deliberation. Observation and execution dominate; no decision forecloses a path with visible cost. Swappable with "curious artist" or "wandering mystic" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Whispering gallery tile flake appears early (setup), is touched and heard mid-scene (development), and dissolves at closure (payoff). However, it functions as a plot device delivering instruction rather than constraining choice or evolving in meaning. The artist follows its command without friction; no visible cost tied to the object itself. Two gates met but causal pressure is minimal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Emergent hush is mentioned repeatedly as a label and tone marker but does not shape stakes or tactics. The artist's actions are not constrained by the hush; it remains atmospheric descriptor. Closure does not hinge on the concept. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>Socially perceptive is asserted twice in identical phrasing ("socially perceptive as any diplomat's," "her socially perceptive mind") but never demonstrates an on-page action enabled or constrained by this trait. No visible tradeoff or cost. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Interject appears as the climactic action—drawing a violet line across the mandala at the seventh turn. This redefines the pattern and triggers the grotto's response (setup absent, development weak, payoff present). However, the mechanics and cost are told rather than dramatized, and the turn could be swapped with "complete" or "disrupt" with similar effect. One gate strongly met.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Through the patterns in a sand mandala is signaled early (artist recognizes the method), constrains the middle action (she extends the mandala rather than ignoring it), and is present at closure (the spiral and interject occur within the mandala). Mechanics are vague but the method is causally active across all three gates. Moderate irreplaceability—story hinges on this technique.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Whispering grotto in mist is established early with vivid sensory detail, houses the mandala and tile flake (middle resources), and the grotto's walls and atmosphere charge the final image ("chalk fossils of ancient stories"). The setting does not constrain a difficult choice but does supply the symbolic space for closure. All three gates met; moderate causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>During the unlearning is mentioned in opening and closing but does not tighten decisions or tactics. The timeframe remains vague; no clock or urgency tied to the unlearning's duration. The artist's work is described as occurring before dawn but elapsed time is untracked. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>To discover meaning in the mess is declared as motivation early and restated at closure ("Her motivation had never been mere curiosity"). However, it is never dramatized through conflicted choice or visible friction between wants and costs. The artist pursues this goal without obstacle or sacrifice. Told-only with no on-page tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Lilac unease is introduced early ("grotto exhaled a lilac unease"), recurs in the violet chalk and mist imagery, and the tone lifts at closure ("lilac unease lifted as dawn approached"). Coherent through turns with moderate modulation. The tone does not meaningfully charge the final image with pressure but does create atmospheric continuity. Two gates met; lyric reprise present.</comment>
