<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Cinder's motivation is stated ("defiant spark") but rarely tested through contradictory impulses in scene. The fire-lighting decision arrives without on-page friction or visible cost—she performs it smoothly, and the watchers' gasps are reported rather than dramatized through her perception. Interiority relies on elevated abstractions ("gravity of hopelessness," "buoyancy of wonder") rather than embodied sensation, and the final walk forward resets rather than forecloses a path. No meaningful choice or renunciation alters her stance; she simply continues her mission.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation Test: "who" anchors by line one, but "where" (the fortress layout, archway location) and "when" (elapsed time from arrival to fire-spin) remain vague past 120 words, creating mild spatial drift without payoff at closure (−0.3). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (pattern of light versus dark, chant-to-flame), but the ending merely loops back to the opening mission without a decisive tightening or felt cost—Cinder's heart "beats with the rhythm of fire" as it did before, and she walks on unchanged. The mosaic note ("Rise") is discovered but does not narrow options or reweight the stake; she was already committed to lighting fires. No reversal, renunciation, or conceptual repricing lands on the page; closure reads as circular repetition rather than Resonant Reconfiguration or Decisive Change.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The kerosene rag knot is handled concretely (wound, looped, struck, charred) and charges the fire-spin beat, meeting the micro-setting test. The fortress's blooming vines and broken tiles supply vivid anchors, and the mosaic archway constrains Cinder's path at midpoint. Spatial choreography drifts slightly—archway is "half-buried" yet tiles "gleam with reflected glow" later—but sensory detail (floral perfume, clink of ceramic, scent of kerosene) is selective and purposeful, filtered through urgency.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"defy the gravity of hopelessness"—is declared early but remains abstract and untested. The story unfolds as a smooth sequence (arrive, walk, discover mosaic, light fire, leave) with no on-page reversal, tightening, or trade-off. The fire-spin succeeds immediately, watchers gasp offstage, and Cinder walks on unaltered; no live option is foreclosed, and no visible price is paid. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening is required at this length; here the mosaic discovery and fire act are adjacent victories without complication or cost escalation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—hope kindled against despair—emerges through the fire/darkness contrast and the mosaic note "Rise," avoiding overt thesis. The final image ("fortress glowed like a promise") offers a resonant visual answer without moralizing. However, the theme remains anchored in a single layer: light versus dark, with minimal ambiguity or counter-reading. The "serious playfulness" tone intention (Q9J) does not complicate the emotional arc; the journey feels earnest throughout, and the ending affirms rather than reweights the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction carries a purposeful lyric register ("void, a tapestry with no stars," "wordless chant, echoing the mantra") that suits a wandering artisan-protagonist, though it drifts toward stock poeticism ("gravity of hopelessness thick as tar") under peak beats rather than tight perceptual signature. Psychic distance is consistent, and sentence rhythm modulates (short bursts at the fire-spin, longer cadence in the final walk). No dialogue; voice remains coherent, if somewhat generic in its metaphoric choices.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops in adjacent lines: "The chant wove through the hush, a thread of sound…" and "Now, as the hush deepened, she listened with ambient awareness…"; "She walked on… She walked into the dark"; "The night still held no stars… was no longer empty" recycles the starless motif without added pressure. Template cadence: "She [verb]" stems repeat across seven sentences in the final third. Figurative density is high throughout ("bloom of violet flame," "helix, a dancer of light," "tower of light," "beacon") without pattern-teaching or payoff, cluttering peak beats (−0.6). Stock metaphors ("gravity of hopelessness," "buoyancy of wonder") reduce specificity. Information density is moderate; many lines restate mood rather than advance situation. Rounding these issues: baseline artifact penalty −0.8, plus template-cadence penalty −0.4, total effective reduction ~−1.2 from a mid-6 start.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—itinerant fireworks artist lighting hope in dark fortresses—echoes familiar metaphor-quest templates (wanderer brings light to despair) without transforming it through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The mosaic discovery and fire-spin succeed on first attempt with no friction, and Cinder's mission continues unchanged, reading as a proof-of-concept for the conceit rather than a singular narrative. Sensory detail (kerosene, wisteria, ceramic clink) provides texture, but the emotional arc and stakes are stock. No bold structural or perspectival risk heightens meaning; the journey unfolds as a predictable demonstration of the title role. Derivative premise adjustment: −1.0 within Q8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Cinder is present throughout and performs the fire-spin, but her choices do not create key turns. She arrives committed to lighting a fire, discovers a mosaic that confirms her mission, lights the fire successfully, and walks on—no on-page decision alters her trajectory. The mosaic note "Rise" could have introduced a choice (light the fire or another path?), but it functions as affirmation rather than complication. Setup present (paragraph one); middle action (fire-spin); closure cameo (walks on). However, the character's involvement is procedural rather than causal: removing her specific personality and replacing with a generic light-bringer would not alter the plot. Functional but replaceable; no visible cost tied to her distinct traits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The kerosene rag knot is introduced early ("In her pack she carried…"), handled in detail (wound, looped onto spindle, struck with flint), and returns at closure ("now a charred coil, its purpose fulfilled"). It drives the fire-spin beat, which is the story's visual and thematic climax. The object's transformation (soaked → ignited → charred) mirrors the thematic arc. However, the rag knot does not constrain a choice or impose a cost—Cinder uses it as intended without complication, and its "purpose fulfilled" note is declarative rather than dramatized. Strong causal presence and closure linkage, but no friction or tradeoff tied to its use. Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.5, minus ornamental peak use (no cost) −0.6, from mid-band anchor.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The mosaic note "Rise" is discovered at midpoint, serves as a visual and thematic anchor, and resurfaces in the whispered line "We rise" at closure. Setup in first third (archway mentioned), middle discovery beat, and closure echo meet the gate model. However, the note does not shape tactics or create a decision fork—it confirms Cinder's existing mission rather than introducing a new stake or complication. The concept functions as thematic ornament and lyric reprise, reweighting mood but not options. Lyric early-to-final reprise with modest thematic charge; no causal pressure or visible cost. Two gates (middle, closure), lyric reprise bonus +0.4, minus swappability (could be any inspiring symbol) −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Chanting is mentioned twice: "she chanted a rhythmic mantra" while walking, and "Each spiral was a wordless chant, echoing the mantra she had hummed." The trait does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost; it serves as atmospheric flavor. Late in the story, "She hummed a new mantra" signals continuation but no choice pivot. Setup present, closure cameo, but no middle beat where chanting alters tactics or imposes tradeoff. Ornamental trait, swappable with any repetitive habit. Two gates (setup, closure cameo) but no causal pressure or cost; label-only in peak beats −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Filter" appears once in "filtering the rustle of leaves for a hidden pattern" and again in "filtering through the stillness." The action enables the mosaic discovery (she listens, follows clink, finds archway), which is a key turn. However, the filtering itself is passive observation rather than a choice with cost, and the discovery is serendipitous—she walks, hears, follows—rather than driven by the filtering method as a constraint. Setup in first third, one functional beat (leads to mosaic), but no closure participation and no visible cost or complication tied to the act of filtering. Introduced early +0.5, one beat +0.4, minus swappability (could be "searched," "noticed") −0.6, minus ornamental second mention −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Ambient awareness" is named once: "she listened with ambient awareness, filtering the rustle of leaves." The method overlaps with Q9E (filter) and enables the mosaic discovery by allowing her to hear the ceramic clink. However, the mechanics are not signaled early or taught—it appears suddenly in the middle third—and does not shape multiple attempts or impose a tradeoff. The ambient-awareness beat is functional but could be replaced with "careful listening" or "sharp ears" without structural change. One beat, late setup (second third −0.3), swappable −0.6, no closure linkage −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The blooming fortress at dusk supplies vivid anchors (wisteria, bougainvillea, broken flagstones, mosaic archway) and the dusk-to-darkness transition frames urgency. The archway constrains Cinder's path (she kneels, traces tiles), and the fortress walls serve as the canvas for the fire-spin's visual payoff. The "blooming" motif (life amid decay) mirrors theme. However, spatial choreography drifts (archway "half-buried" yet later "gleaming"), and the fortress does not impose a tactical cost or supply a resource that alters outcome—Cinder's plan succeeds as intended. Setup in first paragraph, middle use (archway), closure image (fortress glows). Micro-setting test met; environment charges final image. Setup +0.6, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +1.0, minus spatial drift −0.4, minus no tactical cost −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "night with no stars" is signaled early ("When dusk surrendered to full darkness the sky became a void") and recurs at closure ("The night still held no stars"). The starless night functions as thematic backdrop (despair, absence of hope) and frames the fire as defiant contrast. However, elapsed time is vague—arrival to fire-spin feels immediate, with no clock pressure—and the "hush" does not tighten decisions or tactics. The night is static mood rather than a live constraint. Setup in first third, closure reprise, but no middle beat where time narrows options. Lyric reprise without causal pressure; thematic ornament. Two gates, reprise bonus +0.4, minus vague clock −0.5, minus no tactical impact −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The motivation "to defy the gravity of hopelessness" is stated early ("stubborn spark within refused to be smothered") and drives the fire-lighting act. It resurfaces at closure ("feeling the gravity of hopelessness loosen its grip, replaced by the buoyancy of wonder"). However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses—Cinder never hesitates, doubts, or faces a trade-off; she executes her mission smoothly. The motivation shapes the dominant stake but lacks on-page friction or cost. Setup in first paragraph, middle action (fire-spin), closure echo. Told-only in peak beats; no visible want-versus-cost tension. Two beats +0.5, closure linkage +0.8, minus told-only friction −0.8, minus label-speak ("gravity of hopelessness") −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The required tone "serious playfulness" is declared late ("serious yet playful," "playful rhythm," "playful incantation") but not dramatized through earlier voice or choice texture. The prose reads earnest and elevated throughout, with no tonal modulation between solemn stakes and lighter moments until the final third's self-commentary ("serious playfulness"). The fire-spin beat, the story's climax, is rendered with high lyricism ("helix, a dancer of light") but no playful inflection. Tone coherence is undermined by the late, tell-only introduction of the playfulness claim. One gate (closure label), no middle development, static elevated register. Closure cameo only, minus late introduction −0.8, minus tell-only −0.6.</comment>
