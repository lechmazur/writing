<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael's face-blindness and coin-based method are introduced, but his interiority remains abstract and label-driven. The "discovering limits" theme is asserted ("understood that some limits could only be discovered by trying to surpass them") rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses. His choices—opening the safe, pressing the coin, walking away—lack visible internal cost or friction; the ending reads as philosophical acceptance rather than earned transformation. Motivation is declared but never tested on the page by a competing desire or price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The story establishes a Hybrid lens (causal setup + accumulative lyric closure). Orientation anchors appear early (library, Kael, demolition clock). However, causality flattens in the second half: the coin-to-wall transfer and the sky-mirroring unfold without resistance, and the demolition arrives as scheduled backdrop rather than a pressure that narrows options. The ending offers Conceptual Repricing ("the sky, now free, expanded beyond any wall"), but the cost is asserted in metaphor rather than demonstrated through a forfeited path or visible loss. The final walking-away beat lacks the felt price required for RR or CR to land cleanly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tree-trunk library is vivid and anchors early. The coin's tactile indentations and the "faint ridges transfer a hidden blueprint" moment provide micro-setting detail that drives one key action. Spatial choreography is clear (stacks, wall, book safe). The demolition timeframe pressures the frame, and the scent of "old paper and fresh paint" charges the final breath. However, the setting does not constrain a choice at closure—Kael's walk away is unopposed—so it misses the 7+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—mirroring the sky before demolition—is signaled early. The ticking clock provides situational pressure, but no on-page reversal or tightening choice narrows options. Kael completes his mural without obstacle; the demolition arrives as foretold, and he walks away. The "limit" realization is thematic rather than a trade-off that forecloses a live path. One meaningful escalation is present (the walls shimmer, "unsure whether to hold on or let go"), but it lacks agency-driven cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—limits discovered by surpassing them—emerges from the premise and recurs in image (fractal precision, sky held in finite space). The coin and sky motifs return at closure, reweighting prior material. However, the final paragraphs veer toward explicit statement: "some limits could only be discovered by trying to surpass them" and "knew no boundaries, only the endless dance of light and shadow." These declarations replace scene pressure. The mirrored-sky image is resonant, but the moralizing lowers thematic subtlety.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Kael; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric throughout ("hollowed heart," "fractally precise," "drum against the silence"), creating a consistent atmospheric voice. However, the register remains uniformly poetic even under deadline pressure, flattening urgency. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is present (touch-based observation via coin, focus on geometry and light), but the syntax is template-uniform across beats: many sentences open with "The [noun]" or "Kael [verb]," reducing rhythmic variety under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose is grammatically clean and imagistic, but paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade. Multiple sentences restate the limit theme without added pressure ("limits he had never imagined," "limits of his craft press back," "discovering each time where the boundary lay"). Runs of "The [noun] [verb]" and "Kael [verb]" structures flatten momentum. Figurative density is high throughout ("fractally precise" appears four times, "hush" three times) without escalation or taught pattern. The closure paragraph—"The end, yet beginning"—reads as tacked-on epigram rather than earned image. Accumulated artifacts and loops reach −1.2 within Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The face-blind portrait artist using tactile coin indentations is a fresh synthesis. The tree-trunk library and sky-mirroring mural are specific. However, the "discovering limits" theme and the contemplative artist-before-demolition frame follow familiar templates. The ending's "sky now free, expanded beyond any wall" and recursive thematic statements ("fractal and forever," "no boundaries, only the endless dance") lean on abstraction rather than irreversible particulars. The premise is inventive, but execution retreats into meditative generality at closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Kael is present throughout and his face-blindness frames his coin method. He makes two decisions: to open the safe and press the coin, and to walk away. However, these choices do not create reversals or alter tactics—both unfold as planned. His trait is more backdrop than driver. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but swappable with another contemplative artist without structural loss. Mid-functional band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The book safe appears in three beats: introduction, opening to retrieve the coin, and final closing. It is handled on the page and its "sigh" adds atmospheric detail. However, its function is purely storage—it does not constrain a choice or reweight meaning at closure. The coin inside drives action; the safe itself is a container. Setup and payoff present, but middle development is passive. Functional, but the coin does the causal work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Discovering limits" is named early and recurs thematically. Kael's attempt to mirror the infinite sky in finite walls illustrates the concept. However, the discovery is told rather than dramatized: "understood that some limits could only be discovered by trying to surpass them." No on-page choice is narrowed by encountering a boundary—he completes the mural and leaves. The concept shapes interpretation but not tactics. Thematic presence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Fractally precise" is mentioned four times as a descriptor of Kael's method and the pattern on the wall. It characterizes his brushwork and the coin's indentation map. However, it never constrains or enables a specific action with visible cost; it remains a stylistic label. No moment where fractal precision creates a trade-off or alters an outcome. Present in setup and middle, but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Crafting portraits and the mural is Kael's occupation and drives the premise. The coin-pressing and pigment-mixing beats are on-page actions. The mural's completion is the story's climax. Removing "craft" would collapse the plot. However, the action unfolds without resistance—no failed attempt or revision under pressure. Essential across beats and ending, but lacks the costly constraint that would push it to 8+.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The coin method is introduced early, explained in tactile detail ("faint indentations that mapped the contours of a face"), and used in the key mural beat where Kael presses it to the wall to transfer the pattern. It is present in the final safe-closing moment. The method is specific and irreplaceable—no other tool would work. However, it is applied once without complication or revision, limiting its causal spread. Setup, middle use, and closure presence earned; lacks multiple stressed uses.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The tree-trunk library is anchored early with vivid detail (oak heart, yew bark, spiraling shelves). It supplies the mural canvas and frames the demolition deadline. Kael moves through the space (stacks, wall, book safe niche). The setting is present in setup, middle, and ending, and the final "tree was gone, but its heart... beat on" image reweights it. However, the library does not constrain a tactical choice—Kael's mural proceeds unimpeded by the space. Essential to atmosphere and stakes, one step short of forcing a decision.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The demolition deadline is established in the opening ("hush before the demolition crew arrived," "orders had been signed," "crew would arrive at dawn") and tracked through "morning crept," "sun rose," and "siren wailed." The timeframe tightens Kael's window and charges the ending. However, no mid-scene choice is altered by running out of time—he completes the mural and walks away as planned. The clock provides atmospheric pressure but does not narrow options. Setup and payoff present; middle development passive.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"To mirror the sky inside walls" is stated early and drives Kael's pigment-mixing and mural action. His weeks of preparation and the final shimmer show the desire dramatized. However, no competing want or cost tests the motivation—he succeeds without sacrifice or friction. The motivation is clear and shapes the plot, but lacks the internal conflict or trade-off that would push it higher. Setup and action present; closure reiterates success rather than charging a price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Hush" and stillness dominate the opening and recur throughout ("library held its breath," "heart a drum against the silence," "quiet of his studio"). Tone is consistent and atmospheric. The demolition "wail" and "shudder" briefly tension the stillness, then the ending returns to quiet ("sky, now free, expanded"). The tone charges the final image but does not modulate under pressure—urgency is asserted more than felt in syntax or rhythm. Coherent setup and payoff; lacks dynamic escalation in the middle.</comment>
