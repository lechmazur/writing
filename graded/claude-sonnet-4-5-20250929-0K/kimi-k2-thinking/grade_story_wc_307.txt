<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. Her backward aging and teaching mission are told as premises, but we never see her wrestle with a choice that reveals competing desires or costs. The final act—stepping into the pond—arrives without prior micro-choices that would make this renunciation feel earned by her character logic. Interiority relies heavily on abstract meditation language ("the lesson was complete") rather than embodied sensation or struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The piece establishes a Conceptual Repricing closure where Mira's vanishing enacts her teaching, but the cost remains abstract—no visible forfeiture of a relationship, memory, or concrete stake is dramatized on the page. Orientation is delayed: who Mira is and what she risks only clarifies in retrospect, past the 120-word anchor window. The drive lens wavers between lyric-accumulative (ripple patterns, starlight motifs) and causal (backward aging premise), never fully committing to either, making it difficult to judge escalation or closure under a stable frame.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The floating platform, pond, grotto, and starlight create a vivid atmosphere that remains consistent. The platform and water constrain Mira's final choice—she steps off into the pond, using the environment as both medium and metaphor. However, the grotto itself is described but never directly encountered; it pulses from offstage without altering her tactics. Sensory detail leans heavily visual (starlight, shimmer, rings) with minimal embodiment of temperature, texture, or physical resistance that would ground the meditation concretely.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The dominant stake—teaching vanishing to appear—is declared early but never tested by opposition or internal conflict that would force Mira to choose between competing goods. No reversal narrows her options; the narrative moves in one contemplative direction without a turn that changes what she knows or can do. The final act of stepping into the pond feels like fulfillment of a pre-existing plan rather than a decision forced by accumulated pressure. "Vanish to appear" functions as theme rather than a problem with on-page cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The paradox "to appear, one must first vanish" emerges clearly from the imagery of ripples, backward aging, and dissolution. The final image—Mira becoming the stone—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. However, the piece states its theme multiple times ("She realized…the vanishing she taught was her own disappearance"), reducing subtext to exposition. The recurring pond-rings motif charges the ending, but earlier iterations feel decorative rather than accumulating pressure or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. The narrative voice adopts an elevated, lyric register ("sycamore hush," "the breath of the night") that stays consistent but borders on abstraction, especially in peak moments where embodied perception would sharpen urgency. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she realized") cluster in reflective passages without dramatizing the realizations through action. Perceptual signature is generic-mystical rather than character-specific; Mira's way of noticing doesn't reveal her particular history or biases.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Figurative language ("soft fog," "silver threads," "second skin") appears in most sentences without pattern-teaching, creating density that slows momentum. Paraphrase loops recur: "the lesson was complete" echoes "the tapestry unfolded, showing that to appear, one must first vanish." Template cadence: multiple sentences open with "She [verb]" or "The [noun]" across paragraphs. Sentence-level propulsion stalls in the middle third where description circles the same images (rings, starlight, grotto pulse) without new information. The closure image—water closing "like a second skin"—lands clearly despite prior overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The backward-aging premise combined with teaching-through-vanishing offers a fresh synthesis, but execution leans on familiar mystical-meditation tropes (floating platform, still pond, starlight, cosmic pulse). The emotional arc—acceptance of dissolution—follows a predictable wisdom-journey template without a non-obvious turn. Specificity is limited: Mira's disciples, the grotto's discovery, and her memory-erasure are mentioned but not made particular through lived detail. Risk-taking in structure (lyric, reflective) does not fully cohere with the causal setup (backward aging's mechanics and costs).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and her backward aging is stated repeatedly, but she makes no on-page choice that hinges on this trait. Her decisions—casting stones, stepping into the pond—would read identically if she aged normally. The backward aging functions as atmospheric premise rather than a constraint that narrows her options or forces a trade-off with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The magnetic grotto is introduced early and returns in multiple beats, but it remains off-stage, pulsing from beyond the ridge. Mira never enters it, handles it, or uses it to solve a problem. Its "pull" is described but does not constrain her tactics or alter the pond-meditation choice. The grotto's presence charges atmosphere but does not drive causality or closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>Delayed revelation is named explicitly ("delayed revelation") in the text but not enacted structurally. The story withholds no crucial information from the reader that later reweights prior scenes. Mira's realization that "the vanishing she taught was her own disappearance" is a thematic echo, not a plot turn that changes her options. The concept remains label-only rather than shaping stakes on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Weaves truth carefully" and "withheld the final clue" are stated but not dramatized through specific choices with visible cost. We do not see Mira decide *what* to withhold, *when* to reveal, or pay a price for the withholding. The trait functions as character description rather than a constraint that enables or complicates her teaching in a beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Withholding appears twice: Mira "withheld the final clue" and later "whispered" a forgotten name. Neither instance drives a major turn. The first is summary ("letting the silence speak"); the second is part of the dissolution sequence but does not redefine options. The action is present but could be swapped for "revealed" or "demonstrated" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The pond-rings method is signaled early (stone cast, ripples watched) and returns at closure when Mira steps into the water, creating "new rings" that "intersected the old." The mechanics—reading truth in the gaps between ripples—are described but not tested; no failed attempt or refinement shows the method shaping her choices. The method charges the final image through reprise but does not constrain her tactics in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The floating platform is introduced in the opening line and Mira sits cross-legged on it for much of the piece, but it does not alter her choices. She rises and steps off, using it as a launch point, but the platform's hovering, granite solidity, or magnetic suspension never constrains or enables a decision. It functions as a striking visual anchor without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The trance is mentioned ("the trance descended") but never tracked as a duration that tightens decisions. We do not know how long Mira meditates, when the trance begins or ends, or what cost lingering in it imposes. The timeframe remains vague and does not shape her tactics or create urgency. "Through the trance" reads as a thematic label rather than a dramatized constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to teach vanishing to appear" is declared early and drives the thematic arc, but it is never dramatized in conflict with another want (survival, memory retention, connection to disciples). Mira pursues the goal without friction or doubt. The final act enacts the teaching, linking motivation to closure, but no on-page beat shows her choosing this teaching over an alternative path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The tone—quiet, reverent, meditative—remains consistent and modulates subtly: "soft hush" opens, "the night held its breath" closes. The sycamore hush recurs as a framing device, charging the final image with stillness and waiting. However, the tone does not tighten under pressure; peak beats (realization, stepping into water) carry the same contemplative register as exposition, flattening emotional progression. Coherence is strong; dynamic range is limited.</comment>
