<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's interiority is grounded in embodied grief—the slick palms, the trembling hands—and his motivation to restore Mara's memory drives action. However, his emotional arc stays linear; he experiences worry and determination but no contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final choice (pressing wildflowers to crystal) feels more procedural than torn, and Mara's transformation happens off-page, so the cost to Kael is implied rather than viscerally felt. Minor penalty for label-reliant interiority ("massive silence still ringing") that edges toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The drive lens is Causal with lyric-texture accents: whale death → gravity anomalies → memory loss → coffee-ground divination → chamber exhumation → memory restoration. The closure—crystal fracturing and memory returning—lands on-page with cost (Kael's physical and emotional exertion, Mara's hollowed spaces refilled). Orientation anchors cleanly by paragraph two (dock, dawn, Kael's job). One meaningful tightening occurs when Kael stakes his dive into the chamber on the coffee-ground map. The BRR load is high (~35% backstory/exposition on gravity storms, town lore, superstitions) but remains anchored to present stimuli (the beached whale, Mara's empty eyes) and primes the closure. Pressure accumulates steadily, though the middle sags slightly with expository density. No orientation penalty applied; waiver holds because the pattern is taught and the lens is coherent at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The salt crystal chamber and gravity pockets constrain Kael's movements (steps drag, breath crushes/floats) and supply the mechanism for memory recovery, directly shaping the climax. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "metallic" salt air, "cotton wool soaked in starlight," lilac scent refracted from the crystal. The dock's spatial choreography is clear. Gravity as micro-setting charges the final image when pockets "quiet" and flames point "true north." Minor deduction for occasional postcard phrasing ("gleaming silence," "fractured light") that decorates more than it constrains, and for the whale's role being more thematic backdrop than lived environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recovering Mara's lost memory—is signaled early and sustained. Kael's agency drives escalation: he researches superstitions, divines via coffee grounds, navigates dense gravity pockets, and physically exhumes the crystal. The final act (pressing wildflowers to crystal) narrows options and delivers visible cost: the crystal fractures, memory pours out "as weight," and Kael's earlier fear is resolved when Mara recalls the violets. One meaningful tightening occurs when the coffee-ground map points to the fifth piling, forcing Kael's descent. The lack of an on-page antagonist or internal conflict (Kael never doubts, never faces a trade-off) keeps pressure coherent but single-note. Cost is present but muted—Kael's exertion is described, but no explicit sacrifice or foreclosed path appears.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—grief as material force, memory as recoverable artifact—emerges through concrete images: gravity pockets, salt crystals humming with "stolen moments," the whale's death "cracking the world open." The ending offers a resonant answer without moralizing: "some things, once buried, could be brought back to light by understanding where they had gone." The pressed wildflowers function as both key and prayer, charging the closure without over-explanation. Subtext operates in Kael's silence with Mara and the story's refusal to resolve the whale's larger meaning. Minor deduction for "gleaming silence" as a repeated phrase that edges toward aesthetic ornament rather than thematic pressure, and for the final whale song feeling like a thematic coda rather than an earned reprise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present but not sharp—Kael notices gravity effects, scents, textures, but his diction ("massive silence," "gleaming silence," "fractured light") recurs in ways that feel authorial rather than character-particular. The prose modulates under pressure (shorter syntax in the chamber) but maintains elevated register throughout, even at peak stress. Dialogue is minimal and functional; Mara's line at the end advances plot and carries subtext (recognition without full memory). Filter verbs ("felt," "knew," "saw") are frequent but voice-motivated. Minor penalty for register consistency that doesn't degrade appropriately under physical strain (Kael navigating lethal gravity pockets with lyric composure) and for recycled phrase stems ("the gleaming silence").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high, though expository blocks in the middle (paragraphs on superstitions, Old Mira's method, gravity rules) slow momentum. Figurative language is frequent and mostly clear, but metaphor density in non-peak beats ("time-lapsed glaciers," "cotton wool soaked in starlight," "ghost of sound") borders on overwriting without pattern-teaching. Two paraphrase loops: "gleaming silence" appears three times with minimal reweighting; "massive silence" and "gleaming silence" echo each other. The final image ("last lantern flickered," "another whale sang") feels like a thematic flourish rather than propulsive closure. Grammar and usage are clean. Apply −0.6 for loop/scaffold (repeated stems, paraphrase of "silence" motif) and −0.3 for figurative density in middle expository beats that dull momentum rather than charge it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of gravity anomalies, memory loss, salt-crystal storage, and divination via coffee grounds is specific and non-obvious. The premise transforms a familiar trope (grief as supernatural force) through grounded world-building: brine pumps, chandlery lore, harbor physics. Kael's occupation (lantern lighter) integrates organically with the setting and stakes. The emotional truth—sibling devotion, the desperation to reverse cognitive loss—anchors the fantastical elements. Risk-taking (the high-concept premise, the lyric tone) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor deduction for the whale as a somewhat convenient inciting event (large death → gravity storm) that feels more thematic trigger than inevitable cause, and for the coffee-ground divination being introduced and resolved in two paragraphs without complication.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's occupation (lantern lighter) frames his presence on the dock and supplies the hook (paragraph one) and tools (lantern hook opens the chamber door). His choices drive all major beats: researching, divining, navigating gravity pockets, exhuming the crystal, pressing wildflowers. The final image ("lanterns above burning steady… flames pointing true north") charges his success. Removing this character role would collapse the story's logic and stakes.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The wildflowers appear in paragraph four (Mara's gift, pressed in almanac), return in paragraph nineteen (grow warm, pressed to crystal as key/prayer), and are echoed in the ending (Mara recalls "the violets"). They constrain the climax (Kael uses them as the mechanism to unlock the memory) and reweight prior material (the gift now a literal tool). High causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability; the exact properties (Mara's gift, botanical origin) matter. Cost is present (Kael risks the keepsake to recover the memory).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Gravity pockets are introduced in paragraph two (whale death → gravity storms), shape all middle tactics (Kael's steps drag/skip, breath crushes/floats, chamber door mechanics), and resolve at closure ("gravity pockets now quiet," flames stable). The concept enables the premise (memory as stolen weight), constrains Kael's movement, and charges the final image. Removing gravity would require full rewrite. Early setup, multi-beat involvement, closure participation, and high specificity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Fluctuates mysteriously" describes gravity behavior in paragraph three (flame bends inexplicably) and recurs in paragraph seventeen (memory's gravity can't decide to exist/dissolve). It constrains Kael's navigation (unpredictable drag/weightlessness) and charges one peak beat (breath alternately crushes/floats). However, the trait is described more than it forces specific on-page choices with visible trade-offs. Mid-high for causal presence and closure echo, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Exhume" drives the climax: Kael chips at the crystal (paragraph eighteen), each flake releasing sound. The action is prepared by prior beats (researching, divining, navigating) and pays off when the crystal fractures and memory returns. The verb's specificity (archaeological, effortful) cannot be swapped without loss. Early signal (paragraph eight: "exhuming old superstitions"), middle development (paragraph nine: "memories could be mined"), and decisive closure role. High causal pressure, cost connection (Kael's physical effort), and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Coffee grounds are signaled in paragraph ten, used in paragraph eleven (Kael studies sediment, sees spiral pointing to fifth piling), and enable the chamber discovery. The method shapes one key turn (locating the target) and is specific to the world (Old Mira's teaching). However, it resolves in two paragraphs without complication or cost, and any divination method could substitute with minor edits. Mid-range for functional causal role but limited beat involvement and no closure echo.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The salt crystal chamber is reached in paragraph thirteen, supplies the mechanism (crystals grow memories, gravity works differently), constrains Kael's navigation (inward-pulling gravity, alternating breath effects), and delivers the climax (crystal exhumation and fracture). The setting is irreplaceable: removing it collapses the recovery logic. Early signal (paragraph eight: brine pumps), strong middle development (paragraphs fourteen–nineteen), and decisive closure participation. High causal pressure, specificity (brine-hardened edges, facets humming), and cost (Kael's physical ordeal).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The whale beaches at dawn (paragraph two), triggering gravity storms and memory loss. The timeframe anchors the inciting incident and the urgency (Mara's emptiness at breakfast same day, Kael acts that afternoon/night). The ending notes the whale being "cut apart for salvage" and another whale singing, creating a cyclic temporal frame. Time tightens Kael's decision to act immediately. Mid-high for setup, stake-shaping, and closure echo, though the clock itself isn't tracked beat-by-beat after the initial anchor.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Kael's desire to find where deleted memories go is dramatized in every beat: his reaction to Mara's empty eyes (paragraph four), researching superstitions (paragraph eight), divining location (paragraph eleven), navigating dangers (paragraph twelve), exhuming the crystal (paragraph eighteen). The motivation braids with his grief and shapes the final image (Mara's recall, Kael's silent acknowledgment). Friction is present (physical danger, the fantastical premise testing belief) but not internal conflict. High causal pressure, multi-beat involvement, closure linkage, but cost is external rather than torn choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Gleaming silence" appears in paragraphs three, thirteen, and twenty-three, modulating from harbor atmosphere to chamber pressure to the space between Kael and Mara. The tone is consistent (hushed, luminous, grief-soaked) and charges the final image ("letting the gleaming silence between them hold the truth"). It shapes perception (silence "pressed against his eardrums") and supports the lyric register. Minor deduction for repetition that edges toward ornament in non-peak beats, but the payoff at closure is strong and reweights prior uses.</comment>
