<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The custodian's motivation ("prove that coincidences have meaning") is stated rather than embodied in contradictory impulses. Her retrocognitive gift functions as a plot mechanism without showing cost or trade-off in the peak moment. The final choice to position the shard feels inevitable from setup rather than earned through struggle; no live option is foreclosed with visible internal friction. Interiority leans toward abstract philosophizing ("coincidence was merely pattern seen from too narrow a perspective") rather than embodied emotion under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed—"three winters after the collapse" and "beacon-tower" establish time and place, but who the custodian is remains vague past 120 words. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the final light-column and convergence of three travelers reweight the opening premise with conceptual cost (belief restored). However, the closure unit relies heavily on coincidence (travelers arrive carrying exactly the knowledge needed) which complicates rather than resolves under Situational rules; the conceptual cost is felt but the causal path to that moment is thin. One meaningful deepening occurs when she understands pattern, but the cost of this realization is abstract rather than legible in forfeited options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The glass humming pavilion constrains the final action—she must wait for the Navigator constellation and align the shard within the pavilion's star-path markings. The pavilion's resonance ("humming grew louder as starlight struck") charges the closure image. Sensory detail is purposeful: "low thrum that matched her heartbeat," starlight through cracked glass. The post-collapse wasteland is gestured at but remains generic; the tower interior and pavilion are vivid and functional.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rekindle the beacon to prove pattern over chaos—is clear. Pressure accumulates through retrocognitive visions and the approaching conjunction, but no live choice narrows options; she waits for the alignment and executes a preset sequence. The arrival of three travelers at the end reweights hope but introduces no visible cost to the protagonist; her "thistle blown by hope's improbable breath" is metaphorical rather than a forfeited path. One meaningful tightening (understanding the flaw's origin) occurs, but agency at closure is passive observation rather than renunciation or decision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—coincidence as deep order—emerges from the custodian's visions and the star-path convergence. The final image (beacon answered by another distant beacon) offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the text drifts into direct thematic statement: "coincidence was the echo of a deeper order," "hope is a geometry we build together." The shard of hush and star paths function thematically but the piece leans toward assertion ("What seemed like random chance was the universe's oldest language") rather than letting the particulars speak. The ending avoids a tidy moral but the thematic voice becomes over-articulated in the final third.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Single-POV, third-person limited with stable distance. Perceptual signature is present—"fingers following constellations," retrocognitive flashes—but interior lexicon drifts into elevated register inconsistent with a custodian's idiom: "thistle of hope rooted in ruin," "precise geometry of repair." No dialogue. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she understood," "she realized") cluster in reflective passages without voice motivation. Psychic distance remains controlled, but the prose voice converges toward a consensus literary register rather than character-specific texture under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout without pattern-teaching: "beacon of light," "starlight through cracked glass," "thistle-blown hope," "shattered sun," "universe's oldest language." Multiple adjacent lines restate the theme ("coincidence was merely pattern," "signatures written across time," "coincidence was the echo of a deeper order") creating paraphrase loops. Template cadence in the final third: "The beacon would guide them, and they would guide her, and meaning would be remade..." Elevated diction ("retrocognitively blessed," "discordant shards," "beacon's apex") clashes with the POV. Clarity remains high, but momentum sags under lyric ornamentation. Apply −0.8 for figurative overload and paraphrase loops, escalated because they touch the closure sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—retrocognitive custodian repairs a mystical beacon—combines familiar post-apocalyptic and fantasy elements without a fresh synthesis. The "shard of hush" is an evocative phrase but functions generically as a magical catalyst. The convergence of three strangers carrying exactly the needed knowledge is convenient rather than inevitable. Emotional specificity is limited; the custodian's arc follows a template discovery-to-understanding path. The transformation test fails: swap names and setting, the arc remains unchanged. One modest inflection: silence becoming light through the pavilion's resonance.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The custodian observes, waits, and arranges the prism; her retrocognitive visions inform but do not force a trade-off. She makes one key action (positioning the shard at the star-path intersection) but this is preset by prior visions rather than a choice under competing pressures. Present in setup, middle beats, and ending, but her agency is execution of a revealed plan rather than decision that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The broken crystal prism appears in the opening, is arranged "like a shattered sun" in the climax, and refracts stillness into light at closure. It is handled in at least two distinct beats and its fracture constrains the method of rekindling. However, it shares causal weight with the shard of hush and the pavilion; removing the prism alone would not break closure if the shard remained. Essential but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The shard of hush is introduced early, "whispered secrets when touched," and is positioned at the climax to transform silence into light. It shapes one key turn (the rekindling) and is present at closure. However, its unique property—absolute quiet—could be swapped for another mystical catalyst ("shard of focus," "crystal of stillness") with minor edits. Functional but somewhat replaceable; its specificity is more poetic than mechanical.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Retrocognition provides visions that guide the custodian's understanding and timing, appearing in setup and middle beats. It enables her to see the original flaw and the star alignment needed. However, it imposes no visible cost or constraint; she accesses visions without trade-off or friction. The trait is present and functional but lacks the pressure of a limited resource or painful price. No on-page moment shows the attribute costing her something.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rekindling the beacon is the protagonist's explicit goal from early on, drives the middle sequence (waiting for the conjunction, arranging the prism), and succeeds at closure with the light column piercing the night. The action is irreplaceable—this is the story's spine. It also draws the three travelers, seeding the future rebuild. Present in all three gates and causally central; removing it collapses the narrative.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Tracking star paths is signaled early (the astronomer's silver-painted calculations), used in the middle (she traces faded paths), and executed at closure (she rotates the shard "tracking star paths through the pavilion's markings"). The method constrains her timing (must wait for Navigator constellation) and spatial choice (alignment at the intersection). It is specific and plot-active, though the mechanics remain somewhat abstract; we see her follow them but the exact difficulty or alternate methods are not explored.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glass humming pavilion is introduced early, houses the climactic action, and its resonance ("humming grew louder as starlight struck the glass") amplifies the shard's effect into the light column. It provides the star-path markings essential to the method and charges the final image. The pavilion is irreplaceable; its unique acoustics and astronomer's ceiling are load-bearing. Present in setup, middle, and payoff with strong causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The collapse is mentioned in the opening and establishes a post-apocalyptic backdrop, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions. "Three winters" provides rough chronology; the night of the conjunction creates a single deadline. However, the collapse itself is ornamental—swap it for "after the war" or "after the plague" and the story's logic is unchanged. Present but largely replaceable as a setting detail rather than a live temporal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The motivation to prove coincidences have meaning is stated early ("Her motivation burned clear"), returns in the middle visions (each coincidence is a "signature"), and is affirmed at closure ("Her proof was complete"). However, it is told and philosophized rather than dramatized in a choice with friction. No moment shows her risking something concrete to pursue this belief or struggling against doubt. Present across beats but not embodied in conflicted action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Thistle-blown hope appears as a phrase and motif: "heart a thistle blown by hope's improbable breath," "thistle of hope rooted in ruin," "thistle-blown hope of a new dawn." The tone modulates from solitary determination to quiet exultation as the beacon lights and travelers approach. It is carried through turns and charges the final image. However, "thistle" functions more as decorative recurrence than a tone that constrains choice; it is lyric consistency rather than pressure-shaping atmosphere. Coherent and present but somewhat ornamental.</comment>
