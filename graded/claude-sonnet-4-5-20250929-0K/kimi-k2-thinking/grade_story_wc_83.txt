<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is consistent and embodied throughout—her choices are concrete (pushing calibration too hard, locking coordinates, placing the geode in the transfer slot). Internal contradiction appears in "bleak exhilaration" and the tension between mapping versus using energy, showing authentic complexity. The wedding backstory anchors present perception with a micro-choice (letting the geode drink readings) that alters her stance. Deduct −0.3 for slight over-articulation in lines like "understanding that survival meant carrying the weight of all unlived possibilities," which edges toward diagnostic clarity rather than dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean by the opening sentence (observatory, three kilometers above, geode against scanner). The Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through perturbed readings, geode warming, and the final image of refracted starlight reweighting "unused potential" into "infinitely remembered." Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the hunt shifts from extraction to witnessing with conceptual cost ("potential stopped being unused and became, instead, infinitely remembered"). Deduct −0.4 for causality fuzziness: why the breakers blew and what "twenty minutes" materially changes remains abstract, and the locked coordinates never force a follow-on choice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The floating observatory, geode, and scanner constrain choices concretely: Kael steadies herself against the scanner during tilt, the geode warms in response to the pool, and the transfer slot is used under a live clock. Sensory detail is purposeful ("sound like distant thunder, or distant bombs," "heavy and cold and perfect"). The dead zone and high-altitude current supply spatial pressure. No cap applied; environment charges the final image when starlight passes through the geode's "crystallized ghosts."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: find where unused potential pools before the breakers reboot. One meaningful tightening occurs when the algorithm screams and Kael locks coordinates, narrowing her window to three minutes. Agency is present (she chooses to map rather than extract, places the geode in the transfer slot), and the renunciation of extraction carries conceptual cost. Deduct −0.5 because the twenty-minute clock does not materially alter tactics mid-scene—Kael's moves would read identically without it—and the locked coordinates never force a trade-off or consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the geode's hollow core, wedding decorations, perturbation sequences, and the final refracted beam. The ending offers a resonant answer—witnessing transforms unused potential into infinite remembrance—without stating a moral. The phrase "immaculate potential that death had interrupted" and the closing smile deliver non-literal thematic charge. Deduct −0.2 for one Thematic Echo in the penultimate paragraph: "the potential stopped being unused and became, instead, infinitely remembered" over-articulates the thesis where the image alone would suffice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited; perceptual signature is character-specific (geodes as wedding memory, microvolts as grief). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("bleak exhilaration," "geography of what never happened"). Deduct −0.5 for register drift in peak beats: "perturbation sequences that nudged reality just enough to make it confess" and "immaculate potential" elevate diction beyond Kael's established idiom during high-pressure moments. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high (each line advances character, atmosphere, or stakes). Deduct −0.8 for template cadence in the middle third: multiple sentences open with "The [noun]" or "[Noun] + past-tense verb" (e.g., "The geode warmed," "The system chimed," "The observatory hummed"), creating a drumbeat pattern. Additional −0.3 for paraphrase loop: "Her twenty minutes were up" duplicates information already conveyed by "one minute remaining" and the chime. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "galaxy of unspent futures" borders on overwrought but does not obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of drone-strike survivor + quantum imprint mapping + geodes as trauma signature is specific and non-obvious. The observatory as floating grief archive and "perturbation theory" as method for mapping unlived futures show conceptual integrity. The wedding detail (geodes as table decorations) earns the material in hindsight. Deduct −0.2 for "bleak exhilaration" trending toward stock juxtaposition without fresh inflection, and another −0.2 for the phrase "immaculate potential," which gestures at profundity without grounding in lived detail.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's survivor status is seeded early (opening paragraph) and shapes her motivation throughout. She makes two distinct on-page decisions: pushing calibration too hard (causing the breaker failure) and choosing to map rather than extract energy. The wedding backstory constrains her present stance (she will not commit "another kind of violence"). Her final smile and act of witnessing constitute a third beat. Slight swappability: another trauma survivor type could replace drone strike without structural change, though the geode connection would weaken.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The geode appears in four distinct beats: pressed against the scanning plate (opening), releasing trauma-signature (past calibration), warming in response to the pool (midpoint), and placed in the transfer slot to drink readings (ending). Its hollow core and quantum imprints are irreplaceable properties. It charges the final image (starlight through crystallized ghosts). Setup, development, and payoff gates all satisfied. Deduct for slight ornamental use in the wedding backstory, where it is described but does not yet constrain choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Unfiltered awakening" is named once in the narrative ("This was the unfiltered awakening: understanding that survival meant..."). It does not constrain tactics or alter a choice; instead it functions as thematic commentary. The concept arguably shapes Kael's stance—her refusal to extract energy and embrace of witnessing—but this is interpretive rather than dramatized through a specific turn where "awakening" changes her options. Present in closure mood but not causally active.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Intangibly tangible" is introduced early ("energy that pooled like blood in shadows, potential that never got to detonate") and reappears at the algorithm climax ("glittered like phantom diamonds, intangibly tangible"). It describes the nature of what Kael hunts but does not constrain a choice or impose visible cost. The attribute colors the stakes and recurs with reweighted meaning in the closure paragraph ("stories that would never be told"), meeting the lyric-resonance allowance. Cap at ~6.3 for reprise without mid-scene causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The hunt drives the entire structure: Kael scans, applies perturbation sequences, finds the pool, locks coordinates, and places the geode in the transfer slot. Two major beats trace directly to hunting (locking coordinates, final scan). The action is irreplaceable—remove "hunt" and the story collapses into passive observation. The final line ("The hunt was not for vengeance, nor redemption, but for the simple, unbearable act of witnessing") charges closure. Setup, development, and payoff gates satisfied with causal pressure across multiple beats.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Perturbation theory" is named and explained early ("through perturbation theory, she mapped how slight disturbances...revealed where unused potential pooled") and used in the middle beat ("perturbation sequences that nudged reality"). Its mechanics matter minimally: the algorithm screams and Kael locks coordinates, but the theory itself is interchangeable with any technical scanning method. One causal beat (algorithm finding the pool) but swappable without structural loss. Present in setup and development; no closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The observatory is introduced in the opening sentence and provides micro-setting pressure: Kael steadies herself against the scanner during tilt, the tremor-dampeners groan, and the breakers' cooling cycle creates the twenty-minute window. The setting constrains choices (she cannot scan until breakers cool) and supplies the window for final observation (starlight through geode). Setup and development gates satisfied; the observatory participates in closure when Kael holds the geode to the window. Deduct for the breaker constraint being declared but not dramatized with tactical cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The twenty-minute timeframe is signaled early ("twenty minutes before the systems rebooted") and counts down ("three minutes," "one minute remaining," "twenty minutes were up"). However, it does not visibly tighten tactics—Kael's actions would read identically without the clock. The breakers cooling to completion is noted but does not force a trade-off or omission. Setup and payoff gates satisfied (the final line confirms expiration), but middle development is weak. Cap at 4.6 for missing causal pressure in the middle.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Kael's desire to find where unused potential pools is stated early and drives every beat: scanning, applying perturbations, locking coordinates, placing the geode in the transfer slot. Internal conflict appears in her refusal to extract versus the temptation implied by "pushed too hard trying to extract a full trauma-signature." The motivation shapes the final image (mapping versus using energy). Three beats involve the hunt; cost is conceptual (bearing witness as "unbearable act"). Setup, development, and payoff satisfied with causal linkage and visible renunciation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Bleak exhilaration" is named twice (early and late) and embodied throughout: "purpose without promise," "terrible, truthful smile," and the paradox of floating above buried futures. Tone modulates appropriately—anticipation during calibration, crystallization at the algorithm scream, charged witnessing at closure. The final image (refracted beams, smile) carries both bleakness and exhilaration without restating the label. Coherent through turns and charges the ending. Deduct −0.3 for the label appearing twice as explicit commentary rather than being sustained purely through image and action.</comment>
