<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mira's core motivation is stated rather than tested under pressure—she "believes" and "understands" in summary rather than facing contradictory impulses that force a visible choice. The profession of corridor echo cartographer remains ornamental; no on-page moment shows how her sensitivity constrains a tactical decision or imposes a cost. Interior voice relies on abstract declarations ("sensitively perceptive nature translated chalk dust into feeling") and therapeutic self-awareness ("legacy's burden transformed from weight to compass") that flatten embodied struggle. The ending shift from discovery to activism is asserted rather than earned through a dramatized renunciation or sacrifice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who, where, and when emerge slowly across the opening, applying a −0.4 penalty here and capping Q3 at 7.0. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens through its layered objects and echoes, but the final turn—Mira's decision to share the findings—lacks a dramatized moment where she weighs and forecloses an alternative path. The closure unit reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (shift from mourning to action), yet the cost is conceptual and summarized ("legacy's burden transformed") rather than shown through a specific forfeiture or conflict on the page. Backstory dominates the middle third without micro-choices that tilt present stakes, flattening escalation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage and frost-vine hybrids anchor the post-climate setting with vivid sensory detail. The fireplace's surrender of diaries and the milky sun through cracked ceiling provide tactile, purposeful images. However, the passage functions primarily as backdrop; no on-page moment shows Mira navigating a physical constraint (blocked corridor, unstable floor) that alters her approach or charges the final image. Spatial choreography is stable but minimal—most action involves static handling of objects rather than movement through the environment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—to discover what walls dream about—is signaled early but remains abstract throughout. No on-page reversal narrows Mira's options or forces a trade-off; she finds the diaries, deciphers the film, compiles findings, and shares them in a linear accumulation without friction. The climatologist's suppressed formula could generate pressure (risk of sharing dangerous knowledge, institutional pushback), yet these remain off-page. The ending asserts transformation ("legacy's burden was not to mourn what was lost but to rebuild what was possible") without dramatizing the choice or showing a visible price paid.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of suppressed knowledge and unfinished hope emerges organically from the diaries and film strip. The recurring phrase "legacy's burden" and the final corridor message "Remember, but act" provide thematic closure. However, the ending relies on explicit thematic summary ("to discover what walls dream about was to inherit their unfinished stories") rather than a non-literal image that reweights prior material. The piece avoids moralizing but does not resist the urge to state its insight directly. The film negative as a talisman of past solutions offers a concrete anchor, though its thematic charge is told more than shown.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Diction remains elevated throughout ("sonic fossils," "residual pulse," "harmonic of guilt"), which fits the lyric-essay register but occasionally drifts into abstraction ("sensitively perceptive nature translated chalk dust into feeling") that obscures concrete perception. The phrase "sensitively perceptive" recurs seven times, creating template cadence and synonym churn. Interior texture is consistent but generic—Mira's way of noticing reads as authorial summary rather than character-particular perception. No dialogue appears; the piece relies entirely on narrated reflection and description.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Heavy template cadence and paraphrase loops throughout: "sensitively perceptive" appears in seven beats, often in identical syntactic positions; "legacy's burden" and "half-burned diaries" and "film negative strip" recur as formulaic anchors without evolving imagery. Adjacent sentences restate the same content: "She believed stone and plaster accumulated human intention" followed by "stone remembered everything, absorbed intention like a battery." Figurative language is stacked without pattern-teaching ("sonic fossils," "limestone accumulates bone," "heart a drum," "seed crystal"), creating density that slows rather than propels. Multiple beats open with "Mira + [verb]" or "The [noun]" in mechanical alternation. Apply −1.2 for pervasive loops and template runs, with an additional −0.5 because artifacts appear in the final third, disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The profession of corridor echo cartographer and the premise of walls retaining sonic memory offer a fresh speculative angle. The combination of climate-collapse setting, suppressed climatology, and psychometry-adjacent mapping feels specific rather than generic. However, the emotional arc—lone researcher uncovers suppressed truth and shares it to inspire a movement—follows a familiar template without transformation through unexpected cost or moral complication. The ivy-veiled university and half-burned diaries provide textural freshness, but the journey from discovery to dissemination lacks the turn or synthesis that would make the premise feel inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Mira as corridor echo cartographer is present throughout and frames the premise. Her profession enables the discovery (sensitively perceptive to frequencies, mapping echoes) and motivates the search. However, her occupation does not constrain a key choice or force a trade-off on the page. The story would function with minor edits if she were an archivist, archaeologist, or historian. Present by the first line (setup ✓), but middle beats show passive discovery rather than a decision-point shaped by her specific skills (development weak), and the ending centers on sharing findings rather than a cartographer-specific act (payoff partial). Two-of-three gates met; functional but replaceable. Early signal +0.3, two beats +0.9, swappability −0.6, ornamental profession use −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The film negative strip is introduced at the one-third mark (collapsed fireplace yields diaries, then the strip among them). Mira holds it to the sun to glimpse the past (beat one), discovers shadow-writing in the margin (beat two), develops it that night to reveal the full formula (beat three), and it becomes her talisman and proof in the final beats (beat four). The object drives the major discovery—the climatologist's suppressed equation—and charges the ending as "seed crystal for a thousand new calculations." All three gates met: setup at ~33%, development (the formula changes her mission), payoff (closure hinges on sharing the strip's contents). Early signal penalty −0.3, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, slight swappability (photograph or document could substitute) −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Legacy's burden" is named repeatedly and functions as the thematic spine: Mira inherits the climatologist's unfinished work and transforms shame into compass. The concept is signaled early ("legacy's burden pressed against Mira's ribs"), recurs in reflection ("legacy's burden wasn't merely shame but unfinished business"), and the ending declares transformation ("legacy's burden was not to mourn what was lost but to rebuild what was possible"). However, it remains abstract—no on-page choice shows Mira weighing the burden's cost (risk of sharing dangerous knowledge, personal sacrifice, opposition) against an alternative. The concept shapes theme but does not narrow tactical options on the page. Setup ✓, development (told reflection, not choice) weak, payoff (thematic statement) partial. Early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.8, told-only/label −0.8, swappability (inheritance, duty, responsibility) −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Sensitively perceptive" recurs in seven beats as a label describing Mira's ability to distinguish frequencies, detect ink beneath char, translate chalk dust into feeling, and register the corridor's dream shift. The trait enables discovery but does not constrain a choice or impose a visible cost. No moment shows her sensitivity as a burden (overwhelmed by noise, unable to filter trauma) that she must manage or trade against another need. Setup ✓ (first paragraph), development (passive observation, not a forced choice), payoff (she understands the shift, but the trait does not charge the final image with tradeoff or loss). Two-of-three gates; functional but label-only. Early signal +0.4, three beats +1.4, label-only without cost −0.9, ornamental −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Glimpse" appears throughout: Mira glimpses the past through the film (inverted tones, green quadrangles), glimpses shadow-writing in the margin, glimpses the human cost through the diaries (twice), and watches the full image bloom in development. The action is passive observation rather than decisive choice, yet it drives the central discovery (the formula) that redefines her mission. The verb is signaled early and recurs, but could be replaced with "see," "discern," "uncover" with minimal structural change. Setup ✓, development (the glimpsed formula changes stakes) ✓, payoff (glimpsing the truth leads to sharing) ✓. All three gates met; functional but mid-swappability. Early signal +0.5, four beats +1.4, causal role +0.8, closure linkage (indirect) +0.5, swappability −0.7, passive/observational −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The half-burned diaries are discovered in the collapsed fireplace in the opening third and recur across beats: Mira lifts them with care, the diaries reveal the climatologist's ordered silence, she glimpses human cost through them, they become "sacred texts in the reclamation movement," and she sends excerpts in her final report. The method (discovery via fireplace) is concrete and early, and the diaries supply the narrative engine (the suppressed knowledge that drives Mira's shift from mapping to activism). However, the mechanics of reading charred pages are asserted rather than shown—no beat demonstrates the difficulty or tradeoff of deciphering damaged text. Setup ✓, development (diaries change mission) ✓, payoff (excerpts shared) ✓. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +0.9, mechanics under-dramatized −0.8, summary-only use −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The ivy-veiled passage is named in the opening and recurs across beats: Mira presses fingers to its stones, the corridor echoes with suppressed knowledge, the passage "breathes easier" after she develops the film, and its dreams shift from lament to invitation by the end. The setting charges the lyric structure and provides the psychometric anchor (walls that dream). However, the passage does not constrain a physical choice—Mira's movements are static (pressing, listening, returning), and no spatial detail (blocked path, unstable floor, hidden alcove) alters her tactics. Setup ✓, development (thematic resonance, not tactical pressure) weak, payoff (closure imagery) ✓. Early signal +0.7, four beats +1.4, closure linkage (final dream message) +1.0, ornamental/postcard use −0.7, no tactical constraint −0.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the climate shifts" is established early ("world that no longer existed," "great migration," frost-vine hybrids) and colors the setting and stakes. The climate collapse contextualizes the suppressed climatology and Mira's mission to restore lost knowledge. However, the timeframe is static backdrop—no on-page moment shows time pressure (decaying diaries, rival cartographers, institutional threat) narrowing Mira's window or forcing a faster choice. She spends "weeks" in the passage without friction. Setup ✓ (first paragraph), development (context, not constraint), payoff (the past/future contrast in closure) partial. Early signal +0.5, told-only context −0.7, no tactical clock −0.8, ornamental −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to discover what walls dream about" is named in the first paragraph ("her obsessive study," "what walls dream about when the last footsteps fade") and recurs: the corridor's dream of warnings, the shift from catastrophe to potential, the final understanding that discovery means inheriting unfinished stories. The desire frames the premise and the ending pivot (from discovery to action). However, the motivation is told rather than tested—no beat shows Mira torn between the walls' dream and a competing need (survival, relationship, institutional pressure), and no visible cost is paid for pursuing it. Setup ✓, development (reflection, not friction), payoff (thematic restatement) ✓. Early signal +0.6, closure linkage +0.8, told-only without friction −0.9, no dramatized cost −0.5.</comment>
