<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eleanor's ghostly motivation is clear and embodied through concrete actions (yanking the cord, conducting wind). Her desire to "macerate the unsaid things" manifests in specific choices with escalating emotional cost. The interiority avoids therapy-speak until "I'm sorry I left you. I tried to hold on"—these phrases lean toward label-speak but are quickly dramatized through the wind's effect on Sarah. The final renunciation (dissolving handle, thinning form) earns its cost through prior causality, though the move from grief-tending to release happens quickly.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through layered attempts (yanking cord → off-key wind → lullabies → macerated silence → Sarah's laugh → brotherly call) until Eleanor's form thins, a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant: her work complete, she releases). Cost is visible: "the proper weight of her own absence" and her dissolution. One meaningful deepening—Sarah's first cracked laugh breaking three months of silence—narrows the emotional stakes and changes the household's trajectory.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The echo chamber tunnel is established early and constrains Eleanor's tactics: amplification ("turning breath into chorus") is the mechanism she needs. The pull cord handle is tactile and evolves (grows hot, dissolves). Spatial choreography tracks cleanly (tunnel below, Sarah above at sink, later in hallway). The autumn setting and leaf-blower callback anchor memory without becoming static postcards. The tunnel's concrete walls and groundwater texture the ghost-world without over-description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore lost laughter—is signaled in paragraph one and drives every beat. Pressure accumulates through escalation: Eleanor eases off to avoid making Sarah "think herself mad," a tactical constraint that shows agency and cost. The wind's volume modulates with purpose, demonstrating protagonist control. Sarah's shattered plate and cracked laugh are the story's hinge, a visible on-page reversal that forecloses the path of sealed grief. The brother's phone call extends consequence, and Eleanor's dissolution pays the final price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from concrete action: "A true haunting does not frighten; it holds. It tends to what we cannot say, macerating silence until something tender can push through." This line risks stating the theme, but it follows earned dramatization (the plate crash, the laugh, the brother's call) and reframes prior beats without moralizing. The pull cord as both literal tool and metaphor for letting go charges the ending. The final image—Sarah smiling at an almost-melody—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how grief loosens.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with Eleanor as focalizer; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: "spectral heart a bruised fruit," "warped as if sung through a damaged throat." Diction occasionally reaches for elevated phrases ("mournfully eager," "macerated the unsaid things") that feel slightly imposed rather than organic to Eleanor's voice, particularly in abstract clusters. The phrase "tending to the unspoken" recurs with thematic weight but borders on explanatory. Dialogue is absent, so naturalism and subtext bullets don't apply. Psychic distance is controlled, and the closing shift to Sarah's perspective is brief and purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance both image and emotional charge. Figurative language clusters in places ("bruised fruit that still wanted to ripen," "macerate the hard silence that had calcified") but stays legible and mostly coherent. One mild template-cadence run in the climax paragraph: "She remembered... Now she conducted... The off-key wind poured..." A paraphrase loop appears late: "macerate the unsaid things" / "macerating silence" / "macerating the last of her grief"—three uses of the verb in close succession risk synonym churn. No major loops or scaffolding; rhythm varies and propulsion holds.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ghost-as-grief-worker premise is familiar but transformed through specificity: the echo chamber tunnel, the leaf-blower ritual, the pull cord as both literal and spectral tool. The phrase "leaf blower symphony conductor" and Eleanor's absurd performance grounded in character make the haunting feel particular rather than generic. Risk-taking is moderate: the lyric voice and the concept of "macerating silence" are bold but stop short of structural experimentation. The ending avoids the explain-everything trap, though the penultimate paragraph does state theme overtly. Emotional truth outweighs surface novelty.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eleanor as "leaf blower symphony conductor" appears in the opening third, shapes her motivation (transforming yard work into performance), and directly informs her ghostly tactic: conducting wind to break silence. The memory of her joke ("conducting the symphony of decay!") triggers Sarah's laugh, a key turn. Her choice to ease the wind to avoid madness demonstrates agency under the character trait. The role is indispensable to both her living identity and her spectral method.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The pull cord handle materializes in Eleanor's palm in the opening, is yanked to conjure wind (first beat), grows hot with effort (second beat), vibrates with Sarah's laugh (third beat), is eased to modulate force (fourth beat), and dissolves at closure when its purpose is served. It appears in at least five distinct beats, each time with evolving function and meaning. Removing it would break the causal chain: no cord, no wind, no Eleanor's agency. The object is irreplaceable and central to closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Tending to the unspoken" is named explicitly in the opening third as Eleanor's ghostly work. It shapes tactics: she uses wind to "macerate the unsaid things" (apologies, grief, connection). The concept drives the middle beats (easing the wind to avoid madness) and is crystallized at closure: "tending to the unspoken finally releasing her." It appears in the final third's thematic summary, slightly reducing irreplaceability, but it alters Eleanor's choices and frames the ending's cost. Swapping for "healing grief" would dilute specificity but not break logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Mournfully eager" is introduced early as Eleanor's emotional state. It colors her motivation but does not visibly constrain a specific on-page choice; she is eager to act and mournful about her absence, but the trait does not force a trade-off or alter tactics in a beat. The half-sung lullabies are described as "mournfully eager tune," linking the attribute to the wind's quality. Without this exact phrasing, Eleanor could still be "sorrowful and determined" with minimal edits. Present across two mentions but functionally replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Macerate" is used three times: once for the silence calcified around Sarah's heart, once for the unsaid things, once for the last of Sarah's grief. The verb shapes the method (breaking down rather than exploding) and distinguishes Eleanor's tactic from typical ghost-force. It appears in the middle third and at closure, charging the final image. Swapping for "erode" or "dissolve" would preserve some meaning but lose the specific textural violence of pulping. The verb is essential to tone and method but not irreplaceable to plot mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Half-sung lullabies carried on off-key wind are seeded early (paragraph one mentions "half-sung lullabies she had hummed to Sarah seventeen years prior"), deployed as Eleanor's tactic in the middle beats (the wind "carried the half-sung lullabies"), and return at closure ("carrying not lullabies now but something rawer") before the final echo ("half-sung and off-key, macerating the last of her grief"). The method is specific, irreplaceable (no generic "ghostly voice" could substitute), and appears in at least four beats. It enables Sarah's recognition and constrains Eleanor's approach (she must modulate volume). Cost is tied to the method: Eleanor's effort heats the cord.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The echo chamber tunnel is introduced in the opening, explicitly chosen because it "amplified every sound, turning breath into chorus and heartbeat into drum, which was precisely what Eleanor needed." It constrains her tactic (she must work from below) and provides the mechanism for her haunting. The tunnel "caught their voices" later, enabling Eleanor to hear Sarah and her brother. At closure, "the echo chamber tunnel would keep her music... for years to come," charging the final image. Removing the tunnel would require a different amplification mechanism; the setting is essential to method and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After the final grain slips through the hourglass" frames the opening as post-death but does not track elapsed time or create a live clock. The three-month grief period is mentioned ("for the first time in three months, she laughed") but not introduced early. Time does not tighten Eleanor's decisions; she works until the task is complete, then dissolves. The timeframe is more metaphorical (eternal autumn, post-death) than tactical. A lyric reprise could lift this, but the hourglass image does not return at closure. Present but does not shape urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Eleanor's motivation—"restore lost laughter to the household above"—is stated clearly in the opening third and dramatized in every beat: yanking the cord, conjuring wind, easing force to avoid madness, weeping at Sarah's call with her brother. The desire faces friction (risk of driving Sarah mad, her own dissolution as cost) and drives the ending: Sarah laughs, Eleanor releases. The motivation is indispensable; without it, no haunting occurs. The phrase "restore lost laughter" is slightly generic but the enacted choices (using the pull cord, modulating wind) are specific.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"True haunting" is introduced early and defined at closure: "A true haunting does not frighten; it holds. It tends to what we cannot say, macerating silence until something tender can push through." Tone is coherent throughout—mournful, tender, purposeful—and modulates with pressure (the off-key wind, the cracked laugh, the rawer benediction at the end). The tone charges the final image (Sarah smiling at an almost-melody). Stating the definition risks didacticism but follows earned dramatization. The tone is indispensable to the story's emotional logic and thematic closure.</comment>
