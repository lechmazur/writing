<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present but operates as a poetic cipher rather than a motivated agent. Her "hauntingly optimistic" stance is asserted repeatedly through abstract language ("ghost-light in the gloom") without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values under pressure. The sleepwalking mechanism and tapestry-weaving actions occur in summary narration; no beat shows her wrestling with competing impulses or paying a visible cost for a decision. Villagers appear as a collective backdrop without applying immediate relational pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the story layers motifs (red canyon, silver thread, orchids, tide pools) seeking a pattern-break or cadence shift to reweight the dominant stake. Orientation anchors appear late—who, where, and when coalesce only after several paragraphs of abstract imagery. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the tapestry becomes a map, villagers see beauty in broken precedents), but cost is asserted rather than dramatized: no on-page sentence shows what Elara forfeits or loses by creating the tapestry. The final paragraphs summarize legend status rather than landing a charged image with felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The red canyon labyrinth is named early and recurs, yet functions as backdrop rather than tactical constraint—Elara's path through it is narrated in summary ("following the silver thread") without spatial choices or obstacles that test her. The orchid alcove appears late and resolves the village's problem without prior setup, reading as coincidence rather than environment shaping outcome. Micro-setting allowance (the loom, the tapestry) is present but not leveraged to constrain a choice at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restore the wharf's lost glory—is declared early but remains abstract. No on-page beat shows Elara sacrificing time, material, or social standing to pursue the tapestry; the sleepwalking and sewing are narrated in summary across unspecified nights. The orchid discovery at the end arrives as a gift rather than a turn earned by protagonist agency under the chosen lens. Villagers' doubt is mentioned but never dramatizes opposition or forces a trade-off. One tightening or deepening is absent; pressure remains flat until the summarized resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme of transformation (ruin to reverence) is signaled early and recurs, but the final image offers a tidy moral ("something new could rise from the ashes") rather than a resonant, non-literal answer. The orchid/silver-thread motifs are introduced separately and layered, yet their convergence at closure reads as ornamental recurrence rather than reweighting prior particulars with cost. Subtext is minimal; all thematic weight is carried by overt poetic assertion. The penultimate paragraphs lean into direct statement ("a path from ruin to reverence woven in silver and stone") that summarizes rather than evokes.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic—Elara's way of noticing defaults to elevated diction ("pale orchid," "ghost-light," "luminous thread") without character-specific selectivity or bias. Psychic distance stays far throughout; no interior contradiction or embodied perception during high-pressure beats. Diction is uniformly poetic, reading as authorial overlay rather than focalizer's idiom. No dialogue appears. Register is consistent but abstract, favoring stock lyricism over concrete sensory anchors.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "haunting optimism" / "ghost-light" / "ghost chasing a fading dream"; "tide pools emptied" appears in five separate sentences. Template cadence runs through multiple paragraphs ("Each evening… Each night… One morning…"). Stock metaphors ("rose like old giants," "moon painted the canyon") and elevated register ("reverence," "solace," "luminous") flatten momentum. Figurative density is high without pattern-teaching or payoff—nearly every sentence carries metaphor or simile, obscuring causal links. The final third summarizes legend status in abstract terms rather than landing a concrete image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>Core premise (sleepwalker weaves map of nocturnal paths to restore village) has potential but is executed through stock motifs: red canyon labyrinth, silver thread, orchids as secret garden, weaver as solitary artist. Emotional arc and plot function unchanged if names/places shift. The orchid discovery and villagers' epiphany arrive without earned friction. No bold structural or perspectival risk; the piece defaults to safe lyricism and tidy resolution. Transformation test fails: the template (artist persists, finds hidden beauty, community is redeemed) is visible beneath surface detail.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elara is named early and present across beats, but her choices are narrated in summary ("she resolved to sew," "she continued") rather than dramatized with tactical consequences. She observes the tapestry pattern and follows it in the final third, yet this action does not create a key turn—the orchid alcove is discovered, not earned by a decision under pressure. One beat of choice-involvement (deciding to sew the pattern) grants functional presence but swappability remains high.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The illustration plate is introduced mid-story as a gift that "could guide any who dared to sew a map." It appears in one beat (Elara holding it) and is not handled, used, or returned with reweighted meaning at closure. The tapestry itself does the guiding work; the plate could be cut without structural loss. Static description without evolving use or causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Broken precedents ("nets cast at dawn, fish thrashing") are named early and frame the village's crisis, shaping the dominant stake. The concept recurs in the penultimate paragraph when villagers "see beauty in the broken precedents." However, on-page tactics are not altered by this rule—Elara's sewing and path-discovery proceed without confronting or adapting to shattered systems. Present in setup and closure echo but does not constrain middle choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Hauntingly optimistic" is asserted three times as a label ("Elara remained hauntingly optimistic," "Elara's haunting optimism") but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. No beat shows optimism forcing a trade-off or altering a tactic under doubt. Villagers' skepticism is mentioned but not dramatized in friction. Label-only use without embodied pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Sewing is signaled early ("resolved to sew the pattern") and recurs across multiple summary beats ("each morning adding a new line of silver thread," "she continued to sew"). The tapestry becomes the map that enables the orchid discovery and village transformation, linking setup to closure. However, the act itself is narrated in summary without on-page struggle or tactical adaptation; it does not create a turn through protagonist agency under pressure. Functional causal role but lacks irreplaceability—"weaving" or "drawing" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Overlapping sleepwalking paths are introduced early and recur across three beats: the nightly tracing, the dusty footprint web, and the tapestry pattern matching canyon grooves. This method enables the final map and orchid discovery, granting causal role in closure. However, mechanics are asserted ("each night she rose… her steps remained") rather than shown with on-page friction or cost. The sleepwalking itself is never dramatized; no beat shows disorientation, danger, or tactical problem. Present in setup and payoff with summary involvement in middle.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The red canyon labyrinth is named in the opening line and recurs in four beats (initial description, Elara's nightly paths, the tapestry matching canyon grooves, the orchid alcove discovery). It provides the spatial frame for closure and the tapestry's verification moment. However, the labyrinth does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics—Elara follows the tapestry without navigating obstacles or making route decisions. Postcard description dominates; the "ancient grooves" matching the tapestry is told rather than tested. Present across structure with closure linkage but lacks tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>"After the tide pools empty" recurs as a refrain in six sentences, framing the story's melancholy atmosphere and the village's economic collapse. Time itself is not tracked as a tightening pressure—no clock constrains Elara's work or forces a decision. The timeframe is durational marker ("each night… by dawn… one morning") without urgency. Present in setup and mood but does not alter tactics or narrow options.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The desire to "carve a path from ruin to reverence" is asserted early ("whispering verses about a hidden path that could restore the wharf's lost glory") and recurs in the penultimate paragraph. It frames the dominant stake and shapes the tapestry project, linking setup to closure. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized in conflicted choices—no beat shows Elara weighing cost (time, doubt, resource) against desire. Friction between want and obstacle is mentioned (villagers' doubt) but not enacted on the page. One causal role (the tapestry pursuit) grants mid-band presence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Orchid solace" is named late (final third) as the hidden alcove and recurs in the closing lines as thematic anchor. Tone throughout is elegiac and hopeful, coherent across beats with no jarring shifts. The orchids charge the final image and reweight the ruin motif, granting payoff. However, the tone does not modulate with pressure—melancholy lyricism remains uniform whether describing crisis or discovery. The final image ("orchid solace that lingered long after") recapitulates rather than transforms. Setup is absent (orchids not seeded early), development minimal, but closure participation is clear.</comment>
