<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation—to translate silence into music—is dramatized through concrete action with the tuning forks. However, her interior life remains largely abstract; phrases like "heat-mapping emotions" and "silently expressive" read as labeled traits rather than embodied contradiction. The change at closure (accepting silence as canvas rather than void) arrives through assertion rather than a visible on-page struggle with cost. The other survivors remain ciphers, applying no interpersonal pressure that forces Mara to choose between competing goods.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation (conservatory, post-capsizing silence, Mara with tuning forks) within the opening third and follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: three tuning-fork strikes deepen the emotional heat-map pattern until the final image reweights silence as "canvas" rather than void. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing variant): the final paragraph reconfigures the premise with undeniable conceptual cost—Mara closes the case, promising "music yet to be born." However, the tightening is more additive than causal; each fork strike layers color without narrowing options or risking failure, and the cost (brother's loss, her own isolation) is established early but not visibly paid or traded at the ending beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory is anchored early with frost, heating-system crackle, and glass panes that serve as resonant surface for the tuning forks. The glass constrains Mara's method (she needs a medium) and charges the final image (frost patterns as canvas). Spatial choreography is minimal but clear. However, sensory detail tilts heavily visual (frost, heat-maps, colors); other senses are sparse, and the conservatory's layout—number of rooms, sight-lines among survivors—remains vague.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rectifying silence by translating it into shared feeling—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Mara's three fork strikes provide a pattern of escalation (low C → hope, A → sorrow, E → anger), but each strike succeeds without complication or trade-off; there is no moment where the method risks failure or forces a choice between competing goods. The ending deepens understanding (silence as canvas) but does not foreclose a live option or extract a visible price at the closure beat. Agency is present but pressure remains additive rather than tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—silence as canvas for shared feeling, beauty persisting as "unshaken marvels"—emerges through concrete action (tuning forks, frost patterns, heat-maps) rather than direct statement. The final image ("every breath was a note, every frost pattern a melody") reweights prior material with resonance, though the line "cathedral of unshaken marvels" edges toward overt summary. The piece avoids moralizing but leans on the prompt phrase "unshaken marvels" as thematic shorthand, recycling it across beats without fully transforming it through earned insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, filtering perception through Mara's musician-survivor lens ("heat-mapping emotions," attention to resonant frequencies). Diction is consistent—slightly elevated, contemplative—though phrases like "a sign that beauty persisted" and "a promise of music yet to be born" drift toward abstractness under pressure. No dialogue appears. The perceptual signature (silence, vibration, color as emotion) is character-specific, but the prose occasionally slips into expository summary ("She realized she could rectify the silence") rather than letting the realization emerge through image.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose carries clarity and purpose, but several patterns recur: "She had," "She believed," "She placed" across adjacent beats create template cadence; "unshaken marvels" appears three times with diminishing freshness; "silently expressive" is used twice as label. The metaphor "heat-mapping emotions" is repeated but never dramatized in micro-detail—we see the results (colors) but not the perceptual act itself. The final paragraph stacks several summary moves ("no longer a void," "a canvas," "a space," "a cathedral") that could condense. Minor filter-verb clusters ("She watched," "She saw") dull immediacy in the middle third. Deductions: template cadence −0.6, label/phrase loops −0.4, summary drag in closure −0.5; total −1.5, routed here per artifact policy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The synthesis—post-apocalyptic silence, synesthesia via heat-maps, tuning forks as emotional palette—offers a fresh angle on survivor narratives. However, the "music from silence" frame and the winterglass-as-sanctuary setup echo familiar templates (artist finds beauty in ruin, grief transmuted to art). The heat-mapping method is inventive but under-exploited; we see color labels rather than the perceptual mechanics or a moment where the method fails. Risk-taking is moderate: the piece commits to its lyric-accumulative design but retreats to summary at closure rather than trusting a final charged image to stand alone.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara (capsize survivor) is present throughout, her survivor status motivates the silence and the brother's tuning-fork case. Her choices—striking each fork, interpreting heat-maps, performing nightly—drive all three major beats and shape the closure (closing the case, accepting silence as canvas). Setup ✓, Development ✓ (fork strikes), Payoff ✓ (closure stance). Causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, beat involvement (three) +1.4, early signal +0.6; base 3.0 + 4.6 = 7.6. Subtract swappability −0.5 (another traumatized artist could fill the role with minor edits) and summary-only interiority −0.3. Final 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tuning fork case appears in six beats: opening ("small leather case"), middle exposition (three forks, resonant frequencies), the three fork strikes, and closure (case closed, "promise of music yet to be born"). It supplies the key tool and its mechanics matter (requires resonant surface). Setup ✓, Development ✓ (fork strikes enable the emotional translation), Payoff ✓ (closing the case crystallizes acceptance). Early signal +0.7, beat involvement (three functional) +0.9, causal pressure (enables method) +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, specificity (three-fork tuning set) +0.5; base 3.0 + 4.3 = 7.3. Subtract ornamental description ("leather," "small") without functional payoff −0.2. Final 7.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Unshaken marvels" is named three times but functions primarily as thematic label rather than constraint. It describes the frost pattern, the realization that beauty persists, and the conservatory's final state, but does not narrow options or create friction. The phrase appears in closure but as summary rather than causal driver. Setup ✓ (frost as marvel, first third), Development weak (no middle choice hinges on recognizing a marvel), Payoff ✓ (label in final image). Two-gate cap 6.0. Lyric reprise +0.3. Subtract ornamental use −0.8 (could remove phrase without altering action) and label-only trait −0.5. Final 4.2; capped by missing middle development at 3.4, but lyric reprise lifts slightly within allowance. Actual cap 4.6 (two-gate); final after deductions 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Silently expressive" is used twice as descriptor (Mara's gestures, her performances) but never constrains a choice or incurs a visible cost. The trait is consistent with the post-noise world but remains label-only; we do not see a moment where silence forces a communicative trade-off or misunderstanding. Setup ✓ (labeled early), Development absent (no middle choice turns on silent expression), Payoff minimal (mentioned in closure paragraph but not causal). Two-gate cap 6.0. Subtract label-only −0.5, ornamental use −0.8, swappability −0.5 (any silent gesture would serve). Final 3.8; allowed by cap 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Rectify" is named explicitly ("to rectify the silence") and rephrased at closure ("Mara realized she could rectify the silence, not by forcing sound…"). The action—adjusting approach from forcing sound to giving silence form—drives the conceptual shift that enables closure. Setup ✓ (stated as need in first third), Development ✓ (fork strikes are attempts to rectify), Payoff ✓ (closure realization hinges on redefining rectify). Early signal +0.6, beat involvement (two: initial framing, closure reframe) +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.5. Base 3.0 + 4.0 = 7.0. Subtract swappability −0.4 (could substitute "heal" or "answer" with minor edits) and summary-only payoff −0.3. Final 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Heat-mapping emotions" is introduced early (Mara reads anger/red, sorrow/blue, hope/gold), appears in the three fork-strike beats (colors shift on heat-map), and is referenced at closure ("translated silence into music… with heat-mapped emotions"). The method is essential to Mara's approach and shapes all three strikes. Setup ✓, Development ✓ (each strike uses the method), Payoff ✓ (closure claims success). Early signal +0.7, beat involvement (three) +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.6. Base 3.0 + 4.7 = 7.7. Subtract ornamental mechanics −0.8 (we see color labels but never the perceptual act; removing "heat-map" and using "emotion" would not break the plot) and summary-only use in closure −0.5. Final 6.9, but swappability (synesthesia/aura-reading would work identically) −0.5 additional. Final 6.4; round 6.3 under accumulation, but label-only presentation limits to 5.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory is established early (frost, heating, glass panes) and supplies the resonant surface Mara needs; without the glass, the tuning forks cannot "sing." It recurs in all three fork beats and in the closure image ("winterglass conservatory became a cathedral"). Setup ✓, Development ✓ (glass enables method), Payoff ✓ (cathedral image). Early signal +0.7, beat involvement (three functional) +1.4, causal pressure +1.2 (constrains method choice), closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.6 (frost-etched glass is irreplaceable). Base 3.0 + 5.3 = 8.3. Subtract vague layout −0.5 (no sight-lines, room count) and postcard description in opening −0.3. Final 7.5; round to 7.3 under moderate spatial debt.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"After noise becomes impossible" frames the premise and is referenced at opening ("silence had spread") and in Mara's reflection ("a silent world"), but it does not tighten decisions beat-to-beat. Time is untracked; we know only "one evening" for the fork experiment, with no clock pressure or deadline. The timeframe establishes stakes (why silence matters) but does not escalate them. Setup ✓ (opening), Development absent (no middle urgency tied to time), Payoff weak (closure acknowledges silence but without temporal cost). Two-gate cap 6.0. Lyric reprise +0.3. Subtract vague tracking −0.5 and no tactical pressure −0.8. Final 4.1; capped at 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"To translate silence into music" is stated explicitly ("translate silence into shared feeling," "translate silence into music") and drives Mara's fork experiments and closure realization. The motivation is consistent and shapes all major beats. Setup ✓, Development ✓ (fork strikes pursue the goal), Payoff ✓ (closure claims success and redefines translation). Early signal +0.7, beat involvement (three) +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.5. Base 3.0 + 4.6 = 7.6. Subtract told-only desire −0.5 (we hear the goal stated but see little internal friction or competing want) and no visible trade-off −0.5 (Mara never chooses between silence-as-void and another compelling pull). Final 6.6.</comment>
