<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The guardian reads as a static archetype rather than a motivated individual; he performs symbolic gestures but no internal contradiction or micro-choice reveals what he personally risks or wants beyond the stated mission. The child's fear is told through "silent empathy" rather than dramatized through behavior, and the smile at line 31 arrives without earned progression. Interiority relies heavily on poetic abstraction ("spiralingly calm presence," "weave light") that functions as atmospheric label rather than embodied thought under pressure. The final choice to pass the mirror feels inevitable from setup rather than forged through on-page struggle with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers imagery (starlight, shutters, mirrors, water) without causal because/therefore linkage. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration through the child's smile and the guardian's continued vigil, but cost remains abstract—no legible forfeiture or foreclosed path appears on the page. Orientation anchors who/where/when by line 5, satisfying the test. The piece teaches its lyric pattern early, yet the final third recycles motifs (dock, stars, water, mirror) without a decisive reweighting that makes a before/after legible with felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The cobalt dock, rain-slicked planks, and boathouse shutters provide tactile grounding and appear across multiple beats. The dental mirror functions as micro-setting, recurring in the guardian's hand and the child's palm to charge the final image. Sensory detail is vivid ("iron and old rope," "bruised sky") but leans visual; the canal's stillness and the dock's weathered planks modulate with the guardian's ritual, though spatial choreography of the child's approach and the guardian's position at the shutters remains slightly vague.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—teaching the child to find hope through stars—is signaled early and sustained. However, escalation is atmospheric rather than causal: the guardian adjusts shutters and reflects starlight in repeated gestures without a pivot that narrows options or raises cost. The child's question at line 28 ("Why do the stars hide during the day?") offers a potential turn, but the guardian's silent answer and subsequent shutter move feel like another iteration rather than a tightening that forecloses an earlier path. The smile and the promise are declared outcomes without on-page struggle or visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme (stars as metaphor for hope, darkness as fear) emerges from images and the guardian's ritual rather than direct statement. Yet the piece edges toward moralizing: "He taught darkness that stars are not to be feared but to be held gently" (line 27) and the final paragraphs reiterate the lesson in summarizing loops. The half-spoken secret recurs as a motif but never acquires distinct meaning tied to a choice. The closing lines ("For those who listen with silent empathy, the stars will always share their story") verge on thematic echo, asserting wisdom rather than letting the final image reweight prior material with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV with poetic diction holds a consistent register ("spiralingly calm," "weave light"), but the narrative voice feels more like external narration than the guardian's or child's perceptual signature. Psychic distance remains stable, yet the piece offers no interior access to the guardian's wants or contradictions, and the child's interiority is summarized ("unspoken fears," "quiet awe"). The single line of dialogue (line 28) carries naturalism, but surrounded by lyric abstraction it cannot distinguish voice. Sentence rhythm varies, but many stems repeat ("The child…," "The guardian…," "The dental mirror…") without cumulative charge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade the final third: lines 32–56 recycle "stars," "dock," "water," "guardian," "mirror," "darkness" in synonym chains and template cadence without new information. Line 38 ("a silent sentinel, teaching darkness to cherish the stars") restates line 27's lesson; lines 43–50 echo earlier shutter and mirror beats. Filter-verb stacks ("seemed to," "would") and abstract constructions ("spiralingly calm presence," "stillwater tension") dull immediacy in high-pressure moments. Stock metaphors ("bruised sky," "invisible thread") and the formulaic final summary ("And so the dock remained…") flatten propulsion. Artifacts touch the closure beat, triggering high-band disqualification and a −1.4 aggregate deduction in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The core premise—silent mentor guides child through symbolic light ritual—closely matches mentor-arc templates without a fresh inflection. The dental mirror as tool is specific but underexplored; "weave light" and "spiralingly calm" remain atmospheric labels rather than irreplaceable mechanics. The guardian's motiveless vigil and the child's generic unspoken fear offer no lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The piece commits to its lyric frame yet retreats into explanatory loops in the final third, hedging emotional risk. Transformation test: swap "canal guardian" for "lighthouse keeper" and "dental mirror" for "lantern glass" and the arc holds unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The silent canal guardian appears throughout but makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or narrows options. His actions—adjusting shutters, lifting the mirror, maintaining vigil—are ritual gestures without conflict or trade-off. Setup present (line 5), middle beats involve him (lines 13–30), closure mentions him (lines 37–56), yet he remains an archetype whose choices do not create turns. Swappable with "hermit," "sage," or "watcher" with minor edits. Late summary ("The guardian's work was done") tells rather than dramatizes agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dental mirror appears in three beats: resting in the guardian's pocket (line 6), lifted to scatter starlight (line 15), passed to the child (line 24), held as token (line 37), and invoked in final summary (lines 50–51). Setup early, middle use enables the light ritual, closure presence as promise-object. Yet its unique properties (dental mirror vs. any reflective surface) remain unexplored; the object is functionally interchangeable with "small hand mirror" or "shard of glass." Cost tied to the mirror is absent—no choice hinges on its specific mechanics. Cap at 5.8 for two-gate + closure mention without irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Silent empathy is named (lines 7, 18, 38, 53) and described as sensing "the pulse of the water" and "the weight of unspoken fears," but it functions as thematic claim rather than on-page constraint. The guardian never chooses between empathy and another tactic; the child's approach is drawn by "the gentle pulse of shimmering water" (line 20) not by a demonstrated empathic act with visible cost. Setup present (line 7), middle mentions (lines 18–19), closure invoked (lines 38, 53), yet the concept remains ornamental: swappable with "intuition" or "presence" without structural impact. No friction, no trade-off, no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Spiralingly calm" appears as descriptor (lines 8, 19, 34) but never constrains or enables an action. The label is poetic atmosphere; no beat shows what the guardian must sacrifice to maintain it or how it alters his tactics under pressure. Setup present (line 8), middle reprise (line 19), closure echo (line 34), yet it remains static adjectival claim. Ornamental use, no causal work, swappable with "deeply tranquil" or "steadily composed." Cap at 2.9 for three mentions without integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Weave" (or "weaving") appears in eight lines (9, 13, 21, 30, 38, 45) tied to light, shutters, patterns, and empathy. Setup by line 9, middle beats involve adjusting shutters to create patterns (lines 13–30), closure summary invokes "weaving light" (lines 45–47). Yet the action is abstract: the mechanics of weaving are not shown, and the patterns are described as visual effects without causal consequence. The child's approach and smile are outcomes, not results of a specific weaving choice that narrows options. Functional but replaceable with "cast," "shape," or "arrange" without structural loss. Closure participation via summary mention, not dramatized agency.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Creating patterns with shutters is signaled at line 13, executed in lines 21–22, 30, and summarized in lines 39–40. Setup by first third, middle use (the guardian "began to weave light, moving the shutters with deliberate grace"), closure echo. Yet the method's mechanics remain vague: how the shutters produce constellations on the planks is not shown, and no choice hinges on their specific operation versus another light source. The method shapes the ritual but is swappable with "lantern filters" or "mirror angles" with minor edits. Two beats plus closure mention place it near 4.3, held back by ornamental execution and lack of irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The cobalt dock after rain is established in lines 1–3, referenced across beats (lines 4, 17, 22, 33, 43, 56), and charged in the final image ("the cobalt dock, washed by rain, held the memory"). Setup early, middle presence (the planks as canvas for light patterns), closure participation as anchor for the promise. The rain-slicked planks enable the reflecting surfaces that carry the ritual. Yet the dock is functionally a stage; swap "jetty" or "pier" and the logic holds. The setting supplies atmosphere and a reflective surface but does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome. Lyric reprise reweights somewhat but falls short of causal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Within the edge of a half-spoken secret" appears as repeated phrase (lines 10, 32, 43, 54) but does not function as a time constraint. No clock tightens decisions; the ritual unfolds in unmetered twilight without urgency. The phrase is atmospheric metaphor, not a dramatized deadline. Setup by line 10, closure echo (line 54), yet it remains ornamental: swappable with "at dusk" or "in the quiet hour" without affecting tactics. Static mood marker, no escalation, no pressure tied to elapsed time.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"To teach darkness the value of stars" is stated at line 9 and repeated or paraphrased in lines 27, 33, 45, 47, 53, 56. The motivation frames the guardian's ritual but is never dramatized as conflicted choice. No beat shows him weighing this desire against a competing want or cost. Setup early, middle beats enact the teaching (shutters, mirror), closure summary restates it. Yet the desire is told, not tested: no friction between the teaching and another stake, no visible price for continuing the vigil. Functional presence across structure but ornamental execution; swappable with "to offer hope" or "to guide lost children" with minor edits. Closure participation via thematic summary, not causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Stillwater tension" is named at line 11, echoed in line 41 ("stillwater tension eased"), and supported by descriptions of the calm surface and suspended moments. Setup early, modulates once at line 41 when awe replaces tension, closure invokes the still water (lines 47, 55). Tone is coherent and atmospheric, lending weight to the quiet ritual. Yet the shift from tension to awe is told rather than charged through a reversal; the final image restates calm without deepening pressure. The tone supports theme but does not escalate with stakes or constrain a choice. Two-gate presence (setup, mid-shift, closure echo) with purposeful modulation places it at 5.3, held back by lack of causal charge in the ending.</comment>
