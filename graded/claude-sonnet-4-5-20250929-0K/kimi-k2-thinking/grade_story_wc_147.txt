<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Dr. Lira Chen's choice to pour the vial and override survival instinct is motivated and embodied ("fingers flew, not to seal the breach, but to program"), but her arc leans heavily on told interiority and mystical compulsion rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The helmet crack forces the final trade-off, yet the decision feels preordained by the ritual rather than earned through internal conflict. Embodiment is present but undermined by occasional therapy-speak ("instinct screamed," "betrayal of every survival protocol") that labels rather than shows pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation (underwater temple, dying oxygen, distress signal) within the opening beat and tracks a clear causal spine: vial → temple unsnarls → core revealed → helmet cracks → transmission sent. Closure lands as Decisive Change with visible cost (death for data). The drive lens reads Causal with Accumulative texture; the "gathered hush" accumulates meaning across beats and the final transmission crystallizes sacrifice. Minor causality slip: the helmet crack arrives conveniently at peak moment, and the vial's mechanics ("dissolved the knot") gesture toward magic without fully grounding the transformation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The underwater temple's "pulsating wall," "central conduit," and "corridors [that] realigned with geometric clarity" provide vivid spatial anchors that constrain Lira's path and charge the final choice. The quantum core as "fragile star trapped in a cage of frozen time" integrates setting with stakes. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("cold and absolute"). The temple's architecture functions as micro-setting that enables the unsnarling and thus reaches the 9+ gate, but some descriptions ("snarled in dimensions that defied mapping") lean abstract without concrete spatial consequence mid-scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (harness the ephemeral energy source before oxygen runs out) is signaled early and pressure escalates through the ticking clock and the vial's use. The helmet crack provides a meaningful tightening that forces the final trade-off: seal the breach or transmit the data. Agency is clear in Lira's override of survival instinct. The reversal (temple unsnarls → core accessible → helmet fails) narrows options and the cost is legible on the page (death). One slip: the vial resolves a spatial puzzle it barely helped create; its mechanics arrive as solution more than accumulated pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the recurring "gathered hush" and the paradox that "some ephemera could only be captured by becoming stillness itself." The final image reweights the premise: Lira's sacrifice transforms her into the silence she sought, and the crystal vial becomes "a vessel for the gathered hush" rather than mere relic. Subtext operates in the captain's incomprehension ("hearing not words but a silence") and the story resists moralizing. Minor slip: "Tell them it was beautiful" edges toward thematic declaration, and the penultimate paragraph's summary ("some knots can only be unsnarled by surrendering") leans abstract rather than letting the image do the work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Lira throughout. Perceptual signature is consistent (scientific framing, urgency-driven selection). The prose modulates from clinical urgency ("oxygen gauge trembled at red") to lyric intensity ("salt and starlight") as pressure peaks. Two frictions lower the score: occasional filter-verb stacks ("Her fingers found," "Instinct screamed") dull immediacy in high-pressure beats, and late-story intrusions into the captain's interiority without section break create brief POV leakage that weakens distance control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in early beats, but the final third suffers from paraphrase loops and scaffold: "The gathered hush had returned to its birthplace, but a fragment remained" is immediately echoed by "the vial...sat in his quarters, its crystal surface cool with the weight of all it had witnessed." Template cadence appears in cumulative "a [noun] for [noun]" constructions across adjacent lines. Mixed metaphor: "silence that tasted like salt and starlight" blurs sensory logic. Line-level debt in the closure zone disqualifies 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact rule.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise (scientist sacrifices herself to capture ephemeral energy via mystical silence) synthesizes ritual and hard-SF tropes, but the core beats follow a familiar scientist-martyr template without transforming it through specific lived detail. The "gathered hush" concept offers freshness, yet its mechanics remain abstract ("dissolved the knot, unsnarling space itself") and the ending leans on thematic summary rather than a surprising turn. The captain's coda and vial recurrence add lyric resonance but do not alter the arc's predictability. No major proximity issues or clichés; the piece commits to its premise but plays it safely within genre expectations.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dr. Lira Chen is on the page across all beats, makes the key choice to pour the vial (first-third), unsnarls the temple (middle), and transmits data instead of sealing her helmet (closure). Her decisions create the turns and her sacrifice anchors the ending. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The crystal perfume vial is introduced early ("relic she'd dismissed"), used to unsnarl the temple (middle beat: "poured the crystal vial's contents"), and returns with reweighted meaning in the captain's coda ("no longer merely a relic—it was a vessel"). Three beats, causal work, closure linkage, and cost (Lira's life). Very strong integration; removal would collapse the mechanism and the thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Gathered hush" is seeded early ("silence so dense it transcended sound"), drives the vial's mechanics ("the hushed liquid dissolved the knot"), enables the quantum core observation, and returns as the final thematic frame ("became stillness itself"). Shapes stakes and tactics across beats; closure participation clear. Strong integration, though the concept's mechanics remain somewhat abstract.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Touches memories" appears early ("pressure that touched memories not her own"), recurs when the hush fills Lira's lungs ("a thousand funerals, a thousand births"), and echoes in the captain's experience ("touched memories across the expedition"). Two beats with thematic resonance. The trait enables vision and charges the ending but does not visibly constrain a choice with hard cost; it accumulates meaning more than it narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Unsnarl" is seeded early ("the temple's architecture was a knotted puzzle"), executed at the mid-turn ("poured the crystal vial...unsnarling space itself. Corridors realigned"), and the act grants access to the quantum core, driving the climax. Causal pressure, irreplaceable, closure-shaping. Removing "unsnarl" would require rewriting the temple's logic and Lira's key action.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"By overriding instinct" is signaled early ("Instinct screamed for her to swim upward"), dramatized in the middle choice ("forced herself deeper"), and executed at closure ("Instinct demanded preservation; the mission demanded sacrifice. She overrode the first"). The method shapes tactics and the final beat. Strong causal work; the override is the hinge of the sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The "forgotten underwater temple" is present from the opening ("pressed her palm against the temple's pulsating wall"), its unsnarled architecture enables the quantum core's discovery, and it becomes the final resting place that "kept its secret." The setting pressures choices (oxygen depletion, spatial puzzle) and charges the ending image. Solid integration; the temple is more than backdrop.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"As time runs short" is tracked early ("oxygen gauge trembled at red," "ninety seconds of rescue window"), referenced mid-scene ("this dwindling moment"), and implied at closure when the helmet cracks. The clock tightens decisions but is not continuously pressuring tactics beat by beat; once Lira descends, urgency becomes atmospheric rather than a live counter that alters moves. Two gates met, causal role in one beat, but underdeveloped as tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"To harness the ephemeral" is stated early ("an energy source that flickered between quantum states"), drives the descent and vial use, and the climax dramatizes the capture ("Core harnessed. Ephemeral contained"). The motivation fuels all three acts and is tested by the helmet-breach choice. Solid causal pressure and closure link; the desire is clear and conflicted with survival.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" as tone is coherent: the opening's isolation ("her ninety seconds of rescue window collapsing"), the lyric ritual visions, and the ending's elegiac register ("lonesome splendor, a hymn for the woman who became its voice") maintain a consistent mood of solitary grandeur. The tone modulates with pressure (clinical urgency → mystical awe → quiet memorial) and charges the final image. Strong coherence; the phrase "lonesome splendor" appears twice, anchoring the emotional texture.</comment>
