<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to solve the embezzlement is clear and her action (gathering evidence, confronting the manager) drives the resolution. However, interiority remains largely surface-level—"heart beat," "quiet freedom," "renewed sense of purpose"—without embodied contradiction or struggle. The stagehand's tears-and-confession feels unearned; we never see Elara wrestle with doubt or cost during her investigation. The final paragraphs drift into abstract satisfaction ("trust had become the unspoken language") rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive promptly. The causal chain—lens reveals doodles, doodles map to timestamps, Elara presents evidence, confession follows—is legible but mechanical: each step functions as simple sequencing without meaningful tightening of options. Closure reads as Decisive Change (embezzlement resolved, trust restored) but the cost is asserted rather than shown; Elara suffers no visible sacrifice or foreclosed relationship. The projector's "hidden beam" that "flickered across the wall" in an empty lobby strains credulity (why would a static lens and tickets generate a moving image without a light source?), introducing a minor causality slip that doesn't break the ending but weakens trust in the mechanism.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt is vividly rendered—"sheen that caught the light," "whispers of the crystals," droplets as prisms—and returns at closure to signal harmony restored. Spatial choreography is clean (forecourt, stage door, lobby, manager's office, back to forecourt). The lens as a recurring object constrains one choice (Elara uses it to reveal hidden doodles) and charges the final image as "a symbol of clarity." However, the setting does not materially narrow Elara's tactical options; it functions more as atmospheric backdrop than active pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—exposing theft to thaw team mistrust—is signaled early and pursued consistently. One meaningful turn occurs when Elara discovers the doodles map to timestamps, narrowing her investigation. Yet escalation is thin: she faces no obstacle after that discovery, and the manager's acceptance plus the stagehand's confession arrive without resistance. The "silent war" among staff is told rather than dramatized, so the resolution's emotional weight feels asserted. Cost is declared ("quiet freedom," "weight lifted") but not enacted—Elara risks nothing and forfeits nothing visible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The theme of transparency-versus-mistrust emerges organically from the plot and is embodied in the lens's etching ("see beyond the surface"). The final image—lens on her desk, crystals singing harmony—offers a resonant visual answer without overt moralizing. However, the last four paragraphs over-articulate theme: "transparency could free," "trust had become the unspoken language," "transparency is the key to freeing oneself from doubt." These restatements flatten what the lens and forecourt already conveyed, pushing the piece toward thesis rather than implication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable throughout; no head-hopping. Elara's perceptual signature leans toward the professional (she notices timestamps, ticket stubs, "meticulously kept" records) and her interior voice remains consistent. Diction is serviceable but generic in emotional beats: "heart beat," "quiet freedom," "gentle smile." The manager and stagehand appear only in brief confession moments with no distinct speech patterns. Psychic distance stays controlled, and the prose avoids filter-verb stacks, but the voice lacks a character-particular texture that would elevate it into the high band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythms vary and prose is grammatically clean with no major loops. However, numerous lines restate content without adding pressure: "She realized these marks were a silent map" immediately followed by "The numbers matched the timestamps…a record she had meticulously kept"; "The truth, once spoken, lifted a weight" then "Elara felt a quiet freedom, as if the honesty had opened a door." The final five paragraphs cycle through synonyms for transparency and trust—"resonant hush," "words…unnecessary," "unspoken language"—creating a thematic echo chamber that dulls momentum. Information density is moderate; many beats do two jobs (advancing plot and reiterating theme), but closure beats repeat rather than deepen.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The projector-lens-as-detective-tool offers a fresh concrete angle, and the cryptic-doodles mechanism is specific. Yet the core mystery structure—honest observer uncovers embezzlement, confronts authority, villain confesses—is familiar and executed without transformation. The "ambiguously clear" doodles are described but never shown in sufficient detail to feel particular; Elara's trained eye interprets them instantly. The emotional arc (lonely diligence → vindication → renewed purpose) follows a template path. The piece is competent and coherent but does not take the risks or offer the synthesis that would mark it as original.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elara ("quiet night registrar") is present throughout and makes two key decisions: to investigate the doodles (mid-story) and to present evidence to the manager (climax). Both choices advance plot and alter team dynamics. However, her role as registrar is mentioned but never leveraged—her specific occupational skills (ticket tracking) enable discovery, but "registrar" itself could be swapped for "assistant" or "clerk" with minimal edits. She observes more than she struggles, and her final paragraphs are reflection rather than decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lens appears in three distinct beats: discovery near the stage door, revelation of hidden doodles on the ticket stub, and symbolic placement on her desk at closure. Its etching ("see beyond the surface") seeds theme early and is paid off when Elara uses it to uncover truth. The mechanics—holding it over tickets to reveal invisible marks—drive the investigation and enable the climax. Removing the lens would require a wholesale rewrite of discovery and evidence. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff, with charged reprise.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Freed by honesty" shapes Elara's motivation (to thaw mistrust via transparency) and is tested on-page when she gathers evidence and confronts the manager. The concept anchors the dominant stake and informs her tactical choices. However, it is also restated thematically in the final paragraphs ("transparency could free," "honesty had opened a door"), reducing its dramatized pressure. The concept enables rather than constrains—no visible cost attaches to honesty itself, only to the prior theft.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Ambiguously clear" is applied twice: the doodles are described as such, and the evidence Elara places on the desk is called "ambiguously clear." The phrase itself is abstract and does not constrain action—Elara interprets the doodles instantly without struggle. The trait does not create friction or cost; it functions as a descriptive label rather than a lived attribute that forces trade-offs. Swappable with "cryptic yet legible" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Eavesdrop" is mentioned once in a summary line: "decided to follow the doodles' clues and eavesdrop on the conversation they implied." The actual on-page action is Elara using the lens in an empty lobby to reveal projector images—no conversation is overheard. The word appears to be a mislabel or metaphor; the mechanic it names is absent, and removing it would not alter plot structure. Pure ornamental presence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The method (cryptic doodles on concert tickets) is introduced at the first major turn when Elara holds the lens over a discarded stub. The doodles provide the map (spirals, arrows, timestamps) that drives her investigation and supplies the evidence presented at climax. Mechanics are signaled: invisible marks revealed by the lens. However, the projector's "hidden beam" that creates "a series of drawings…on the wall" reads as a second, unexplained mechanism that muddles the method slightly. Still, the doodles are essential to two beats and closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt brackets the story (opening rain-washed scene, closing sunrise prisms) and its "resonant hush" establishes tone. It provides atmospheric grounding and a visual motif (crystals' whispers shift from secrets to harmony). However, it does not constrain Elara's choices—she could solve the mystery in any venue. The setting functions as lyric reprise rather than tactical pressure. Present in setup and payoff with thematic coloring, but swappable for another liminal space.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>"After words become unnecessary" appears once in a late reflective line and again in the penultimate paragraph as the team's new state. It is not a time constraint that tightens decisions; rather, it describes an achieved condition after the climax. No clock or deadline pressures Elara's investigation. The timeframe is retrospective theme rather than forward stake, making it ornamental to plot mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elara's desire "to thaw mistrust with transparency" is stated early ("Determined to thaw mistrust with transparency") and drives her decision to gather evidence and confront the manager. The motivation is tested on-page in two beats: investigation and confrontation. However, it is told more than shown—we do not see Elara wrestle with doubt, fear of retaliation, or cost to relationships. The want does not conflict with another need or fear, reducing dramatic friction. Still, it shapes plot and aligns with action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Resonant hush" recurs throughout: crystals' whispers, the air after rain, the forecourt at dawn. The phrase establishes a consistent auditory-atmospheric texture and modulates slightly (secrets → harmony) to reflect resolution. Tone remains quiet and contemplative even during investigation beats, which fits the registrar's character but flattens tension. The tone charges the final image (crystals holding their breath, words unnecessary) and supports theme, but does not escalate under pressure—emotional peaks are muted rather than sharp.</comment>
