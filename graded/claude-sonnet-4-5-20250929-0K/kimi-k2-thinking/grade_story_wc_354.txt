<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation ("to discover beauty in the difficult thing") is stated rather than embodied in contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. His final choice to release the stone and walk away reads more as symbolic gesture than as a decision arising from earned internal conflict with visible cost. Interiority leans heavily on metaphor ("exile-trained thumb," "metaphysical vertigo") without grounding emotion in concrete bodily experience. The backstory with Mira provides context but flattens present-tense agency; Kael's climactic move feels predetermined rather than wrestled from competing wants.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode with lyric patterning (magnetic pulses correlate to memory, chess imagery recurs). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kael releases the stone, transforming the covenant into "something more difficult, and therefore more beautiful." Cost is conceptual—he walks away, erasing his footprints—but the final image reweights prior material. The Orientation Test is satisfied early (twilight nexus, Kael arriving). However, the middle third loops memory and metaphor without a distinct tightening; the decision to release the stone arrives without a prior reversal or deepening that narrows options on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus is vividly rendered ("lodestone gravel where compasses spun wild," "humming ground") and micro-setting (the basalt stone's dent) charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear: Kael sits, correlates pulses, releases the stone into gravel. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("purple twilight," "silver dust"). The nexus constrains Kael's ritual and supplies the resonance he translates, meeting the 9+ gate criterion of environment shaping choice and closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding silence to resolve the eclipsed covenant—is signaled early. Pressure is more textural than causal: magnetic pulses mirror memory, but no on-page obstacle forces Kael to adapt tactics. The stone release is Kael's unilateral decision; no reversal or external complication tests his commitment beforehand. Cost is legible in the final image (he walks away, erasing presence) but lacks a prior trade-off or narrowed option that would demonstrate escalation under Accumulative lens standards.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: sacrifice, absence as communication, difficult beauty. The stone's dent and the nexus's hum serve as charged motifs. The ending offers a non-literal answer—transformation via absence—without moralizing. However, "the difficult beauty was this: that sacrifice could be reversed" edges toward thematic statement rather than pure dramatization. Subtext operates in silence and gesture, especially the stone's final position as "a black bishop taking its square."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited. Voice carries a distinct lyric register ("twilight purpled the sky," "hopeful melancholy of a drawn position") with chess-saturated diction that reflects Kael's expertise. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. However, elevated metaphor density in peak beats ("ghost gambits," "magnetic twilight") occasionally obscures immediacy, and some interiority reads as writerly exposition ("translating silence had become his only method") rather than embodied perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor voice and closure. Information density is high in many beats. However, paraphrase loops appear: "the eclipsed covenant replayed" and "Both promises had shattered" restate the same betrayal; "translating silence" is asserted multiple times without evolving tactics. Template cadence emerges in the middle third: "Each magnetic flutter became…each silence between pulses…" Figurative language is dense throughout without always advancing scene pressure, triggering the overwriting check (−0.5 in Q7 for density and some mixed metaphors like "metaphysical vertigo").</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of chess tutor, magnetic nexus, and silence-as-language is specific and non-obvious. Chess imagery (bishop, knight's L, stalemate) is tightly integrated rather than ornamental. However, the "exiled mentor redeems via symbolic gesture" arc is recognizable; transformation comes through lyric specificity rather than structural surprise. The nexus and stone ground the premise in vivid particulars. Risk-taking is moderate: the lyric mode and accumulative structure are purposeful but do not radically heighten stakes beyond the template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Kael is present throughout and his final choice (releasing the stone, walking away) drives the ending. However, most beats involve reflection and correlation rather than on-page decisions that alter tactics. His agency is more interpretive than kinetic; the tribunal, Mira's sacrifice, and the covenant are backstory rather than live pressure he navigates. Swappable with another reflective protagonist archetype with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The stone appears in multiple beats: pocket (opening), thumb-dent anchor (mid), release into gravel (closure). Its dent is specific and recurs with reweighted meaning ("perfect dark moon"). The stone's warmth and weight ground Kael's ritual. Closure linkage is strong: "a black bishop taking its square" charges the final image. Causal pressure is moderate—it anchors rather than enables a choice—but it meets three gates and irreplaceability is high.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "eclipsed covenant" frames stakes early and returns at closure ("not ended—merely transformed"). It constrains Kael's motivation and the piece's central question. However, its mechanics are abstract: the covenant is a past promise replayed in memory rather than a live on-page obstacle. Middle development is thematic rather than tactical. Closure participation is strong but ornamental; swappable with "broken vow" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Thoughtfully precise" is asserted ("a man of thoughtfully precise movements") and illustrated in the stone release ("his thoughtfully precise choice"). However, the trait does not constrain a choice with visible cost; it describes Kael's general manner rather than enabling or foreclosing a tactic under pressure. No on-page moment where haste would succeed but precision costs him, or vice versa. Label-only use trends low.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Correlate" is signaled early ("learned to correlate patterns") and drives the middle ritual: Kael correlates magnetic pulses to Mira's breathing, pawn advances, knight paths. The method structures his engagement with the nexus. Closure linkage is indirect—he releases the stone as the culmination of correlation—but the action itself shapes two beats. Swappable with "interpret" or "translate" with minor edits; specificity is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Translating silence" is introduced early ("he must decode the silence") and asserted as Kael's method ("translating silence had become his only method"). It reappears at closure: "Mira would understand the language of absence." However, the mechanics are abstract; no on-page demonstration of how silence is parsed into meaning. Middle use is summary rather than dramatized action. Lyric reprise reweights the stake but causal pressure is low.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The magnetic nexus is introduced in the opening line and anchors every beat: lodestone gravel, humming ground, compass distortion, shifting fields. It supplies the pulses Kael correlates and erases his footprints at closure. Spatial detail is vivid and the nexus's properties (magnetic, twilight timing) constrain Kael's ritual. Environment actively shapes the final image and tactics. Strong across all three gates with high irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Before the next phase" appears twice: "before the next phase of the moon turned blood-red" and "before the next phase peaked." The eclipse timing frames urgency but is not tracked on the page; no moment where the clock tightens Kael's decision. He completes his ritual and walks away "before the eclipse completed," but the timeframe does not force a trade-off or alter tactics. Functional but replaceable with "by nightfall."</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"To discover beauty in the difficult thing" is stated mid-story and echoed at closure ("something more difficult, and therefore more beautiful"). The motivation shapes Kael's thematic stance but is not dramatized in conflicted choices with visible cost. No on-page moment where pursuing beauty costs him an easier path. The desire is asserted rather than tested under pressure. Closure reprise reweights but friction between want and cost is absent.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Hopeful melancholy" is named once and embodied throughout: twilight purpling, "quiet agony of stalemates," "the twilight held its breath." Tone modulates with the ritual's cadence and charges the final image ("the pattern would remain, written in absence"). Coherent across beats without static flatness. The duality (hope within sorrow) reflects the covenant's transformation. Strong closure linkage and purposeful modulation under pressure.</comment>
