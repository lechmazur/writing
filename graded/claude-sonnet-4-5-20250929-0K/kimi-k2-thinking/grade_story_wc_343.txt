<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara shows clear motivation (cartographer ambition) driving on-page choices—deciphering coordinates, persuading Kess, noting the bearing. Her interior life appears through "diligently curious" and "sociable isolation," but these remain more label than embodied contradiction. The final choice (noting exact bearing) feels more procedural than transformative; no visible cost forecloses a path. Minor issue: Kess's rare praise and the crew's whispers tell us impact rather than showing Elara wrestling with the cost of fame versus solitude.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (airship chart room, Elara, evening starlings) arrive promptly. Drive lens reads Causal: phrasebook clue → hopscotch pattern → coordinates → journey → discovery. The closure lands on-page (Elara realizes predecessor left breadcrumb, crew legends her name), but cost remains asserted rather than dramatized—no visible sacrifice or foreclosed option in the final image. The inferred lens holds, yet the ending summarizes consequence ("became a legend") instead of showing a choice or reconfiguration with felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The antique airship is vivid and recurring: brass fittings, wooden hull creaking, humming in approval. The dusty hopscotch board constrains Elara's discovery method and the Whispering Crag's "stranded luminance" charges the ending image. Starling murmurations frame time and atmosphere across multiple beats. Minor slip: "porthole," "chart room," and "deck" anchor space, but the spatial relationship between chart room and deck remains vague during the hopscotch discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (chart the fallen star, earn cartographer status) is signaled early and Elara's agency drives the journey. One meaningful tightening: phrasebook + hopscotch → Whispering Crag coordinates narrows options. The stranded luminance materializes as promised, but the resolution arrives without complication—Kess agrees immediately, the light is exactly where legend said, ancient carvings confirm the breadcrumb. No reversal or trade-off tests commitment; coincidence delivers rather than protagonist struggle.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme of solitary discovery versus collective legend emerges through "sociable isolation" and the predecessor's breadcrumb, resonating in the final image of crew whispers. The phrasebook dog-ear as inherited clue adds thematic depth. However, the ending drifts toward summary assertion ("her name became a legend") rather than a resonant, non-literal answer. The carvings of "forgotten explorers" gesture at theme but remain ornamental—Elara does not wrestle with their meaning or cost on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; Elara's perceptual signature (chartroom details, celestial obsession) is consistent. Diction is controlled and voice-motivated ("the graphite a faint echo of the starlight"). Kess's dialogue is minimal but functional. Minor slip: "the airship humming in approval" and "its course forever changed" edge toward anthropomorphic narrator intrusion rather than strict Elara-filtered perception. No head-hopping; psychic distance is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is clear and momentum generally good, but multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence appear: "Elara's current obsession… She believed that mapping… would earn her" (adjacent restatement); "According to legend… the legend" (synonym churn); "the starlings still swirled… the starlings returned… the starlings above" (recycled stem). Stock metaphors: "dark brushstroke," "flickering clock," "faint echo." Figurative density in the opening and closing paragraphs ("captured star," "soft silver glow," "breadcrumb") accumulates without pattern payoff. Sentence openings vary adequately; grammar is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The airship-cartographer-fallen-star synthesis offers a fresh steampunk-adjacent angle, and the hopscotch-as-cipher is specific. However, the plot follows a familiar treasure-hunt template: clue → decode → journey → discovery without subversion. Emotional arc (solitary apprentice gains renown) is earnest but predictable. The phrasebook breadcrumb from a predecessor adds ingenuity, yet the ending's tidy confirmation (carvings, praise, legend status) retreats from risk. Transformation test: swap airship for ship, star for artifact—core beats remain unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's choices—deciphering phrasebook, noting hopscotch, persuading Kess, recording bearing—create all major turns. Present in setup (chart room intro), development (hopscotch decode), and payoff (noting exact bearing, tracing carvings). Her curiosity drives causal pressure across three beats and shapes closure. Slight friction: the final realization (predecessor's breadcrumb) is more received insight than active decision, but prior agency is strong.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Phrasebook dog-ear appears in setup (beneath chart table, marking celestial navigation section) and development (cryptic "lights that linger" note aligns with legend). Returns at payoff ("tucked safely in her pocket," predecessor breadcrumb realization). Handled twice; meaning reweights at end. Friction: it enables discovery but does not constrain a choice with visible cost—Elara never struggles over trusting it or risking a wrong interpretation. Swappable with any inherited map or journal.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Stranded luminance defines the dominant stake from paragraph 5 and materializes on-page ("faint, pulsing glow," "soft silver glow") at closure, illuminating carvings that confirm the legend. Shapes tactics (decoding coordinates, persuading pilot, noting bearing) and charges the final image. Essential across setup, development, and payoff. Minor friction: the light delivers exactly as promised with no complication—its mechanics (why it reveals hidden paths) remain abstract.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Diligently curious" is stated twice but functions mostly as label. On-page demonstrations: "losing herself in… latitudes," "quick stroke of her pencil," "deciphered the connection," "hurried to the pilot." These actions show curiosity driving discovery, but no visible cost or constraint—diligence never forces a trade-off (e.g., missing rest, alienating crew, risking safety). The trait enables success without friction; swappable with "determined" or "observant."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Note" appears in three beats: noting hopscotch pattern, noting exact bearing, noting carvings. The hopscotch notation unlocks coordinates (major turn). The bearing notation completes the cartographer goal (closure participation). Setup and payoff present; development overlap with hopscotch beat. Friction: "note" as action is generic—swappable with "record," "sketch," "mark"—and does not impose specific cost or constraint beyond observation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Hopscotch board is seeded early ("dusty hopscotch board etched onto the deck, its squares half-erased"), its secret pattern mirrors celestial coordinates, and this method drives the central turn (decode → Whispering Crag). Present in setup (board discovery), development (pattern decode), and payoff (coordinates guide journey, carvings confirm). Mechanics matter: "sequence of numbers" shapes tactics. Unique and irreplaceable—removing this exact method breaks the plot. Minor friction: no visible cost to decoding it (no failed attempt, no risk).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Airship is present throughout: chart room (setup), humming engines (development), "humming in approval" (payoff). It provides locomotion and framing atmosphere ("brass fittings," "wooden ribs vibrating"). However, it functions mostly as transport and backdrop—no on-page constraint (fuel, weather, crew tension) alters Elara's tactics or choices. Kess agrees immediately; the ascent succeeds without complication. The setting stages action but does not pressure it. Lyric reprise ("antique airship sailed onward") reweights tone but not stakes.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Starling murmurations frame three beats: opening ("drifted slowly amid"), hopscotch discovery ("while the starlings still swirled"), departure ("starlings trailing like a farewell"), return ("starlings returned to their nightly murmurations"). Functions as atmospheric clock and tonal anchor. Present in setup and payoff; mentioned in development. Friction: time remains vague—"one evening," "evenings," "days that followed"—and murmurations do not tighten decisions or impose a deadline. Swappable with any recurring natural phenomenon (tides, twilight). The return charges closure tone but not tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Motivation to "chart the next great discovery" and "earn her a place among the great cartographers" is stated in setup and drives every choice: decoding, persuading Kess, noting bearing. Present across all three gates. Friction: desire is told more than dramatized in conflict—no scene shows Elara weighing fame against cost (e.g., risk, isolation deepening, betraying the predecessor's secrecy). The ending asserts "her name became a legend" but Elara's interior reaction to fame is absent; no visible trade-off between discovery and the "sociable isolation" she cherished.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Sociable isolation" appears as label in three paragraphs: "defined her days," "felt like a quiet strength," "remained… a solitary figure." Tone is coherent and modulates slightly (isolation as burden → isolation as strength). Present in setup and payoff. Friction: the tone is asserted rather than enacted in scene texture—Elara interacts with Kess without visible tension between connection and withdrawal, and the ending's "crew whispered" suggests integration but does not show her navigating it. The final image repeats the label ("sociable isolation of the skies") without reweighting it through a choice or cost.</comment>
