<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is clear (translating grief into moonflower planting) and anchored in embodied memory (machine oil, tobacco, grandfather's locksmith precision). The piece delivers embodied moments—kneeling on warm concrete, scoring earth—but interiority often drifts into abstract summary ("translating it, turning grief into geometry") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously under pressure. The final choice to seed the lot is earned by prior causality, yet the cost feels more asserted than dramatized: we're told she's learned "letting go was the most precise measurement" without witnessing a live struggle or forfeited path on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers image (petal drop, bitting gauge, moonflower seeds, harbor moonlight) toward a final reconfiguration where planting becomes "horizontal hope" and Maya becomes "the lock, and the key, and the hand that turns them both." Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the bitting gauge shifts from loss-measurement to invitation-tool—but the cost remains oblique: the rose is gone, yet the emotional or opportunity price of abandoning the fire escape for the cannery lot is told more than felt. Orientation is prompt (Maya, fire escape, petal drop) and the piece coheres under its lens, but the final image asserts transformation without a visible sacrifice or friction point that makes the before/after undeniable on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setting is vivid and purposeful: the fire escape vertical garden, the abandoned cannery lot, the luminous harbor by moonlight all anchor Maya's shift from constrained to expansive planting. The bitting gauge tooth—handled across multiple beats (scoring soil, gleaming in dirt, slipped back into pocket)—functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective (salt and nostalgia, machine oil and pipe tobacco, warm concrete) and filtered through Maya's locksmith-gardener perspective, though some phrases ("cathedral of fragrance," "canvas waiting for moonlight's brush") veer toward generic lyricism rather than character-particular perception.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: after the rose dies, Maya must decide how to carry forward her devotion and her grandfather's legacy. The piece delivers one meaningful tightening—choosing the cannery lot over the fire escape, seeding moonflowers with the gauge—but the escalation is more declaration than dramatized pressure: "she was not replacing what was lost, but translating it" is asserted rather than tested by a complicating reversal or visible tradeoff. Agency is present (she gathers seeds, walks to the lot, plants) yet coincidence supplies the abandoned lot without on-page discovery friction, and the ending reconfigures meaning without showing a live cost that narrows options or forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and action: precision as love, translation of grief, light seeded into darkness. The bitting gauge's journey from measuring loss to scoring invitation coheres across the piece, and the final line—"the lock, and the key, and the hand that turns them both"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how to endure loss. The piece resists overt moralizing and invites reflection through layered particulars (locksmith precision, moonflower blooms, fire escape to horizontal lot). However, some assertions ("letting go was the most precise measurement of all") edge toward thematic summary rather than letting the concrete work speak, and the rose-to-moonflower parallel risks symbolic convenience without friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Maya, and perceptual signature is present (locksmith's precision, machine oil memory, measured soil cuts). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, though some register drift occurs: "wistfully pragmatic devotion," "translating it, turning grief into geometry," "protected vulnerability" read as elevated summary rather than Maya's lived idiom under pressure. The recurring phrase "with the rhythm of oars in water" is purposeful but borders on over-crafted lyricism that distances rather than deepens immediacy. No dialogue is present; the piece maintains coherent distance and internal texture, though emotional peaks sometimes compress into abstraction rather than embodied perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose is polished with purposeful rhythm and vivid image ("the water caught the moon and threw it back in shards of silver"), yet multiple beats fall into template cadence and synonym loops: "She could still smell…," "She gathered…," "She planted…," "She would return…," "She walked…," "She slipped…" creates a monotonous stem pattern across the middle third. Paraphrase loops appear ("translating it, turning grief into geometry, memory into moonlight" restates the same concept three times) and stock metaphors cluster without fresh inflection ("cathedral of fragrance," "canvas waiting for moonlight's brush"). The final paragraph stacks declarations—"Tomorrow, the city would wake… And Maya would be… The gardener had become…"—that tell closure rather than charge it through image and action. Information density is high in early beats but sags mid-piece with reflective summary that doesn't advance pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The locksmith-gardener synthesis is specific and the bitting gauge as planting tool offers a fresh angle on grief and legacy. The shift from vertical fire escape garden to horizontal cannery lot is purposeful, and moonflowers that bloom at night while the city sleeps add conceptual resonance. However, the core emotional arc—translating personal loss into communal offering—follows a familiar template (private mourning → public generosity) without a non-obvious moral calculus or complicating friction that would transform it. The final metaphor ("the lock, and the key, and the hand that turns them both") is evocative but borders on abstract cleverness rather than inevitable synthesis rooted in prior particulars, and the piece avoids bold risk at peak beats, choosing lyricism over a harder, character-specific pressure test.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya is present throughout and her choices drive all major beats: deciding to gather seeds, walking to the cannery lot, scoring earth with the gauge, planting moonflowers, returning home with purpose. She appears in the closure image ("the gardener had become the lock, and the key") and her agency narrows options (abandoning the fire escape for the lot). Introduced in the opening line and causally active across setup, development, and payoff. The role is irreplaceable—no generic "gardener" could deliver the locksmith-precision specificity—and the cost of letting go the rose is tied to her on-page actions, though the emotional price is more asserted than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The bitting gauge tooth is handled across multiple beats: kept in her pocket (setup), used to score soil with each notch a promise (middle), gleamed in the dirt as invitation rather than entry (late middle), slipped back into pocket feeling legacy and liberation (closure). The object's mechanics matter—its tooth originally traced key depths, now scores furrows—and it carries reweighted meaning (from measuring loss to enabling invitation). Present in the final third with transformed significance, and its locksmith origin ties directly to Maya's grandfather memory and the precision-as-love theme. Removing it would require structural rewrite of both the planting method and the thematic through-line.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The quivering hush appears in the opening ("a silence that trembled like a struck bell") and returns near the end ("the quivering hush gave way to something softer, a protected vulnerability"), framing the city's held breath before and after Maya's act. It shapes tone and primes the reader for transformation but does not constrain an on-page choice or alter tactics—Maya's decision to plant is driven by the rose's death and her grandfather's legacy, not by the hush itself. The concept charges atmosphere and provides lyric continuity, yet it remains more thematic echo than causal agent. Present in setup and payoff with shifted emotional weight, earning mid-band placement, but it does not force a tradeoff or narrow options on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Wistfully pragmatic" is declared in paragraph three ("twenty years of wistfully pragmatic devotion") but functions as retrospective summary rather than a trait that constrains present action. The piece shows pragmatism (gathering seeds, using the gauge as a planting tool, measuring growth by notches) and hints at wistfulness (nostalgia, memory of grandfather, rose devotion), yet these qualities operate separately rather than creating a visible tradeoff or friction point where one impulse costs the other. The attribute could be removed with minimal structural impact—Maya's choices would read the same. It lacks middle development and does not participate causally in closure, capping it below 5.0 despite thematic presence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Instill" governs the major turn: Maya decides "it was time to instill something new, to carry light where only shadows owned the ground," prompting her to gather seeds and walk to the cannery lot. The verb is purposeful (echoing precision, insertion, planting) and distinct from generic alternatives like "plant" or "create." It appears early (paragraph eight), drives the middle choice to leave the apartment, and its result—moonflowers seeded—shapes the closure image. However, the action itself is more transition than peak pressure test; Maya faces no on-page obstacle to instilling, and the moonflower planting proceeds without friction. Strong causal role and closure linkage, but swappable mechanics (she could "sow" or "seed" with similar effect) and lack of visible cost during the act itself keep it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The phrase "with the rhythm of oars in water" appears three times: when Maya moves through the apartment (paragraph nine), when she scores earth (paragraph fifteen), and when she walks home (paragraph thirty-two). It establishes a cadence of measured persistence and ties to the harbor setting, charging the final reprise with accumulated meaning (steady, sure, her heart a quiet boat). The method shapes tone and coheres thematically but does not constrain mechanics or tactics—Maya's planting would proceed identically without the oar-rhythm framing. Present in setup, middle, and closure with reweighted resonance, earning mid-band for purposeful lyric recurrence, yet it remains ornamental to causal structure rather than mechanically necessary.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The luminous harbor by moonlight is established in paragraph ten ("the water caught the moon and threw it back in shards of silver") and returns in the final third ("moonlight ripple across the harbor," "her heart a quiet boat on a silvered sea," "the harbor answered"). It provides spatial anchor and sensory atmosphere (salt, nostalgia, moon-shards) and the moonlight thematically ties to the moonflowers Maya plants. However, the harbor does not pressure a choice—Maya walks past it to the cannery lot, and the setting functions more as backdrop and tonalcharge than as a constraint or resource that alters her tactics. Present in setup and closure with thematic resonance but no direct causal role, placing it in mid-band for purposeful atmosphere that supports but does not drive the action.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the final petal drops" anchors the opening line and triggers Maya's decision: the rose's death marks the moment she must act. The petal drop is causally necessary—without it, Maya would continue tending the fire escape rather than seeking a new site. Time progresses coherently across one continuous sequence (evening into night, moonlight throughout) and the piece tracks Maya's movement from apartment to lot to return home. However, no live clock or deadline tightens tactics; Maya proceeds at her chosen pace without urgency or competing pressure. The timeframe frames the story and enables the turn but does not escalate or constrain choices after the opening, earning solid mid-to-high band for setup and causal trigger without ongoing pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to reflect light into dark corners" is stated explicitly in paragraph eight ("to carry light where only shadows owned the ground") and paragraph sixteen ("destined to reflect light into dark corners"), then enacted through planting moonflowers that bloom at night. It drives Maya's choice to leave the fire escape and seed the cannery lot, and it coheres with the grandfather's legacy (precision as illumination) and the moonlight imagery. However, the desire is more declared than dramatized in conflict—Maya faces no on-page friction between wanting to reflect light and another competing want or cost. The motivation is present in setup, development, and payoff with causal force, but the lack of visible tradeoff or internal resistance (she simply gathers seeds and goes) keeps it from higher bands. Solid integration with thematic resonance but minimal friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tone "protected vulnerability" is signaled in paragraph nineteen ("the quivering hush gave way to something softer, a protected vulnerability") and coheres across the piece: Maya's devotion is tender yet resilient, her planting is an act of exposure wrapped in precision, and the final image of becoming lock, key, and hand balances strength with openness. The tone modulates subtly—quiet grief in the opening, steady resolve in the middle, liberation and legacy at the close—without breaking voice. However, the phrase "protected vulnerability" appears once as an explicit label mid-piece rather than being embodied throughout in action and perception. The tone is coherent and purposeful, charging the final image with softness and strength, but the reliance on direct declaration rather than sustained enactment through diction and rhythm under pressure keeps it from higher bands.</comment>
