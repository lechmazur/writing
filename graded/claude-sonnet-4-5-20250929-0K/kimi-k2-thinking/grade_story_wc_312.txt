<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael's "lukewarm mage" trait and "earnestly naive" quality are declared but remain largely labels without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. His devotion is called "brittle" yet he proceeds without visible internal struggle or competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final smile and quiet satisfaction feel unearned—no prior causality shows what cost this victory extracted or what path was foreclosed. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("heart skipped," "wonder") rather than character-particular perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Kael measures drips, adjusts the bell, strikes it, and the cosmos shifts. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the bell's song restores fish and balance), but the cost remains abstract—"lukewarm magic spent" is told, not shown through forfeited options or visible trade-off. Orientation anchors (sapphire viaduct, dawn, Kael) arrive early. The ritual sequence coheres, yet the final image ("bell's echo still humming in his bones") reconfigures atmosphere more than stakes; no concrete price or foreclosed path is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The sapphire viaduct is vivid and returns throughout: "arches dripping with dew," "shadow met the rising sun," "crystalline arch captured the tone." The dawn light striking sapphire and cascading into water directly enables the bell's resonance, constraining Kael's timing and positioning. Spatial choreography (central arch, reeds, ocean) remains clear. The viaduct functions as both setting and tool, charging the final image when it glows "softly in the morning mist." Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through the ritual's demands.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—righting cosmic imbalance after the last fish is caught—is signaled early. Kael's adjustments (counting drips, tilting the bell) provide texture but no meaningful escalation or trade-off; each attempt succeeds incrementally without narrowing options or raising cost. The coincidental arrival of fish and the restoration of balance feel handed rather than earned through protagonist agency. No live alternative is foreclosed, and the "quiet victory" lacks the visible price or tactical consequence required for higher bands under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—cosmic balance, the power of patience and small acts—emerges from particulars (dripping water, cracked bell, silent sea) rather than statement. The final image of the viaduct glowing in mist offers visual resonance, and Kael's "earnest naivety" becoming "quiet strength" hints at conceptual repricing. However, the thematic answer is somewhat generic ("one drip at a time") and lacks a non-literal charge or ambiguity that reweights prior material. The bell's restoration feels thematically tidy rather than transformative.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is consistent ("faded twilight," "cosmic imbalance," "plausible impossibility") and fits a lyric-fantasy register, though some phrases veer toward stock ("heart skipped," "wonder"). Perceptual signature is present (Kael notices dripping rates, engravings, vibrations) but not deeply character-particular. No dialogue. Psychic distance is controlled. The prose carries a distinct texture, yet under peak pressure (bell strikes, fish return) the voice does not modulate or compress; it maintains the same elevation throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; no template cadence runs. Information density is moderate—many lines advance atmosphere more than plot. Minor paraphrase loops: "brittle devotion" appears three times with slight variation, "earnestly naive" twice. Figurative language ("contained starlight," "bent the air") is vivid but occasionally strains clarity ("plausible impossibility made manifest" tells rather than shows). Scaffolding is minimal. The final line ("one drip at a time") feels engineered for thematic closure rather than emergent. Propulsion is steady but not urgent; some beats linger without adding pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core premise—restoring balance via a ship's bell tuned to dripping water on a sapphire viaduct—offers a specific synthesis. However, the emotional arc (naive mage succeeds through patience) is familiar, and the transformation test suggests the plot and arc would work largely unchanged with different names and places. The "lukewarm mage" and "brittle devotion" labels promise complexity but deliver straightforward success. No bold risk or unexpected turn; the story follows a predictable ritual-completion path. Specificity in setting and method provides freshness, but the stakes and resolution remain generic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael (lukewarm mage) is present throughout and makes decisions: choosing to perform the ritual, measuring drips, adjusting the bell, striking it. His choices drive the sequence. However, his "lukewarm" quality is told rather than shown in constrained action—he proceeds methodically without visible cost or trade-off tied to that trait. Early signal (+0.5), three beats (counting, adjusting, striking, +1.4), causal pressure moderate (+0.6), closure linkage present (+0.8). Swappability moderate (−0.5): a "determined" or "patient" mage could replace him with minor edits. Total baseline ~7.0; deduct for label-only trait and lack of visible cost tied to "lukewarm" (−0.8 each). Final ~5.4, round down to 5.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The broken ship's bell is introduced early ("lay in the reeds"), handled and adjusted across multiple beats (tracing engravings, adjusting resonance, positioning, striking twice), and its song drives the ending (fish return, balance restored). Early signal (+0.6), three distinct beats (+1.4), causal pressure high (+1.2), closure linkage strong (+1.5), specificity (cracked bronze, engravings, internal resonance) high (+0.6). Baseline ~8.3. No major frictions. Final 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Brittle devotion is mentioned three times but remains thematic decoration; it does not constrain or enable on-page action. Kael's faith "threatens to snap like old twine" yet holds without consequence—no choice is altered, no tactic foreclosed. Late payoff (final third, −0.7), ornamental (−0.8), label-only (−0.6). Baseline ~3.0 + early signal (+0.4). Total ~2.7, adjust up slightly for thematic presence to 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Earnestly naive" is declared twice and said to enable the ritual ("believing each drip was a heartbeat of the cosmos"), but the trait does not visibly constrain choice or impose cost. Kael proceeds without friction or trade-off tied to naivety. Early signal (+0.5), one beat (belief enabling persistence, +0.4), closure linkage weak (+0.3). Swappable (−0.6), label-only (−0.6). Baseline ~3.0, total ~3.0. Adjust to 4.3 for thematic presence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Rebuild" is the action: Kael rebuilds the bell's voice through measurement, adjustment, and striking. The action spans multiple beats and drives the ending (fish return, balance restored). Early signal (+0.6), three beats (+1.4), causal pressure high (+1.2), closure linkage strong (+1.5), specificity (rebuild via drip-tuning) moderate (+0.4). Baseline ~8.1. Minor swappability (repair, restore could substitute, −0.3). Final 7.8, round to 7.4 for slight generality in execution.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Understanding dripping rates" is introduced early ("became his obsession"), demonstrated in two beats (counting intervals, adjusting tilt by drip-count), and shapes the ritual's success. Early signal (+0.6), two beats (+0.9), causal pressure moderate (+0.8), closure linkage indirect (+0.5), specificity moderate (+0.4). Baseline ~6.2. The method is told more than shown in mechanical detail (−0.4). Total ~5.8, adjust up for integral role to 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The sapphire viaduct at dawn is present from the opening, supplies resources (dripping water, crystalline arches that multiply the bell's tone, shadow-and-light timing), and appears in the final image. Early signal (+0.7), three beats (opening, ritual positioning, ending, +1.4), causal pressure high (light striking sapphire enables resonance, +1.3), closure linkage strong (+1.4), specificity high (sapphire, arches, dawn light cascade, +0.7). Baseline ~8.5. No major frictions. Final 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the last fish is caught" frames the premise and provides the inciting imbalance, but timeframe does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page. Kael works without a deadline; the ritual unfolds at his pace. Early signal (+0.6), one beat (premise, +0.4), no causal pressure from time (+0.0), closure linkage weak (fish return signals resolution, +0.3). Vague tracking (−0.7). Baseline ~3.6, round to 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"To right a cosmic imbalance" is Kael's stated motivation, signaled early and driving his ritual. Early signal (+0.7), two beats (sensing imbalance, achieving balance, +0.9), causal pressure moderate (+0.7), closure linkage present (+0.9). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost (−0.7), and desire feels declarative, not embodied (−0.4). Baseline ~5.1, adjust to 5.7 for consistent presence.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Plausible impossibility" is named once ("a plausible impossibility made manifest") and sustained through imagery (bell hums, arches multiply sound, fish flicker). Tone is coherent—lyric-fantasy realism—and charges the final image (cosmos "a little more balanced," viaduct glowing). Early establishment (+0.5), consistent modulation across beats (+0.8), closure linkage strong (+1.2), specificity moderate (+0.4). One overt label (−0.4). Baseline ~6.5, adjust to 6.8 for tonal consistency under pressure.</comment>
