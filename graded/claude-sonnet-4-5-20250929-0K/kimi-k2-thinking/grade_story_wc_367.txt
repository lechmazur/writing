<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The Herald remains a cipher—label-only "Laughing Storm Herald" with "accidentally prophetic" powers declared but never embodied through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Her interior is stock mysticism ("shadowed elation," "thrill wrapped in the weight of destiny") rather than character-particular texture. The crew and captain appear only to passively receive her light, offering no relationship crucible. No meaningful change or renunciation is earned; she "continues her otherworldly routine" with the same posture as page one.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who she is and when/where this occurs drifts until "emerald lighthouse" anchors setting but "After the last print newspaper folded" remains vague atmosphere rather than felt stake or temporal anchor (−0.4 Orientation Test; cap Q3 at 7.0). The drive lens reads as attempted-Accumulative (lyric patterning, motif recurrence) but closure is declaration rather than a resonant reconfiguration with cost: "the storm herald's laughter was not a warning, but a promise of dawn" summarizes theme instead of dramatizing a decisive change. The ship's safe harbor arrival is coincidence—she shouts, the storm abates, he turns the wheel—without visible price or foreclosed path. Cost-proof test fails: no on-page sentence shows what she loses or what path closes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The emerald lighthouse, glass wick with total internal reflection, and shadowed echoes offer vivid, specific anchors that recur and charge the mood. Spatial choreography is coherent (lighthouse, sea, approaching ship). The wick's mechanics (crystal shard, hollow channel, starlight capture) constrain her routine and shape one middle choice (adjusting the beam's angle). However, the "digital fog" and "old radio" are ornamental contrasts that do not alter tactics, and the opening newspaper detail vanishes after serving as atmosphere.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—guiding lost sailors, "shaping a new dawn"—is declared but never tested with a live choice that forecloses an option. The ship sends a signal; she turns the wick; the light reaches them; they arrive safely. No reversal, no trade-off, no visible cost. Her "accidentally prophetic" utterance ("The tide will turn") stills the sea without struggle or price, and the climax repeats the pattern: she shouts a prophecy, the storm abates, the captain "felt a sudden clarity" and steers in. Agency belongs to convenience and her passive gifts, not protagonist decision under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme is over-articulated: "The new dawn is carved from the shadows of the past!" in dialogue, then "a testament to the power of ancient shadows," then "the storm herald's laughter was not a warning, but a promise of dawn" in the final paragraph (−0.7 for multiple thematic echo moments including closure-beat sermonizing). The motifs (ancient shadows, laughter, emerald light) recur but remain symbolic gestures rather than constraining choices or charging a non-literal final image. The last line, "The dawn broke, fierce and bright gold," is literal weather rather than a resonant reconfiguration of prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic mystical-narrator rather than character-particular: "shadowed elation," "otherworldly routine," "living prophecy" could describe any mythic figure. Diction drifts into elevated register ("harbinger of tempest," "fabric of tomorrow") inconsistent with embodied interior. Dialogue (one ship captain, one Herald shout) is functional but brief. The prose shows consistent tense and clean mechanics, but voice lacks specificity and the narrator's way of noticing is stock rather than selective.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "ancient shadows" appears ~10 times, often in adjacent lines without added pressure; "shadowed elation" recurs as synonym churn for mood; "accidentally prophetic" and "otherworldly routine" are template phrases recycled across beats (−1.0 for pervasive loops and stock-phrase stacks). Figurative language in most sentences of the climax ("needle-thin ray," "silver thread," "fabric of the night") without payoff (−0.5 density penalty). Mixed metaphor: light "slicing darkness" then "connecting lighthouse and ship" as a "thread" shifts vehicle mid-beat. Information density is low: many lines restate atmosphere rather than advance situation or choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The core premise—last lighthouse keeper with prophetic laughter after print media ends—offers a fresh synthesis of elements, but execution is template-driven: mystical guide with passive gift rescues lost travelers through atmospheric declarations. The "accidentally prophetic" power and "total internal reflection" mechanics are noted but not transformed into specific, grounded tactics or trade-offs. Emotional arc (relief, thrill, shadowed elation) uses generic labels. The ship-rescue climax could swap any beacon/guide archetype with minor edits. No bold risk elevates the synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Laughing Storm Herald is present throughout and named early (setup ✓). She adjusts the wick angle (one middle beat, development ✓) and shouts the prophetic line that abates the storm (closure participation ✓). However, her choices are passive application of her gift rather than decisions that narrow options: she turns the wick, the light reaches the ship, the crew arrives. No visible cost tied to her agency. The climax turn (storm abating, captain's clarity) happens to her words rather than through a difficult choice. Swappable with any mystical guide who channels power. Gates met but causal pressure and cost are absent: 3.0 base +0.8 early signal +0.4 one beat +0.7 closure linkage −0.8 swappability −0.3 summary-only interiority = 4.1 (round down).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Glass lantern wick is present early (setup ✓), handled in the nightly routine and adjusted to steer the beam mid-story (development ✓), and its mechanics (total internal reflection) enable the rescue (closure ✓). Appears in three distinct beats (routine lighting, adjusting angle, shooting light across waves). However, the wick's properties are described rather than tested under pressure, and no cost or evolving constraint shapes its use. Specific (crystal shard, hollow channel) and irreplaceable for the physics claimed, but the object does not return with reweighted meaning. Gates met: 3.0 base +0.6 early +0.9 two beats +0.7 closure linkage +0.5 causal enable +0.6 specificity −0.5 ornamental first mention = 6.8 (round down).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Otherworldly routine is named early and described (lighting the wick with trembling hands each night, decoding shadow movements), but it remains atmospheric label. The routine does not constrain a choice or create friction; she performs it, then the plot advances. Middle development is weak: her routine primes her to adjust the wick, but any keeper would do the same. Closure participation is label-only: "She continued her otherworldly routine" is summary, not demonstrated stakes shift. Setup ✓, development marginal, closure summary-only. 3.0 base +0.5 early signal −0.3 ornamental use −0.3 summary closure −0.5 swappable = 3.2 (round down). Cap at 3.4 (missing middle development gate).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Accidentally prophetic is introduced early (setup ✓). It enables the key middle turn: "The tide will turn before the dawn" stills the sea, demonstrating the trait's power (development ✓). At closure she shouts "The new dawn is carved from the shadows of the past!" and the storm abates, the captain feels clarity (closure ✓). However, the trait is convenient rather than constraining: no visible cost or tradeoff for speaking prophecy; no friction from unwanted predictions. The trait narrows no options and imposes no price. Gates met: 3.0 base +0.6 early +0.9 two beats (tide, dawn shout) +0.7 closure linkage +0.5 causal enable −0.7 resolves problem without cost −0.3 label-only interiority = 5.3 (round down). Cap at 6.0 (two gates allow ~6.0 max per guidance).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Steer is the action of the climax: "She turned the glass wick, adjusting its angle so that total internal reflection would steer the beam toward the vessel." This middle beat directly enables the rescue (development ✓, closure ✓). Setup is implied in the routine but not foregrounded as a goal until the ship's signal. The action is specific (adjusting angle for total internal reflection) and causally necessary, but easily swappable with "aimed" or "directed" with minor edits—steering is generic lighthouse-keeper action. No visible cost tied to the act. 3.0 base +0.4 one beat +0.7 closure linkage +0.5 causal pressure +0.4 specificity −0.6 swappable with near-synonym −0.2 late explicit framing = 6.2 (round down).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Through total internal reflection is introduced early in the wick description (setup ✓), its mechanics (light bouncing within glass, refusing to escape) are explained, and the method is invoked at the climax when she adjusts the wick angle to steer the beam (closure ✓). However, middle development is weak: the method is described in the routine but not tested or constrained by the physics. The mechanics do not alter her tactics (she adjusts the angle as any keeper would). Specificity is high (the physics claim is precise) but the method's role is ornamental explanation rather than constraint. Gates setup + closure allow ~6.0 ceiling; missing middle development caps at 3.4; take the lower. 3.0 base +0.6 early +0.5 specificity +0.7 closure linkage −0.5 ornamental use −0.6 late arrival of the technique as plot device = 4.9 (round down). Apply cap 4.6 (missing middle development).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Emerald lighthouse under stars is named in the second line (setup ✓), frames the entire action (she performs routine there, adjusts the wick, guides the ship), and is present in the final image (closure ✓). The setting supplies the tool (glass wick, beam) that enables the rescue and the spatial stage (lighthouse/sea/harbor). However, the setting does not pressure a choice or impose a resource limit; it is atmospheric anchor rather than tactical constraint. The lighthouse's "emerald glow" and "ancient shadows" are vivid but do not alter her options. Gates met: 3.0 base +0.8 early signal +0.9 two beats (routine, rescue) +0.7 closure linkage +0.5 enables via tool −0.5 postcard description without pressure = 6.4 (round down).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.3</grade><comment>After the last print newspaper folded appears in the opening line (setup ✓) and is reprised in the final third ("the last print newspaper's final headline still whispered on the wind"), but the timeframe does not constrain a choice or tighten a decision. The "digital fog" and "old radio" are atmospheric contrasts; the Herald's task (guiding ships) is unchanged by the post-print era. No middle development: the timeframe does not affect tactics. Closure participation is ornamental reprise. Setup only; development and closure absent. 3.0 base +0.5 early signal −0.3 ornamental −0.3 summary-only reprise −0.6 no pressure = 2.3 (round down). Cap at 2.8 (missing closure participation gate).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>To shape a new dawn using ancient shadows is stated mid-story ("She sought to harness this power… to steer the world toward a new dawn") and invoked at closure ("The new dawn is carved from the shadows of the past!"). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices. No friction between this desire and a competing want or cost on the page. Middle development is weak: decoding shadow movements is mentioned but not shown constraining a choice. Closure participation is dialogue declaration, not a lived tradeoff. Setup ~30% in, development label-only, closure told. 3.0 base +0.3 signal −0.3 told-only −0.5 no friction −0.3 summary closure −0.2 late setup = 4.7 (round down). Cap at 4.6 (introduced after 40% mark).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Shadowed elation is named early ("her laughter now held a shadowed elation") and recurs ("shadowed elation" at the crew's moment, "thrill of shadowed elation" at her relief). The tone is coherent—mystery, awe, charged hope—and modulates slightly under pressure (laughter merging with wind, relief and thrill at closure). However, the tone is label-only rather than embodied through sentence rhythm or diction shift; the prose maintains the same elevated, static register throughout. The final image ("The dawn broke, fierce and bright gold") shifts to literal brightness without tonal reweighting. Gates met: 3.0 base +0.6 early signal +0.4 one beat (recurrence) +0.6 coherence +0.5 modulation −0.3 label-only −0.4 static mood −0.6 final image does not charge with tone = 5.8 (round down).</comment>
