<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to restore her sister is clear and drives her descent, but her agency at the key turn is passive—she accepts the Keeper's terms without dramatized internal conflict between competing impulses. The phrase "reckless idealist" and "fiercely gentle" appear as labels rather than embodied contradictions acting simultaneously in scene. The final state (lighter and heavier, a different-shaped hole) gestures toward complexity but remains abstract; no micro-choice in the closing beats reveals a hierarchy of values with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a Causal lens: Elara descends, barters memories for her sister's destiny, and the transaction completes with consequences. Orientation anchors early (catacomb orchard, Elara, the burned card). The closure unit—a Resonant Reconfiguration where Elara's memories are traded and her sister will wake "in a body not her own"—lands on the page, but the cost is told rather than shown in a concrete image or sentence ("lighter and heavier," "threadbare"). The midpoint turn (placing the card, memories pouring out) is functional but lacks a visible narrowing of options or a dramatized hesitation that would deepen escalation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is vividly anchored: tree roots snaking between bones, the Keeper's form "bent like the trees above," packed earth between ribs and femurs. The root functions as a micro-setting that constrains the climactic choice—Elara must kneel and place the card on the thickest root—and the glowing wood charges the final transaction. The half-lit corridors frame the entire descent and return, modulating atmosphere. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elara's urgency, though the "roots no longer whispering" on the return could be more embodied.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (restore her sister's destiny) is signaled early and sustained. The barter scene provides one meaningful tightening when the Keeper names the price (memory), but Elara's acceptance is swift and lacks on-page hesitation or a visible trade-off between competing goods. The consequence (sister wakes "in a body not her own, with memories not quite right") is stated rather than shown in a concrete image that forecloses a path. The phrase "imperfect, as all such transactions are" tells the cost rather than letting the reader feel it through a specific loss or changed tactic.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (the cost of bartering fate, grief as transformation) emerges from the descent and transaction, not from direct statement. The burned tarot card and its golden-script healing, the roots "inlaying meaning everywhere," and the final "different shape" of the hole offer thematic resonance. However, the closing paragraph edges toward summary moralizing: "fate had trammelled her back, and in the space between, something new had grown" is near-platitude. The piece invites reflection, but the final image (clutching a "dead piece of paper," feeling her sister's pulse) abstracts rather than reweights prior particulars in a non-literal way.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable, and the prose carries a heightened register ("dusky resolve," "fiercely gentle," "inlaying meaning everywhere") that reads as intentional voice. However, the repeated phrase "inlaying meaning everywhere" (used six times) and the stock metaphors ("conviction and borrowed time," "hole she left behind") create a template cadence that flattens immediacy. Dialogue is minimal but functional; the Keeper's "voice like rustling leaves over stone" fits the setting. The narrative certainty matches Elara's knowledge, with no head-hopping, but the perceptual signature is not character-particular—adjectives like "dusky" and "fiercely gentle" feel imposed rather than arising from Elara's internal texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The phrase "inlaying meaning everywhere" appears six times, creating a synonym loop that dulls momentum. Stock metaphors ("bones of the earth," "hollow places in her soul," "patched but threadbare") and therapy-speak ("holes in the soul," "fiercely gentle") cluster in peak beats without fresh embodiment. The opening and final lines anchor voice and stakes effectively, but paraphrase loops (e.g., "lighter and heavier all at once" / "a different shape now") and repetitive sentence stems ("The root pulsed," "The Keeper watched," "Elara rose") reduce information density. Cumulative artifacts trigger −1.0 in Q7 under the Patterned-artifact penalty pack; the phrase "inlaying meaning everywhere" in the final third disallows 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard as a setting and the barter-for-destiny frame offer fresh inflections on grief and resurrection tropes. However, the emotional arc (grief → transaction → transformation) follows a familiar template, and the closure (sister restored imperfectly, protagonist lighter and heavier) is a widely used pattern for deals-with-supernatural-forces stories. The specific detail (burned tarot card, roots glowing, memories pouring into wood) is vivid but does not transform the premise into a non-obvious synthesis. The phrase "imperfect, as all such transactions are" signals genre awareness without subversion.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her descent is motivated by her reckless idealism. Her label as "reckless idealist" appears in the opening third, satisfying setup. She makes the key choice to kneel and place the card, which enables the barter (development beat). At closure, she climbs the stairs and clutches the card, present but not decisively reweighted. However, her idealism does not constrain a choice with visible cost—she accepts the Keeper's terms without on-page hesitation or a dramatized internal conflict between recklessness and caution. The trait is functional across beats (setup, development, closure) but replaceable with "desperate" or "determined" with minor edits. Positive signals: early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage (present but not causal) +0.4, total ~+1.8. Frictions: label-only trait without embodied tradeoff −0.8, swappability −0.6, total ~−1.4. Base 3.0 + 1.8 − 1.4 = 3.4; round to nearest adjustment → 5.2 for functional presence and closure participation without irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The burned tarot card is introduced in the opening sentence (setup), held between Elara and the Keeper as a shield (beat 1), and placed on the root where its image seeps into the bark and heals into golden script (beat 2, development). At closure, Elara clutches "the burned tarot card that was now just a dead piece of paper," reweighting its meaning from prophecy vessel to spent artifact. The card's transformation (melted → healed → dead) tracks causally and charges the final image. Positive signals: early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage (charged reprise) +1.2, specificity (its burned state and healing matter) +0.6, total ~+3.8. Frictions: none significant. Base 3.0 + 3.8 = 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Bartered destinies" is signaled in the opening third ("bartered destinies, of souls who had traded futures") and frames the entire transaction. The concept drives the key turn: Elara offers to "barter for [her sister's destiny] back," the Keeper names the price (memory), and the barter completes with consequences on the page (sister's destiny restored but vessel changed). The mechanics are dramatized—memories pour into the root, the card materializes—and the cost is visible (Elara's memories become "soil in which this orchard grew"). At closure, the phrase "destinies had been bartered beneath its streets" explicitly names the concept and its outcome. Positive signals: early signal +0.7, three beats (offer, transaction, closure) +1.4, causal pressure (the barter narrows options and exacts cost) +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, cost connection +0.5, total ~+5.2. Frictions: late explicit naming in final third is acceptable when causal work is done; no significant penalty. Base 3.0 + 5.2 = 8.2; minor swappability with "traded fates" −0.4 → 7.8, but the phrase appears five times and drives the transaction, so restore +0.3 for irreplaceability → 8.1, adjust for integration strength → 7.3 after rounding and band-placement for concept that is told more than it constrains tactics on the page in the middle.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Fiercely gentle" appears three times: as a character label ("Elara was a reckless idealist… fiercely gentle"), in her steps through the catacombs ("fiercely gentle steps"), and in her accusation ("fiercely gentle even in accusation"). The trait is present at setup and closure ("fiercely gentle as dawn broke"), satisfying two gates. However, it does not constrain or enable a choice with visible cost—Elara's gentleness (careful not to disturb the dead) and fierceness (challenging the keepers) do not create a tradeoff or alter tactics. The phrase is label-only, never embodied in a micro-choice where one quality forecloses the other. Positive signals: early signal +0.5, two beats (catacombs, accusation) +0.9, closure presence +0.4, total ~+1.8. Frictions: label-only trait without tradeoff −0.8, ornamental use −0.7, AI-pattern artifact (repeated phrase) −0.3, total ~−1.8. Base 3.0 + 1.8 − 1.8 = 3.0; adjust up +0.6 for closure presence and thematic coherence → 3.6, band-place → 4.1 for functional presence without irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Trammel" appears twice: in Elara's declaration ("I would trammel the gods themselves") and in the closing reflection ("She had trammelled fate, and fate had trammelled her back"). The verb is present at setup (first third) and closure (final paragraph), satisfying two gates. The concept (to restrain or entangle) shapes Elara's stance and the transaction's reciprocal cost, but the action itself does not alter tactics or narrow options in the middle beats—the barter mechanics (placing the card, surrendering memories) could proceed without invoking "trammel." The word charges the thematic frame but is swappable with "defy" or "bind" without structural loss. Positive signals: early signal +0.6, closure linkage (thematic reprise) +0.8, specificity (rare verb) +0.4, total ~+1.8. Frictions: no middle-beat involvement (missing development gate, cap 3.4 waived for lyric reprise) −0.5, swappability −0.6, summary-only use at closure −0.5, total ~−1.6. Base 3.0 + 1.8 − 1.6 = 3.2; lyric-resonance allowance for early seed → final reprise +2.0 → 5.2, adjust +0.5 for thematic weight → 5.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Inlaying meaning everywhere" appears six times across the story: in the opening ("roots… inlaying meaning everywhere the living world forgot"), describing the card's transformation ("the burned edges healing into golden script… inlaying meaning everywhere"), the memories becoming part of the catacombs ("Each memory inlayed itself into the wood, inlaying meaning everywhere"), the roots' acceptance ("inlaying meaning everywhere in its endless, hungry growth"), and the final reflection. The phrase is signaled early (setup) and appears at closure, satisfying two gates. However, the method is never dramatized as a mechanics choice—Elara does not select or enact "inlaying" as a tactic; it happens to her memories passively. The phrase is descriptive and thematic rather than causal. Positive signals: early signal +0.6, closure presence +0.4, pattern recurrence (six uses) +0.8, total ~+1.8. Frictions: ornamental/passive use (no agency or tactic) −0.8, synonym loop artifact (repeated phrase dulls impact) −0.4, swappability with "embedding" or "weaving" −0.5, total ~−1.7. Base 3.0 + 1.8 − 1.7 = 3.1; adjust +0.4 for thematic coherence → 3.5, band-place → 3.8 for functional presence without causal mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The catacomb orchard is introduced in the opening sentence ("descended into the catacomb orchard") and detailed throughout: tree roots snaking between bones, packed earth between ribs and femurs, the Keeper emerging from shadows, the thickest root where Elara places the card. The setting constrains the climactic action—Elara must kneel on the earth, lay the card on the root, and the root's glow enables the transaction. At closure, Elara walks back through "half-lit corridors" and climbs "final stairs," and the catacombs keep their counsel, framing the story's before/after. The orchard is not mere backdrop; its physical properties (the root) and symbolic weight (bones and growth) drive the barter mechanics. Positive signals: early signal +0.8, three beats (descent, transaction, return) +1.4, causal pressure (root enables transaction) +1.2, closure linkage +1.2, specificity (roots + bones is unique to this story) +0.7, total ~+5.3. Frictions: none significant. Base 3.0 + 5.3 = 8.3; minor reduction for the return corridor being atmospheric rather than choice-constraining −0.4 → 7.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Half-lit corridors" appears in the opening ("Here, in the half-lit corridors") and return ("She walked back through the half-lit corridors"), framing the descent and ascent. The phrase is present at setup and closure but does not track elapsed time or create a ticking clock. The timeframe is atmospheric (dim light, underground) rather than a constraint that alters tactics—Elara's decisions are not pressured by time running out or light fading. The glow is static throughout. Positive signals: early signal +0.5, closure reprise +0.6, total ~+1.1. Frictions: no middle development (missing gate, cap 3.4 for two-gate) −0.3, ornamental (description without urgency) −0.6, no causal pressure (time does not narrow options) −0.8, total ~−1.7. Base 3.0 + 1.1 − 1.7 = 2.4; lyric-resonance allowance for atmospheric frame +1.5 → 3.9, adjust +0.7 for coherent tone across beats → 4.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Patch holes in the soul" is introduced early ("she could patch holes in the soul with nothing but conviction") and recurs in the transaction ("patching the hole she left behind") and closure ("her soul patched but threadbare," "The hole remained, but it was a different shape"). The motivation drives Elara's descent, her offer to barter, and her acceptance of the price. The friction between wanting to restore her sister and the cost of losing her memories is told ("The reckless idealist in her screamed… But the fiercely gentle sister… nodded") rather than dramatized in a choice where she hesitates, tries an alternative, or visibly weighs the trade-off. Positive signals: early signal +0.7, three beats (declaration, barter, closure) +1.4, closure linkage (the hole reweighted) +1.1, cost connection +0.4, total ~+3.6. Frictions: told friction without on-page hesitation −0.6, swappability with "heal wounds" or "fill the void" −0.5, total ~−1.1. Base 3.0 + 3.6 − 1.1 = 5.5; adjust +0.9 for thematic coherence and closure charge → 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Dusky resolve" appears three times: as Elara's defining attribute ("her jaw set in dusky resolve"), in the final paragraph ("she kept her dusky resolve"), and in the closing image ("fiercely gentle as dawn broke"). The tone is present at setup and closure, satisfying two gates. It modulates slightly—"dusky" (dim, twilight, neither bright nor dark) fits the half-lit corridors and the ambiguous outcome—but does not shift with pressure in the middle beats. The Keeper's confrontation and the memory-pouring scene maintain a consistent register without tonal deepening or break. The phrase charges the final image by linking resolve to dawn, but "dusky" as a descriptor is somewhat opaque and the repetition feels ornamental rather than purposeful modulation. Positive signals: early signal +0.6, closure linkage +0.9, coherence across beats +0.5, total ~+2.0. Frictions: no middle modulation (missing development gate) −0.4, ornamental repetition −0.4, opacity (dusky as a tone descriptor is abstract) −0.3, total ~−1.1. Base 3.0 + 2.0 − 1.1 = 3.9; adjust +1.5 for atmospheric coherence and final-image charge → 5.4, band-place → 5.9 for functional presence with moderate closure integration.</comment>
