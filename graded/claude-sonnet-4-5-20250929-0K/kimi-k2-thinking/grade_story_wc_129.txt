<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael's desire to belong is dramatized through repeated attempts (reed-woven child, marsh-grass sculptures), but his internal contradictions remain abstract rather than embodied in scene. The girl's teaching sequences show progression, yet Kael's final "understanding" arrives as declared epiphany ("Kael understood then") rather than earned through micro-choices under pressure. The ending grants grafting without visible cost—villagers' marsh-grass offerings and the arbor's acceptance feel given rather than fought for. Emotional states are often labeled ("luminescent ache") instead of shown through contradictory action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds through lyric repetition and pattern (arbor hums, shadows map lineage, reed sculptures multiply), culminating in the tag discovery and sculpture placement. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final image shows Kael "grafted," his reflection fused with shadows—but the cost is conceptual and asserted rather than felt on the page. Orientation is delayed: who Kael is and why he's at the crater emerges gradually across the first third, functional but soft. The search structure (dawn/dusk cycles, girl's teaching) provides accumulative pressure, though the solstice reveal feels timed by calendar rather than protagonist agency.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and obsidian arbor are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (humming frequencies, refracted light points, glass branches absorbing light). The arbor constrains Kael's understanding—its shadows are a map he cannot read—and the tag's location "where branch met earth" matters spatially. Marsh and crater rim supply recurring micro-settings that filter Kael's isolation. The crater's "shimmer" and solstice light pulse charge the discovery beat, meeting the 9+ gate of environment shaping the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—grafting onto community—is signaled early and sustained. Escalation under the Accumulative lens reads as increasing intimacy (girl teaches, villagers leave offerings), but no live option is foreclosed with visible cost. The tag discovery and sculpture placement feel like fulfillment rather than trade-off; Kael's loneliness "transforms" but prior gestures (the grieving mother's rejection) carry no tactical consequence at closure. One meaningful deepening occurs (villagers' trust shifts from silence to offerings), meeting minimal requirements, but the climax lacks felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme—belonging-in-difference—emerges through the tag's spiral etymology and Kael's realization about "dedication of one stranger to another's ghosts." The arbor's song and shadow-mapping create recurring images that reweight at the end. However, the penultimate paragraph states the theme overtly ("kinship wasn't blood or memory, but the dedication…"), flattening subtext. The final image (Kael reflected as kin) offers resonance, yet the "new language of belonging" line edges into summary. Complexity is present but occasionally spelled out rather than trusted to image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Voice is lyric and consistent, with purposeful compression ("a remembering," "dusk's last tag") that reads as pattern-taught rather than artifact. POV remains stable third-limited on Kael. The girl's traced-air speech and berry-dye fingers offer distinct texture. However, elevated diction occasionally drifts from Kael's likely lexicon ("dialects he couldn't parse," "citation of lineage") without clear POV anchoring. Perceptual signature—Kael notices reeds, weavings, shadows—is selective and character-specific. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer lyric sentences during observation and shorter beats during action. Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere or theme. However, figurative language saturates high-pressure beats without always clarifying: "luminescent ache," "beautiful pain of roots taking hold," "heavy and bright" stack metaphors that blur rather than sharpen. Minor template cadence appears in parallel constructions ("The girl taught… how each… how the silence…"). Paraphrase loop in the penultimate paragraph ("kinship wasn't blood… but the dedication… the willingness") restates the same idea across two sentences. No major loops, but density occasionally tips into overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The crystalline arbor, marsh-reed medium, and street-artist tag as ancient glyph offer fresh synthesis. The "belonging-in-difference" etymology and the arbor singing names between breaths are specific, non-obvious choices. However, the outsider-seeks-acceptance frame is familiar, and the arc (stranger earns trust through patient craftsmanship and shared quest) follows a recognizable template. Transformation occurs through the tag's conceptual twist and the arbor's sentience, lifting the piece above generic execution. Risk-taking in voice and structure (lyric compression, accumulative design) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, warranting within-band bonus consideration.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kael (marsh-reed sculptor) is introduced early and drives the search with the girl. His sculptures (reed-woven child, arbor effigy) are on-page actions across multiple beats. However, key decisions—beginning the search, placing the final sculpture—feel more like fulfillment of a quest structure than choices that narrow options. The girl initiates; Kael follows and learns. His agency in the climax is present but passive (understanding arrives; he places the sculpture as tribute). Two gates met (setup, payoff); middle development is responsive rather than decisive. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The glimmering obsidian arbor appears in setup (humming, casting shadows), development (absorbing light, teaching lineage through vibration), and payoff (pulsing with stars, singing Kael's name, reflecting him as kin). It constrains Kael's understanding (shadows he cannot read) and charges the final image (his reflection fused with kinship shadows). Handled across at least four beats; meaning evolves from barrier to bridge. All three gates met with strong closure linkage and causal pressure. Specificity high—glass branches, frequency song, root-earth juncture are irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Webs of kinship (core concept) shapes stakes from the opening: villagers move in "webs… spun from ancestral glass," each gesture a "citation of lineage Kael could not translate." The arbor's song marks lineage; the girl teaches Kael to "listen for kinship webs." The tag's meaning—"belonging-in-difference"—reweights the concept at closure. Present in setup, development (learning the arbor's song), and payoff (Kael grafted into the web). However, the concept operates more as thematic frame than tactical constraint; Kael's choices are not visibly altered by kinship mechanics on the page. Thematic integration strong; causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Boldly sympathetic" appears once as a label modifier ("Boldly sympathetic, he once touched a grieving mother's shoulder and offered a reed-woven child"), describing a single past action. The trait is not tested or constrained in the present timeline; the gesture happened before the story's main search begins. No visible cost on the page tied to this attribute—Kael's sympathy is backdrop rather than active lever. Setup gate met (mentioned early); development and payoff gates missing. Swappable with "earnest" or "well-meaning" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Dedicate" (action) anchors the central arc: "Kael would dedicate his final sculpture to the arbor only if he understood what Dusk had left behind." The dedication frames the search and pays off when "He placed his final sculpture at the arbor's base." Present in setup (conditional promise), development (days weaving community's stories into sculpture), and payoff (placement as grafting act). The sculpture's dedication is the hinge for Kael's acceptance. However, the act itself—placing reeds at the base—feels ceremonial rather than costly; the stakes are Kael's understanding, not the dedication mechanics. Strong setup and closure linkage; moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"A shared search for an elusive street artist's tag" (method) is signaled early by the girl ("Dusk's last tag nests in the arbor's roots") and structures the middle (dawn/dusk searches, learning the arbor's song). The tag is found and its meaning revealed at the climax, reweighting Kael's effort. All three gates met. However, the search mechanics are generic—walking, listening, waiting for the solstice—and the tag's appearance is timed by environmental cue (crater exhales light) rather than Kael's tactical choice. The spiral glyph's etymology matters, but the search method itself is swappable with any sustained quest. Functional across beats; specificity moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard at the crater's rim (setting) is established immediately and pressures Kael's isolation: "trees humming in frequencies beyond the murmur of lost languages," shadows mapping lineage he cannot read. The marsh supplies reeds for his sculptures; the arbor's root-earth juncture holds the tag. The crater's "shimmer" and solstice light enable the discovery. Setting constrains understanding (Kael cannot read the arbor) and supplies resources (marsh-grass, the tag's location). All three gates met with strong causal and closure linkage. Irreplaceable—no other setting could provide the glass arbor's lineage mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Beyond the murmur of lost languages" (timeframe) appears in the opening line as setting-tone rather than a live clock. Time markers exist (three seasons, days folded into weeks, eve of the solstice) but operate as background duration rather than tightening pressure. The solstice triggers the arbor's light pulse, a calendar convenience rather than a countdown shaped by Kael's choices. No tactics altered by time scarcity. Setup gate barely met (vague framing); development and payoff gates missing. Swappable with any seasonal or cyclical marker.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To graft oneself onto community" (motivation) is Kael's explicit desire, dramatized through failed gestures (the grieving mother), sustained effort (three seasons, sculpture work), and the search with the girl. The motivation structures all choices and is rewarded at closure when the girl says "Now you are grafted" and the arbor sings Kael's name. Friction between want (acceptance) and cost (loneliness, repeated rejection) is present but muted—the cost is more emotional backdrop than on-page trade-off. All three gates met; strong closure linkage. Felt cost at ending is asserted ("luminescent ache") rather than shown through a sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Luminescent ache" (tone) is stated once late ("Kael felt the luminescent ache of it, the beautiful pain of roots taking hold") and implied through images of "brittle and lovely" reeds, "ghost-artist's mark," and "sharp and shared" transformation. The tone—beauty laced with pain—coheres across the piece and modulates with pressure (isolation → teaching → acceptance). However, the exact phrase is label-only and arrives near the end rather than charging the final image through echo. The tone is consistent and purposeful but not indispensable; the story's emotional texture would hold without the label. Lyric reprise partially met; closure charge moderate.</comment>
