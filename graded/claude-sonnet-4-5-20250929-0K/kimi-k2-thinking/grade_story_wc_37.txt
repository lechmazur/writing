<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elias possesses the scattered-memory trait, but it functions primarily as atmosphere rather than driving concrete micro-choices under pressure. His actions—placing the mica window, singing—proceed without visible internal contradiction or embodied struggle between impulse and cost. The final sacrifice ("his own memory would scatter again") is declared rather than earned through on-page foreclosure of a live option with felt hesitation or trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers imagery (silver leaves, mica, woven dawns, singing) toward a final density shift. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration—dawn returns, realm rekindled—but cost is asserted in summary ("his own memory would scatter again") rather than shown in a concrete image or action that makes the loss undeniable on the page. Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines; no penalty applied. The second half largely restates the first without meaningful deepening, weakening closure charge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse is vividly established (obsidian glass, fermenting apples, copper scent, silver-leaved trees). The mica window constrains one key choice (placement against the wall reveals threads) and charges the ending when it shatters, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. Deduction for minor over-reliance on color adjectives (silver, amber, rose) that decorate without altering tactics mid-scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake—rekindle the dying realm—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elias sings and the threads brighten, but agency is passive: the greenhouse "responds," trees "tremble," dawn "grows" without Elias navigating a live trade-off or tactical adjustment. The cost (memory scattering) is told in future tense rather than paid in a present-tense foreclosure that narrows options on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme of bound release and collective memory emerges through concrete images (threads, songs, swaddling) and the recurring mica motif that shifts from promise to shattered vessel. The ending reweights prior material—dawn arrives, memory scatters—but the final line ("became a whisper in endless night") leans toward lyric assertion rather than a non-literal image that trusts the reader to complete the thematic question. No overt moralizing; slight deduction for "bound release" stated in exposition mid-text rather than left implicit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and consistent ("shards of the past," "tapestry of frayed threads"), creating a distinct lyric register. However, the voice lacks character-specific perceptual signature—descriptions read interchangeable across beats rather than filtered through Elias's particular way of noticing. Compression and poeticism are purposeful but do not vary under pressure; the same ornate cadence persists from opening to climax, flattening emotional modulation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Significant paraphrase loops: the opening fourteen paragraphs are largely restated in the final ten with synonym variation ("endless night" / "night-shrouded," "forgotten songs" / "Dawn-Weaver's Hymn," "mica window cracked" / "mica window lay in shards"). Template cadence runs appear ("He touched… He began… He sang… He felt…" in consecutive lines). Filter-verb stacks ("felt the realm's pulse," "recognized the melody") dull immediacy in peak beats. Stock metaphors ("tapestry of frayed threads," "jigsaw of stars") recur without fresh charge. Apply baseline −1.0 for loops and stems; escalate to −1.5 for artifact spread touching closure description.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Core synthesis—memory keeper in alchemical mirror-world orchard rekindling realm through song—is distinctive on paper but executed through familiar fantasy tropes (forgotten songs, dying realm, sacrificial amnesia) without fresh moral calculus or lived specificity. The mica window and woven-dawn imagery offer texture, but the emotional arc (lone wanderer restores world at personal cost) follows a well-worn template. No bold structural risk; the restatement structure dilutes rather than heightens the premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elias (scattered memory keeper) is present throughout and his nature frames the premise. He performs two key actions (places mica window, sings), meeting setup and development. However, his memory-keeper trait does not constrain a choice with visible cost; he acts despite amnesia rather than because of it. His final sacrifice is narrated in future summary ("would scatter again") rather than shown as a present foreclosure. Swappable with a generic "wounded hero" archetype; the scattered-memory detail does not alter tactics on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The mica window appears in setup (carried, described), drives the mid-beat action (placement reveals threads), and returns transformed at closure (shatters, lets in dawn). Handled in three distinct beats; its unique property (reveals woven dawns) is irreplaceable and causally active. Cost is tied to its destruction. Minor deduction: the mechanics of how pressing mica against glass "reveals threads" are asserted rather than grounded in world logic, slightly weakening specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Woven dawns" appears as atmospheric description ("threads of light, the woven dawns that once stitched the realm") and recurs in the climax ("woven dawns grew brighter"), but it functions as metaphor rather than a rule or constraint that shapes Elias's choices. Removing the exact phrase and substituting "threads of light" would not alter plot logic or tactics. Present and thematically consistent but ornamental; does not constrain options or enable a distinct action with cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Knits communities together" is label-claimed in exposition ("each thread a lifeline that could knit the scattered shards together," "communities once again bound together") but not dramatized through visible action or trade-off. No on-page community members appear; the trait is outcome-asserted rather than method-shown. Swappable with generic "restores the realm" phrasing. Present in setup and payoff but does not constrain a choice or impose cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Swaddle" recurs three times (forgotten melody "swaddled newborn worlds," song "wrapping the greenhouse in a gentle swaddle of sound," final "lullaby, a song of bound release"). The image is purposeful and specific but does not drive a major turn; Elias's singing could proceed without the swaddling metaphor with no change to causality. Present in setup and payoff; lyric resonance is intentional but the action itself (singing) is the causal driver, not the swaddling descriptor.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Forgotten songs" appears in setup ("method lay in forgotten songs"), middle beat (Elias sings "the forgotten melody"), and climax ("Dawn-Weaver's Hymn"). The method shapes Elias's central action and the mechanics matter: singing triggers the trees' response and threads' brightening. Cost is tied to each note pulling memory away. Minor deduction: the method is signaled early but the specific mechanism (how song rekindled dawn) remains atmospheric assertion rather than rule-grounded logic the reader can trace.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The alchemical orchard greenhouse is anchored early with vivid sensory detail (obsidian glass, fermenting apples, copper, silver-leaved trees) and its shrouded-in-endless-night condition frames the dominant stake. The greenhouse itself is described as "a living alchemist, transmuting sorrow into fruit," giving it unique world logic. It constrains Elias's movements (rows of trees, greenhouse wall for mica placement) and its transformation (trees regain sheen, perpetual dawn) is the visible closure outcome. Present across all three gates with causal pressure and irreplaceable specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Mirror world" appears in setup and is restated mid-text ("The mirror world, a reflection of the waking realm, had been locked in twilight for centuries"). It provides context but does not impose time pressure or alter tactics; no ticking clock or urgency tied to the mirror-world frame. The timeframe is atmospheric setting rather than constraint. Present but ornamental; easily swappable with "twilight realm" or similar phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"To rekindle a dying realm" is stated early ("to rekindle the dying realm before its last ember faded") and drives the dominant stake. Elias's actions (placing mica, singing) serve this goal, and the ending shows the realm rekindled ("the orchard now basked in a gentle, perpetual dawn"). However, the motivation is not dramatized through conflicting wants or visible hesitation; Elias proceeds without friction between desire and cost until the ending summary. The goal is clear but lacks on-page internal conflict or trade-off moment where the cost is weighed.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Bound release" is explicitly named in the final lullaby phrase ("a song of bound release") and the ending enacts the concept (realm freed, Elias's memory bound/released). Tone is elegiac and consistent throughout, modulating slightly from melancholic wandering to bittersweet resolution. However, the tone remains uniform in diction and rhythm across all beats without heightening under pressure; the climax reads at the same lyric register as the opening. The concept charges the ending thematically but does not modulate syntactically or texturally to heighten the final image.</comment>
