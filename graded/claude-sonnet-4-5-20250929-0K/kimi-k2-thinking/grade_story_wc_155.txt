<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation to rediscover joy is stated but not dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. Her actions flow in a single emotional direction—trembling hands, breath catching, heart swelling—without internal friction or competing fears that would complicate the choice to display the work. The final decision feels inevitable rather than earned by struggle, and the cost of her choices (time, risk, vulnerability) remains abstract. Interiority relies on stock phrasing ("her heart swelling," "breath caught") rather than character-particular perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes orientation (Lyra, warehouse, orchard district) within the first 120 words and follows an accumulative/textural lens: fog → discovery → re-creation → display → shared wonder. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Lyra steps back at dawn knowing "the fog would return, but now it would carry the scent of blossoms, not decay." The cost is implied rather than visible—no path is foreclosed on the page, no tactical choice altered. The final image reweights the premise, but the emotional price remains diffuse across dozens of lines rather than crystallized in a single beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The orchard district (fog, skeletal apple trees, lichen glow) is vividly rendered and constrains Lyra's search; the fresco fragment functions as a discovery object that charges her re-creation. The light-painting tools and portable screen are handled on the page and enable the climactic display. However, spatial choreography during the display setup is vague (how she "erected" the screen, where spectators stood relative to the mural), and the fog's convenient thinning at the climax reads as symbolic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—rediscovering lost joy—is signaled early and tightens once: Lyra finds the fresco, feels a pulse of joy, and decides to display the work. No reversal or meaningful opposition intervenes; the display succeeds without complication, and spectators emerge with "eyes wide with wonder" in a frictionless escalation. The cost of her effort (physical toll, vulnerability, risk of failure) is never tested on the page. The accumulative lens allows a single deepening, but the lack of any live obstacle or trade-off limits pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme—resilience, memory as living pulse, light piercing decay—emerges from the orchard's restoration and the shared breath of spectators. The final image ("the fog would return, but now it would carry the scent of blossoms") reweights the premise without stating a moral. However, the piece tilts toward abstraction in the final third: "fold of a daydream," "threads in a larger tapestry," "pensive mirth" become repeated labels rather than concrete discoveries. The closing two paragraphs summarize the thematic import rather than trusting the display beat to resonate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The third-person limited POV remains stable, with perceptual filters (fog, light, tactile handling of tools) reflecting Lyra's artistic focus. Diction is elevated but consistent: "swirled," "pulsed," "lattice of fiber-optic strands." Two patterns weaken voice: recycled sentence openings ("She unrolled," "She projected," "She danced," "She realized," "She vowed," "She packed," "She walked") create template cadence across the middle third, and figurative language ("mercury," "skeletal hands," "bridge between past and present") appears in most sentences without building a taught pattern. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops appear across adjacent lines: "She felt the lost joy returning, not as a memory, but as a living pulse" followed two lines later by "her heart swelling too, as the lost joy she sought became a shared breath." Template cadence dominates the middle: ten consecutive sentences begin with "She [verb]" or "Lyra [verb]," flattening rhythm during the re-creation sequence. Stock metaphors (fog "pooled like mercury," trees "rose like skeletal hands") and therapy-adjacent phrasing ("pensive mirth," "fold of a daydream") dilute specificity. Information density is moderate; many lines do advance action, but the final five paragraphs recapitulate closure effects already delivered.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—artist uses light-painting and film to revive a lost fresco and rediscover joy—combines familiar elements (urban decay, forgotten beauty, creative renewal) without a sharp angle. The orchard district and light-painting tools add sensory texture, but the emotional arc (lost → found → shared) follows a predictable trajectory without complication or moral friction. The "knowledge-network" and "photon watercolor" gestures toward speculative texture but remain ornamental. The piece commits to its premise but does not transform or subvert it; removing the light-painting specifics and replacing them with traditional muralism would leave the emotional logic unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lyra is named in the first line and drives every beat: she paints, descends, spots the fresco, captures it with the camera, projects, displays, and watches the spectators. She makes two decisions—to re-create the fresco and to display it publicly—but neither choice faces opposition or cost on the page. Observation and execution dominate; the internal conflict (rediscovering joy) is resolved without a visible trade-off. Present across all three gates (setup, middle choice, ending observation) but replaceable with any artist-seeker archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The fresco fragment is discovered in the orchard hollow, photographed with the vintage camera, projected onto the screen, and traced with light-painting tools—four distinct touches across the middle third. It seeds Lyra's joy ("breath caught") and reappears in the display that charges the ending. However, the fragment itself does not constrain or enable a choice; it is a catalyst object rather than a source of friction. Strong setup and payoff; moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Exposed film is packed as a talisman, loaded into the camera, and developed for projection. It functions as a method (bridge between past and present) but does not alter tactics or stakes; any recording medium would serve the same role. The concept is present in three beats but ornamental—film's specific properties (grain, halide chemistry, exposure risk) do not shape Lyra's choices or charge the closure. Functional but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Paints with light" is signaled in the opening (gear that paints with light) and executed in the re-creation beat ("light-painting tools," "spraying photons like watercolor"). The attribute enables the display but imposes no visible constraint or cost—no mention of power limits, tool failure, or technical difficulty. The trait is demonstrated on the page but does not force a trade-off. Present in setup and middle; absent from closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The display is decided ("Lyra decided to display"), erected (temporary screen, fiber-optic lattice), and witnessed by spectators whose wonder validates Lyra's rediscovery of joy. It anchors the ending but does not redefine options—no reversal or complication arises from the act. The display could be replaced with a private viewing or installation without altering the emotional resolution. Present in all three gates but causally passive at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The knowledge-network tablet appears once in the discovery beat, connects to archives, and pulses again during the display to "send a ripple of inspiration to others." It provides backstory exposition (festival three hundred years past) but does not constrain or enable a choice. The network's mechanics are vague (how it connects through fog, who watches the remote feeds) and its presence is ornamental. Setup present; no middle development; cameo at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ruined orchard district (fog, twisted apple trees, crumbling walls, lichen glow) frames every beat and supplies the fresco fragment that sparks Lyra's re-creation. The fog pressures visibility and isolates the search; the hollow pools mercury-thick fog, heightening discovery. The setting constrains access (each step a negotiation) and charges the ending image ("fog would return... carry the scent of blossoms"). Present in all three gates; environment shapes tactics and final meaning.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Within the fold of a daydream" is mentioned in the resolution ("In the fold of a daydream, she had found the key") but never dramatized as a temporal or experiential constraint. The narrative progresses in linear time (descent → discovery → re-creation → display → dawn) with no indication that events occur inside a mental frame or that time behaves non-causally. The phrase functions as a metaphor for creative immersion, not a story-shaping timeframe. Ornamental; no setup or development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"To rediscover lost joy" is stated in the opening ("needed something that could pierce the fog... inside her") and resolved in the ending ("the lost joy she sought became a shared breath"). The motivation drives the descent and display decisions but is never conflicted—no fear of failure, no cost of vulnerability, no friction between joy and another want. Desire is told and fulfilled rather than tested. Present in all three gates but dramatized weakly; cost absent.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Pensive mirth" is named twice (closing lines of the discovery beat and the final paragraph) but not modulated through the narrative. The tone remains reverent and earnest throughout—trembling hands, breath catching, heart swelling—without the playful or ironic inflection "mirth" implies. Pensiveness dominates; mirth is declared rather than embodied in rhythm, image, or choice. The tone does not shift under pressure or charge the closure meaningfully. Label-only integration.</comment>
