<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elias is labeled "eminently peculiar" and shown speaking to gears, but interiority remains abstract philosophical musing without embodied contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The quest "to understand what clocks really measure" is told rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses; he muses, counts, and withdraws the key with no visible cost or foreclosed path. Emotional states are asserted ("felt the weight," "realized") without embodied sensation or credible struggle. The final "understanding" arrives as epiphany without prior causality earning it.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who and where anchor early, but when remains vague (night/sunset/tomorrow blur without a legible timeline); apply −0.3. The piece attempts Accumulative/Textural design with recurring "razor edges" and "counting backwards," but no on-page decisive change or resonant reconfiguration occurs—Elias turns the key, has a realization, withdraws it, and walks away with no visible cost or altered stakes. The ending asserts closure ("his quest had come full circle") without an image that reweights prior material. Cost proof test fails: no exact sentence shows a foreclosed path or felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The fjord, cliff, and hydraulic clock chamber are anchored early with sensory detail ("still as glass," water dripping). The mantle clock key returns in the final paragraphs and is handled across beats, lending some micro-setting function. However, environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; description remains atmospheric postcard rather than pressure-shaping. The 9+ gate (environment/tool constrains choice or charges final image) is not met; cap at 8.8 even if vivid.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding what clocks measure—is signaled early but never tested by a concrete choice or reversal. Elias performs a ritual (turn key, count backwards, receive insight) without opposition, cost, or narrowed options. No meaningful tightening or deepening occurs; the hydraulic clock's behavior and Elias's actions proceed in a single line. Agency is observation, not decision; the ending claims understanding without visible trade-off or foreclosed alternative. Band guardrails for 8.0+ (tightening that forecloses an option) are unmet.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme—time as edges, silence, and what remains—is stated repeatedly in abstract philosophizing rather than emerging from concrete events. "Razor edges" recurs as metaphor without constraining choice or accumulating pressure; it ornaments rather than drives. The final answer ("time is the space between two heartbeats") is delivered as epiphany-label, not earned through specific struggle. Thematic echo penalty: the final paragraphs articulate thesis in prompt-like language without scene pressure; apply −0.6.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is generic contemplative rather than character-specific; diction ("eminently peculiar," "the space between being and not being") tilts abstract-philosophical without embodied texture. Sentence stems recur ("He counted," "Elias squinted," "The razor edges") creating mild template cadence. Voice lacks distinct rhythm or lexical fingerprint; the prose could belong to any meditative narrator. No purposeful distance shift or strong idiom emerges.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "razor edges" appears in seven lines with minimal functional variation; "counting backwards" recurs in summary rather than distinct beats; "fjord quiet" and "horizon measurement station" loop without new information. Template cadence: runs of "He [verb]" and "The [noun]" openings across adjacent sentences; apply −0.6. Figurative density ("razor edges," "pool of glass," "fabric of the present") clusters without pattern-teaching or payoff; apply −0.4 for overwriting. Filter-verb stacks ("felt," "realized," "wondered," "imagined") dull immediacy in peak beats; add −0.3. Artifacts touch the closure beat (final paragraph repeats key/edges/silence); apply disallow-9+ globally and cap high-band at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>The premise—philosophical clock shepherd seeks meaning through ritual—reads as stock mystical-quest template without transformation. "Razor edges" and "counting backwards" are repeated motifs but remain ornamental metaphors rather than specific, lived stakes. The emotional arc (quest → epiphany → acceptance) is generic; plot and theme would work unchanged with different names and setting (transformation test fails). No bold risk heightens coherence; the piece hedges into abstract middle ground. Derivative premise guardrail: apply −0.8.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Elias is present throughout and performs the key action (turning the key, counting backwards), but his choices do not create turns—he executes a single ritual without opposition or cost. Observation without decision trends low per the rubric; the final "understanding" is epiphany, not a choice that alters tactics. Setup and payoff gates met; middle development (constraining choice) absent. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle gate; swappability and summary-only use lower further within band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The mantle clock key appears in paragraph 4, is handled in the turning ritual (paragraphs 15–21, 28), and returns in the final beats (35, 38, 39). Three distinct beats with causal involvement: it unlocks, turns the clock's hands, and "pulses with its own quiet rhythm" at closure. However, its specific properties (brass worn smooth, teeth as razor edges) do not constrain a choice or alter tactics; any key would serve. Setup, development, payoff gates met; swappability and ornamental description lower the score within band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Razor edges" recurs in thirteen paragraphs as metaphor (key teeth, horizon, clock hands, existence) but never shapes stakes or alters tactics on the page. It ornaments theme without constraining choice or enabling action. Present throughout (setup, middle, payoff) but purely decorative; cap at 4.6, then subtract for ornamental use and thematic-echo pattern.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Eminently peculiar" is asserted in paragraph 3 ("spoke to the gears as if they were old friends") but the trait does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. It is label-only; Elias's behavior (climbing stairs, turning key, counting) could belong to any shepherd. No visible trade-off or friction tied to peculiarity. Label-only mention; minimal integration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Squint" appears in paragraphs 9, 17, 33 at different moments (horizon, key engraving, fading light). Each mention adds observational detail but does not create a turn or redefine options; easily swappable with "looked closely" or "peered." Setup and payoff present; middle beat is observational. Swappability and lack of causal pressure lower score within band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Counting backwards" is signaled early (paragraph 11), mechanics matter in the ritual (paragraphs 11, 18, 20, 25), and it returns in the final beat (paragraph 40: "counting backwards from ten"). The method shapes the protagonist's attempt (three beats) and appears in closure. However, the mechanics remain abstract meditation rather than altering tactics under pressure. Setup, development, payoff met; causal pressure weak; closure linkage present but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The horizon measurement station is named in paragraphs 1, 30, 32, 37, anchoring setting early and at closure. It provides the cliff and clock chamber but does not pressure choices or supply resources that affect outcome; Elias could perform his ritual anywhere. Setup and payoff present; middle development (constraining choice) absent. Cap at 4.6; postcard description and swappability lower further.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"After blowing the whistle" anchors the opening (paragraph 2) and recurs conceptually in the final beats (paragraph 36: "Tomorrow he would blow the whistle again"). Time does not tighten decisions or tactics; the ritual unfolds without urgency or live clock pressure. Setup and payoff gates met; middle development (time-driven choice) absent. Vague tracking lowers score within band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.0</grade><comment>"To understand what clocks really measure" is stated explicitly (paragraph 7), drives the ritual (paragraphs 11–28), and is claimed as achieved at closure (paragraphs 27, 35, 36). Three beats; setup, development, payoff met. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized in conflicting choices; no friction between wants and costs emerges on the page. Summary-only and lack of embodied conflict lower score within band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>"Fjord quiet" appears in paragraphs 1, 10, 22, 30, 35, anchoring tone early and at closure. Tone remains static contemplative meditation throughout; no modulation with pressure or cadence shift reweights the stake. The final image invokes the quiet but does not charge it with new cost. Setup and payoff present; middle coherence maintained; single static mood trends mid-low per rubric.</comment>
