<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Alex's interiority is largely observational and metaphorical rather than embodied under pressure; phrases like "walls humming with stories" and "mortar whispered in a dialect of patience" remain poetic without concrete stakes testing character choice. Mrs. Voss is realized more vividly through gesture ("patiently nimble," jade comb, bergamot tea) but her motivation—preserving the building's memory—is stated rather than tested by a competing cost. The final act (pressing the seal) feels assigned rather than earned by prior contradiction or micro-choice that forecloses a live option. Agency at closure reads more as ritual completion than a character-driven trade-off with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece infers an Accumulative/Textural lens: weekly sessions layer images (tea, seal, rooftop, graffiti) toward a climactic ritual. Orientation anchors (Murray Building, Tuesday, November, Alex knocking on 7B) arrive clearly. The closure unit—Alex pressing the seal into the basement wall—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Alex becomes scribe, inheriting Mrs. Voss's custodianship), but the cost is oblique: no on-page sentence shows what Alex forfeits, risks, or loses by taking this role. The final paragraph's recursion (new borrowers, Mrs. Voss refilling the kettle, "agreed-upon lies" stamped again) suggests cyclical endurance, yet the ending feels more thematic echo than a decisive tightening with felt price, capping the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setting detail is vivid and selective: bergamot and old paper in 7B, antique desk seal on the windowsill, rooftop tomatoes in salvaged chimney pots, sealed basement with nurses' graffiti. The western corner's dusk sigh, water damage as lament, stairwell asymmetry as question mark all filter through Alex's architectural fascination. The seal—handled twice (windowsill, pressed into plaster)—and the basement wall constrain the final choice, lifting the score. Minor drift: the rooftop meteor shower, while atmospheric, does not alter tactics; it times the ritual rather than pressuring it, keeping the category shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—learning the building's language and preserving its hidden history against renovation—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through weekly sessions, Mrs. Voss's warning ("They're planning to renovate"), and the meteor shower urgency. The tightening is atmospheric rather than causal: no on-page reversal narrows Alex's options or forces a trade-off; the renovation threat is told, not dramatized with a live choice under pressure. The seal-pressing ritual feels more like climactic illustration than a decision that forecloses a path with visible cost, landing the score in mid-band under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—memory, translation, the ethics of preservation versus erasure—emerges organically from the seal's imprint, the "agreed-upon lies" motif, and the building's palimpsest history (school, TB ward, apartments). The final image (Alex as scribe, "patiently nimble grammar of mortar and memory") reweights prior material without overt moralizing. The "dead language tutor" teaching silence-as-language is resonant. Weakness: "agreed-upon lies" is named repeatedly without sufficient dramatized friction; the nurses' graffiti and basement wall appear late, reducing their thematic charge. The recursion (new borrowers) risks neat closure but stays within earned ambiguity, lifting the score into the 7s.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filters setting through Alex's architectural idiom ("fire escapes conjugate verbs," "water damage as lament"). Diction is consistently elevated and metaphor-dense ("lithographer's chisel," "manuscript of burning letters"), fitting the lyric Accumulative mode. Dialogue is minimal but purposeful: Mrs. Voss's lines ("Borrowing sugar becomes tea becomes truth") carry subtext and thematic weight. Weakness: the metaphorical register flattens under emotional pressure (meteor shower, basement ritual) rather than tightening; Alex's internal voice remains observational throughout, without modulation that would signal stance shift or cost. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks, but the uniform lyricism across all beats prevents 8+ entry.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled with varied sentence openings and purposeful figurative language ("well-worn manuscript page," "eyes brightened like struck flint," "meteors fell like periods"). Information density is high; nearly every line advances setting or theme. Weaknesses: paraphrase loops appear ("dead languages were my trade" / "dead language tutor"); "patiently nimble" recurs as an unvaried phrase across multiple beats without reweighting; template cadence in the weekly-session summary ("Mrs. Voss would pour... interrogate... respond") and minor synonym churn ("bergamot tea" / "Earl Grey" toggle without purpose). The final paragraph's recursion risks loop but stays within thematic intent. Deduct −0.6 for loops and template stems, capping shy of 7.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The dead-language tutor teaching building-as-text is a fresh synthesis; the antique desk seal as dictionary and authenticating stamp offers specificity. The transformation from "borrowing sugar" to custodianship of hidden history feels earned in hindsight. Weaknesses: the "mysterious mentor initiates younger seeker into secret knowledge" frame is template-familiar; the meteor shower as climactic timer is a stock lyric device; "agreed-upon lies" as a concept-phrase risks abstraction without sufficient dramatic friction. The piece personalizes through bergamot, jade comb, and graffiti particulars, lifting it above generic execution but not into high originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mrs. Voss (dead language tutor) appears early (paragraph 4), teaches Alex weekly, warns of renovation, instructs the seal-pressing ritual, and stands behind Alex at closure. Her choice to hand over the seal and her role as "a kind of seal, preserving the building's authentic grammar" drive the final beat. She shapes at least three distinct beats (initial meeting, rooftop sessions, final instruction) and participates in closure, meeting all three gates with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The antique desk seal appears early (paragraph 10, "on the windowsill"), is described with function ("stamp each blueprint with a promise"), becomes "their dictionary" (paragraph 14), is handed to Alex with instruction (paragraph 20), and is pressed into plaster at closure (paragraph 21), making the building "recognize you as its scribe." The seal is handled twice, shapes the final image, and its unique property (bearing the building's original floor plan, architect's promise) is irreplaceable. All three gates met with strong closure linkage and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Agreed-upon lies" is named early (paragraph 13, "hidden the original foundation behind agreed-upon lies"), recurs (paragraph 16, "agreed-upon lies were crumbling"), and Alex chips away at them in the basement (paragraph 22). The concept frames the central tension (renovation erasing truth vs. preservation) and the seal-pressing ritual counters the lies by exposing the nurses' graffiti. Setup, development, and closure participation are present, but the concept remains more thematic label than a lived choice-constraint; Alex never dramatizes a trade-off between complicity and exposure with visible cost. Lyric reprise with mid-band causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Patiently nimble" is applied to Mrs. Voss three times (paragraphs 4, 11, 24) but functions as a repeated descriptive label rather than a trait that constrains or enables action with cost. The trait does not visibly alter Mrs. Voss's choices or impose a trade-off; it describes her manner (navigating doorway, moving among planters, grammar of memory) without demonstrating how patience or nimbleness forecloses an option or shapes the outcome. Setup present, development and closure participation absent; swappable with "graceful" or "deliberate."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Interrogate" appears in paragraph 11 ("interrogate the building's limestone grammar") and recurs in the final paragraph ("interrogation of what we choose to remember"). The action frames the weekly sessions and thematic question but does not itself create a turn; the sessions accumulate knowledge rather than narrow options. The seal-pressing and basement exposure are the decisive acts; "interrogate" could be replaced with "study" or "decode" without altering structure. Present in setup and thematic closure, but mid-development causal pressure is weak.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Borrowing sugar" initiates contact (paragraph 3), Mrs. Voss declares "Borrowing sugar becomes tea becomes truth" (paragraph 9), "that Saturday marked the first of many sessions" (paragraph 9), weekly sessions structure the middle (paragraphs 10–15), and the final paragraph shows the cycle continuing ("someone new knocked on 7B, asking to borrow sugar"). The method is signaled early, shapes the accumulative middle beats (tea sessions as tutorial), and is recursively present at closure. All three gates met; the method's mechanics (incremental trust-building, ritual repetition) matter to the ending's custodianship transfer.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The rooftop garden appears in paragraph 11 (tomatoes, morning glories, water tower) and the meteor shower in paragraphs 18–21. The garden provides a teaching space (Mrs. Voss tracing constellations, explaining punctuation marks of the sky) and the meteor shower times the urgency ("Perseid display... the last of the bergamot tea"). However, neither element constrains Alex's choice; the ritual could occur without them. The garden is scenic; the meteor shower is atmospheric backdrop. Setup and middle presence confirmed, but closure participation is ornamental (meteors as metaphor, not pressure), capping mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Alex's desire "to learn the language of old buildings" is dramatized early (paragraph 7, "fascination with the building's secrets"), sustained through weekly sessions asking questions (paragraph 12, "Why does the western corner sigh at dusk?"), and culminates in Alex becoming the building's scribe (paragraph 23, "the building's story continued in Alex's bones"). The motivation shapes tactics (seeking Mrs. Voss, attending sessions, pressing the seal) and is tested by the renovation threat. Setup, development, and closure participation present; friction between curiosity and the cost of custodianship is implied but not dramatized as a competing desire with visible trade-off, capping high-7s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Mysterious familiarity" is coherent: the building hums with knowable-but-hidden stories, Mrs. Voss is simultaneously mentor and enigma, the desk seal bears a legible floor plan yet stamps secrets. Tone modulates from curious (early knocking, tea invitations) to elegiac (renovation threat, final ritual) without breaking. The final recursion (new borrowers, Mrs. Voss smiling, seal ready) charges the ending with cyclical inevitability. Weakness: tone remains uniform across emotional beats (no sharp shift under urgency at the meteor shower), and "mysterious familiarity" is more descriptor than felt pressure that alters Alex's stance. Coherent but not decisive in the final image.</comment>
