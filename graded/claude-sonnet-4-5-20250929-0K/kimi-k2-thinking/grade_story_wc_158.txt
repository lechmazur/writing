<question>1</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The poet remains an abstraction across centuries with no embodied contradictions or micro-choices under pressure. Motivation is declared ("photosynthesize pain into beauty") but never dramatized through conflicting impulses or visible cost. The insomniac trait is mentioned yet never constrains a choice or degrades perception. The merfolk shift from rage to peace via passive listening without on-page decision or friction, reducing agency to spectacle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode but lacks a coherent closure unit with cost. The blossom armistice "holds" across repetitive assertions without a decisive tightening or reweighting that forecloses a path. Orientation is delayed—who, where, when remain vague past 120 words (−0.4). The ending loops prior material ("shyly unstoppable," "reef-shadow joy") without a final image that reconfigures stakes or meaning with felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The gargantuan shell is vivid and anchors the setting early, but it functions mainly as backdrop rather than constraining choice. The galaxy postcard and pearl of verse ensconce micro-setting objects that charge the final beat slightly. Sensory detail ("phosphorescence," "kelp in a calm tide") is selective and POV-filtered. The setting does not alter tactics or impose resource limits during key turns, capping higher-band entry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—forging a blossom armistice—is signaled early but never tightened through on-page reversal or cost. The merfolk's rage "softens" via passive listening without a decision that narrows options. The poet's vow to continue is renewal rather than escalation. No visible trade-off, forfeiture, or price alters tactics; coincidence (the young mermaid's pearl) rewards without struggle. Accumulative designs require at least one meaningful deepening with cost; this piece loops without pressure increase.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme ("pain into beauty") is stated rather than emergent from specific events. The final paragraph explicitly moralizes: "turned the pain of ages into blossoms," which is Thematic Echo (−0.6). The blossom/peace motif recurs but does not constrain choice or charge the closure with non-literal resonance. Subtext is thin; the galaxy postcard's promise is decoded on-page rather than layered. The ending offers no counter-reading or ambiguity, resolving into a tidy testament.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Third-person narration maintains consistent distance and a distinct lyric texture ("fossilized moon," "spire of shell"). Perceptual signature is present but static across centuries without degradation under stress. Psychic distance does not modulate with pressure. Repetitive syntactic patterns ("She sang of," "She knew," "She had") create template cadence (−0.5). Diction occasionally elevates beyond the POV's immediate stress ("photosynthesis of sorrow") in peak moments without dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "blossom armistice" appears nine times with synonym churn ("petal peace," "treaty," "living armistice"); "shyly unstoppable" recurs four times; "half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind" is repeated verbatim three times (−1.0). Template cadence runs in the final third: "For as long as… And so… And the…" (−0.5). Stock metaphors ("quiet tempest," "thread spun from moonlight") cluster without fresh synthesis. Figurative density is high but coherence is mixed ("photosynthesize pain" is biologized metaphor strain). Total artifact penalty: −1.5, capping at 7.0 even if other elements were clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Core premise—underwater poet singing peace—leans on familiar tropes (mermaid wars, song-magic, immortal longing) without specific transformation. The galaxy postcard and "photosynthesize pain" offer surface novelty but remain ornamental. Emotional arc and plot would function unchanged with different names and setting (transformation test fail). The ending is symmetric and safe, granting resolution without risk or counter-reading. No bold structural or perspectival choice elevates the material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Present throughout; mentioned in opening and ending beats. No on-page choice or decision that alters tactics; observation and declaration dominate. Insomnia label appears but never constrains perception or action. Late arrivals (mermaid) drive the pearl offering, not the poet's agency. Ornamental presence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Introduced early (paragraph 3) and returns in final third when poet traces constellations and whispers to it. Two distinct beats: initial framing and late reprise. Does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic; remains static description. The postcard's promise motivates interpretation but does not shift meaning at closure. Functional seed → reprise without middle development (cap 4.6).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Signaled early (paragraph 5) and named nine times, shaping the dominant stake. The armistice is the goal, tested when merfolk lay down spears and bloom spreads. It constrains the poet's ongoing vow and charges the final image ("armistice held"). Present in setup, middle enactment, and closure. Swappability moderate; "peace treaty" or "ceasefire" would function similarly. Causal role in one major beat (merfolk gathering) and closure charge lift it to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Repeated four times as a label ("shyly unstoppable," "quiet tempest"). Does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost. No dramatized tradeoff where shyness limits reach or unstoppability forces sacrifice. Mentioned in closure paragraph but ornamentally. Label-only trait (−0.3).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Introduced early (paragraph 8) and recurs across three beats: nightly verse pearl placement, the young mermaid's pearl gift, and final vow to continue ensconcing. The act of ensconcing structures the poet's method and charges the closure ("ensconcing hope in each verse"). Causal linkage to lullabies spreading and armistice holding. Specificity moderate; "embed" or "hide" would function but lose some texture. Three beats + closure linkage + early setup meet all gates; causal pressure and cost visible in the ongoing vow.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Introduced paragraph 9 and repeated verbatim three times. The method is signaled and its mechanics (melodies softening rage) matter to the merfolk's shift. Shapes one key turn (merfolk laying down spears). Present in setup (paragraph 9), development (paragraph 10–11), and closure (final paragraphs reference lullabies drifting). Swappability moderate; "songs on the tide" would function. Early signal + one causal beat + closure mention → eligible ~6.0; repetition without deepening and synonym strain lower slightly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Introduced opening line and anchors all action. The shell's spiral chambers amplify the verse pearls (paragraph 8), and the poet watches from "her spire of shell" (paragraph 17). The cathedral image at closure ("gargantuan shell, now a cathedral of peace") charges the final beat. Setting enables the ensconcing action and provides the resonant final image. Early setup + middle use (amplification) + closure charge meet all gates. Causal pressure modest (amplification matters but does not narrow options); closure linkage strong. Specificity high ("spiral chambers," "cathedral").</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Mentioned six times ("centuries of longing"). Does not tighten decisions or impose a live clock; serves as atmosphere rather than tactical constraint. No mid-scene urgency or deadline that alters moves. Present in setup and closure but functions as backdrop. Swappable with "ages" or "eons." Summary-only (−0.3); no dramatized time pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Stated explicitly paragraph 6 and echoed at closure ("photosynthesis of sorrow"). Desire is declared rather than dramatized through conflicting choices. No visible friction between the goal and cost on the page; the poet's sleeplessness is mentioned but not shown to impede or complicate the photosynthesize metaphor. Present in setup and closure; missing middle dramatization (cap 3.4 waived by closure mention, but lack of friction caps higher scoring). Told motivation without embodied tension.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Introduced paragraph 18 and repeated in final paragraphs. Tone is coherent (lyric, elegiac, hopeful-yet-shadowed) and modulates slightly when the armistice blooms. The phrase "reef-shadow joy" charges the closure image twice. Present in late-middle and closure; missing early setup (late first appearance −0.3). Tone supports the final reconfiguration. One key beat (reef-shadow joy deepening) + closure charge → eligible ~6.0; late signal and static application through most of the piece lower slightly.</comment>
