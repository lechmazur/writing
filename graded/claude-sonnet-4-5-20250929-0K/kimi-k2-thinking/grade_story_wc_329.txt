<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation is clearly declared but her interior life relies heavily on poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. The decision to sync her heart to the locust shell's pattern feels more symbolic than psychologically earned—no genuine internal conflict between self-preservation and sacrifice is dramatized. Her grandmother's hardening is mentioned but never pressures a present choice. The final transformation lacks visceral cost; she "stands" and "smiles" with an "aching chest," but the price of becoming a bridge is asserted rather than felt through contradictory impulses or physical collapse.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story infers an Accumulative/Textural lens: pattern-building through orchard imagery, locust shell, and heart-rhythm recursion. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive clearly in the opening paragraphs. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elara becomes a bridge, the statues awaken, and tomorrow they will signal beyond the orchard. However, the cost at closure is declared ("chest aching with new rhythm") rather than shown through a concrete forfeiture or visible price—she gains agency and community without dramatized loss. The causality of the locust shell's arrival ("a breeze that shouldn't exist") and its microscopic filigree feel convenient rather than seeded. One meaningful tightening occurs (the counter-pulse from the clocktower), but escalation stalls when she simply "lets her heart fall" and succeeds without a legible trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The enchanted orchard and sky-bridge are vividly anchored with sensory detail: ash falling, iron orchard, clockwork gears, granite eyes. The locust shell functions as micro-setting, constraining Elara's final choice by providing the rhythm pattern. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout, and the orchard's magical rules are consistent. Entering the high band requires that setting constrain a choice or charge the final image; the locust shell does both, and the orchard's "roots deep in old magic" surge through the bridge at closure, reweighting the stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reawakening beauty in a mechanical world—is signaled early and sustained. One clear tightening occurs when the clocktower sends a counter-pulse, raising the cost of Elara's attempt. However, the escalation lacks a visible trade-off: she "felt she'd become statue herself" but then simply transitions to becoming a bridge without forfeiting anything concrete. The statues' awakening and the orchard's restoration feel like rewards without on-page sacrifice—no stamina, voice, or autonomy is visibly lost. Coincidence resolves key pressure: the locust shell floats in "on a breeze that shouldn't exist" rather than being earned by prior action.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—beauty as rhythm to risk, not memory to preserve—emerges through the locust shell and heart-rhythm pattern rather than exposition. The gap between knowing and understanding recurs purposefully, shifting meaning from a descriptor to a lived experience at closure. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary: "beauty was not memory to preserve but rhythm to risk" states the insight rather than letting the image speak. The ending withholds a non-literal answer; the line "she simply breathed, letting her heart's resonantly soft beat speak language of breaking free" is specific but bordered by overt interpretation. Subtext operates in the locust shell and mechanical hearts, but epiphany arrives suddenly rather than accumulating from prior contradiction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Elara; no head-hopping. Voice carries a lyric, elevated register: "resonantly soft cry," "gap between knowing and understanding," "tarnished wonder." This diction is consistent and purposeful, creating a fable-like texture. However, under peak stress (the counter-pulse beat), the syntax does not compress or fragment—Elara's interiority remains equally ornate ("terrible moment," "surge upward through sky-bridge's cables"), flattening the pressure gradient. Perceptual signature is present but generic: she "watches," "feels," "realizes" in broad strokes rather than idiosyncratic noticing. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and often beautiful ("dying ember," "crystalline moment between heartbeat and thought"), but it appears in nearly every sentence, including peak beats, without pattern-teaching or payoff—this triggers the Overwriting Check (−0.5 in Q7). Paraphrase loops are present: "She played the locust's rhythm. / …She played it again" restates without adding pressure (−0.2). Mixed metaphors appear: "uprooted from their own bodies" versus "planted in dangerous soil of hope" uses the same vehicle in contradictory ways (−0.4). The phrase "resonantly soft" recurs mechanically across six beats without variation. Template cadence runs ("She played… She felt… She realized…") flatten momentum (−0.4). Artifacts touch the closure beat ("resonantly soft beat" in the final paragraph), which disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The core synthesis—music as heart-signal to awaken transformed beings—is fresh and specific to this premise. The locust shell as mnemonic device offers a non-obvious angle on the "mechanical world" trope. However, the emotional arc (lone artist reawakens oppressed souls through self-sacrifice) follows a widely used template without meaningful transformation through lived detail or moral calculus. The orchard's magic and the clocktower's counter-pulse are stated rather than discovered through goal-directed action. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative lyric design) is present but does not elevate stakes—it ornaments them. Transformation test: the plot would work largely unchanged with a different art form and setting, suggesting the particulars are decorative rather than load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Sky-bridge violinist: Setup clear (opening lines). Development: her choice to play the locust rhythm and then sync her heart (two beats). Closure: she stands on the bridge, violin silent, having become the bridge herself—present and reweighted. Causal pressure: her decision to "become the rhythm completely" enables the statues' release. Cost: chest aching, body stiffening briefly. Specificity: the violinist role matters (amplifier, not instrument). Swappability: another musician could substitute with minor edits. The role is functional across beats and shapes closure, but the violinist identity (versus musician generically) does not constrain tactics uniquely. Score reflects solid middle development and closure linkage but moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Locust shell: Setup at "yesterday" flashback (~25%). Development: Elara examines it, recognizes the rhythm, presses it to her chest, and syncs her heart (three beats). Closure: "crumbled to dust in her palm" at the ending, marking transformation complete. Causal pressure: the shell's rhythm enables her heart-sync method and provides the pattern that awakens statues. Specificity high: the shell's "microscopic filigree" and "amber" materiality are irreplaceable. Cost: it is consumed at closure. Beat count (three) and closure linkage are strong. Minor friction: the shell's arrival is coincidental ("breeze that shouldn't exist"), reducing setup integration slightly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Breaking free: Setup implicit in motivation ("enforced silence," "mechanical world"). Development: Elara "breaks free from flesh's limitations" and "breaks free of mechanical world's silence" are stated claims; no on-page choice dramatizes a foreclosed path or visible cost tied specifically to "breaking free" as an act. Closure: the phrase recurs ("language of breaking free") but as thematic echo, not as a constraint on tactics. The concept shapes stakes thematically but does not alter tactics or narrow options in a beat. Treated as theme rather than dramatized stake, it scores in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Resonantly soft: Setup in opening line ("resonantly soft cry"). Development: recurs in "resonantly soft voice" (violin as amplifier) and "resonantly soft note" (final playing moment) and "resonantly soft beat" (final paragraph). The trait is label-only; it does not constrain or enable an action with visible cost—louder or softer music would not alter the outcome. No on-page trade-off (e.g., soft sound cannot reach the clocktower, forcing a choice). It functions as atmospheric descriptor rather than tactical attribute. Label repetition without causal work trends low-functional.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Uproot: Setup implicit in statues "uprooted from their own bodies." Development: Elara's heart is "uprooted from safety and planted in dangerous soil of hope" at closure. The verb also describes the orchard's roots and the clocktower's attempt to "uproot her song from air itself." Causal pressure: the uprooting metaphor frames the transformation but does not itself drive a turn—Elara's decision to sync her heart is the engine. Closure linkage strong (final paragraph). Specificity moderate: "transform" or "break" could substitute without major loss. Swappability and metaphorical rather than literal use lower the score to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Signaling through heart rhythms: Setup when Elara recognizes "pulses, codes written in language of cardiac arrhythmia" (~40%). Development: she syncs her heart to the pattern, her violin translates her pulse, and the statues' mechanical hearts "began to stutter, desynchronizing." Closure: "their own hearts learning to signal again" and "patting out pulse she'd taught them." Causal pressure high: the method enables the statues' awakening and shapes the final image. Cost: Elara's own heart falters under counter-pulse. Introduced after the 40% mark caps the element at 4.6 per the late-arrival rule, but strong development and closure linkage push within allowable band. Specificity strong: this exact method is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Enchanted orchard policed by living statues: Setup in opening paragraph (orchard, statues on patrol). Development: the orchard's fading magic motivates Elara; the statues' rigid watch prevents awakening; the orchard's roots surge through the bridge at climax (three beats). Closure: "orchard thrummed with restored life," statues crumble and release, and the orchard's magic is restored—setting transformation is the visible outcome. Causal pressure: the orchard's deep magic responds to rhythm, enabling Elara's success. The statues as antagonists and the orchard as resource both constrain and enable. Specificity high: this exact setting is load-bearing. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Gap between knowing and understanding: Setup in opening ("that moment when memory almost became truth"). Development: recurs when Elara realizes the statues' origin ("crystalline moment between heartbeat and thought") and at closure ("gap between knowing and understanding had closed"). The phrase is metaphorical rather than temporal; no live clock or deadline tightens decisions. Time is vague ("thirteen moons," "yesterday," "tonight," "tomorrow") and does not alter tactics. The timeframe functions as thematic motif rather than pressure device. Thematic echo without causal work trends low-functional.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>To reawaken beauty in a mechanical world: Setup explicit ("trying to reawaken beauty in a mechanical world that had forgotten music's power"). Development: her attempts with every melody fail; the locust shell provides the method; her final act reawakens the orchard (three beats). Closure: beauty is restored and the living beings signal. Causal pressure: the motivation drives every choice. Cost: her chest aches, she risks becoming stone. Specificity: "reawaken beauty" is slightly abstract—does she mean literal life, aesthetic experience, or both? The story equates the two, which works thematically but makes the desire somewhat diffuse. Strong setup, development, and closure linkage; moderate specificity due to abstraction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Tarnished wonder: Setup implicit in "trying to reawaken beauty" and ash falling. Development: "tarnished wonder" appears explicitly when the statues' eyes hold "faintest glimmer of tarnished wonder" after the first rhythm, then again when freed beings look up "with eyes full of tarnished wonder." Closure: the phrase recurs in the final section, and the tone—beauty marred by mechanical oppression—charges the image of beings learning to signal. Coherence strong; the tone modulates with pressure (softer during flashback, urgent during counter-pulse). Specificity high: "tarnished" captures the exact mix of beauty and corruption. The tone shapes the final image and is irreplaceable. Strong closure linkage and rhythmic control.</comment>
