<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The ghost's altruistic motivation is told rather than shown through contradictory impulses or embodied choices under pressure. The community functions as an undifferentiated collective with no individual micro-choices that reveal hierarchy of values. Internal experience remains surface-level summary ("felt the stirrings," "understood") without embodied emotion or genuine struggle. The ghost's transformation into "nebula of respite" reads as metaphoric convenience rather than an earned change with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (orchard planet, floating arches, community) appear early, but the ghost's agency and the water-crisis stake remain abstract until the bell appears past midpoint. The closure—ghost fading into nebula after fulfilling purpose—lacks visible cost; his disappearance feels like atmospheric exit rather than foreclosing a live option. The dominant lens is unclear: causal turns are weak (bell rings → water flows with no friction), accumulative texture doesn't deepen pressure, and situational crystallization is absent. The piece teaches a mosaic pattern but the connective pressure across beats remains diffuse, and the spiral chalk mark at the end is thematic assertion rather than dramatized reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The floating rock arches and butterfly garden establish vivid setting, but they function as backdrop rather than constraining choice. The watering bell's mechanics (droplets spiral upward, fill hidden reservoir) are described but never complicate tactics or introduce friction. Spatial choreography is clean in individual beats, but the micro-setting doesn't pressure the central conflict—the bell simply works when rung, and the orchard thrives without visible environmental resistance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—revive the orchard before dry season—is declared but never tested on the page; no scene shows withering blossoms or failed irrigation attempts. The bell's use bypasses all friction: they ring it once, water flows, problem solved. No reversal, no tightening choice that narrows options, no visible price paid (ghost fading is his choice, not the community's trade-off). Escalation is absent; pressure remains flat from setup through resolution.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Theme of collective effort and "brambled hope" is stated repeatedly ("their shared laughter weaving bonds," "living testament to their collective effort") rather than emerging from specific choices and costs. The ghost's altruistic orchestration never faces friction or moral calculus, so thematic resonance is asserted not earned. The spiral symbol in the final chalk mark ("path forward would always be tangled, yet hopeful") moralizes the theme instead of letting the image speak. Subtext is minimal; gesture, silence, and implication are replaced by direct explanation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-person collective ("they," "the community"), but internal access is shallow and undifferentiated—no distinct perceptual signature or character-specific noticing. Diction occasionally inflates ("nebula of respite," "silent choreography," "brambled hope") beyond the grounded orchard-worker lexicon without voice motivation. Sentence rhythm is competent but falls into template cadence in the final third ("They learned to reexamine," "The butterfly garden, now a vibrant sanctuary," "Their story, etched"). No dialogue present to evaluate. Distance remains consistent, but the collective "they" lacks individual texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Multiple paraphrase loops weaken momentum: "altruistic ghost" / "altruistic desire," "shared laughter weaving bonds" / "bound by more than soil," "strangely trustworthy despite ethereal nature" / "strangely trustworthy aura." Template cadence dominates the final third with runs of "The [noun], now [modifier]" openers. Stock phrasing appears in peak beats ("shimmering mist," "silver veil," "tapestry of shared purpose"). Information density is low; many sentences restate prior content without advancing pressure. Figurative language (nebula, brambled hope, weaving bonds) appears frequently but vehicles contradict or blur: hope as brambled, laughter as weaving, ghost as nebula.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The core premise—benevolent ghost guides community via chalk messages—follows familiar altruistic-guardian templates without fresh synthesis. The orchard-planet setting and floating arches offer specificity, but plot turns are predictable: hidden resource, forgotten tool, problem solved. The bell's mechanics (chime summons water upward) lack grounded logic or cost. Emotional arc is generic ("strangers become family," "resilience," "beacon for others adrift"), and the spiral symbol moralizes rather than charging the image. No risk-taking or bold structural choice elevates the material beyond its template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The altruistic ghost is present throughout, leaving messages and hovering above the community, but his choices never create a turn; his role is to observe and urge, not decide under pressure. His fading at the end is his own fulfillment, not a choice that alters community tactics. Present in setup, development (messages), and payoff (fading), but causal pressure is minimal; the community's success does not hinge on a ghost decision. He is more atmospheric guide than agent.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The butterfly garden watering bell is introduced near midpoint ("forgotten tool"), used once in a single beat (they ring it, water flows), and becomes a "cherished relic" at closure. It appears in three beats (forgotten, used, hung at gate), but its use lacks friction or evolving meaning—it simply works as intended. The bell's chime is mentioned again in later beats as a "daily reminder," but this is summary, not dramatized reprise with reweighted cost. Two-gate presence (development, payoff) with moderate causal pressure, but the object does not constrain choice or impose visible cost; it solves rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The "nebula of respite" is mentioned twice: once as "a distant cloud of calm that had once sheltered the ghost's weary soul" (backstory) and again when the ghost dissolves into it at the end. It functions as metaphoric atmosphere, not as a concept that shapes on-page stakes or alters tactics. The community never engages with it as a resource or constraint; it remains the ghost's private symbol. Present in setup (via reflection) and payoff (ghost fades), but missing development; no middle choice hinges on this concept. Ornamental use without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Strangely trustworthy" is applied to the ghost twice: once describing his ethereal presence and again referencing the "strangely trustworthy aura of the chalked symbols." It is a label rather than a trait that constrains action; the community never doubts or debates the ghost's guidance, so trustworthiness never becomes a live question with cost. Present in setup and development (newcomers won confidence), but no on-page beat shows a character choosing to trust against risk. The attribute is told, not dramatized with tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Reexamine" appears twice: the ghost's message urges them to reexamine reliance on ancient irrigation, and later newcomers "learned to reexamine their assumptions about the land." The action is summary instruction, not a dramatized turn where the community debates, tests, or pays a cost. No major beat traces causally to this action; the shift to using the bell happens off-page between paragraphs. Swappable with "reconsider" or "rethink" with no structural change. Present in development and payoff (theme), but missing causal pressure; reexamine is theme claim, not plot engine.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Messages chalked onto deserted sidewalks at dawn are introduced early ("left messages chalked"), used to convey the hidden reservoir clue, and reappear when drought threatens ("chalked messages reappeared") and in the final paragraph as future guidance ("chalked symbols...guide future generations"). The method shapes three beats (setup, middle clue, drought response), but the mechanics are summary; we never see the community discovering or interpreting a message in real time with friction. The method matters as the ghost's signature but does not constrain or complicate on-page choices. Present in setup, development, and payoff; moderate causal pressure (clues guide action), but swappable with spoken whispers or visions with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The orchard planet with floating rock arches is introduced in the opening sentence and mentioned across multiple beats: shadows cast by arches, hidden reservoir beneath them, arches as "silent guardians" and "conduits of ancient wisdom." Setting is present in setup, development (reservoir location), and payoff (future canvas for messages). However, the arches never constrain a choice or impose cost; the reservoir's location beneath them is convenient rather than complicating. Spatial pressure is absent—no scene shows the community navigating, reaching, or struggling with the floating geography. The arches are vivid backdrop, not tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after strangers become family" is stated in the opening paragraph and reprised near the end ("a time after strangers become family"). It functions as thematic framing but does not tighten on-page decisions; no scene dramatizes the transition from strangers to family, nor does the "after" status impose time pressure on the orchard revival. The drought and dry season are mentioned as threats, but no clock tracks urgency or alters tactics. Present in setup and payoff (theme), missing development; the timeframe is backdrop rather than a live constraint that forces stance crystallization.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to orchestrate collective effort" is told directly ("the ghost's altruistic desire was to orchestrate collective effort") and demonstrated in his chalk messages and water-distribution guidance. The desire shapes the ghost's actions (messages, hovering presence, urging crop rotation), appearing in setup, development, and payoff. However, it is never conflicted or tested with cost; the ghost's orchestration succeeds without friction, and no scene shows him choosing this motive over another or paying a price for it. The community's collective action is asserted ("collective effort transformed labor into celebration") rather than dramatized with competing wants or visible tradeoffs. Functional but told-only, no on-page friction between wants and costs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"Brambled hope" appears once as a phrase ("brambled hope was the essence of their resilience") and is echoed in the spiral symbol ("tangled, yet hopeful") and the final line ("future a brambled hope, tangled but ever luminous"). Tone is coherent—optimistic with acknowledged difficulty—but static; it does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image with new weight. The piece tells the tone rather than embodying it through syntax or image. Present in development and payoff (theme and final line), but does not shape a turn or constrain choice. The tone is asserted ("tangled but hopeful") rather than earned through a beat where hope collides with cost on the page.</comment>
