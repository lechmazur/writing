<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The archivist remains largely competent and unobstructed; no genuine internal contradiction or embodied struggle appears. Her motivations are clear but one-note—she records the combinations and escapes, with no visible cost or path foreclosed. Interiority leans toward stock adventure phrasing ("latent blaze of purpose," "seeds of vigilance") rather than character-particular thought under pressure. The final return to the library feels like mission completion rather than earned change or renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when adequately early. The lens reads Causal-Adventure with a linear fetch-quest structure: find grotto, record glyphs, escape before window closes. Closure is a successful extraction with the tablet secured, but no on-page Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or felt cost—she simply wins and returns, mission accomplished. The Cost Proof Test fails: the ending describes readiness and vigilance as future states rather than a visible present sacrifice or foreclosed option.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful (mist, condensation, serpentine spine, inverted gravity revealing hidden alcoves). The grotto's environment supplies concrete resources (hidden alcoves, glyphs visible only under prism light) that affect the protagonist's ability to complete her task. Spatial choreography remains clear through the chase and threshold leap. The prism and manuscript return in the final image, charging closure with a faint rainbow reminder of hidden layers.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—secure the forgotten combinations before the inversion window closes—is signaled early and creates a ticking clock. Pressure tightens as gravity begins to right itself and the mist thickens, forcing the archivist to run. However, no genuine obstacle or trade-off materializes; she records all glyphs without error or cost and escapes cleanly. Escalation is mechanical (time running out) rather than driven by protagonist agency or a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme of hidden knowledge and vigilance emerges from images (prism, luminous doodle, threshold) but remains abstract. The "seeds of vigilance" and "latent blaze" recur as labels without dramatic embodiment or cost. No earned insight arises from specific struggle; the archivist's arc is mission completion, not transformation. The final paragraph moralizes readiness and watchfulness rather than offering a resonant, non-literal answer to a central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and vivid ("serpentine grotto," "clandestinely luminous"), though register occasionally elevates into prompt-like phrasing ("seeds of vigilance," "latent blaze") that feels externally imposed rather than character-specific. Perceptual signature is professional-archivist observant but not deeply idiosyncratic. Psychic distance is consistent; no dialogue is present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prose is clear and grammatically clean with varied sentence structure. However, paraphrase loops and synonym churn appear: "latent blaze" recurs five times without reweighting, "threshold" and "serpentine" repeat decoratively, and "seeds of vigilance" is stated twice without dramatization. Template cadence appears in the middle stretch ("She moved… She traced… She recorded…"). Figurative language ("blaze," "spark," "fire") stacks without payoff. No line-level opacity, but density and propulsion suffer from repetitive motifs.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Core premise—gravity-inversion window, luminous hidden doodle, threshold-sliding—combines multiple genre elements but feels like a prompt checklist rather than an organic synthesis. The archivist's journey is a competent fetch-quest with no fresh moral calculus or surprising turn. Emotional and plot beats follow expected adventure-story rhythms: discover, travel, record, escape. The piece executes tropes without transforming them through character-specific stakes or an inevitable-in-hindsight reversal.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Present throughout and drives the plot: she decodes the doodle, travels to the grotto, records glyphs, and escapes. However, her choices are purely procedural—no trade-offs, renunciations, or alterations under pressure. Setup, development, and payoff all present, but swappable with "treasure-hunter" or "spy" without structural change. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Appears early (first paragraph), recurs in the grotto (glyphs visible under its ink), and returns in the final scene where "the margin now empty, the doodle's light spent." Three beats with evolving function (discovery → key → closure callback). Enables the glyph-tracing action with specificity (clandestinely luminous ink). Missing causal pressure that narrows options; the doodle facilitates but does not constrain or cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Mentioned twice as thematic label ("seeds of vigilance") without dramatization: first when she records glyphs ("These were the seeds of vigilance"), then in the ending reflections. Does not shape on-page stakes or tactics; the core conflict is recording glyphs before time runs out, not vigilance itself. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The doodle's "clandestinely luminous" property is introduced early and enables one key beat: glyphs visible only under the prism's influence require the luminous ink. Setup and development present; payoff weakens when "the doodle's light spent" is told rather than shown altering final options. Functional in one beat but not irreplaceable—any "special ink" would serve.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Signals early ("re-enter the threshold"), drives the grotto entry and exit (sliding between realities, leaping through before closure), and appears in the ending promise ("she would re-enter the threshold"). Three beats with escalating stakes (entry calm, exit urgent). Specificity: "threshold effect" mechanics matter for both passages. Missing: no visible cost tied uniquely to re-entry; she succeeds cleanly both times.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Introduced mid-story ("the threshold effect still lingered, a narrow corridor between worlds") and used twice: entry and escape. The mechanics—sliding between stable realities, window closing—shape the urgency beat. Setup weak (not signaled early), development and payoff present. Functional but the effect could be replaced with "portal magic" or "dimensional shift" without deep structural change.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Introduced early in manuscript doodle, drives the entire middle (grotto entry, labyrinth navigation, glyph discovery, escape), and recalled in the ending ("the grotto waited"). Environment supplies concrete resources (hidden alcoves revealed by gravity inversion, glyphs etched in stone, mist thickening as danger). Spatial choreography clear. Missing higher score: no choice uniquely constrained by serpentine layout or mist; the grotto facilitates rather than pressures.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Introduced early ("That hour was now"), tightens middle urgency ("the hour was slipping away," gravity tugging, "last flicker of inversion faded"), and recurs in ending promise ("The hour of inversion would come again"). The ticking clock shapes escape tactics concretely. Setup, development, payoff all present. Missing higher band: no on-page cost of miscalculation or trade-off forced by the deadline; she completes the task and escapes cleanly.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Stated early (implicit in "reveal its hidden fire" and "markings mentioned in the doodle") and drives plot: she seeks glyphs, records them, guards the knowledge. Development present across beats. Missing: no friction between desire and cost, no competing want. The motivation is procedural quest-logic without internal contradiction or visible sacrifice when fulfilled.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Latent blaze" recurs five times but remains label-only: "doodle blazed," "latent blaze of purpose," "latent blaze in her heart," "latent blaze within her," "latent blaze… kept watch." Tone declares intensity without embodied variation—no modulation under pressure, no shift at closure. Static mood rather than dynamic charge. Ornamental.</comment>
