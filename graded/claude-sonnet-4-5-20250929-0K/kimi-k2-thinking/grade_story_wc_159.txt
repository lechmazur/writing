<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lyra operates as a pure vessel for thematic material rather than a character with embodied choices under pressure. Her interiority consists entirely of abstracted mood ("foxglove regret," "quiet defiance") without contradiction, micro-choice, or visible cost that forecloses a path. The "she realized" and "she understood" beats are told epiphanies disconnected from on-page struggle. No meaningful change or renunciation occurs; she continues her work in the final paragraph exactly as she did in the opening, rendering the arc static.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes who and where by the second paragraph but operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens that never achieves a decisive tightening or cost. The dominant stake—preserving forgotten names—cycles through synonym loops ("preserve the sound," "echo," "light," "kept alive") without escalation or closure choice. The final paragraph ("gentle systematic rhythm…continued to light") reprises the opening tableau without reweighting options or meaning, yielding a loop rather than Resonant Reconfiguration. No visible or felt cost appears on the page; "foxglove regret" remains an assertion rather than a dramatized price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The opal library and glass orchids supply vivid textures but function as postcard backdrops rather than constraints that shape Lyra's choices. The cracked bamboo tube is handled in multiple beats and its fracture is thematically charged, lifting the score slightly. However, spatial choreography remains vague (where Lyra stands, how she moves between galleries), and no environmental detail alters tactics or charges the final image beyond label-level mood.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The stated stake—to preserve forgotten names—never faces a test or trade-off. Lyra discovers the resonance, hums, lights the orchids, and captures the sound in a silver vial without obstacle, cost, or choice that narrows options. The piece asserts that "lighting the orchids also unveiled the emptiness," but this consequence does not alter Lyra's actions or require a stance crystallization. Under an Accumulative lens, escalation would require density increase or pattern break; here the text loops the same lighting action without deepening or cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The concept of deserted marvels and preservation laced with regret is coherent and emerges from imagery rather than explicit statement. However, the piece's reliance on prompt-adjacent abstractions ("extinct feelings," "foxglove regret," "deserted marvels") and its failure to ground theme in a concrete choice or cost keeps resonance at a mid-band. The final image reprises the opening without reweighting prior material, missing the chance for a non-literal answer to the central question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The prose maintains stable third-person limited focalization and a consistent lyric register. However, the narrative voice lacks perceptual signature; Lyra's way of noticing remains generic and interchangeable with any caretaker in any museum. Diction remains elevated and uniform across beats without modulation under pressure. The repeated template cadence ("She knew that…," "She realized that…," "She understood that…") flattens voice and creates a mechanical rhythm that undercuts immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn dominate: "preserve the sound of forgotten names" appears verbatim or as near-synonym in six paragraphs; "deserted marvels," "foxglove regret," "gently systematic," and "echo of a long-forgotten song" recur as labels without added pressure. Template cadence runs ("She knew…," "She resolved…," "She continued…") across the final third. The same core action—lighting orchids via song—is restated in paragraphs 8, 10, 15, 24, and 29 without propulsion. Mixed metaphor: "beauty laced with knowledge" (abstract) beside "crack of the bamboo, a mirror of her own imperfection" (concrete but contradictory vehicle). Apply −1.4 for pervasive loops and template cadence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The museum-of-extinct-feelings premise and the caretaker archetype are familiar from lyric-fantasy templates. The glass orchids, wind chime, and opal setting are vivid but do not transform the underlying structure of solitary curator preserving lost beauty with melancholy acceptance. The piece executes the template competently but offers no fresh inflection or synthesis; removing proper nouns and swapping in "archive of lost songs" or "library of faded memories" would leave the arc intact. No bold risk or non-obvious moral calculus elevates the material beyond its median choices.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Lyra is present throughout and performs the action of humming and lighting, but her choices do not create key turns. She discovers the resonance, decides to hum, and succeeds without obstacle or cost that alters tactics. The "she resolved to keep the chime hanging" (paragraph 20) is the closest to a choice, but it has no on-page consequence. Present and functional, but replaceable with any caretaker who performs the same ritual.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The cracked bamboo tube appears in paragraph 4, is used in paragraph 9 to split Lyra's voice into harmonics, and returns in paragraphs 18, 20, 25, and 27 with reweighted meaning ("even imperfect instruments could carry the weight of memory"). It enables the lighting action and is thematically charged at closure. However, its mechanics are vague (how does a crack split sound into harmonics?), and it does not constrain a choice with visible cost. Strong reprise and multi-beat involvement lift it into mid-7s, but lack of cost or irreplaceability caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Deserted marvels" appears as a label in paragraphs 7, 12, 21, 24, but does not shape stakes or tactics. The concept is thematic background—halls once vibrant, now hollow—but Lyra's task and method do not change because of this desertion. Present and consistent, but ornamental rather than causally active.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Gently systematic" labels Lyra's manner in paragraphs 2, 14, 22, 26, 29, but the trait does not constrain or enable a choice with cost. It describes her pacing without showing a trade-off (e.g., systematic care that prevents speed, or gentleness that risks incomplete preservation). Present and consistent, but label-only without on-page friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Light" (and its variants "lighting," "illuminate," "glowed") drives the central action across paragraphs 6, 8, 10, 15, 24, 26, 29. The orchids glowing with inscriptions is the piece's visual climax. However, the lighting is achieved without obstacle or choice; it is a result of humming rather than a decision that redefines options. Strong multi-beat presence and closure linkage, but swappable with "awaken" or "reveal" with minor edits. Mid-6s for involvement, capped below 7.0 for lack of irreplaceable causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The method—"by the echo of a long-forgotten song"—is signaled in paragraph 6, enacted in paragraph 8 ("she began to hum the ancient melody"), and its mechanics are described (voice split into harmonics that light the orchids). It shapes the attempt and reappears in paragraphs 15, 19, 24, 29. However, the method is a given rather than a choice under pressure; Lyra does not struggle to master it or pay a cost to use it. Present across beats and at closure, but functional rather than indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The opal library is named in paragraphs 1, 13, 21, 27, 28 and supplies vivid imagery ("translucent shelves," "opal spires," "vaulted aisles"). However, it does not constrain choice or supply resources that alter Lyra's tactics. The setting is a stage rather than a participant; removing "opal" and "above clouds" and substituting "crystal archive" would not change the arc. Functional and consistent, but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"Across the museum of extinct feelings" appears as a spatial phrase in paragraphs 2, 17, 24, 26, but functions as a location label rather than a timeframe that tightens decisions. "One morning" (paragraph 5) and "each sunrise" (paragraph 27) mark time loosely without creating urgency or a live clock. Present, but ornamental rather than pressure-inducing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lyra's motivation—"to preserve the sound of forgotten names"—is stated in paragraph 3, enacted in paragraph 11 ("captured the sound in a silver vial"), and reprised in paragraphs 19, 23, 24, 29. The desire is consistent and coherent. However, it is never conflicted or tested; no competing want or fear creates friction, and no visible cost is paid for pursuing it. Present and thematically central, but told rather than dramatized with choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Foxglove regret" is named in paragraphs 4, 13, 22, 27 and the tone of melancholy preservation is coherent throughout. However, the tone remains static; it does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image beyond reassertion. The prose maintains a single lyric mood without rhythmic shift or deepening at closure. Present and consistent, but does not elevate through craft or stakes-driven variation.</comment>
