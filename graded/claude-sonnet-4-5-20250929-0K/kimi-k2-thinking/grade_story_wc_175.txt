<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Esme's motivations are clearly established—to honor overlooked histories through temporary monuments—but her interiority remains abstract and label-driven rather than embodied. The "esoteric realist" tag feels more like exposition than a lived contradiction that drives choices. Micro-choices (knotting her hair, building the wind-harp) are present but lack visible internal conflict or competing impulses acting simultaneously. The piece tells us about her calculations and understanding rather than showing her struggling under pressure with competing desires.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through layered images and the moth wing accrues meaning across beats, culminating in a charged final moment when the monarch appears. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the final image crystallizes the temporary-signal motif and reconfigures the weight of witnessing—but the cost remains conceptual and oblique rather than felt on the page. Orientation is delayed: "she" appears without name or grounding for several lines, though the verdant grotto anchor arrives early enough to waive penalty. One meaningful deepening occurs when the moth wing becomes the signal that draws the monarch, but causality is loose—why this signal, this moment, this butterfly?</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The verdant grotto is vividly rendered with moss respiration, cloud pools, and volcanic glass, and it constrains Esme's actions (building temporary structures suited to the high-altitude environment). Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric—"blushing stillness," "beard-moss," "wind-harp"—and filtered through Esme's priorities as a witness-builder. The moth wing as micro-setting object charges the final image by vibrating against gut strings. Spatial choreography is clear across her movements from grotto floor to reed tower.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—honoring overlooked histories through temporary signals—is signaled early but remains abstract; we never see Esme face a live trade-off that tests her commitment with visible cost. Pressure accumulates through the textural mode (spore release, wing discovery, monarch's arrival) rather than through decisions that narrow options. The seventeenth-morning discovery and final monarch appearance deepen the stakes conceptually, but Esme's agency is more curatorial than decisive—she builds, observes, and interprets without facing a moment where her choice forecloses a path. The cost is implied (her own transiently rooted memory will fade) but not dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: interrupted cadence as ecological and personal rupture, temporary structures as shaped absence, witnessing as an act against erasure. The moth wing—humbler than a monarch—embodies the "overlooked histories" premise without stating it baldly. Subtext operates in the image-work (the sky's "blushing stillness" as apology, the tower that whistles) and the final moment invites reflection without moralizing. Minor slip: "This was how you honored overlooked histories" edges toward direct statement, and the "esoteric realist" calculations feel slightly thesis-driven. The ending offers a resonant answer—memory carried into emptiness—that reweights the temporary-permanent paradox.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single-POV third-person maintains stable distance with a lyric, elevated register consistent with Esme's contemplative stance. Perceptual signature is present (she "recognized it as an interrupted cadence," calculates angles, reads the landscape through entomological memory) but the diction occasionally drifts into expository abstraction—"mathematics of loss: each extinct pollinator erased seventeen plant memories"—that feels more like authorial essay than character thought under pressure. Rhythm modulates appropriately, lengthening in reflective passages and tightening at the moth-wing and monarch beats. No dialogue present to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Prose is ambitious and imagistic ("clouds pooled at its entrance like shy visitors," "spores that had not yet learned their vectors were gone") with strong density in many lines. However, paraphrase loops and template cadence mar momentum: "transiently rooted" appears three times with near-identical phrasing; "temporary structures as signals" recurs as a nearly verbatim phrase across multiple paragraphs; "blushing stillness" is repeated without reweighting. Stock metaphor "the sky itself was embarrassed" and the phrase "she was transiently rooted, but the memory she shaped was permanent in its impermanence" edges into paradox-for-paradox's sake. Filter-verb stacks ("she knew," "she understood," "she recognized") dull immediacy in reflective beats. Baseline scaffold penalty −0.6; template cadence in repeated phrases adds −0.4.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The premise—witness-artist building ephemeral monuments to extinct migration routes—offers a fresh angle on ecological elegy, and the moth-wing-as-signal is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. The "esoteric realist" frame and the knotting of silver hair add memorable particulars. However, the emotional arc (solitary figure mourning nature's loss through art) follows a familiar template, and the transformation test is weak: swap "Esme" for another name and "grotto" for another remote site, and the emotional beats remain largely unchanged. The piece commits fully to its lyric vision but plays it safe within that mode, avoiding bold structural or perspectival risk. The final image (monarch carrying memory into emptiness) is elegant but not startling.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Esme is present across all beats but her role is primarily observational and curatorial—she builds, recognizes, calculates—rather than making choices that create turns. The knotting decision and tower-building shape the final beat, satisfying two gates (development, closure participation), but her agency is more additive than transformative: she prepares signals, one works. Setup is clear; mid-beat involvement is functional but replaceable (another witness could perform the same acts). No visible on-page cost tied specifically to her identity as "esoteric realist."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The moth wing appears in beat one (discovery in beard-moss), beat two (knotted with Esme's hair to the wind-harp), and the closure (vibrates, sings, draws the monarch). Early signal, clear causal role (its vibration becomes the signal), and closure linkage all present. The wing's properties—fragile rib, "not a monarch's"—matter to the thematic charge (overlooked histories). Visible cost: Esme sacrifices her own hair to tether it, and the wing "would shred by morning," emphasizing transience. Strong integration across all three gates with specificity and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Interrupted cadence" is signaled early (paragraph 8: "an interrupted cadence, the natural resolution broken") and reappears at closure ("sang its interrupted cadence—a minor key note in a major silence"). The concept shapes the dominant stake—Esme's mission is to respond to this rupture—and the moth's mistimed flight and the monarch's five-year failure are dramatized instances. However, the concept functions more as thematic frame than as a constraint that alters on-page tactics; Esme does not face a choice between completing versus leaving incomplete. Lyric reprise at closure reweights prior material but the concept itself does not narrow options mid-scene.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Transiently rooted" is introduced early (paragraph 4) and recurs three times, but its use is largely label-only: "her presence no more permanent than the orchids," "her own memory was transiently rooted," "she was transiently rooted." The attribute supports theme (impermanence) but does not demonstrably constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost. Esme's choices (building structures that dissolve) align with the trait, yet the trait could be swapped for "temporary," "ephemeral," or "passing" without altering any beat. Functional thematic accent, not causal driver.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Knotting appears twice with distinct functions: knotting the silver hair through the moth wing (paragraph 9) and knotting threads in the weaving (paragraph 16). The first knot is the key turn—it creates the signal-device that ultimately draws the monarch at closure. Early signal (first knot by paragraph 9), middle development (second knot as thematic echo), and closure participation (the knotted hair vibrates with the wing). Causal pressure is clear: without the knot, no signal, no final connection. Visible cost: Esme's hair becomes part of the temporary structure, linking her body to the ephemeral monument. High integration, though the second knot is slightly redundant.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Building temporary structures as signals" is introduced paragraph 5, repeated nearly verbatim in paragraphs 15 and 27, and demonstrated across beats (cairns, prayer flags, driftwood ladders, quartz spiral, lichen bridge, reed tower, wind-harp). The method shapes the entire arc—Esme's actions are iterative signal-building—and the final structure (tower with moth wing) is the one that works. However, the mechanics are generic (she builds, attaches, positions) and the method could be described as "creating ephemeral monuments" without loss. All three gates present, but swappability and repetitive phrasing lower integration score. Causal role at closure (the built signal draws the monarch) elevates it into the 7-band threshold, but lack of unique mechanics or visible tradeoff between methods caps it.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The verdant grotto is vividly rendered and present across beats, supplying materials (volcanic glass, beard-moss, reeds, gut strings) and atmospheric conditions (clouds, monsoon, thermal currents) that shape Esme's tactics. The high-altitude setting explains why the moth "should not have flown so high" and creates the thermal currents that enable the mistimed migration. The grotto's steaming moss and spore release dramatize the ecological rupture. Setup, development (materials constrain building choices), and closure participation (the tower's height and the valley below frame the final monarch flight) all present. Micro-setting elements (moss, tower height) directly affect action and the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "during the migration of the last monarch butterfly" is signaled in the opening and contextualized ("the migration had been an interrupted cadence for five years now"). The "seventeenth morning" marker adds specificity. However, time does not visibly tighten tactics—Esme's work is iterative, not urgent, and no clock pressure forces acceleration or trade-offs. The monarchs' failure has already occurred; Esme is witnessing aftermath rather than racing against a deadline. The timeframe sets emotional stakes (finality, loss) but does not alter on-page choices. Functional setup and thematic weight, but no live escalation via time pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To honor overlooked histories" is stated explicitly (paragraph 3) and demonstrated through Esme's building and the moth-wing focus. The motivation drives all beats—her signal-building is the enactment of this desire—and the final moment (monarch carrying memory into emptiness) completes the goal. However, the motivation is never visibly conflicted or tested: Esme does not face a choice between honoring and, say, preserving herself, or between different histories. The desire is told ("her purpose was to honor") more than dramatized through friction. Setup, development (repeated building acts), and closure linkage all present, but lack of on-page cost or competing want lowers the score.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Blushing stillness" appears twice (paragraph 7 and paragraph 18) as a descriptor for the sky's rose-gold color and emotional tenor. The tone is cohesive across the piece—contemplative, elegiac, softly atmospheric—and modulates appropriately (reflective passages lengthen, the final beat tightens slightly). The phrase charges the final image when the monarch's wings are described as "the color of the blushing stillness itself," linking tone to the closure. However, the tone is largely static; no meaningful shift in emotional temperature occurs as pressure builds. Lyric reprise reweights the phrase at the end, but the tone does not dramatize escalation. Setup, closure participation present; middle modulation weak.</comment>
