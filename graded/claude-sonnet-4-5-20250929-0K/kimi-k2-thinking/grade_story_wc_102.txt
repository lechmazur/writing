<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is abstract and label-heavy throughout ("spiritually curious," "hollow," "vault of unused love"), relying on emotional summary rather than embodied contradiction. Her actions—clutching the crystal, breathing, extending her hand—are gestural without revealing a hierarchy of values or genuine internal conflict. The "healing" arrives through passive reception of firefly-sparks rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The lover's dissolution and Mira's transformation read as declared rather than earned by on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The piece operates in Accumulative/Textural mode with lyric patterning, but the closure—Mira realizing unused love was "within" and walking into fog "healed"—lacks a legible cost or decisive reconfiguration. The viaduct corridor, firefly memories, and breathing ritual unfold without narrowing options or altering tactics; the "release" is asserted in summary ("She let the unused love flow back") rather than dramatized. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough to waive penalty, but the escalation remains atmospheric rather than pressure-driven.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The viaduct, fog, blooms, and iron rails supply vivid sensory anchors filtered through Mira's lens as a camera obscura artist. The crystal tear's prism effect and the "corridor of light" constrain her perception, and the blooms "breathing with her" participate in the final image. However, no environmental detail forces a tactical choice or alters the outcome; setting functions as backdrop and metaphor rather than a crucible that shapes decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—is signaled early, but pressure remains static: Mira observes, breathes, and receives rather than confronting a reversal or trade-off. The lover's spectral smile and the chamber sealing itself are handed to her without agency-driven escalation. No meaningful tightening forecloses an option or forces a cost; the "release" is told rather than tested on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Theme—unused love preserved within—emerges from recurring images (vault, sparks, tear, blooms) and the pilgrim-of-sparks motif. Yet the final realization is stated directly ("She had found where unused love is stored: within") rather than left resonant through image. The camera obscura and Kwan Yin's tear recur but do not reweight meaning at closure; they remain decorative symbols rather than charged particulars that complicate the moral calculus.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single-POV distance is stable, and the perceptual signature—light, aperture, prisms—is consistent with Mira's role as camera obscura artist. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("lucid dream," "silent blessing," "foggy lucidity") that reads more literary than character-particular. No head-hopping, and the lyric compression is purposeful, but the voice lacks the grit or micro-choices that would make the texture feel lived-in under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops appear throughout: "unused love" is restated across at least six lines without advancing pressure; "breath/breathing/breathed" recurs in template-like stems ("Her breath steadied," "She breathed them in," "each breath a spark"). Figurative density is high but often generic ("fireflies," "embers," "storm of feeling") without sharp vehicle logic. The final third contains multiple restatements of the healing and release, flattening momentum. Deductions: paraphrase loops −0.6, template cadence −0.5, totaling −1.1; artifacts touch closure, so cap at 7.7 before applying, landing mid-5s.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The premise—spiritual pilgrimage to heal past-life love via camera obscura and crystal—assembles prompt elements without transforming them into a non-obvious synthesis. The "unused love stored within" resolution is a familiar internal-journey endpoint. The viaduct, blooms, and fog remain postcard setting rather than world logic that alters tactics. Swap "camera obscura" for "medium" or "seer," and the arc holds unchanged. No bold risk or fresh inflection charges the material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout but passive: she steps, clutches, calls herself a label, breathes, extends her hand, and receives insight. No on-page choice alters tactics or forecloses a path. Her role as camera obscura artist supplies perceptual filter but does not drive turns. Present in setup, middle, and closure, but swappable with "intuitive healer" or "spiritual seeker" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Kwan Yin's tear appears in three beats: initial clutching, prism-painting on stone, and held to twilight sky at closure. It enables the corridor vision and "pulsed" once, but its mechanics are vague and it does not constrain a choice or impose cost. The tear is handled on the page and recurs, meeting two gates, but remains a symbolic prop rather than an object whose specific properties drive action.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Pilgrim of sparks" is invoked as self-description and echoed in the final paragraph ("pilgrim of sparks now at peace," "each breath a spark of healing"). It frames the quest thematically but does not shape stakes or tactics; Mira's actions would be identical if she called herself "seeker of light" or "wanderer of memory." Present in setup and closure, but ornamental label rather than concept that alters options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Spiritually curious" is named once ("Mira felt spiritually curious") and echoed late ("Her spiritual curiosity had led her to this revelation"). It describes her stance but does not constrain an action or create visible cost. No on-page moment where curiosity compels a risky choice or trade-off. Label-only mention without dramatized friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Heal" appears throughout as goal and outcome: the lover's eyes hold "a request for healing," "a healing current flow through her chest," "a quiet healing," "release it," "healed" at closure. The action structures the quest but is told rather than tested; no specific wound or treatment is dramatized with cost. Swappable with "forgive" or "release" without altering beats. Present in setup, middle, and closure, meeting all gates, but lacks causal pressure or irreplaceable mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Breathing is signaled early ("each breath she took altered the shadow play," "breathing changed the aperture") and recurs across multiple beats: inhaling brightens blooms, exhaling relaxes trusses, deep breath draws sparks, breath steadies as promise, breath becomes bridge. The method shapes perception and the final image ("each breath a spark of healing"). However, the mechanism is vague—no clear cost or limit—and the outcome (healing) would occur with minor rewrites replacing breath with meditation or touch. Present in setup, middle, and closure; functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The twilight viaduct in bloom anchors every beat: fog, iron rails, arches glowing, blooms shimmering and breathing with Mira. It supplies atmosphere and the "corridor of light" vision, and the viaduct sighs and stands witness at closure. However, no spatial feature forces a tactical choice or alters the outcome; the setting functions as charged backdrop rather than constraint. Present in setup, middle, and closure; essential to tone and image but not to plot mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the past life memory surfaces" is invoked in the opening ("Tonight, a past life memory surfaced") and drives the quest to heal the lover's image. However, the memory itself is static—no urgency, no ticking clock, no evolving threat. The "after" signals causality but does not tighten decisions or tactics. Present in setup and implicit throughout, but the temporal frame is loose rather than pressuring.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to find where unused love is stored" is articulated early ("Mira whispered a prayer, asking where unused love is stored") and structures the quest through the corridor vision and firefly sparks. The answer—"within"—arrives at closure. However, the desire is declared rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses or visible cost; Mira pursues it without friction or trade-off. Present in setup, middle, and closure, but told-only without on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Foggy lucidity" coheres across the piece: fog curls, softens, lifts slightly, swirls "like a lucid dream," and Mira becomes "a figure of foggy lucidity." The tone modulates from mystery to clarity ("fog lifted from her mind") and charges the final image. The phrase itself appears late but the tone is established early and held through turns, supporting the Accumulative lens. Coherent and purposeful, though the overt label in the final third reduces subtlety.</comment>
