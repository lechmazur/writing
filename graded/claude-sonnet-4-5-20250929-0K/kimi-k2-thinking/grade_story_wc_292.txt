<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The librarian's internal progression from nervousness to certainty is traced through embodied decisions (transcribing coordinates, overriding protocols, running to the deck), and her "nervously confident" attribute drives visible choices under pressure. However, the interiority relies heavily on stock phrasing—"spongey dread," "wet wool in her lungs," "crystalline purpose"—that repeats across beats without fresh embodiment. The director's sudden appearance and pale-faced silence reads as convenient validation rather than genuine secondary pressure. Internal contradiction is present (fear vs. purpose) but the final stance arrives through assertion more than dramatized cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates motifs (copper nail, coded stanzas, the camp emerging from ice) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the librarian's final stance crystallizes options and reweights the approved history with undeniable pressure, even though the personal cost is not yet fully paid on the page. Orientation anchors (map librarian, weather station, three weeks post-shift) appear early. The escalation hinges on decoding journals and overriding protocols, then the camp's physical emergence validates her choice—coincidence complicates (the melt reveals the camp) but does not resolve the protagonist's internal shift. Cost is legible in her defiance of termination and the director's retreat, though the social and professional fallout remains Charged Poise rather than paid fully on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The experimental weather station is anchored early with concrete details (instrument towers, main console, observation deck) and the valley below becomes the spatial crucible where Vance's camp emerges, constraining the librarian's final choice to stand and point. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through urgency: wind "with frozen claws," the scent of "thawed permafrost and something organic and wrong," the ghost camp "emerging like a developing photograph." The copper nail, journals, and monitors function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. Minor slip: the director's sudden arrival on the deck lacks spatial choreography (how did he know she was there?), and the station's interior layout remains generic beyond the console and deck.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—honor Vance's bravery and prove the suppressed weather truth—is signaled early and tightens when the librarian overrides safety protocols, facing termination. The tightening is meaningful: entering Vance's coordinates triggers alarms and forces her into open defiance, foreclosing her safe position. The camp's emergence provides external validation, but the protagonist's agency (transcribing, running, pointing) drives the escalation under the Accumulative lens. Cost is visible in the director's termination threat and her willing acceptance of professional ruin. The "spongey dread" spreading to the director signals a reweighting of certainty, though the dread itself functions more as atmospheric label than embodied pressure in the final beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—truth suppressed by institutional convenience, bravery erased by fear—emerges organically from the librarian's decoding work and the physical reappearance of Vance's camp, not from stated morals. The copper nail and coded stanzas operate as motifs that accumulate pressure and shift meaning: the nail is "a key," then "transmits permission or warning," then charges the final image as the librarian holds it while confronting the director. The final line ("nervously confident in a way that made the director's silence heavy") offers a resonant answer to the central question—what cost for being right too soon?—without overt philosophizing. Minor slip: "spongey dread" is named repeatedly as both emotion and atmospheric condition, sometimes blurring into label-speak ("the feeling of a lie collapsing") rather than embodied particular.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited to the librarian; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices maps, coordinates, atmospheric data, and the journals' coded language. Voice modulates appropriately from anxious cataloging to defiant certainty. The prose carries a distinct, slightly elevated register ("fractured jet stream," "reversible exile," "crystalline purpose") that fits a scholarly map librarian. Dialogue is minimal and functional ("Look at what she found for us... Look at what we've been erasing"), carrying subtext of vindication and challenge. Minor slips: repeated phrase stems ("nervously confident" appears three times) and filter-stack in one passage ("she understood," "she knew," "she would catalogue") slightly dull immediacy, though the clustering does not pervade.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance situation or imagery. Rhythm varies, and the read-aloud test passes without algorithmic monotony. However, multiple paraphrase loops and template cadence issues appear: "The librarian's hands shook" / "The librarian's fingers trembled"; "nervously confident" recurs three times without fresh embodiment; "spongey dread" is named six times, sometimes with synonym churn ("wet wool," "clinging fog"). Stock metaphor strings in peak beats ("crystalline purpose," "dry and certain had finally caught flame") elevate diction beyond the librarian's internal texture under stress. The closure beat itself is clean, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies: two distinct issues (paraphrase loops, stock metaphor strings) trigger −1.5 within Q7, setting the grade at 6.9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of climate science, historical exile, and coded cartography offers a specific angle, and the reversible-exile concept is fresh. However, the emotional arc—lone scholar defies institution, proves suppressed truth, faces termination—is template-familiar, and the story does not transform it through unexpected moral calculus or lived detail that surprises in hindsight. The director's instant retreat and the ghost's approving nod feel convenient rather than earned. Risk-taking is moderate: the accumulative design and the coded-stanzas conceit add texture but do not fundamentally challenge narrative expectations. The final image (librarian standing, director backing away, instruments gleaming) is evocative but not irreplaceable; a similar close could serve many discovery-vindication plots.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The map librarian is present throughout and her choices—transcribing coordinates, overriding protocols, running to the deck, confronting the director—create the story's key turns. She appears in the opening line and drives all major beats. Her idealism is dramatized through action (defying termination, pointing to the valley) rather than summary. However, her internal contradictions resolve quickly into certainty without sustained friction, and the director's capitulation softens the cost of her defiance. The character is essential but the arc's predictability and the director's convenient validation prevent higher scores.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The copper nail appears in the opening line (pinned to the corkboard), returns when the librarian "felt nervously confident as she matched the copper nail to a diagram," is held "against her heart" on the deck, "warmed in her palm, transmitting something," and implicitly charges the final image as she stands with it. The nail is seeded early, constrains the librarian's interpretive choice (it's "a key" to reversible exile), and accumulates meaning across at least four beats. The object's reweighting at the end (permission/warning) ties to closure. However, its physical properties (green with age, copper) do not materially alter tactics; the nail functions more as symbolic anchor than causal lever.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Reversible exile is introduced early ("a punishment where the condemned could return if they proved their dangerous truth") and shapes the librarian's stake: proving Vance returned or could have. The concept drives her decision to enter coordinates and override protocols, seeking the "promised land" that would validate Vance's survival. It appears in the coded journals, the grave marker note, and the station becoming "a monument to reversible exile." The concept is present in setup, middle choice, and closure narration. However, it remains more thematic container than on-page constraint; the librarian's tactics (decode, enter data, point) would function similarly if the concept were renamed "suppressed truth." The exile's mechanics (how return was achieved or blocked) are not dramatized, so the concept's irreplaceability is limited.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Nervously confident" is named three times: in the first decoding scene, on the observation deck, and in the final line. The trait enables the librarian's override decision (confidence) while registering the cost (nervousness), and the final use "made the director's silence heavy," charging the closure image. However, the trait is label-only after the first instance; no on-page action specifically embodies the simultaneous nervousness and confidence beyond general trembling-plus-defiance. The tradeoff (risk termination vs. validate ancestor) is visible but not uniquely tied to this exact pairing; a similar arc could use "determined despite fear."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The action "question" is named explicitly in the journals' final verse ("Will you honor the brave, or seal the truth again?") and the librarian's internal stance: "She had questioned the official maps... Now she would question what came next." The questioning drives her to decode, override protocols, and confront the director with "Look at what we've been erasing." The action appears in setup (questioning maps), middle (overriding to test the coordinates), and closure (making the director question). However, the action is somewhat generic; "challenge" or "investigate" could substitute with minor edits. The ending hinges on making others question, which is thematically resonant but not mechanically indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The method "through coded stanzas in shipwrecked journals" is introduced early ("the shipwrecked journals had arrived with the melting ice"), drives the middle beat (the librarian transcribes "the final verse, a question hidden in barometric pressure readings"), and provides the coordinates she enters. The journals appear in three beats and their mechanics matter: coded stanzas yield latitude lines and Vance's coordinates, shaping the librarian's attempt. However, the decoding process is summarized rather than dramatized; we do not see her solve the code on the page, only its result. The journals function as essential information source but could be replaced by another discovery method (e.g., a map, a message in ice) without restructuring the plot.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The experimental weather station is present from the opening line, houses the main console and instruments the librarian uses to enter coordinates, and its location on Vance's original coordinates is a plot hinge: "The experimental weather station had been built on Vance's original coordinates, its instruments designed to dismiss her theories, not prove them." The station's monitors show the calm eye, its alarms scream when she overrides protocols, and the observation deck frames the final confrontation. The setting constrains her choices (she must use the station's console to test the coordinates) and supplies the tactical resource (the override capability). The station is essential across setup, middle, and closure, with its dual function (suppress/reveal truth) charging the thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the jet stream shifts" anchors the story's premise ("Three weeks since the shift, and the approved maps already meant nothing") and creates urgency: the melt has revealed the journals, the jet stream's new pattern exposes Vance's stable pocket, and "the shift had changed everything." The timeframe appears in the opening third, motivates the librarian's cataloging work, and enables the climax (the jet stream now reveals what was hidden). However, the passage of time within the story is vague—does the transcription and override happen over hours, days?—and no live clock tightens decisions. The shift functions as premise-setter more than active constraint; once established, it does not further narrow options on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to honor an ancestor's overlooked bravery" is seeded early ("Her ancestor's name appeared in the first coded stanza") and drives the librarian's choices: decoding journals, entering coordinates, running to the deck, confronting the director with "Look at what she found for us." The motivation is present in setup (discovering Vance's name), middle (proving the coordinates), and closure (making Vance's bravery undeniable). Friction appears between honoring the ancestor and risking termination, and the final cost (professional ruin, spreading dread) is tied to this desire. However, the motivation is told and restated more than it is tested by competing wants; the librarian's commitment never wavers or faces a genuine dilemma that would force her to weigh Vance's honor against another value.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The tone "spongey dread" is named six times and textured with variations: "wet wool in her lungs," "certainty that something buried was now breathing," "like damp fog, clinging to everything," and it "spread from the librarian's certainty into the air itself." The tone is seeded early, modulates as the librarian moves from fear to defiance, and charges the final image when it "belonged to everyone who had built their certainty on erased maps." The tone is present across setup, middle, and closure, and its evolution (personal dread → shared institutional dread) reweights the stakes. However, "spongey dread" is label-only in several instances without fresh sensory embodiment, and the repetition sometimes dulls rather than intensifies. The tone is coherent but not irreplaceable; "creeping unease" or "suffocating doubt" could serve similarly.</comment>
