<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's interior life is largely mediated through abstract metaphysical musings rather than embodied emotion. The borrowed-time premise exists as label rather than lived contradiction; we never see her wrestle between contradictory impulses in scene. The final choice to "stop embedding messages" and "learn to read the texture of time" arrives without on-page cost or visible foreclosure of a prior option. The figure coalescing from dust introduces a second character late without clear relationship pressure or status dynamics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the first paragraph. The story attempts a hybrid lens—causal discovery of Harrison's message mixed with accumulative texture—but the lens wobbles: the middle section's garage-sale listings feel like outline steps rather than motivated beats, and the climactic meeting occurs through spatial hand-waving ("not walked, but simply was there"). Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration (learning to read time's texture, accepting borrowed time as gift), but the cost is conceptual only, never dramatized as a forfeited path or visible price. The urn fragment's return in the final paragraph gestures at charged reprise without reweighting prior stakes.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The Emerald Silo's copper-to-green oxidation is vivid, and the interior shelving provides spatial grounding. The ammo box and porcelain fragment are handled concretely. However, the silo functions primarily as backdrop; it does not constrain Elara's choices or supply resources that alter tactics. The "shadowless meeting place" paradox is asserted rather than spatially dramatized, and the final image relies on metaphysical abstraction (lifelines as roads) rather than environment or object that charges the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding Harrison's fractured message about borrowed time—is signaled early but never tightened through a live obstacle or trade-off. The garage-sale embedding method appears mid-story without prior setup and resolves when a reply arrives three weeks later (coincidence, not protagonist agency). The meeting with the figure delivers backstory exposition rather than a choice that narrows options. No on-page cost is visible: Elara "stops embedding messages" because "the mystery had been anticipated," not because continuing carries a price or forecloses another path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—borrowed time as gift rather than debt, and damaged messages as transformation—emerges through image and event rather than sermon. The final image of the urn fragment "against the borrowed heartbeat she no longer needed" attempts resonant reconfiguration. However, the piece leans on prompt-adjacent phrasing ("texture of time passing," "numbers change meaning") that hovers near thematic echo. The garage-sale listings ("its light remembers when shadows were solid") inject lyric subtext, but the climactic revelation is told rather than dramatized, weakening the thematic payoff.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Diction carries a consistent lyric-philosophical register ("corroded jewel," "ink in water," "voice like pages turning"). However, elevated metaphor saturates high-pressure beats without pattern-teaching: "timeless," "eternal hum," "grammar of numbers" all arrive in quick succession, flattening urgency. The figure's exposition ("He knew the Recalibration was coming…") shifts into flat summary rather than embodied voice. Elara's perceptual signature (cataloguing damaged capsules) is established early but does not modulate under emotional pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout without clear pattern or payoff: "borrowed-time timekeeper," "pulse spread out like ink in water," "voice like pages turning," "roads she could travel at will" cluster in adjacent lines, creating metaphor fatigue rather than propulsion. Paraphrase loops appear: "borrowed time wasn't a debt to be repaid, but a gift to be spent" closely echoes the urn fragment as "endings are just beginnings that have forgotten their numbers." Template cadence is visible in the garage-sale listings (parallel "vintage lamp…," "set of four teacups…" structures). Clarity remains mostly intact, but information density is low in the middle third where the garage-sale method is described rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The Recalibration premise (numbers change meaning, "seven no longer meant seven") offers a fresh speculative hook. However, the story does not follow its implications into on-page constraint or tactical choice; the concept remains thematic window-dressing. The garage-sale method and the "texture of time" motif feel derivative of prompt language rather than organic invention. The figure's late arrival and expository function reduce risk; the climax opts for explanation over dramatized discovery. Transformation of the borrowed-time trope is attempted but not completed with specific, grounded cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara appears throughout and touches the urn fragment (key turn), embeds messages, and meets the figure. However, her choices do not create causal pressure: the urn grants timelessness passively, the reply arrives by coincidence, and the final "learning" is summary rather than decision. Present in setup, middle, and ending, but agency is low. Beats: touch (one), embed (two), meet (three). Closure linkage weak (she places urn back but does not act). Swappable protagonist. Caps: none missing. Band guidance suggests ~4.2 for functional presence without strong causal agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The urn fragment appears when Elara brushes it (beat one), triggers her timeless state (beat two), pulses in her pocket during the meeting (beat three), and is placed back at the end (beat four). Setup early, middle use (pulsing as key), closure participation (placed back with new understanding). Causal pressure: moderate (triggers state). Irreplaceability: high (Harrison's intent, name visible). Cost connection: conceptual only. Caps: none. Positives: early +0.5, three beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, specificity +0.5. Frictions: cost is felt not visible −0.3, swappability for any keyed object −0.5. Lands ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Damaged time capsules frame Elara's occupation (setup), the rusted ammo box with broken seal delivers the urn fragment (beat one inciting), and the final sorting scene ("by the weight of their untold stories") reprises the concept (closure participation). Setup, middle incident, closure reprise all present. Causal pressure: the broken capsule enables discovery but does not constrain later choice. Irreplaceability: moderate (concept-specific). Cost: none. Caps: none. Positives: early +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure reprise +0.7. Frictions: ornamental in ending −0.5, swappable for any mystery container −0.5. Lands ~5.9.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Suddenly timeless" triggers when Elara touches the urn: pulse spreads, becomes eternal hum (beat one). The trait enables her to exist in all the silo's moments simultaneously (beat two, meeting). However, it does not constrain a choice or impose visible cost; it grants access without trade-off. Setup, middle use, closure mention (heartbeat she no longer needed). Caps: none. Positives: early +0.5, two beats +0.9, closure linkage +0.7. Frictions: label-only trait (no embodied cost) −0.8, enables without constraining −0.6, swappable for any transcendence −0.5. Lands ~4.7.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Rediscover" is the stated mission: Elara seeks the lost half of Harrison's message, embeds garage-sale messages to attract someone (beat one), receives a reply (beat two), and meets the figure who helps her rediscover meaning (beat three). Setup, middle method, closure meeting all present. Causal pressure: moderate (shapes method). Irreplaceability: low (could be "find," "learn," "decode"). Cost: none. Caps: none. Positives: early +0.5, three beats +1.4, closure +0.9. Frictions: swappable verb −0.7, summary-only climax (told discovery) −0.8. Lands ~5.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Embedding messages in garage-sale listings appears at ~40% mark (late setup penalty applies). Elara writes two sample listings (beat one), scatters them (beat two), receives a reply (beat three), then stops using the method because "the mystery had been anticipated" (beat four, closure mention). Missing early setup. Caps: introduced after 40% → 4.6. Positives: three beats +1.4, closure mention +0.4. Frictions: late −0.6, method resolves problem it did not create −0.7, swappable (could use any anachronistic medium) −0.5, stops without cost −0.3. Lands ~4.1, under cap.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The Emerald Silo is named in the opening line, described vividly (corroded jewel, copper cladding), houses the damaged capsules (beat one), becomes the "shadowless meeting place" paradox (beat two), and in the ending is reframed as "prism, refracting one life into many possibilities" (closure reprise). Setup, middle (interior shelves, meeting location), closure reconfiguration all present. Causal pressure: low (does not constrain choice). Irreplaceability: moderate (emerald color, silo structure). Caps: none. Positives: early +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure reprise +1.0, specificity +0.5. Frictions: postcard use in middle −0.6, does not alter tactics −0.8. Lands ~6.3.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After numbers change meaning" is established in the backstory block (setup), shapes the ledger swimming scene (beat one), and informs Harrison's transformation into "texture between seconds" (beat two). The Recalibration is mentioned at closure but does not tighten a decision. Setup, middle thematic color, closure mention all present. Causal pressure: none (does not alter tactics). Irreplaceability: high (unique speculative premise). Cost: none. Caps: none. Positives: early +0.5, two beats +0.9, specificity +0.7. Frictions: ornamental (never constrains choice) −0.9, swappable for any reality-shift −0.4. Lands ~5.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Motivation to "understand the texture of time passing" is named when Elara realizes Harrison's breadcrumb (beat one, ~30% mark). She pursues it by embedding messages (beat two) and meeting the figure who explains (beat three). At closure she "learned to read the texture of time passing in the palm of her hand." Setup, middle pursuit, closure fulfillment all present. Causal pressure: low (method is passive). Irreplaceability: moderate (tied to concept). Cost: none (gains understanding without trade-off). Caps: none. Positives: early +0.4, three beats +1.4, closure +0.9. Frictions: told-only climax −0.8, no friction between want and cost −0.7, swappable for "understand mystery" −0.5. Lands ~4.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Anticipated mysteries" is established through Harrison's deliberate urn placement, breadcrumb across decades, and the figure's line "the mystery had been anticipated, and it had arrived." Tone is consistent: contemplative, philosophical, suffused with temporal paradox and lyric description. Setup (capsule as mystery), middle (garage-sale enigma), closure (anticipated arrival) all present. Coherence: high. Modulation: low (static mood throughout, no tonal shift under pressure). Caps: none. Positives: early +0.6, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +0.8, coherence +0.4. Frictions: single static mood −0.7, does not charge final image distinctly −0.5. Lands ~5.6.</comment>
