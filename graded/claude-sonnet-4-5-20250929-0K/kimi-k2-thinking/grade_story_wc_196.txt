<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marianne's broken-hearted grief over her son creates a specific, embodied motivation that shapes her archival work. Her choices are clear and character-particular: the decision to extend file lives, to trace the button's history, to send the letter without promising closure. The daughter's response provides an earned payoff that reweights Marianne's persistent grief into "tactfully hopeful" endurance. Minor: the social worker who placed the button remains speculative rather than dramatized, limiting the crucible of secondary pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Marianne's broken heart eases "not by healing, but by the recognition that histories...settle in patterns that can be read." The accumulative lens holds—dust reading, button discovery, letter exchange—with each layer deepening the stake. Orientation anchors quickly (file room, Tuesday in March, Marcus Dwyer's box). The daughter's posthumous response provides felt cost: Marcus died believing he came from nothing, yet the gesture reaches those who remain. One meaningful tightening when the button's regiment is traced to Private James Dwyer.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The file room's "metal shelves sagging under boxes" and dust patterns function as both setting and diagnostic tool, constraining Marianne's method throughout. The button's patina and envelope dust layers provide concrete micro-setting that charges the final discovery. Sensory detail is purposeful: "stale air and forgotten stories," dust thickness revealing sequence. The setting enables rather than decorates—dust becomes the medium through which history is read and small kindnesses magnified.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—magnifying small kindnesses through archival work—is signaled early and drives each beat. Pressure tightens when the button suggests a father's identity, deepens when Private James Dwyer is traced, and culminates when the daughter reveals Marcus died believing he came from nothing. The posthumous timing forecloses reconciliation while still landing emotional cost: the gesture reaches across decades "to touch those who remain." Agency manifests in Marianne's choice to send the letter without promising closure, an act of "tactfully hopeful" restraint that shapes the ending's charged poise.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from dust-as-history metaphor: "histories, like dust, settle in patterns that can be read." The button functions not as symbol but as concrete residue of a social worker's decision to preserve something permanent. Marianne's method—reading accumulated layers—embodies rather than states the thematic question of how small kindnesses survive systemic neglect. The ending's "tactfully hopeful" stance resists tidy resolution: her broken heart eases through recognition, not healing, and the cost (Marcus's death before receiving the button) ensures complexity. The daughter's letter provides non-literal answer without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third, filtering all perception through Marianne's archival expertise. Perceptual signature is distinct: "dust told her the sequence of events," patina matched to inner documents, the envelope sealed "before the dust of history could claim it." Diction stays consistent—"tactfully hopeful," "specialized grief," "dust patterns Marianne could read like a map"—with rhythm modulating between archival precision and emotional weight. The social worker remains speculative ("she imagined") without head-hopping. Minor: "magnify small kindnesses" phrase recurs without fresh coloring in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high: most sentences advance characterization, world detail, or thematic pressure. "Broken-hearted, but it was a specialized grief" and the dust-reading method establish voice and stakes efficiently. The button's discovery beat layers physical description, inference method, and emotional weight without padding. Minor loop: "tactfully hopeful" appears three times with similar framing, and "small kindnesses" recurs in near-identical constructions (final paragraph echoes mid-story phrasing). Rhythm varies appropriately, though the closing paragraph stacks summary statements where a sharper final image might land harder.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The dust-reading conceit transforms archival work into embodied detective method: patina matching document age, envelope dust thickness revealing temporal sequence. The emotional premise—finding kindnesses rather than solving mysteries—offers a fresh inflection on foster-care narratives. The posthumous delivery ensures the story resists easy redemption while honoring the gesture's reach across decades. The combination of forensic detail (manufacturer marks, regiment records) and emotional restraint ("She didn't promise closure") feels specific to this voice and stakes. Risk: the accumulative structure and quiet ending commit fully to their emotional logic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marianne's broken-hearted state motivates the entire archival mission, shapes her choice to trace the button across three days, and determines the letter's careful restraint ("didn't promise closure"). Her specialized grief over her son's death directly enables her recognition of Marcus's erasure. The daughter's response reweights Marianne's endurance into "tactfully hopeful" survival, charging the closure. Present in setup, drives middle research beats, and shapes the ending's emotional register.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The button appears in discovery (physical handling, dust analysis), drives the three-day cross-reference search, and is mailed as the story's pivotal gesture. Its military provenance narrows the father's identity to Private James Dwyer, and its survival in the file embodies the social worker's kindness Marianne seeks to honor. The daughter's revelation that Marcus "came from nothing" reweights the button's meaning at closure. Irreplaceable: no other object could carry this specific lineage and manufactured evidence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Unknown histories" frames the file room's function (emancipated children "who had disappeared into the adult world") and Marcus's erased paternity ("father listed as unknown"). The concept shapes Marianne's stake—not solving mysteries but magnifying the kindnesses hidden in neglected records. The button and dust patterns make the unknown partially legible, and the daughter's letter confirms that Marcus died believing his history was void. The concept constrains method (dust reading as historical recovery) and charges the ending, though it operates more as thematic frame than on-page tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Tactfully hopeful" governs the letter's restraint: Marianne doesn't claim the button is Marcus's father's, doesn't promise closure, simply "unfurls the facts." This caution prevents false hope while honoring the gesture's intent. The trait is tested when she drafts the letter, shaping word choice and emotional stance. The ending returns to it—"still broken-hearted, but tactfully hopeful, and that was enough"—reconfiguring the attribute as endurance rather than optimism. Visible cost: the refusal to promise more limits immediate consolation but preserves integrity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Unfurl" appears twice: Marianne "unfurls the facts as the dust had revealed them," and the final paragraph states "small kindnesses can unfurl across decades." The action captures her method—gradual, layered revelation rather than dramatic disclosure—and links dust-reading to the letter's careful presentation. It shapes the story's accumulative pressure and charges the ending's temporal reach. Swappability: "reveal" or "trace" could substitute with minor tonal loss, placing this in mid-band despite thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dust-reading is signaled immediately ("Marianne had learned to read dust the way others read books"), demonstrated in the button discovery (uniform surface dust vs. thinner interior dust reveals timing), and applied to trace the envelope's sealing sequence. The method constrains her conclusion: she can determine the button was added last but cannot name the soldier without cross-referencing manufacturer marks. It shapes three days of archival work and charges the final recognition that "histories, like dust, settle in patterns that can be read." Mechanics matter throughout and the method is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The file room anchors all action: "basement of the county building," metal shelves, sealed boxes, the seven-year retention law. It enables Marianne's access to Marcus's file and supplies the button itself (found inside the box). The setting's neglect—"dust on its cardboard flap told her no hand had disturbed it since...1987"—materializes the story's stake (forgotten children). The room functions more as static backdrop than dynamic pressure; it doesn't alter tactics mid-scene, though its archival logic constrains what Marianne can discover.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After emancipation" structures the file room's purpose (seven-year retention law) and Marcus's timeline (aged out 1987, died three years before the letter). The timeframe enables the posthumous irony at closure and explains why the button remained untouched for decades. However, the temporal pressure is retrospective rather than live: no urgent deadline shapes Marianne's choices, and the three-day research window isn't tracked as a constraint. Present in setup and payoff, but doesn't tighten decisions in the present action.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The motivation is stated early ("to magnify small kindnesses, to find the one human moment") and dramatized in Marianne's choice to honor the social worker's button preservation rather than solve the paternity mystery. It drives the three-day cross-reference effort and shapes the letter's restraint—she offers facts, not closure. The daughter's response confirms the magnification succeeded: the button felt "like a kind of emancipation from that belief." The motivation's specificity (magnify rather than solve) creates visible tradeoffs and charges the ending's recognition that "small kindnesses can unfurl across decades."</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Examined unknown" coheres through the dust-reading lens: Marianne studies erasure methodically, never forcing certainty. Tone modulates from archival precision (manufacturer marks, regiment records) to restrained emotion (daughter's letter, Marianne's "broken heart eased not by healing"). The ending sustains the tone—"tactfully hopeful" examination without resolution—charging the final image with quiet persistence. The tone's intellectual restraint and emotional honesty integrate across beats, though "examined" leans descriptive; a more active tonal choice might have pressured the closure harder.</comment>
