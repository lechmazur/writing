<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear—dock worker yearning for dance—but her interiority often substitutes lyric assertion ("her body a silhouette," "fortress of duty") for embodied contradiction under pressure. The guardian encounter offers a single micro-choice ("twisting away while offering her open palm") that reads as graceful choreography rather than a decision with visible cost or competing impulses. The final transformation into "dancer of the tide" feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle; no blind spot or mistake compounds before resolution. Embodied emotion is sparse; most feeling is narrated through metaphor rather than perception and gesture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the opening lines. The piece follows a causal-accumulative hybrid: scrimshaw summons whale → whale summons Mira → guardian encounter → unlocking → island retreat → return. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mira embraces her dancer identity and chooses the liminal life. Cost is stated ("world, for a moment, sang with her") but the price—what she forfeits by leaving the docks—remains abstract; no on-page consequence or foreclosed path is dramatized in the final beats. The lens holds, but the cost-proof test is soft.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe and disappearing island are vivid and purposeful, anchoring the liminal-space theme. Spatial choreography is clear (dock → skiff → island shore). The scrimshaw functions as micro-setting, constraining the guardian encounter and charging the final image when it "rested in her hand." However, the island itself does not pressure a choice; it offers sanctuary without obstacle. Sensory detail is selective and poetic but occasionally drifts toward postcard ("floating mound of sand and shadow") rather than lived texture. The warm sand and brine scent are effective but underused as tactical elements.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: Mira seeks freedom to dance, escape dock labor. The whale's call and guardian encounter provide one tightening moment ("combative tenderness that surprised them both"), but the guardian dissolves without resistance, eliminating conflict rather than escalating it. The island "began its retreat" is a atmospheric move, not a pressure point Mira must navigate. Agency at closure reads as acceptance rather than decision with trade-off; no live option is foreclosed with visible cost. Under the hybrid lens, one meaningful deepening is present (scrimshaw unlocks guardian) but escalation is gentle and cost remains implicit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—freedom through embracing true nature, the liminal as stage, strength/softness synthesis—emerges from event and image rather than statement until the closing lines tip toward articulation ("strength and softness are not enemies"). The scrimshaw and whale recur with reweighted meaning at closure. The final image of Mira as "dancer of the tide" offers resonance, though the whispered thank-you and thematic summary in the penultimate beats ("deepest locks are opened by the gentlest calls") edge toward overt moralizing. The piece invites reflection on liminality and self-discovery, but the post-violence world constraint feels ornamental rather than thematically integrated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mira; psychic distance modulates purposefully between close ("felt the island's pulse match her own heartbeat") and lyric remove ("a dancer's grace"). Perceptual signature leans poetic and dance-inflected ("body a silhouette," "arms tracing arcs"), though it occasionally slips into elevated register that doesn't feel earned by a dock worker's lexicon ("sublittoral fringe" is narratorial, not Mira's idiom). No dialogue is present. Prose rhythm supports the lyric-accumulative mode, but some figurative language feels decorative rather than voice-motivated. Internal thought formatting is consistent; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and some lines carry density ("The guardian reached out, not with a sword, but with a touch that was both threat and care"). However, the piece suffers from template cadence in the middle third: multiple sentences open with "She [verb]" or "The [noun]" without variation, and synonym loops appear ("the island began its retreat, sinking back into the deep" echoes "vanishing shore" and "disappearing island"). Stock metaphors cluster: "fortress of duty," "warm against her chest," "horizon without chains." Figurative language in peak beats (guardian dissolves into mist, island pulse) is legible but leans generic. Paraphrase loop: "her true nature was not in hauling crates but in the fluid motion of dance" restates the setup without added pressure. Filter verbs ("felt," "understood") stack in reflective passages. Artifacts touch the closure beat ("strength and softness are not enemies" reads didactic), triggering the −1.7 band and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The core premise—disappearing island as sanctuary after violence ends, scrimshaw that unlocks hearts—draws heavily on folklore and portal-fantasy templates without sharp transformation. Mira's arc (laborer discovers artistic soul) is familiar; the guardian's instant dissolution removes friction. The "combative tenderness" tone and sublittoral-fringe specificity offer small fresh angles, but the emotional trajectory and final image ("dancer of the tide, free because she finally embraced the truth") resolve predictably. No bold structural risk or synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. The post-violence timeframe is underused, functioning as backdrop rather than shaping stakes or world logic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and makes decisions (detaches rope, steps ashore, responds to guardian, returns to dock once). Her dock-worker identity frames her yearning but does not constrain a key choice with visible cost; she leaves without dramatized consequence. The "graceful" trait is shown in the guardian encounter but reads as choreography rather than pressure-driven action. Present across all three gates (setup, middle, closure) and drives two beats (detachment, guardian), but her choices feel enabled rather than hard-won. Causal role is present but swappable; another yearning archetype could fill the slot with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The scrimshaw appears early (caught in net at dawn), is handled in the guardian encounter (glows, unlocks heart), and rests in Mira's hand at closure as "a token of unlocked hearts." It enables the guardian's dissolution and charges the final image. Present in three beats (discovery, guardian touch, closure reprise) and supplies a specific mechanic (unlocking). However, the scrimshaw does not constrain a choice; it solves the guardian encounter without cost. Cost connection is weak; the scrimshaw is a key rather than a trade-off. Strong setup and closure participation lift it into mid-6s, but lack of trade-off pressure caps higher.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The disappearing island is seeded early ("a ghost of the old world"), arrives at midpoint, offers sanctuary, and retreats at closure. It shapes two beats (arrival/stepping ashore, retreat/riding the tide). However, the island functions as destination rather than obstacle; it does not narrow options or impose cost. The "vanishing shore" quality is atmospheric but does not create tactical pressure. Present in setup (legend), development (arrival), and payoff (retreat), with moderate causal work (enables Mira's transformation) but high swappability (any sanctuary could substitute). Causal and closure linkage lift it above ornamental, but lack of constraint caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The "unlocks guarded hearts" attribute is the scrimshaw's stated power and is demonstrated once when the guardian's hand brushes it, dissolving the guardian. This is a single beat use with no visible cost to Mira; the unlocking is a convenience rather than a trade-off. The attribute does not constrain Mira's choices or create friction. Present in setup (legend), middle (guardian), and payoff (token mention at closure), meeting all three gates. However, it resolves a problem (guardian) it did not help create, and the cost is borne by the guardian, not Mira. Functional but replaceable; any magical key could substitute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Detach" appears explicitly when Mira feels the urge and "the rope fell away," freeing the skiff. This action is a clear turn: it moves Mira from dock to sea, enabling the island journey. However, agency is blurred—"the rope fell away" reads as passive, and "the small skiff she had hidden for years" implies prior preparation rather than spontaneous choice under pressure. The detachment enables two subsequent beats (skiff journey, island arrival) but does not redefine options at closure; Mira could have chosen any departure mechanism. Present in development, shapes tactics, but swappable with minor edits (e.g., "untied," "cast off"). Mid-6s for causal role, capped by lack of closure-scene participation and ambiguous agency.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The whale's call is signaled early ("low moan of a whale rose from the deep"), triggers the scrimshaw's glow, and summons Mira to the island. It appears again at closure ("as the whale's call echoed once more") and Mira thanks the whale in the final beats. The method is present across all three gates and drives two beats (initial summons, closure echo). However, the mechanics are vague—how the call works, why Mira alone responds—and the call does not constrain tactics; it is invitation rather than test. The final whisper ("whispered a thank you to the whale") is reflective, not action. Setup and closure participation are strong, but lack of tactical pressure and specificity cap it in mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe is named and described ("where the tide painted silver ribbons over jagged rocks," "where water kisses land") and serves as the threshold where the island appears and Mira's final transformation is anchored. It is present in setup (description), development (island appearance), and payoff (Mira's stage). The fringe supplies atmospheric charge and thematic resonance (liminality) but does not constrain a choice or alter tactics; the jagged rocks are not navigated, the tide does not block or enable. Micro-setting as conceptual space rather than tactical pressure. Closure linkage is present ("In the sublittoral fringe... Mira found her stage") but swappable with any liminal zone. Mid-5s for thematic resonance, capped by lack of causal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "after violence becomes impossible" is stated in the opening ("the war was a distant echo, replaced by treaties and trade") and mentioned once more ("a sanctuary for those who sought freedom after the age of violence"). It does not shape stakes, constrain choices, or pressure tactics on the page. The post-violence world is backdrop; Mira's conflict (labor vs. dance) and the guardian encounter could occur in any peaceful era. No causal work, no closure participation. Setup is present, but development and payoff gates are missing. Ornamental use; swappable with any peaceful setting. Label-only mention without dramatized consequence.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Mira's motivation—"to find freedom in embracing one's true nature"—is seeded early ("hiding her true love for dance"), tested in the guardian encounter (combative tenderness as self-expression), and fulfilled at closure ("understood... her true nature was not in hauling crates but in the fluid motion of dance"). The desire drives three beats (rope detachment, guardian encounter, final transformation) and is present across all gates. However, the friction between want and cost is weak; no on-page sacrifice or trade-off dramatizes the price of leaving the docks. The realization is told ("she understood") rather than shown through embodied choice under pressure. Causal and closure linkage are strong, but lack of visible cost and tell-heavy execution cap it in mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Combative tenderness" is demonstrated once in the guardian encounter ("twisting away while offering her open palm, a combative tenderness that surprised them both") and echoed in the whale's teaching ("strength and softness are not enemies"). The tone is coherent in that moment but does not modulate with pressure or appear consistently through other turns; most beats (rope detachment, island arrival, return to dock) read as lyric yearning without the combative element. Setup is implicit, development has one clear beat, payoff is thematic echo rather than tonal charge. Functional in one beat but not sustained; swappable with "graceful defiance" or similar. Mid-5s for single-beat demonstration, capped by lack of tonal control across the arc.</comment>
