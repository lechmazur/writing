<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The performer's morally ambiguous role (informing on neighbors) is present but yields no on-page dramatized cost—the dog-reporting is announced, not enacted with visible friction. Interior life consists largely of abstract declarations ("grief pooled like dark water," "emotional void") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The whittling and dramatic narration are repeated gestures, but they do not escalate or force a meaningful trade-off; the final wooden figurine placed on the windowsill feels like a symbolic coda rather than a choice that forecloses a path with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early and are stable. The piece infers an Accumulative/Textural lens: the performer's nightly rituals accumulate texture, and the ending offers a Conceptual Repricing ("the remade hush was not a silence to be broken, but a canvas on which to carve the quiet art of survival"). However, the closure realization is asserted in explanatory summary rather than shown through a decisive image that reweights prior material with visible cost. The dog episode mid-story does not causally alter the performer's stance or tactics; it remains an illustrative vignette. Cost remains conceptual and told rather than felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The farmhouse, wind turbines, and wooden figurines are vivid and recur across beats, charging the atmosphere. The turbines' "relentless hum" and "massive shadows" pressure the performer's routines and recur in the final image. The knife, pine block, and dried bouquet function as micro-setting tools that the performer handles repeatedly, grounding the rituals. However, spatial choreography within the farmhouse is vague—no clear room layout or distance cues—and the turbines remain postcard backdrop rather than a constraint that alters a tactical choice on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"cultivate lightness in grief"—is signaled early but remains abstract across the arc. The performer's nightly whittling and narration are repeated without escalation or a tightening choice that narrows options. The dog episode could have introduced a moral pressure point (report vs. mercy), but the decision to report is declared in summary without dramatized friction or visible cost. No meaningful reversal or deepening occurs; the final placement of the figurine on the windowsill does not foreclose a live option or impose a felt trade-off under the inferred Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The theme of survival and meaning-making in a world of enforced erasure emerges organically from the whittling, narration, and dried flowers. The "remade hush" recurs and shifts meaning, and the moral ambiguity (informant role) adds complexity. However, the final paragraph summarizes the theme in direct statements ("a living paradox of grief and lightness, whittling hope from the wood of despair"), replacing scene pressure with thesis. The closing image (figurine on windowsill, bouquet as dust) carries lyric weight, but the explanatory coda dilutes resonance by telling what the prior particulars already implied.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable, and the narrative voice carries a distinct, elevated register ("phantom limbs of a forgotten world," "brittle as the promises"). Perceptual filtering is consistent: the performer notices turbines, shavings, petals. No head-hopping or POV leakage. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstract literariness ("emotional void," "fleeting lightness") that sits slightly outside the performer's lived experience under pressure, and the final paragraphs shift toward explanatory summary rather than maintaining the performer's immediate perceptual lens through the closure beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn are pervasive: "remade hush" / "not quite silence"; "emotional void" / "hollow echo"; "blank canvas" / "bare canvas"; "grief pooled" / "weight of loss" / "heavy air of grief." Template cadence runs appear in the opening ("The blank faced performer stood… Their blades turned… After the happiness mandate…"). The figurative density is high but often mixed or decorative ("turbines as scissors cutting the sky," "shavings fall like silent confessions") without clear vehicle logic. Sentence openings vary little ("The performer…" recurs across many paragraphs). These artifacts pervade the piece and touch the closure beats, dulling propulsion. Apply −1.4 in Q7 for spread and closure-beat presence; disallow 9+ globally and cap high-band entries at 8.8 per the artifact pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The happiness-mandate dystopia and blank-faced performer are familiar premises. The combination of whittling + dramatic narration + informant role offers a fresh angle, and the dried bouquet as lost-lover token is specific. However, the emotional arc and final image (figurine on windowsill, continued survival) do not transform the template in hindsight; the story could function with similar beats in many post-mandate settings. The morally ambiguous informant role is under-explored on the page, reducing its transformative potential. No bold structural risk heightens stakes; the piece plays it safe within the established frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The blank-faced performer is the sole on-page character and is present throughout. Setup and development gates are met (whittles, narrates, interacts with dog). However, the performer's choices do not create key turns; actions are repeated rituals (whittle, narrate, report) without escalation or a decisive pivot. The final act (placing figurine on windowsill) is observation without a choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. Functional but does not drive causality.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dried flower bouquet appears early (first third), is handled in multiple beats (whispered to, petal pressed, placed in vase, noted as "almost dust"), and returns in the final image charged with loss and the passage of time. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The bouquet is tied to the lost lover and the emotional void, reweighting meaning at closure. However, it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure; its role is lyric reprise rather than causal. Score reflects strong lyric integration with closure linkage but no visible cost or decision tied to it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The "remade hush" is named repeatedly (opening, midpoint, final paragraphs) and frames the world post-mandate. It is present early and shapes the atmosphere. However, it remains thematic backdrop rather than a stake that alters tactics or choices on the page; the performer's actions (whittling, narrating) are responses to the hush but do not test or redefine it through conflict. The concept echoes at closure but does not constrain a decision or enable a turn. One key thematic beat, but no causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The morally ambiguous informant role is mentioned twice (reports neighbors' complaints, will report the dog). Setup gate is met (first third), but development and payoff are absent: the reporting is summarized, not dramatized, and yields no visible on-page friction or cost. The trait is label-only; we never see the performer wrestle with the choice or face consequences. Swappable with minimal edits; the story's arc would hold without it. Cap at 3.8 for swappability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Whittling is signaled early, recurs across multiple beats (nightly ritual, carving bone for dog, final figurine on windowsill), and anchors the performer's meaning-making. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The whittling embodies the dominant stake ("cultivate lightness") and is tied to the closure image. However, the act does not drive a major turn or decision that narrows options; it is repeated ritual rather than escalating action. Essential across beats and ending, but not indispensable to story logic. Two beats plus closure linkage, moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Dramatically narrating mundane tasks is mentioned in paragraph 7 ("turning sweeping the porch or boiling water into epic monologues") and paragraph 15 ("turning the simple ritual into a soliloquy of steam and leaves"). Setup gate is met (first third). However, the method is described rather than enacted—we are told the performer does this, but no monologue appears on the page, and it does not shape a choice or outcome. Development and payoff gates are missing. Functional background detail, no causal work. Cap at 4.6 for missing setup demonstration and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The farmhouse and giant wind turbines are anchored early, recur across beats (opening, midpoint, final image), and charge the atmosphere with the "relentless hum" and "massive shadows." Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The turbines frame the performer's isolation and the "remade hush." However, the setting does not constrain a choice or provide a resource that alters tactics; it remains evocative backdrop. The farmhouse interior is vague (no spatial choreography). One key atmospheric beat at closure, but no causal pressure. Lyric reprise without decision impact.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The "after the happiness mandate" timeframe is established in paragraph 3 and recurs as context (blank faces, enforced smiles). Setup gate is met. The timeframe provides historical backdrop and explains the performer's rituals, but it does not function as a live clock that tightens decisions or alters tactics within the story window. Development and payoff are thematic only; no scene-level urgency or deadline tied to the mandate's ongoing enforcement. One thematic beat, no temporal pressure on choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The motivation "to cultivate lightness in grief" is named explicitly (paragraph 4) and dramatized through the whittling, narration, and interaction with the dried bouquet. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The final image (figurine on windowsill, continued effort) reflects the motivation. However, the desire is not conflicted in choices on the page—no visible friction between the pursuit of lightness and a competing want or cost. The motivation shapes attempts but does not drive a turn. One key beat at closure, moderate specificity, no visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "emotional void" tone is established early ("blank faced," "stripped," "void") and recurs across beats ("hollow echo," "heavy air," "emotional void," "fleeting lightness"). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. The tone modulates slightly as the performer narrates and whittles, then returns to stillness at closure. However, the tone is asserted through labels rather than embodied through action and perception under pressure; the final image ("blank faced performer lived on") restates the void rather than charging it with new cost. Coherent through turns, charges the final image moderately, but static in execution.</comment>
