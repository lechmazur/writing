<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and her arc from certainty to humility is earned, but her interior voice leans toward abstraction ("the weight of her yearning," "edifice crumbled"). Moira's "shrewdly innocent" expression is label-only without embodied contradiction. The final choice to collaborate feels mechanically resolved without visible friction or cost in the moment. Emotional progression is mostly coherent but lacks messy irrationality under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Elena accepts her failure and commits to correction, foreclosing her former career stance. The lens reads Causal with some Accumulative layering (garden as metaphor), held cleanly. Orientation anchors arrive promptly. One meaningful turn (the tooth's arrival reframes the entire premise) tightens options. Cost is visible—undoing three decades of work—but felt more through summary than a single charged image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The secret garden and hedge maze anchor the final scene with vivid, purposeful detail (morning glories, cracked sundial, moss-covered bench). The telescope aimed at blooms rather than stars charges the closure image by reweighting the "constellation" motif. However, the quarry and MacLeod estate exterior remain generic placeholders. Spatial choreography is clean and the garden's hidden status subtly mirrors the suppressed truth.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Elena's need to reconcile her career with truth—is signaled early and tightens when the tooth arrives. The confrontation with Moira narrows options: collaborate or remain silent. Cost is explicit (career dismantling) but the final beat resolves smoothly without a painful trade-off in the moment. One meaningful deepening occurs when Clara's parents' story surfaces, raising moral stakes. Agency is present but the protagonist's internal struggle feels summarized rather than embodied in a decisive act.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the tooth, garden, and "constellations" motif: certainty as cruelty, mistakes as navigational aids. "Failure is just the first draft of memory" risks platitude but is earned by Moira's lived experience. The telescope-on-blooms image offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in Moira's "shrewdly innocent" gaze and the hedge maze as structural metaphor. Minor slip: "bone setting" metaphor is overexplained in the penultimate paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds steady on Elena with clean focalization; no head-hopping. Diction is generally controlled, though some phrases drift into abstraction ("cleft in certainty wide enough to swallow," "edifice crumbled"). Moira's dialogue carries subtext ("certainty is a kind of cruelty"), but Elena's internal voice occasionally flattens into summary. Perceptual signature is present but not sharply character-specific. The final telescope passage shifts toward lyric register purposefully, supporting the thematic turn.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clean with varied rhythm, but several artifacts lower the grade: "yearning" appears twice in adjacent paragraphs, "bone setting" is over-explained, and "edifice crumbled" + "cleft in certainty" lean purple. Template phrasing: "She found... She pushed... Elena saw..." runs in the garden entrance sequence. Information density is high in the tooth revelation but sags in the reflective middle. The final telescope image is vivid and propulsive. No major loops, but figurative language clusters without pattern-teaching in the closure beat (−0.4).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The changeling/folklore forensics premise is fresh, and the twist (uncle's abduction, not fairies) subverts expectation. The garden telescope aimed at morning glories rather than stars is a specific, non-obvious image. However, the emotional arc—expert confronts career-defining mistake, chooses humility—is familiar. The "constellations of mistakes" metaphor is purposeful but borders on over-articulation. Moira's voice and the tooth's forensic detail add specificity. Risk-taking is present in the lyric telescope ending but not bold enough to elevate further.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Elena is the forgiving skeptic: she doubted supernatural elements yet clung to structural "truth," and she forgives Moira for shattering her theory. Present in opening frame, drives the meeting, and her final choice (collaboration) closes the story. However, "forgiving" is more told than shown through a difficult on-page choice. Middle development is thin—she mostly listens. Closure participation is strong. Two gates (setup, payoff) plus weak middle; causal role in ending earns mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The baby tooth appears in the opening frame, drives Elena's visit (causal pressure), and Moira handles it physically in the garden ("rolling it between her fingers like a worry stone"). It returns verbally in the ending as symbol of evidence. Three beats, early signal, closure linkage, and irreplaceability (DNA + carbon dating) all present. Cost connection is strong: the tooth shatters Elena's career. Slightly swappable (any forensic artifact could serve), preventing top band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"A cleft in certainty" is explicitly named in the fourth paragraph and drives Elena's journey from dogma to doubt. It shapes the dominant stake (reconciling certainty with new evidence) and alters her final choice. However, it functions more as thematic frame than tactical constraint—no scene choice hinges on navigating uncertainty in real time. Early setup, thematic presence, and closure resonance earn mid-band; lack of beat-level pressure caps higher.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Shrewdly innocent" is applied to Moira's eyes twice but remains label-only without embodied contradiction or tactical use. The trait does not constrain a choice or enable a reversal; it decorates her characterization. No visible tradeoff tied to the attribute. Present in setup and ending (two touches), but ornamental. Late explicit naming and lack of causal work keep it low-functional.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Yearning appears explicitly twice: Elena "yearned for and feared this moment" and later references "the weight of her yearning." It motivates the garden visit and her vulnerability to Moira's proposition. However, the action is told rather than embodied in a struggling choice. The final collaboration flows smoothly without visible friction. Early setup, causal role in one major beat (the visit), and closure presence earn mid-6s; swappable with "seeking" or "needing" prevents higher.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Bone setting" is introduced midway as metaphor for "reassembling skeletons" and "setting right the broken structure of narrative." It recurs in the final paragraph ("the delicate work of bone setting") to frame the collaboration. Lyric reprise reweights the closure, but the method is not signaled early or used tactically in a beat. Two touches (middle reflection, ending), thematic resonance, but no causal pressure or mechanics that shape attempts. Reprise pattern earns low-5s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The secret garden behind the hedge maze is signaled in the opening, drives Elena's spatial goal, and hosts the entire confrontation with Moira. The maze entrance, sundial, telescope, and morning glories furnish the closure image. Three beats (approach, meeting, telescope moment), early setup, and closure charge. The garden's hidden status mirrors suppressed truth. Strong spatial constraint and thematic resonance, though slightly generic as "secret garden" trope. Irreplaceability moderate; still, essential across beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"After the substitute body was found" anchors the opening and "yesterday" arrival of the tooth creates immediate pressure. Timeline is loose thereafter—"thirty-five years later," "last year"—but the meeting occurs in one continuous present. Time does not tighten tactics in scene; no clock forces urgency. Setup present, closure frame stable, but middle lacks temporal pressure. Two gates (setup, ending continuity) without escalation use earn mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To turn mistakes into constellations" is Elena's stated goal, voiced explicitly and revisited in the telescope moment where she sees "a map not of certainties, but corrections." The desire drives her visit and frames the ending collaboration. However, it is told more than dramatized in a conflicted choice—no visible friction between yearning for redemption and fear of exposure. Early setup, middle articulation, and closure resonance present. Causal role in one beat (visit motivation) and thematic charge earn upper-6s; lack of visible internal struggle caps higher.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Tone blends reflective gravity (thirty-five-year reckoning, career collapse) with tentative hope (morning glories, "something better from the bones"). The telescope-on-blooms image innovates the "constellation" motif. Nostalgic: the garden "she remembered only from old photographs." Innovative: folklore forensics, lyric telescope ending. Tone modulates from dread to collaborative possibility without jarring shifts. Coherent through turns and charges the final image. Not static but also not a pronounced cadence shift under pressure; the hopeful ending feels slightly tidy for the weight of loss.</comment>
