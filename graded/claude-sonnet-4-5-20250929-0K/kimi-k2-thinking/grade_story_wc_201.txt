<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elena's proprioceptive enhancement is mentioned repeatedly but never meaningfully constrains a choice or creates visible friction. Her trauma responses are described rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The interrogation backstory floods the present frame without altering present tactics—she walks, braces, recites numbers, but none of these actions foreclose options or reveal contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. The final "understanding" that mercy must be lived arrives as assertion rather than through a choice that costs her something on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed and vague: who Elena is, where this forest exists in relation to the interrogation, and what timeframe governs her survival remain unclear past the 120-word threshold, triggering the Orientation Test penalty. The drive lens appears Accumulative/Textural (UV light, forest hum, pewter strap recur), but no meaningful tightening or deepening occurs—she walks, remembers, recites, and concludes without a decisive change or felt cost. The ending assertion "mercy was not to be calculated, but to be lived" substitutes for an on-page reconfiguration; no visible price is paid, no option foreclosed. Closure form (RR or CR) is attempted but lacks legible cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (moss compression, ozone scent, violet haze, UV lamps), and the pewter strap functions as a tactile anchor. The setting recurs across beats and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement of environment participation. However, spatial choreography is loose—Elena's position and movement through the forest lack clear progression—and the forest does not meaningfully constrain a choice or alter her tactics; it remains backdrop for internal reflection.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering the mathematics of mercy—is signaled early but never tested through a choice that narrows options or imposes cost. Elena walks, braces, and recites without facing a reversal or trade-off; her "realization" at the end is an intellectual conclusion, not an earned turn driven by her agency. No escalation or deepening occurs under the Accumulative lens; the UV light and memories recur without building pressure or forecloses a path. The ending offers no visible or felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The theme of mercy as pattern versus formula emerges through recurrent images (UV light, pewter strap, proprioceptive mapping), and the piece attempts a Conceptual Repricing at closure. However, the final paragraph moralizes explicitly—"mercy was not to be calculated, but to be lived, one breath at a time"—substituting thematic summary for earned resonance. The mathematics metaphor (ratios, variables, coefficients) is repeated without transformation or irony. Thematic Echo in the final lines triggers a −0.6 deduction in this category.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent elevated register and sensory focus throughout, with some perceptual specificity ("each flicker an echo," "textured surface a tactile anchor"). However, diction drifts into abstraction and academic idiom under pressure ("proprioceptively enhanced," "geometry of grace," "coefficient," "variable"), which feels unmotivated by Elena's interiority. Filter verbs cluster in high-pressure beats ("she felt," "she realized," "she understood"), dulling immediacy. The final paragraph's shift to summary mode ("And as the light intensified, she understood") breaks the established texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the text: "brace" appears six times across adjacent paragraphs without added pressure; "UV light" and "ultraviolet" cycle interchangeably; "mercy" is redefined in nearly identical terms three times. Template cadence runs dominate ("She [verb], [object]" structure repeats across a dozen sentences). Stock metaphors ("wave of heat," "violet fire," "shroud") appear without fresh inflection. These artifacts touch the closure beat ("she understood: mercy was not to be calculated"), triggering a −1.7 baseline penalty and disallowing 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The core premise—trauma survivor seeking mathematical proof of mercy in a UV-lit ritual forest—offers a striking synthesis, but the execution retreads familiar trauma-processing and epiphany arcs without transformation. The "mathematics of mercy" conceit is asserted rather than dramatized through specific calculus; Elena's proprioceptive enhancement and the pewter strap could be replaced with generic anchors without structural loss. The ending's realization ("mercy is written in the language of survival") echoes self-help idiom rather than offering a fresh, non-obvious synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elena is present throughout and her survivor status frames the narrative, but she makes no key choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path. She observes, remembers, and concludes without agency-driven turns. Present in setup, middle reflection, and ending assertion, meeting two gates, but lacks causal pressure or closure participation beyond presence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The pewter strap appears in three distinct beats: found in her pocket early, gripped as tactile anchor mid-story, and its imprint felt on her palm near the end. It recurs with slight reweighting (muffled screams → focus → talisman) and is present in the final paragraph, meeting all three gates. However, it does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under stress; it remains a symbolic touchstone rather than an active agent.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Ultraviolet penance is introduced early as a ritual ("expose skin, let UV strip away guilt") and the UV light recurs across beats, shaping Elena's remembering process. It is present in the closure image ("ultraviolet glow wrapping around her"). However, the concept does not change her options or force a choice; she moves through it without resistance or cost. Functional but replaceable with any sensory-catalyst framework.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Proprioceptive enhancement is mentioned five times but never constrains or enables an on-page action with visible cost. Elena "feels the moss compress under the precise pressure," catches "the subtle shift in her weight," and treats "her body as a calibrated instrument," but these descriptions do not alter her tactics or create friction. Label-only trait without demonstrated tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Brace" appears six times across the narrative, marking moments when memory threatens to overwhelm. It is present in setup, middle beats, and the final third, meeting all three gates. However, bracing does not redefine her options or drive a turn; it is a repeated coping gesture rather than a pivotal action. Swappable with "steady" or "anchor" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Remembering through trauma responses is signaled early ("each flash of pain pointing toward a forgotten detail") and recurs in the middle when UV light "unleashed a memory." The method is present in the ending when she recites numbers and lets memories flood. However, the mechanics remain vague—how trauma responses unlock memory is asserted, not demonstrated through specific attempt-and-adjustment. Present across all gates but lacks causal specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The ultraviolet forest is vividly rendered and present from the opening line through the final image. It recurs with shifting meaning (interrogation echo → measurement tool → home) and charges the closure metaphor. The forest does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome, but the purposeful early-to-final reprise reweights the dominant stake under the Accumulative lens. Lyric-resonance allowance lifts this into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the anesthesia wears off" anchors the opening and Elena notes "the anesthesia had worn off" near the end, providing a before/after marker. However, no clock tightens her decisions or tactics; elapsed time remains untracked and does not pressure her choices. Present in setup and mentioned at closure but does not shape escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Elena's desire to discover the mathematics of mercy is stated early ("she wanted to discover the mathematics of mercy") and recurs in her recitation of numbers and final realization. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices; she pursues it without friction between want and cost. Present across all gates but lacks on-page struggle or visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>The tone of "displaced rooted" (Elena is "rooted in the forest, yet displaced from the world she once knew") is established early and maintained throughout with consistent elevated diction and sensory estrangement. The tone modulates slightly from violet haze to "raw clarity" and charges the final image ("ultraviolet glow wrapping around her like a shroud"). Coherent through turns and present in closure, meeting all gates and achieving mid-6s under accumulative texture.</comment>
