<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to ground the seven sailors is legible and her final acceptance ("not gone; they were architecture now") shows a stance shift. However, interiority leans heavily on figurative abstraction rather than embodied contradiction—"lucid unrest," "calcified in her throat," "restless spirits…pressure she had carried" are more poetic than character-particular. The core choice (to unravel despite her mentor's warning) is present but the interior conflict reads as retrospective summary rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Micro-choices exist (lifting the needle, speaking the secret) but the embodied cost remains conceptual rather than viscerally felt on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (Elara, mask restorer) and where (prism sanctuary) early; "tonight" establishes when. The story follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density increases as each knot releases a memory, culminating in the pearl as compressed silence with conceptual cost. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the spirits become "architecture" in her bones, the net hung as forgiveness)—the final image reweights prior material and forecloses the path of carrying alone. The cost is felt but abstract; pointing to "redistributing—seven souls finding their names again in her breath" as the on-page cost moment. No causal breaks, one meaningful deepening across the unraveling sequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary is vividly rendered (fractured walls, spectral geometry, starlight refraction) and returns at closure ("hung the empty net across the sanctuary doorway, where starlight could pass through"). The net itself functions as micro-setting, though its physical properties (weight, texture, spatial position) remain generic. The pearl at the ending charges the final image but does not constrain a prior choice. Setting details are filtered through Elara's professional lens (mask restorer, tapestry needle) but spatial choreography during the unraveling is vague—where she sits, how she moves, how the net is positioned. Meets the 9+ gate narrowly via the net and starlight at closure, but lacks the tactical constraint needed for the high 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (ground the restless spirits) is signaled early and coherent throughout. One meaningful tightening occurs as Elara begins the forbidden method and each knot releases a memory, narrowing her path back. The final knot ("figure-eight of perfect fear") reweights the stake by revealing the pearl—silence compressed into tangible form—and the spirits settle "into the hollows of her bones." Under the Accumulative lens, this deepening is sufficient and the cost is legible: she redistributes the weight rather than erasing it, foreclosing the option of carrying alone. Agency is clear (her choice to unravel despite the mentor's warning) but the pressure feels more iterative than escalating; each knot is a beat but they read as parallel rather than compounding.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (silence as burden and shared architecture, brokenness as covenant) emerges from the net, masks, and pearl without overt thesis. The final image—"ground beneath her feet felt solid, anchored by the restless spirits who had finally come home"—offers a resonant answer to the question of how to carry grief. The pearl as "accumulated silence…no longer a burial but a birth" reweights prior material. One minor slip: "the brokenness wasn't in the asking, but in the carrying alone" verges on thematic echo but is embedded in Elara's realization rather than narrator moralizing. The masks-as-vessels motif ("Each mask could become a small sanctuary") transforms the premise without forcing it. No false binaries, and the ending resists tidy moral in favor of earned wisdom.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Elara, psychic distance consistent. Perceptual signature is present (mask restorer's lens, "leather patch," "porcelain, wood, feathered things") but diction drifts into elevated register under pressure: "calcified in her throat," "lucid unrest," "spectral geometry" feel writerly rather than character-particular. Sentence rhythm is controlled but syntactic patterns repeat (noun + prepositional phrase + abstract clause). No dialogue to judge. The net/pearl handling is legible but the line "interlaced hush was not empty; it was full of everything unsaid" reads as narrator intrusion rather than Elara's thought. Free indirect style is mostly clean; one filter-verb stack in the opening paragraph ("She was…She lifted…She had been") but not enough to disqualify 9+.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>High figurative density without pattern-teaching: "drank starlight," "mosaic of scars," "knots dense as grief," "silence accumulated from drowned voices," "pressure she had carried," "calcified in her throat," "redistributing," "architecture now"—nearly every sentence in the first half carries metaphor, many mixed (silence accumulates *and* calcifies? spirits are pressure *and* architecture?). Template cadence in the unraveling section: "The first knot…The second knot held…the third…" reads mechanical. Paraphrase loop: "interlaced hush" appears three times with slight synonym churn (silence/hush/quiet). Clarity remains mostly intact but momentum drags under the ornamental load. Apply −0.6 for density without payoff, −0.4 for template cadence, capped at −1.0 cumulative per the artifact penalty pack. Some strong images ("tapestry needle…eye glinting like a miniature moon") but overwriting pervades.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Core premise (mask restorer unraveling a grief-soaked net to release drowned sailors) is a fresh synthesis of restoration craft and spiritual reckoning. The net-as-map and pearl-as-compressed-silence offer specific rather than generic transformation. However, the emotional arc (survivor guilt → acceptance through ritual unburdening) follows a familiar template, and the final pivot—"brokenness wasn't in the asking, but in the carrying alone"—lands close to self-help idiom. The prism sanctuary and tapestry needle are distinctive anchors. Risk-taking is present (the accumulative structure, the extended figurative language) but does not heighten stakes so much as obscure them. No proximity echoes detected. Transformation test: the arc could transfer to another craft (pottery restorer, weaver) with minor edits, suggesting mid-range originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara (broken mask restorer) is present throughout and her choices drive key turns: she lifts the needle, begins the forbidden method, speaks her secret, unravels each knot, and hangs the net at closure. Her profession colors perception (masks as vessels, tapestry needle, restoration work) and the final decision to set the pearl into a mask's brow links craft to stakes. Setup in paragraph one, middle development across the unraveling sequence, and payoff at closure (she will begin a new mask, be there to help others). Causal pressure is clear; the element is indispensable to the logic. Specific cost: she redistributes the spirits' weight into her own structure. No swappability; "restorer" is load-bearing for the theme.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The tapestry needle appears twice: "She lifted the tapestry needle, its eye glinting like a miniature moon" (early) and "The tapestry needle she placed on her bench…gleaming with the residual hush" (final third). Both mentions are descriptive rather than causal; the needle does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic—the unraveling is done by hand ("her hands moved"), not needle-work. The needle's "eye" and "moonlight" imagery charge the tone but it never functions as a tool in the action. Lyric reprise is present but without mid-scene use or causal pressure. Meets two gates (setup, closure cameo) but not middle development. Cap at 6.0 per guidance; lower for ornamental use and swappability (any fine tool could substitute).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Interlaced hush" (the core concept of accumulated silence woven into the net's knots) shapes stakes and tactics on the page. The concept is introduced early ("each knot held an interlaced hush, silence accumulated from drowned voices"), drives the middle action (unraveling releases memories and voices), and reweights at closure ("interlaced hush had been a prison; its unraveling, a return to the natural quiet"). The method (unraveling knots) is directly tied to the concept. Visible cost: Elara risks "becoming the threadbare thing yourself" and must carry the spirits as internal architecture. The concept is irreplaceable; removing it would collapse the logic. Slightly abstract but not merely thematic—it dictates the mechanics of exhumation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The attribute "accumulates silence" is embedded in the net's knots and Elara's decades-long burden. It enables the central action (silence compressed into the pearl) and constrains her: "the silence of her failure had woven itself into the net." The trait appears early, recurs in the unraveling sequence, and pays off at closure (the pearl as "accumulated silence…no longer a burial but a birth"). One visible tradeoff: the spirits' silence becomes Elara's internal architecture, redistributing rather than erasing the weight. The attribute is specific but risks abstraction—"accumulates" is more conceptual than embodied. Meets all three gates; causal pressure and closure linkage are clear.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Exhume" (truth by unraveling knots) is the story's spine: signaled early ("the method her mentor had forbidden: exhuming truth by unraveling knots"), drives every middle beat (each knot releases a memory, Elara speaks her secret), and completes at closure (final knot yields the pearl, spirits are exhumed into her bones). The action is irreplaceable—swapping "exhume" for "reveal" or "release" would lose the resurrection/disinterment charge that links to grounding the dead. Visible cost: the mentor's warning ("to unravel them was to risk becoming the threadbare thing yourself") is paid on the page as Elara becomes the net that holds. Strong setup, development, and payoff; specific mechanics (knot by knot) matter.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The method (unraveling knots in the centuries-old fisherman's net) is signaled early, its mechanics detailed (each knot releases a memory, "first…second…third…final knot"), and the net's history (dragged up empty after the spiral storm of '93) anchors the stakes. The method constrains Elara's approach—she cannot shortcut, must address each knot sequentially—and its completion yields the pearl. The net returns at closure, hung "across the sanctuary doorway, where starlight could pass through its open weave like forgiveness." Setup, development, and payoff are all present; the method is load-bearing and irreplaceable. Slight deduction for the mechanical template cadence in the unraveling sequence, but causal pressure and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary is introduced early ("drank starlight through its fractured walls, casting spectral geometry"), returns at closure ("hung the empty net across the sanctuary doorway"), and its function (to refract singular into shared) is thematized ("prism sanctuary had been built for this"). However, the setting does not constrain a tactical choice during the unraveling—Elara could perform the ritual elsewhere. The starlight provides atmosphere and charges the final image but does not alter her options. Meets setup and payoff gates; middle development is thematic rather than causal. The space is vivid but replaceable without breaking the plot. Lyric reprise lifts it toward 6.9 but not beyond, per the allowance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "across sharing a secret" is embedded in the unraveling sequence: Elara speaks her secret ("I was afraid") into the loosening twine, and the action spans "until dawn's first suggestion." However, the secret-sharing is a single early beat rather than a tightening constraint across the arc. The work "until dawn" provides loose temporal bounds but does not create urgency—no live clock alters her tactics. The secret (her paralysis during the storm) is backstory context rather than an on-page decision under time pressure. Functional presence but not causal; swappable with "across one night's work" without structural loss. Meets setup (the secret is named) and closure (dawn arrives) but middle development is weak.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to ground the restless spirits is introduced early ("the restless spirits of seven sailors thrummed beneath her fingertips"), drives every beat (unraveling to release them, speaking her secret, accepting their weight), and resolves at closure ("the restless spirits who had finally come home"). The desire faces friction: her mentor forbade the method, and the cost is becoming "the threadbare thing yourself." Visible tradeoff: the spirits are not erased but become "architecture now, the underlying structure" of Elara. The motivation is irreplaceable—removing it collapses the stakes. One minor issue: the want (to free them) versus the cost (to carry them differently) could be sharpened into more direct contradiction on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Tone ("lucid unrest") is signaled early in the phrase "her hands moved with the lucid unrest of someone finally awake inside a long nightmare" and modulates across the arc—lyrical and meditative during setup, intensifying as knots release memories, settling into quiet resolve at closure. The final image (walking home "through the waking village, her scars silvered with starlight residue") maintains the tone's spectral clarity. However, the tone is more consistent than dynamic; it does not shift decisively under peak pressure. The phrasing "lucid unrest" is apt but abstract, more thematic label than embodied quality. Meets all three gates and charges the final image but does not deeply constrain choices or escalate with plot pressure.</comment>
