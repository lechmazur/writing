<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The poet remains an abstraction throughout—labeled as "ethically playful" and driven by "passionate subtlety," but these traits never constrain an on-page choice with visible cost. Interior life consists of generalized philosophical musing ("He wondered if the energy beings had left this place as a test") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-decisions under pressure. The climactic non-choice—"he decided to carry the rope onward"—forecloses nothing and costs nothing legible on the page. Motivation is declared but never dramatized through conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation remains vague past the opening (who is this poet? what prison? when did he escape?) without clear payoff at closure. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens but never tightens or deepens meaningfully; the poet enters with a rope, considers weaving it into the wall versus carrying it, and then carries it—no reversal, no narrowing of options, no felt cost. The ending gesture ("he would again uncover layers") resets to the premise rather than reconfiguring it. No Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing is legible; the dominant stake—discovering time's texture—is never tested or risked on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The terra-cotta grotto and starlight anchor setting early, but details remain postcard-static—"walls seemed to breathe," "sediment band a page in a book"—without constraining a choice or charging the closure. The rope is handled minimally (coiled, trailed) and its frayed state is described rather than used tactically. Spatial choreography is clear, but the environment never presses the protagonist or supplies resources that alter outcome, keeping the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to discover the texture of time"—is signaled early but never tested by a meaningful tightening or cost. The poet could use the rope to escape or weave it into the wall, yet he chooses a third option (carry it onward) that sidesteps both, foreclosing no path and risking nothing. Pressure remains static from entry to exit; no reversal, no trade-off, no on-page price. Agency is entirely internal and costless, consistent with the Accumulative lens but lacking the requisite deepening or cadence shift.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme—time's texture, impossible choices—is stated repeatedly in poetic abstractions ("every fray is a door, every knot a home") rather than emerging from concrete action or image. The ending delivers a thematic summary ("the texture of time, now his companion") in place of a resonant non-literal answer. Motifs (rope, frayed ends, layers) recur but do not constrain choice or accumulate pressure toward closure; they function as decorative recurrence. No earned insight arises from specific struggle on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Voice remains stable and carries a consistent lyric register, but diction drifts into elevated abstraction ("passionate subtlety," "ethically playful reverence," "impossible choices shimmer like mirages") that feels authored rather than filtered through the poet's lived perception. Perceptual signature is generic—"he wondered," "he realized," "he felt"—without character-specific bias. No dialogue. The prose texture is uniform across emotional beats, missing the modulation or compression under pressure that would elevate voice control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Pervasive paraphrase loops and template cadence: "He could use it to climb...Alternatively, he could weave the rope..." "The poet's heart thrummed...The poet's hands moved..." "Each note uncovered a layer...each pause a silence..." Stack of "he [verb]" and "The poet [verb]" constructions across adjacent paragraphs. Figurative density in most sentences without pattern-teaching or payoff: "ghost of a prisoner's grip," "silver threads that seemed to tug," "quiet fire that drove his fingers." Register drift into workshop-speak ("ethically playful," "passionate subtlety") clashes with the roadside-poet frame. Apply −1.4 for clustered artifacts; −0.3 for paraphrase loops. Total deduction pushes below mid-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Premise—poet discovers time's texture through knotting rope in a mystical grotto—leans on familiar workshop templates (lyric wanderer, symbolic object, meditation on time) without transformation through specific lived detail or moral calculus. Energy beings and "impossible choices" are invoked but never dramatized. The rope's prison origin is gestured at but not used to complicate the present choice. Emotional arc could swap in any symbolic craft (weaving, pottery, song) with minor edits, signaling high swappability and low irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Poet is present throughout but makes no choice that alters tactics or forecloses a path; he observes, hums, and ultimately carries the rope onward without cost. Role is functional but entirely passive at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Rope appears in opening, middle consideration (climb vs. weave), and final carry-onward. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, but no causal pressure (the rope does not narrow options) and no closure linkage (it is simply carried). Swappable with any symbolic tool. Cap at mid-band for lyric reprise without consequence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Impossible choices" are labeled throughout but never enacted on the page; the poet faces a clear dilemma (climb, weave, or carry) and chooses the easiest, costless path. Concept is ornamental theme rather than a stake-shaping force.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.9</grade><comment>"Ethically playful" is a label applied twice without constraining an action or enabling a visible tradeoff. No on-page cost tied to this trait. Ornamental descriptor.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Pattern" (knotting rope, uncovering layers) is central to the poet's method and appears in opening, middle, and ending. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, but no causal pressure—removing "pattern" and substituting "meditation" or "song" would require only minor edits. Swappability and lack of cost cap score at functional.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Uncovering layers" is signaled early (grotto's sediment, stone's skin) and mentioned in middle and ending beats. Method is present but does not shape a tactical choice or alter the outcome. Lyric reprise without causal work places score in functional band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Terra-cotta grotto and starlight anchor setting from the opening and bookend the piece. Early signal +0.7, closure reprise +0.7, but the setting does not constrain a choice or supply resources that affect outcome. Postcard description without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>1.6</grade><comment>"After the energy beings arrive" is mentioned in the opening line and twice more as backstory, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency. No live clock; the poet's exploration unfolds at leisure. Ornamental frame.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"To discover the texture of time" is stated as motivation in the opening and repeated at closure, but never dramatized through conflicting wants or costs. Desire is told rather than tested. Functional presence without friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Passionate subtlety" is declared in diction ("quiet fire," "whispered") and maintained through the piece, creating a stable lyric mood. Tone does not modulate meaningfully under pressure or charge the final image with cost, placing it in the functional-but-static band.</comment>
