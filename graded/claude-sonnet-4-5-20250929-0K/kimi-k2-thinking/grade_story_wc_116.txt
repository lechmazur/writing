<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The Chronicle Keeper remains static across the entire piece—observation without on-page choice that forecloses a path or alters tactics. "Grips reality loosely" appears as a label but never constrains an action with visible cost. The swan journey and chamber discovery occur without internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting in scene. No meaningful change or credible endurance is earned; she simply continues her prior stance with reaffirmed intention.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation is delayed—who, where, when arrive piecemeal across the opening third without early anchoring. The piece layers images (library, catacombs, refuge, swan, chamber) but no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing occurs on the page; the ending restates her vow to continue witnessing without visible cost or option foreclosure. The Cost proof test fails: no exact sentence demonstrates cost paid at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Vivid sensory fragments (moss-covered spines, obsidian refuge, ink pool, river murmur) anchor mood and recur across beats. The swan functions as micro-setting, constraining the tunnel passage in one beat. However, spatial choreography between library, catacombs, and refuge remains abstract; no environmental detail pressures a choice at closure. Meets the minimum bar for coherent setting but does not charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserve fragile knowledge—is signaled early but never tested by a tightening that narrows options or forces a trade-off. The swan passage and chamber discovery occur without opposition, cost, or agency-driven reversal. Pressure remains atmospheric rather than escalating under the Accumulative lens; no visible price alters tactics. The ending reaffirms her stance without on-page consequence or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: decay, witness, silence as regeneration, the swan as map. "Crumbling peace" and "regenerative silence" recur with shifting weight, and the final image offers a lyric reprise without overt moralizing. However, the thematic question—how to accompany decay without judgment—receives no earned answer through specific struggle; the conclusion restates rather than reweights prior material with undeniable cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds stable distance with lyric diction ("paper-thin boundary," "breathing organism of memory"). Perceptual signature remains consistent—poetic, reflective register. However, compression and patterned syntax lean heavily on stock phrases ("drift of untold seasons" recurs five times, "regenerative silence" four times) without fresh variation. Purposeful repetition is taught but borders on template cadence in cumulative beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: paragraphs 20–21 restate the drift/archive theme, paragraphs 27–28 loop the swan's lesson without added detail. Template cadence runs through multiple "She [verb]" stems and repeated phrase anchors ("drift of untold seasons," "regenerative silence," "crumbling peace"). Figurative density in every sentence without escalation or payoff ("breathing organism," "silent archive," "quiet vigil") obscures propulsion. Apply −0.8 for loops and template artifacts; −0.4 for stock metaphor strings in multiple beats; total deduction ~−1.2, baseline mid-6 drops to 5.4.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The premise—archivist in decaying library seeks hidden chambers via origami map—echoes familiar custodian/archive motifs without a fresh synthesis. "Regenerative silence" and "crumbling peace" function as lyric abstractions rather than specific lived detail. The swan's cryptic folds arrive with potential but the transformation lacks earned surprise or non-obvious inflection. Emotional specificity is present but the arc remains contemplative observation rather than risk-taking that heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Chronicle Keeper is present throughout and her witnessing frames the piece (setup, development, payoff gates met). However, she makes no key turn or decision with cost; her journey through the swan passage is passive discovery, and the ending reaffirms her prior stance without alteration. Early signal +0.5, three-beat involvement +1.4, closure linkage (restated vow) +0.4, but ornamental-use friction (observation without pressure) −1.0, no causal pressure −0.8, swappable observer archetype −0.5. Lands ~3.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Obsidian refuge appears in paragraphs 5–6, 20, 24, 31–32, 36 (setup, middle, ending gates met). It functions as sanctuary where silence "washes over her" in three beats and frames the final image. Early signal +0.5, two distinct beats +0.9, closure linkage (ending locale) +0.8, specificity (dark glass pavilion along river) +0.4. However, it supplies no constraint or enabling tactic under pressure; she returns unchanged each time. Ornamental-use friction −0.8, swappable sanctuary −0.5. Lands ~5.8.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Regenerative silence recurs in paragraphs 6, 17, 21, 31, 35 (setup, middle, ending). It is labeled as healing/mending but never shapes an on-page choice or alters tactics; functions as thematic echo rather than stake-driver. Early signal +0.5, three-beat mention +1.4, closure linkage (final vow to let silence mend) +0.7, but label-only use −0.6, no causal pressure −0.8, swappable with "restorative quiet" −0.5. Lands ~4.1.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Grips reality loosely appears in paragraph 14 and 33 as label. It does not constrain or enable any on-page action with cost; no visible tradeoff demonstrates what this trait forecloses. Late first appearance (second third) −0.4, label-only −0.6, no causal pressure −0.8, swappable descriptor −0.5. Lands ~2.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Burrow is signaled in paragraph 8, enacted via swan passage in paragraphs 11–12, and restated thematically in paragraph 23 ("to burrow is to preserve") and 34 ("taught her to burrow not into earth, but into silence"). Setup, middle enactment, closure reprise gates met. Early signal +0.6, two beats (enactment, thematic realization) +0.9, closure linkage (final lesson) +1.0, specificity (swan tunnel) +0.5. However, the action is passive discovery without opposition or cost, and the final reprise is abstract restatement. No causal pressure narrowing options −0.8, easily swappable with "descend" or "delve" −0.6. Lands ~5.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Origami swan introduced paragraph 9, its folds used to open passage paragraphs 11–12, folded again paragraph 22, floated down river paragraph 29, mentioned in closure paragraphs 31, 36. Setup, middle use, ending reprise gates met. Early signal +0.7, three beats (opening, re-folding, floating) +1.4, causal pressure (enables passage) +0.8, closure linkage (final image of folds) +1.0, specificity (cryptic folds, paper-thin) +0.6. However, mechanics are vague ("pressed a fingertip into a fold and felt the paper yield"), and the swan resolves a passage problem it did not help create. Swappability (any magic key) −0.6, late-resolution artifact −0.5. Lands ~6.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>Overgrown library in catacombs frames opening and closing (paragraphs 1–4, 25, 35, 39). Setup and ending gates met; middle gate weak (chamber discovery is passive). Early signal +0.8, two beats (opening frame, chamber) +0.9, closure linkage (final frame) +0.9, specificity (moss-covered spines, roots crack stone, faded glyphs) +0.6. However, the setting supplies no constraint that alters her choices; she moves freely without cost. No causal pressure −0.8, postcard description in several beats −0.6. Lands ~6.0.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>Across the drift of untold seasons recurs in paragraphs 2, 24, 29, 37. Setup and ending gates met; no middle development. The phrase signals vast time but remains abstract; no tightening clock or seasonal constraint alters decisions. Early signal +0.4, closure linkage (final paragraph) +0.6, but vague/untracked time throughout −0.9, no causal pressure −0.8, ornamental use (poetic flourish) −0.7, swappable with "through the ages" −0.5. Lands ~3.6.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Witness change without judgment stated paragraph 3, enacted in paragraphs 13–18 (chamber observation), reaffirmed paragraphs 26, 37. Setup, middle enactment, ending gates met. Early signal +0.7, two beats (chamber witness, final vow) +0.9, closure linkage (vow to continue) +0.8. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through friction; no on-page moment where the cost of non-judgment conflicts with another want. Told-only friction −0.9, no want-versus-cost tension −0.8, swappable with "remain neutral observer" −0.6. Lands ~4.9.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Crumbling peace appears paragraphs 4, 27, 36. Tone is melancholic, accumulative, consistent across beats (lyric diction, decay imagery, quiet closure). Setup and ending gates met. Early signal +0.6, closure linkage (penultimate paragraph) +0.9, coherence across turns +0.8, modulates subtly (peace → understanding at end) +0.5. However, tone remains static rather than escalating with pressure; no modulation reflects rising stakes. Single mood trend −0.7, does not charge final image beyond label −0.4. Lands ~5.7.</comment>
