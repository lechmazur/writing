<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's motivation (survival after clerical death) is established, but interiority reads generic and abstract. The heartbeat-counting habit is told rather than shown constraining choices; it operates as a label without embodied friction. The final "mended the ghost / mend her own life" parallel feels tidy rather than earned through contradictory impulses. No secondary character pressure; the ghost remains a symbolic mirror rather than a dramatized force.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive within the first paragraph. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—she accepts the ghost's wisdom and resolves to carry the shard forward—but the cost is asserted ("as she had mended the ghost") rather than dramatized through a visible forfeiture or choice that forecloses a live path. The defragmentation sequence provides one meaningful deepening, yet the final image ("ready to write a new chapter") abstracts the stakes rather than charging them with felt pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The opal observatory, snow, server room, and terminal are anchored early and maintained. The porcelain shard functions as micro-setting, present in her pocket and used twice (pressed to screen, then "went cold"), constraining one choice and charging the closure. Sensory selection (ink veins, soft chime, faint pulse) reflects urgency. Small penalty: the "midnight glow" and "quiet curtain" veer toward stock phrasing in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: fetch wisdom from the ghost's failure to mend her own misfiled existence. One meaningful tightening occurs when the porcelain shard contact sparks the defragmentation completion. Agency is present (she traces ink, presses the shard), but the resolution—ghost speaks, wisdom "settles"—lacks a visible trade-off or foreclosed path; the protagonist does not renounce, endure with cost, or make a choice that narrows later options. Cost is implied in the phrase "each crack teaches the path to mend," yet no on-page action demonstrates what she gives up or what alternative she closes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (broken pieces as map; failure as teacher) emerges from the ghost's fractured code and the porcelain shard. The ink-pattern ritual and the defragmentation sequence ground the concept in particulars. The final image—"ready to write a new chapter"—states theme rather than offering a non-literal answer; the prior line "a token of the lesson learned" risks explicit moralizing. The parallel between clerical error and digital ghost is apt but told ("a mirror of her own survival") rather than discovered through on-page friction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV, stable throughout. Perceptual signature is present (heartbeat counting, ink-pattern tracing) but leans abstract. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("ephemeral patterns," "midnight solace") that feels imposed rather than character-specific. Psychic distance is consistent. No dialogue to evaluate. Filter verbs ("she realized," "she understood") cluster in key beats, dulling immediacy. The prose modulates with pressure but lacks a distinct rhythmic fingerprint under stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Clarity is generally high; no major loops or contradictions. Sentence openings show variety. Two frictions: (1) paraphrase loop in paragraph 3–4 ("a survivor of a clerical death" / "her life into a ghost file" / "Her pulse beat a private metronome" repeats the misfiled-existence concept without added pressure), and (2) template cadence in the reflective block (lines 21–25: "She remembered... She had counted... The porcelain shard had belonged...") stacks past-perfect stems without variation. Figurative density ("like a frozen thought," "spread like nerves," "like ink drying") is high but coherent. No major momentum loss, yet the reflective block (lines 21–30, ~18% of text) flattens present pressure without a present-tense micro-choice to offset it.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Premise (clerical-death survivor seeks wisdom from a digital ghost via ink divination) synthesizes familiar elements (ghost in the machine, survivor trauma, divination) but does not transform them through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The defragmentation-through-ink method is novel in isolation yet feels ornamental; the porcelain-shard resonance and the heartbeat-counting trait are introduced but not tested under contradictory pressure. The ending ("ready to write a new chapter") lands on a generic recovery template. Risk-taking is modest; the observatory and opal dome add texture but do not constrain tactics.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Character present throughout; her clerical-death status frames the quest and parallels the ghost's existence. She makes two on-page choices: trace ink patterns, press shard to screen. These choices advance the defragmentation but do not foreclose alternatives or reveal a hierarchy of values under contradictory pressure. The backstory block (lines 21–25) recounts her reaction to the error but does not dramatize a present micro-choice that alters tactics. Present in closure (line 31: "her own life as she had mended the ghost"), but the decision to leave and "write a new chapter" is stated rather than enacted with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Porcelain shard appears in five beats: (1) introduced as origin clue (line 6), (2) pocket presence resonating with ghost (line 11), (3) pressed to terminal screen (line 15), (4) goes cold after defragmentation (line 18), (5) reweighted in closure as "token of the lesson learned" (line 29). It enables one key action (screen contact sparks defragmentation) and carries charged meaning at the end. Small penalty: the shard's "pulsing" and "resonating" properties feel symbolic rather than mechanical; its role in the final image is stated ("token") rather than visibly enacted in a choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Digital ghost is the quest object and thematic mirror. It shapes stakes (fetch wisdom from failure) and supplies the pivotal utterance ("The heart you count... it matches the beat of the machine," line 12; "In failure, there is a map," line 16). The defragmentation sequence (lines 9, 14, 18) structures the middle and ending. Present in closure ("She would... mend her own life as she had mended the ghost," line 28; "The digital ghost might remain a quiet presence," line 30). The ghost's voice provides wisdom but does not force the protagonist into a trade-off or dilemma; she receives rather than wrestles.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Heartbeat counting appears in four lines: setup (line 4), ghost's observation (line 12), protagonist counts in solace (line 19), and past protest (line 23). It characterizes her vigilance and parallels the machine's rhythm, but it does not constrain an on-page choice or create visible cost. The trait is told ("a habit born from the fear") rather than shown altering tactics under pressure. The ghost's line ("The heart you count... it matches the beat of the machine") elevates thematic resonance but does not impose a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Defragmentation is the central action: introduced (line 9), executed via ink tracing (line 10), catalyzed by shard contact (line 15), completed (line 18), and referenced in closure (line 28: "mend her own life as she had mended the ghost"). It structures the middle pressure and enables the ghost's final utterance. The process is narrated in passive summary ("The defragmentation completed") rather than dramatized as a sequence of visible, effortful moves with setbacks. Swappability test: another repair metaphor (reboot, reassemble) could substitute with minor edits, lowering irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Spilled ink appears in three beats: poured onto plate (line 8), veins traced with stylus (line 10), patterns shift like kaleidoscope (line 14). The method is signaled early and tied to the defragmentation attempt. It guides her action ("each curve mapping a path," line 10) but does not create friction, setback, or multiple attempts that test its reliability. The ink "settles like... drying on paper" (line 20) offers a closure image, yet the mechanics remain decorative—removing ink and substituting another divination tool would not break story logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Opal observatory under snow is anchored in the opening line and sustained (dome, server room, terminal screen, snow outside, midnight). It provides spatial coherence and the terminal as a tool. The setting enables the ghost encounter and supplies the "midnight solace" tone at closure. Small penalty: the observatory does not constrain her choices (no locked doors, failing systems, or rival presence) or supply a resource she must ration. The snow functions as atmospheric frame rather than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Timeframe ("after the radio static clears") anchors the opening (line 2) and is referenced obliquely in line 26 ("after the radio static cleared"). The static's clearing signals a moment of possibility but does not impose a deadline or tighten decisions. The piece unfolds in a continuous present with one reflective flashback; no clock tracks elapsed minutes or forces tempo. The timeframe orients but does not escalate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation ("to fetch wisdom from failure," line 7) is stated early and drives the quest. She performs goal-directed actions (pour ink, trace veins, press shard) and receives the ghost's lesson. The motivation is singular and uncontested; no friction between competing wants (e.g., fear of re-engagement vs. need for closure) surfaces in choices. The final paragraph declares success ("to mend her own life as she had mended the ghost") without dramatizing what she sacrifices or risks to claim that wisdom.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Tone ("midnight solace") is established in the opening (opal dome, faint midnight glow, humming silence) and sustained through diction (quiet, soft chime, quiet curtain). The tone modulates subtly—urgency in the defragmentation beats, solace in the final paragraph. Coherent across turns. The final line ("ready to write a new chapter") shifts toward resolve, slightly brightening the solace without breaking it. The tone charges the final image (heartbeats as "restored rhythm," snow as "quiet curtain") but does not reconfigure under peak pressure; it remains static and contemplative throughout.</comment>
