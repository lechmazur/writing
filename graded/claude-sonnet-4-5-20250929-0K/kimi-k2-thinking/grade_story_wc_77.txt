<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation (trick fear into revealing weakness) is present but her internal contradiction feels manufactured rather than lived—she moves through terror without embodied hesitation or micro-choices that reveal competing impulses. The advisor character never makes an on-page decision that alters tactics; it only narrates riddles. The final "confession" moment where fear answers "You are the only one who returned" lands as a conceptual turn, but Mira's laughter feels unearned because we never see her grapple with survival guilt or process what "returning" cost her until that exact beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Hybrid: causal pressure (photo → funhouse → confrontation) overlaid with accumulative/textural design (riddles, luminance motifs). Closure unit is Conceptual Repricing—fear's weakness revealed as inability to affect survivors—but the cost remains abstract; Mira walks out carrying the clasp "like a scar," yet no prior scene shows what path she foreclosed or what she sacrificed beyond enduring the encounter. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive cleanly within the first few lines. One meaningful tightening occurs when the entities circle her and she forces the question, but the escalation from entry to climax feels more like traversal than narrowing options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The funhouse setting supplies mirrors, footprints, and skeletal architecture that guide Mira's path, and the "corrupted gold" luminance provides atmospheric texture. However, the space doesn't constrain a choice—Mira walks in, walks to center, asks the question, walks out—so the micro-setting test for 9+ fails. Sensory hierarchy (visual dominance of oily sheen and glowing footprints) reflects the fantastical POV but other senses remain thin during the peak confrontation. The carnival's "bruised twilight" and "plywood grin peeling" are vivid but function as postcard anchors rather than tactical pressures.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (unmask fear's weakness) is signaled early and pursued on-page. One meaningful tightening occurs when the entities circle and Mira must voice the paradoxical question, but the escalation reads more as ritual completion than a choice that forecloses options. The entities "pause" and answer; Mira laughs—no visible tradeoff, lost resource, or secondary cost that alters her exit. Under the Hybrid lens, accumulative pressure (riddles, luminance, entities manifesting) builds atmosphere, yet the climax lacks a felt price: she emerges with knowledge and the clasp intact, no dramatized sacrifice on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (survivors carry knowledge the dead cannot touch) emerges from the entities' confession and the closing image of Mira as "witness," avoiding overt thesis statements. The paradoxical notes and dream-dictionary motifs recur purposefully, and the final line ("only the revived can speak their language") reweights prior material without moralizing. However, the pearl's function—"held the ghost of every scream"—veers toward symbolic convenience introduced late rather than arising from established particulars, and "beautiful and obscene" in the penultimate line edges into abstract label-speak that dilutes the concrete resonance of the clasp's earlier bite.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Mira with consistent psychic distance; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature (oily luminance, ghostlights) is character-specific and sustained. However, diction drifts into elevated register during peak beats—"unbosom," "devotee's prayer is the tyrant's interrogation," "manifestating as flickering entities"—that clashes with the embodied, sensory voice established earlier ("stomach clench," "edges bit her palm"). The advisor's riddle-speak is intentionally stylized, but when narration adopts similar ornamentation ("repulsive allure that pulled even as it repulsed") without grounding in Mira's lexicon, voice coherence slips. Dialogue is absent, so those bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops touch multiple beats: "Their beauty was a lie that made her stomach clench, an allure that pulled at her even as it repulsed" restates repulsive-allure within one sentence; "The photograph in her pocket now showing only empty glass" echoes "the mirrors would forever reflect only what they were—empty glass" two paragraphs later. Template cadence appears in the advisor's riddles, but that reads voice-motivated. Figurative density spikes without pattern-payoff: "oily residue," "corrupted gold," "bruised twilight," "skeletal," "plywood grin peeling," "pearl erupted with pure, harsh light" cluster in quick succession, some mixing metaphors (grin/skeletal/plywood). Filter-verb reliance ("showed," "revealed," "seemed") dulls immediacy in mid-beats. Stock metaphor "blood" in the opening feels placeholder. Information density is moderate—many lines do double work—but scaffold phrases ("she found," "she stepped," "she pulled out") repeat sentence stems across the funhouse sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Core premise (survivor confronts manifested fears in cursed funhouse after drowning/resuscitation) hybridizes familiar gothic and trauma-processing templates without a sharp transformation. The "ask fear what it fears" twist is clever but arrives late and feels more like a riddle solution than an earned character insight—Mira never demonstrates why she, specifically, would think to invert the interrogation. Emotional specificity around resuscitation and survival is thin; the "second heartbeat" opener promises embodied stakes but the text quickly abstracts into luminance mechanics and riddle-chasing. The opera clasp and dream dictionary are period-inflected props, yet their combination reads more as checklist fulfillment than organic synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The whispering advisor appears in week six (setup), delivers riddles throughout (development), and issues the final command "Ask it what it fears" (closure participation). All three gates present. However, the advisor never makes a choice that alters Mira's tactics—it narrates paradoxes, and Mira interprets them. The advisor's voice "intensified" and "commanded" but these are passive observations; Mira's peak action (asking the question) is her own inference, not a decision the advisor forces or enables with visible cost. Functional but replaceable with an internal monologue or the grandmother's notes alone. Late first appearance (week six mentioned but not anchored early in the funhouse sequence) and ornamental use (riddle delivery without on-page tactical consequence) cap the score. Two beats (mid-sequence urgency, final command) and closure linkage (the final riddle shapes the question) elevate slightly above purely ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The opera cloak clasp appears early (setup: found in attic with photo), is handled mid-sequence (development: "clutched until its edges bit her palm," pearl pulses with light only Mira sees), and returns at closure (pearl erupts with light during confrontation, "grew cold," "carry like a scar"). All three gates present. The clasp is used in two distinct beats (grounding grip, light weapon) and reappears with reweighted meaning in the final paragraph. However, the pearl's light function—"erupted with pure, harsh light" to pause the entities—introduces a new ability at the climax without prior causal setup (the "faint light only she could see" does not establish offensive capability). Closure linkage is strong (clasp as embodied scar), but the light's mechanics feel late-breaking. Causal pressure moderate (grounding pain is embodied, light intervention is convenient), specificity moderate (silver snakes/pearl design is concrete but the "every scream" payload in the penult is symbolic convenience). Early signal, two beats, closure linkage, but swappability moderate (any charged object could ground) and late power introduction cap the score.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Lingering luminance is introduced early (setup: "flickering vision—ghostlights that clung to objects like oily residue"), recurs throughout (funhouse surfaces "painted in corrupted gold," footprints glow), and is mentioned at closure ("leaving her with the lingering luminance"). All three gates present. However, the luminance never constrains a choice or enables a tactic—Mira sees the glow, but her decisions (enter funhouse, hold clasp, ask question) do not depend on it. The luminance functions as atmospheric texture and a perceptual marker of her altered state, not as a tool or obstacle. Development participation is weak (she observes glowing footprints but they merely confirm direction, not alter tactics). Closure mention is passive ("leaving her with"). Two beats (attic discovery, funhouse observation) but no causal pressure or cost connection. Functional as a motif but replaceable with any synesthetic marker; the story's logic would hold without this exact element.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The photograph is photographically cursed: it "showed the funhouse mirror maze—not empty, but crowded with smudged faces that had never been there" and "gleamed with the same oily sheen." Setup early (attic discovery), development (Mira holds it to mirror, "faces poured out of the photo like smoke"), closure (photo "now showing only empty glass"). All three gates. The curse enables one key action (releasing entities by reflecting the cursed image), which drives the confrontation beat. However, the mechanics are summarized ("She pulled out the photograph and held it to a mirror… The funhouse shuddered") rather than dramatized with tension or cost—no struggle, no risk that the photo might trap her instead, no tradeoff. The curse's payload (releasing entities) is the story's inciting complication, but Mira's handling of it feels inert: she simply presents it and the entities appear. Causal pressure moderate (one beat: mirror reflection), closure linkage weak (the photo is emptied but the image does not recharge prior material), cost invisible (no price for releasing the entities, no dramatized consequence of holding a cursed object). Functional but mechanical; a stronger score would require on-page friction or visible tradeoff when deploying the curse.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Unbosom appears in the advisor's command ("Unbosom now") and in Mira's realization ("She had unbosomed the secret: to trick fear into revealing its weakness"). Setup late (mid-sequence command), development weak (Mira's interpretation off-page), closure (the "unbosomed secret" is named in the resolution paragraph). Missing early setup; the command arrives past the 40% mark, capping at 4.6 under the late-introduction rule. However, the action—forcing fear to confess—structures the climax turn: Mira asks "What frightens you?" and the entities answer, which is the story's pivotal reversal. The verb "unbosom" itself is ornamental (the action is "ask" and "confess"), but the concept of extracting confession is load-bearing. Development beat exists (Mira's question is the unbosom act), closure participation moderate (the secret's articulation names the payoff). One major turn traces to this action (the entities' confession), though swappability is moderate—"confess," "reveal," "interrogate" would work with minor edits. Cost connection weak: no visible price for asking the question. Late arrival, one strong beat, closure linkage, but replaceable verb and minimal cost limit the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The dream dictionary is introduced early (setup: "the dream dictionary Mira's grandmother had left behind, its margins dense with paradoxical notes"), its mechanics appear mid-sequence (development: advisor's riddles are "cribbed from the dream dictionary," specific note "Entry: Fear" is quoted), and the final paradox is invoked at closure ("The dream dictionary's final paradox still whispered in her memory"). All three gates present. The method shapes Mira's approach: she remembers the note "The devotee's prayer is the tyrant's interrogation—make fear answer to itself" and applies it by asking the entities what they fear. This is one beat of causal pressure (the note primes the tactic). However, the dictionary itself is never handled on-page in the funhouse; the notes are summarized in flashback and the advisor's voice delivers them, so the mechanics feel second-hand rather than directly used. Swappability moderate (any inherited wisdom or advisor could deliver the tactic). Early signal, one beat shaping the final question, closure linkage (final paradox quoted), but summary-only use and indirect delivery lower integration. Cost connection weak: no price for consulting the notes or following the method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The abandoned carnival funhouse is introduced early (setup: "abandoned carnival at the edge of town," "funhouse stood skeletal"), provides the confrontation arena (development: Mira enters, the mirror maze is the stage for entities manifesting), and is present at closure (mirrors crack, funhouse remains as a lesson). All three gates. The setting supplies concrete resources: mirrors enable the photo-reflection tactic, the maze's center is the convergence point (footprints glow toward it), and the cracking mirrors signal resolution. Two beats: entry/observation and mirror-reflection confrontation. However, the funhouse does not constrain a choice—Mira walks in unobstructed, walks to center, performs the action, walks out—so it functions more as a scripted stage than a tactical pressure. Spatial choreography is coherent (entrance → corridor → center → exit). Micro-setting option: the mirrors are handled (photo held to mirror) and charge the climax image (cracking mirrors, empty glass). Causal pressure moderate (mirrors enable one tactic), closure linkage present (mirrors crack, the funhouse "would wait for others" reappears in final paragraph), specificity moderate (funhouse/mirrors are genre-typical but concretely described). The setting alters one tactic (mirror reflection) and participates in closure, elevating above postcard description, but it doesn't force a tradeoff or narrow options.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the resuscitation" is established in the opening ("Mira's second heartbeat began three minutes after the first stopped") and anchors the premise (her altered vision post-drowning). Setup clear. However, the resuscitation itself is not a live constraint during the funhouse sequence—no urgency tied to recovery time, no stamina limit, no ticking clock that alters her tactics. Development weak: the advisor appears "in week six" (a time marker) but this does not tighten decisions. Closure participation absent: the ending does not hinge on time elapsed or return to the resuscitation moment. The timeframe sets the premise (she has a gift "after" dying) but does not shape the plot's escalation or tactics. Functional as a premise anchor but replaceable—any inciting trauma could grant the vision. One gate (setup) present; missing development and closure participation cap at 2.8 under the gate model, but the early signal and premise integration lift slightly above purely ornamental. No live clock, no time-based tradeoff, no escalation pressure tied to the timeframe.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Mira's motivation "to trick fear into revealing its weakness" is present throughout: she follows the photo to the funhouse (setup implies search for answers), confronts the entities (development), and executes the trick by asking "What frightens you?" (closure). All three gates. The motivation drives the climax turn: her question forces the entities to confess "You are the only one who returned," which is the story's payoff. One major beat (the question/confession exchange) and closure linkage. However, the motivation is more told than dramatized with friction—Mira's interiority during the approach does not show competing desires (e.g., fear versus curiosity, safety versus closure) that would embody "trick" as a risky gambit. She clutches the clasp for grounding but never hesitates or second-guesses the plan. The trick itself (inverting interrogation) is summarized in the resolution paragraph rather than shown as a micro-choice sequence under pressure. Causal pressure moderate (one beat shaped by this want), cost connection weak (no visible tradeoff for pursuing the trick; she emerges with knowledge and clasp intact). Desire is clear but not conflicted in choices; friction between want and cost is asserted ("She had unbosomed the secret") rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Repulsive allure is introduced with the entities' faces: "Their beauty was a lie that made her stomach clench, an allure that pulled at her even as it repulsed." Setup mid-sequence (first appears when entities manifest, past the 30% mark). The tone recurs in the pearl's description ("beautiful and obscene, forever") at closure. Two beats with lyric reprise qualifies for ~5.5–6.3 under the lyric-resonance allowance. However, the tone does not modulate with pressure—it is declared twice in similar phrasing but does not charge the action beats (Mira's question, the entities' pause, her laughter) with sensory or emotional texture that embodies the pull-repulse dynamic. The tone is asserted rather than felt in the prose rhythm or choice friction. Closure linkage present (pearl as "beautiful and obscene" reweights the clasp's meaning), but the repulsive-allure effect remains static (described identically at manifestation and resolution) rather than evolving through the confrontation. Late first appearance (−0.3), two beats (+0.4), closure linkage (+0.8), but static mood and summary-only texture (−0.5) limit the score. The tone fits the concept but does not drive the narrative's texture or modulate under stress.</comment>
