<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lina's "resiliently positive" nature is asserted repeatedly but never tested by genuine internal contradiction or a choice that costs her something on the page. Her motivation to merge timelines drives action mechanically, yet we see no competing impulse, no moment where resilience wavers under pressure that would make the final stance earned. The empty hourglass and radio manipulations read as competent puzzle-solving without blind spots or mistakes that compound before resolution. Interiority leans on stock phrasing ("her heart beat in sync," "her purpose became something larger") rather than character-particular perception.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The piece orients who (Lina), where (ferry Tidemark), and when (tonight, seventh tide) promptly. The closure unit—timelines snapping together after Lina's radio pulse—lands on the page, but the cost reads conceptual rather than felt: "permanence settling on her shoulders, yet she knew it was fleeting" tells us impermanence persists without showing what Lina forfeited or what tactical option closed. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (pattern-building via spectral grotto, starlight, hourglass glow), yet the final reweighting is muted by the immediate acknowledgment that "the merge was temporary" and the cycle will repeat, undercutting any decisive change or resonant reconfiguration with visible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ferry hull, wheelhouse, empty hourglass, and spectral grotto are vividly sketched with selective sensory detail (damp rail, sideways clock, silver starlight threads). The grotto's walls hum in harmony and starlight pools in hollows, and the empty hourglass warms and glows, charging the final image. However, spatial choreography during the merge—"three places at once: the dock, the grotto, and the sea"—remains abstract; we do not see how Lina's body or the ferry's physical constraints shape her radio transmissions or securings. The setting constrains choice lightly (the grotto must be reached, the hourglass positioned) but does not force a tactical trade-off that alters the outcome.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—merging parallel timelines to anchor the vanishing ferry—is signaled early and pursued consistently. Pressure accumulates through the radio tuning, starlight-filling ritual, and spiral tracing, but no reversal or tightening forecloses a live option with on-page cost. Lina "holds fast" and sends "one final pulse," the timelines snap together, yet she already knows "it was fleeting" and "the ferry would vanish again." Agency reads as execution of a learned procedure rather than a high-stakes choice where success trades one value for another or failure compounds prior mistakes. The "resiliently positive" stance never wavers, so no internal or external pressure forces a recalibration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—permanence within transience, home as moving horizon—emerges from the recurring hourglass, starlight threads, and the ferry's cyclical vanishing without direct statement. The empty hourglass "marking time that never began nor ended" and Lina's whisper "echoing across timelines" offer resonant images. However, the final paragraph explicitly articulates the theme ("every vanishing was a new beginning," "anchor and sail, forever ferrying souls") rather than trusting the prior particulars to carry it. The spectral grotto and sideways clocks function as motifs but do not constrain a choice or reweight prior material with cost at closure; they recur without deepening contradiction or irony.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present (damp rail, sideways clock, silver threads) but lacks character-particular bias—Lina's noticing reads generically lyric rather than shaped by her deckhand experience or personal history. Diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("ardent deckhand," "resiliently positive," "permanent transient") that sits uneasily with the voice's concrete anchors. The dialogue snippet from Captain Roedskal ("Time's sand ran out long ago") and Lina's radio transmission ("Tidemark to all echoes, we are merging now") carry subtext but are brief. Sentence rhythm varies, yet runs of "Lina [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" create mild template cadence in the middle third.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops are pervasive: "resiliently positive" appears three times as label; "empty hourglass" is mentioned nine times, often with near-identical phrasing ("placed the empty hourglass back," "the empty hourglass sat"); "permanent transient" recurs without functional variation. Template cadence runs through the middle: "Lina [verb]" opener × 6 in close succession, "The [noun] [verb]" × 5. Purple clusters appear ("starlight pooling like silver in the hollows," "her voice a thread," "lighthouse in the ever-shifting dark") without dramatic necessity. Information density is moderate—many sentences do double work (hourglass warms + resonates, grotto responds + hums)—but the final third summarizes the cycle and Lina's stance rather than advancing pressure. No major grammar or continuity breaks, but momentum sags under synonym churn and repetitive stems.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The vanishing commuter ferry straddling parallel timelines offers a lyric premise, yet the emotional arc—resilient deckhand anchors the ferry through a known, repeating ritual—follows a familiar template of competent guide ensuring safe passage. The spectral grotto, sideways clocks, and empty hourglass as fulcrum are vivid images, but their function (tuning device, time marker, balance point) reads as assembled genre furniture rather than a synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. No turn or final reweighting surprises; Lina's laugh "would guide the next deckhand" telegraphs the cycle's continuation without fresh inflection. The premise is not transformed through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus; instead, it leans on stock motifs (hourglass, starlight, echo) and a tidy thematic loop that retreats from the cost of merging.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Lina is present throughout and her actions (tuning radio, holding hourglass, tracing spirals, transmitting code) drive the merge sequence. She makes decisions (intending to anchor the ferry, weaving threads, sending final pulse) that alter the ferry's state. However, her choices feel procedural—executing a learned pattern—rather than constrained by competing costs or blind spots. The "resiliently positive" stance is asserted but never tested by a dilemma where one path forecloses another with visible price. Setup clear, middle development present (spiral tracing, radio bursts), closure participation strong (final pulse snaps timelines), but low causal pressure and no felt trade-off keep the score mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The empty hourglass appears early (Captain Roedskal nods to it), is handled mid-sequence (Lina holds it up, lets starlight fill chambers, it warms and glows), and returns at closure (placed back on console, glowing then dimming, final mention as "reminder that emptiness could be full"). It acts as fulcrum balancing timeline flows and resonates with the radio's pulse, so it shapes the merge tactically. However, the hourglass does not constrain a choice or impose a cost—Lina uses it successfully without sacrifice or trade-off. Setup, development, and payoff gates all met; beat involvement (three distinct uses); closure linkage (final image). Swappability moderate (another time-measuring object could serve). Rounds to 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The vanishing commuter ferry is the core premise and frames the dominant stake (anchor it to stop vanishing). It appears early ("Tonight, the Tidemark would vanish, as it did every seventh tide"), drives Lina's goal (merge timelines to anchor the ferry), and is present at closure (ferry solidifies, then will vanish again). However, the ferry's vanishing operates as backdrop rather than active pressure—Lina executes the merge without the vanishing forcing a tactical pivot or imposing a visible cost. The concept shapes stakes but does not redefine options in a causal chain. Setup, development, and payoff gates met; moderate causal pressure; closure linkage present but not indispensable (the story could pivot to any cyclical phenomenon with similar edits).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Resiliently positive" is asserted three times as label ("ardent deckhand who never lost hope," "her resilient positivity a beacon," "resiliently positive, a lighthouse," "Lina's heart remained resiliently positive") but never dramatized through an on-page choice where positivity constrains tactics or costs her an alternative. No moment shows Lina's optimism enabling a risky move or blinding her to danger; no friction between resilience and despair. The trait is ornamental—present in summary without action pressure. Setup (early label), no clear middle development that constrains choice, closure participation (final label "resiliently positive"). Swappable with "determined" or "hopeful" without structural change. Caps at 4.6 for missing middle gate; label-only use and swappability pull lower.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Radio tuning and transmission drive the merge sequence: Lina tunes the radio searching for the pattern, static gives way to hum, she transmits code in bursts that weave spirals, and the final long pulse snaps timelines together. The radio is present early (introduced in beat where she tunes it), constrains middle tactics (must match grotto's pulse), and is causally active at closure (final pulse triggers snap). Removing the radio would break the merge mechanism. Setup, development, payoff gates met; three distinct beats; high causal pressure; closure linkage strong. Slight swappability (another transmission device could serve similar function) and no visible cost tied specifically to using the radio (no interference, no sacrifice of another resource) prevent higher score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Interconnected patterns" (interlocking spirals mirroring starlight's path, each spiral a timeline, each intersection a future) is signaled mid-sequence and shapes Lina's radio transmission method (tracing spirals, sending code that weaves them). The method is present in the merge beat and mentioned as learned from "old charts," but it does not constrain earlier attempts or impose a cost—Lina executes it successfully on first try. Setup late (first appearance past the first third), development (one beat where she traces and transmits), closure participation (spirals mentioned as timelines snap). Swappable (any transmission code could serve). Lacks early signal and causal friction. Caps at 4.6 for late setup; functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The spectral grotto under starlight is introduced early as the hidden destination where Lina intends to anchor the ferry. It appears in the merge sequence (walls hum in harmony, starlight pools in hollows) and is mentioned at closure ("In the spectral grotto under starlight, the timelines merged"). The grotto provides the environment where the merge occurs and supplies the starlight resource that fills the hourglass. However, the grotto does not constrain Lina's tactics—she reaches it and executes the plan without spatial obstacle or tactical pivot. Setup clear, development (one beat of interaction), closure linkage (mentioned in final paragraph). No cost tied to the grotto; swappable with any otherworldly anchor location. Moderate causal role, no high irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"When clocks run sideways" is the temporal frame signaling the ferry's vanishing window. It appears early ("sideways spin of the wheelhouse clock," "When clocks run sideways, the Tidemark's hull shimmers") and recurs at closure ("clocks sliding sideways"). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—Lina is never shown racing against the clock or adjusting tactics as time pressure mounts. The seventh tide and "tonight" establish urgency in summary, but on-page action proceeds without visible countdown or time-driven pivot. Setup present, development absent (no middle beat where clock state alters choice), closure participation (final mention). Ornamental rather than constraining. Caps at 4.6 for missing development gate; static rather than live pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Lina's motivation to merge parallel timelines is stated early ("her purpose became something larger: to merge the parallel timelines") and drives her goal-directed action throughout (tuning radio, filling hourglass, tracing spirals, transmitting code). The merge succeeds at closure. However, the motivation is told rather than shown through competing wants or friction—no moment reveals why Lina prioritizes this merge over another goal or what personal cost it exacts. The desire is functional and consistent but lacks internal conflict or dramatized trade-off. Setup clear, development (pursuit across multiple beats), closure participation (goal achieved). No felt cost or friction between wants and reality. Moderate causal role, swappable with any stabilization goal.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Permanent transient" appears as descriptor throughout ("permanent transient world," "permanent transient vessel") and coheres with the theme of cyclical vanishing and impermanent anchoring. Tone remains lyric and meditative, modulating slightly at the merge (urgency in "ferry shuddered," "Lina felt the timelines tug") then settling back to contemplative ("she smiled," "her resilient laugh"). The oxymoron charges the final image ("every vanishing was a new beginning," "anchor and sail"). However, tone is asserted via labels rather than emerging from diction and rhythm alone—"permanent transient" is repeated four times. Setup (early label), development (tone shapes middle descriptions), closure participation (final paragraph invokes it). Coherent but relies on explicit phrase rather than tonal control through prose texture.</comment>
