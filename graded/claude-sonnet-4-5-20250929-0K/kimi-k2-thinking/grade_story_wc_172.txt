<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Vesper's core trait—amoral philanthropist with secret sentimentality—is presented largely through labeled interiority ("beneath his ruthless exterior lay a secretly sentimental heart") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The drought's displacement of villages is told in summary ("the drought had displaced villages") without embodied guilt or micro-choices that test competing values. His final act of walking away reads passive; the cost is asserted ("his own making") but not dramatized through a visible forfeit or renunciation that forecloses a path on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land by the opening lines. The piece follows a single continuous journey across the salt flat, fitting the 600–800 word default. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing: the echo is preserved while the drought's cost is buried, reweighting Vesper's philanthropic gesture. However, the cost is told ("the drought had displaced villages") rather than felt in the closure image itself; the final paragraph summarizes legacy ("Vesper's story became a legend") instead of landing a decisive on-page moment. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural (pattern of cracks, echo, erasure), held consistently.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The salt flat is vividly rendered ("fractured mirror," "crystalline surface," cracks forming a map) and its acoustics directly enable the climactic act: the resonant hollow cradles the egg's note. Spatial choreography is clean (edge of riverbed → convergence point → hollow). The storm's return and rain erasing the map charge the final image, making environment essential to closure. Sensory detail is purposeful and reflects urgency without catalog padding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving the extinct bird's echo—is clear and propels Vesper's journey. One meaningful tightening occurs: releasing the egg into the hollow produces the note, narrowing options (the act is irreversible). However, escalation is thin; Vesper faces no on-page opposition or complication that forces a trade-off. The drought's human cost is summarized ("protests drowned by progress") rather than creating friction in the present scene. Cost legibility at closure is conceptual (buried guilt) but not viscerally tested.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—preservation intertwined with destruction—emerges organically from the egg release, the manufactured drought, and the final erasure by rain. The closing image of the echo lingering while the map is washed away offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the final paragraph tilts toward thematic summary ("fractured grace lay in its dual nature") and labels the protagonist ("amoral philanthropist hiding a sentimental wound") rather than trusting the particulars to carry meaning. No overt moralizing, but the ending leans expository.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored in Vesper's perception throughout. Diction is controlled and elevated ("fractured grace," "ghostly melody"), fitting the lyric-textural lens. Psychic distance remains consistent; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is visible in Vesper's focus on cracks, echoes, and relics. Minor register drift occurs in late exposition ("visitors would pause, hearing a sound never known"), shifting briefly to external summary, but the narrator's core voice holds.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high in the first two-thirds. However, the final third contains paraphrase loops: "the echo of the Aerion bird, released, seemed to sing" and "the note lingered in the museum's memory" restate the echo's preservation without added pressure. Template stems appear in clusters: "Vesper's foundation would…" / "Vesper would watch…" / "Vesper's story became…" across adjacent lines (−0.5). Minor filter-verb stack: "He imagined their faces" / "He imagined the Aerion's call" (−0.2). Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "fractured grace" recurs as a motif without becoming a crutch.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of amoral philanthropy, manufactured drought, and extinct-species preservation offers a fresh moral calculus. The map-of-cracks conceit and the acoustics of the hollow are specific and non-obvious. However, the "cost of progress buried beneath generous legacy" frame is familiar; the piece does not transform it through unexpected lived detail or a non-obvious final reconfiguration. The closing legend summary flattens the tension rather than crystallizing it in a singular image. Execution is competent but stays within established templates.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Vesper drives all on-page action: orchestrating the drought, tracing the map, releasing the egg, and walking away. His choices create the central turn (egg release → echo). However, the amoral dimension is told ("amoral philanthropist," "the amoral truth gnawed") rather than tested through a peak-beat trade-off with visible cost. Sentimental trait is labeled but not dramatized in conflicting impulses acting simultaneously. Present in setup, middle, and closure; functional but swappable with a less specific archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The egg appears early (setup), is carried and handled in transit (middle), and is released in the climactic beat (closure), producing the central sound artifact. Its fragility and extinction status matter causally: no egg, no echo. The glass case and condensation add tactile specificity. The egg's single note reweights prior material (the drought's silence vs. preserved song). Strong beat involvement and closure linkage. Not fully indispensable—another extinct artifact could substitute—but the exact form (egg, fragile promise) charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The manufactured drought exposes the riverbed, enabling the map and the hollow—setup and middle development are present. It is causally necessary for Vesper's plan. Closure participation is oblique: the drought's human cost is mentioned ("the cost… would remain buried") but not shown reweighting Vesper's final stance. The concept shapes stakes thematically (destruction enabling preservation) but does not pressure a present choice with visible friction. Functional causal role; thematic resonance strong; on-page cost at closure is asserted, not felt.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Sentimental trait is labeled early ("secretly sentimental heart, hoarding relics") and tied to the collection of the egg. It explains his motivation but does not constrain an on-page choice with visible cost. The trait is static: he acts sentimentally throughout without internal conflict testing it. No beat where sentimentality forces a trade-off against amorality. Present in setup and thematic summary; functional but told, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The release is the central act, signaled early and executed at the story's climax. It produces the egg's note, fulfilling the preservation goal and shaping the closure image (echo preserved, map erased). Tactics converge on this moment. Removing it breaks the story's logic. However, the release itself is swift and faces no complication; the egg simply cracks and sings. Strong closure linkage and causal necessity; minor deduction for lack of friction during execution.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The crack-map is introduced early and Vesper follows it on-page ("walked the length," "stopped where the cracks converged"). Its mechanics matter: the cracks form a bird's-wing silhouette and guide him to the resonant hollow. The map enables the climax. Closure participation: the rain erases the map, reweighting the ephemeral/permanent tension. Two distinct beats (reading, following) plus closure charge. Specific and irreplaceable; the exact method (cracks as map) is integral to the story's conceit.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The salt flat provides the acoustics (resonant hollow) necessary for the echo, directly shaping the climax. Its texture (crunching surface, cracks, white expanse) is handled throughout. The storm and rain at closure erase the map, charging the final image. Setting is not merely backdrop; it constrains action (Vesper must walk the flat, find the convergence) and participates in the ending's reweighting. Strong causal role across setup, middle, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The lull opens and closes the story, framing the action. Thunder brackets the release beat: "The thunder returned, a low rumble that swallowed his voice." Time is present but does not tighten decisions; Vesper proceeds without urgency or a live clock pressuring his moves. The lull functions thematically (silence enabling sound) more than tactically. Lyric reprise reweights the frame, but the timeframe does not constrain choice. Functional; not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Preservation of the extinct bird's echo is Vesper's stated goal, driving all action (diverting the river, following the map, releasing the egg). The motivation is signaled early and pursued on-page. However, it is told ("He believed that by releasing it, the echo of its song could be preserved forever") without dramatized friction between desire and cost during peak beats. The drought's human cost gnaws thematically but does not complicate his present choice. Functional and causal; friction is asserted, not enacted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Fractured grace" appears in the opening and closing lines, and the story's texture—broken landscape, fragile egg, dual nature of destruction/preservation—embodies the tone throughout. Diction is controlled and elevated; no tonal breaks. However, the tone remains static; no modulation under pressure (Vesper's mood is contemplative from start to finish). The final image charges the phrase conceptually but does not deepen it emotionally. Coherent and purposeful; lacks dynamic range.</comment>
