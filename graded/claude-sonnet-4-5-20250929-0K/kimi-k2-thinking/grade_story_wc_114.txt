<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The oracle's interior life is presented through lyric abstraction rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The motivation to "find the weight of a swallowed truth" is stated repeatedly but never dramatized as a micro-choice that forecloses options. The colleague's vanished note and the forgiveness epiphany arrive through summary rather than scene pressure, and the final release feels asserted rather than earned through prior causality with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a Resonant Reconfiguration (the oracle's release of the truth's weight), but the closure lacks visible cost—the forgiveness and lifting of burden are declared rather than paid for on the page. Orientation is delayed: who, where, and when emerge slowly across the first 15% without deliberate pattern-teaching, though the disorientation does not serve closure (−0.4 in Q2; Q3 capped at 7.0). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, but the ending summarizes the emotional shift rather than charging a final image with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The mountain weather station and instruments provide atmospheric grounding, and the aurora functions as a recurring visual motif. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics; it remains postcard description. The scale used to weigh the botanical illustration is the closest micro-setting moment, but the needle's wavering is metaphorical rather than tactical, preventing entry to the 9-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recovering the weight of the swallowed truth—is signaled early but never tightens through a dramatized choice. The oracle examines the logbook, traces the smudge, places the illustration on the scale, but each action is observational or symbolic rather than a trade-off that narrows options. The resolution (forgiveness, release) is told in summary without an on-page cost that forecloses a live path, keeping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The theme of forgiveness and the weight of secrets emerges from the recurring motifs (smudge, botanical illustration, auroral sorrow), but the final paragraph's direct thematic statements ("the weight of a swallowed truth is measured not in mass, but in the release of its hold on the heart") replace scene pressure with sermonizing (−0.6). The auroral sorrow is evocative but remains external atmosphere rather than an internal cost that reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The single-POV narration maintains stable third-person close distance and a consistent lyric register. The prose carries a meditative texture appropriate to the oracle's reflective state. However, the voice relies on repeated conceptual abstractions ("swaying certainties," "peripherally aware," "auroral sorrow") without grounding them in action or perception that changes under stress, and the diction occasionally drifts into thematic essay mode in the final third.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade the text: "weight of a swallowed truth" appears eight times, "swaying certainties" four times, "auroral sorrow" five times, often across adjacent lines restating the same idea without added pressure (−0.8 for loops). Template cadence runs ("She realized… She decided… She believed… She traced… She recalled… She understood…") flatten momentum in the middle third (−0.5). The final paragraph summarizes the oracle's release across multiple sentences that could be condensed, and several beats (the smudge, the scale, the fade) are narrated twice without new information.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The combination of oracle, weather station, botanical illustration, and auroral sorrow offers a specific atmospheric synthesis, and the "fault-tolerant" framing is a fresh inflection. However, the emotional arc—suppressed guilt released through forgiveness—follows a familiar template without transformation through specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The smudge-as-word reveal and the scale's wavering needle feel convenient rather than inevitable, and the ending's explicit moralizing ("the weight of a swallowed truth is measured not in mass, but in the release…") retreats to abstraction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The fault-tolerant oracle is named early and her ability to hold conflicting forecasts is mentioned, but this trait does not constrain or enable a key turn. Her choices (examining the logbook, tracing the smudge, placing the illustration on the scale) are observational rather than decisive. The character is present across beats but her defining attribute—fault tolerance—remains a label rather than a tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The botanical illustration appears in multiple beats (pressed in logbook, smudged, placed on scale, returned to margin) and returns at closure. However, its role is symbolic rather than causal: it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics, and the final replacement in the margin is a lyric reprise without reweighted cost. Setup and payoff are present but middle development lacks functional pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Swaying certainties is named explicitly and echoed in the instruments' uncertain readings, but it functions as a thematic label rather than shaping stakes or tactics on the page. The oracle's mind is described as holding conflicting forecasts, yet no choice dramatizes this contradiction under pressure. The concept is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Peripherally aware appears as a descriptor ("peripherally aware of a memory") but does not constrain or enable action with visible cost. The trait is mentioned early but never tested in a choice where peripheral awareness matters tactically. It remains a label-only attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The smudge is introduced early (thumb smudges ink), examined in the middle (resembles a shape, traced with a finger), and reweighted at closure (becomes the word "forgive"). It drives two distinct beats and participates in the ending's thematic turn. However, the resolution—smudge as forgiveness—is revealed through summary rather than a causal action that alters options, limiting the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>By occupying margins is stated as the oracle's method ("by occupying margins… she could recover the weight") and enacted when she searches the logbook margins and places the illustration back into the margin at closure. Setup and payoff are present, but the method does not constrain a middle attempt or alter tactics under pressure; it is thematic rather than mechanical.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The mountain weather station is established early and anchors the setting across beats (window, instruments, scale). The instruments' swaying readings mirror the oracle's internal state, and the scale is used for the weighing attempt. However, the station supplies atmosphere rather than resources or constraints that alter outcome; it does not pressure a choice. Micro-setting participation is present but not tactical.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>After fever breaks is mentioned in the opening line and implied to mark a threshold ("after the fever's break, she must uncover"), but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or track as a live clock. The fever's aftermath is a static condition rather than a pressure that alters moves, and no recovery cost or deadline shapes tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>To find the weight of a swallowed truth is named explicitly as motivation early ("Her motivation was to find…") and recurs across beats (searching margins, weighing the illustration, realizing forgiveness). The desire drives multiple attempts and shapes the ending. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized in conflicted choices, and the final satisfaction (forgiveness allows release) is summarized without on-page friction between want and cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Auroral sorrow is named early and recurs throughout (green ribbons weaving sorrow, auroral sorrow echoes, deepened with regret and release, becomes internal peace). The tone is coherent and modulates slightly at closure (from shadow to peace). However, sorrow functions as atmospheric description rather than charging the final image with undeniable pressure; the ending's tone is explained rather than embodied, and the repetition of the phrase itself becomes ornamental.</comment>
