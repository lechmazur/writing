<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The guardian shows internal contradiction—caught between duty and homesickness, between knowing and befriending uncertainty—and these tensions drive micro-choices (pawing ice, licking the pendant, letting the door settle). The shift from "no longer to know, but to make friends with uncertainty" feels more asserted than earned through dramatized struggle; the interiority leans abstract and diagnostic ("dimensionally homesick," "foggy lucidity") rather than embodied. The final stance crystallization is legible but the path there relies heavily on reflection rather than physical-world pressure that forecloses options with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece signals "wait" early and accumulates through patterned images (mist, ice, pendant) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure—the guardian interiorizes the garden and accepts waiting as "a way of arranging the world." However, orientation anchors (who/where/when) emerge slowly and remain vague past the 120-word mark; the frozen garden and "between dimensions" setup lack spatial grounding until deep into the text. The closure effect lands (Earned Stasis: waiting becomes home with conceptual cost of never leaving), but cost feels implied rather than viscerally on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs (discovering the pendant reweights the guardian's stance), satisfying length requirements, yet causality often reads as synonymous restatement rather than because/therefore linkage.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The frozen garden, mist, and pendant provide recurring anchors, and the ice/stone tablets constrain movement. However, spatial choreography remains abstract—"between dimensions," "courtyard," and "garden" float without clear boundaries or physical layout. The pendant's role as lens and the ice as archive create micro-setting pressure, but the environment never forces a concrete tactical choice that alters outcome. Sensory detail leans heavily visual and conceptual (geometry, angles, glyphs) with minimal tactile or temperature grounding despite "frost" and "frozen." The guardian's body and the pendant qualify as micro-setting elements that recur and charge the final image, lifting the score into mid-band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: overcoming dimensional exile and making peace with uncertainty. The pendant's discovery provides one meaningful tightening—it reweights the guardian's understanding of its role—and the final image reconfigures waiting from sentence to syntax. However, the escalation relies on interior recalibration rather than external pressure that narrows live options. The "door that had never existed before" appears late without prior setup, reading ornamental rather than a choice-forcing complication. Agency is present (the guardian chooses to interiorize and "let the door settle") but cost feels abstract; no visible sacrifice or foreclosed path materializes on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme—befriending uncertainty, the limits of knowledge, exile as translation—emerges organically from the guardian's journey and avoids overt moralizing. The pendant as "a friend to uncertainty, a key to no door" and the final realization "home was a way of waiting" offer resonant, non-literal answers to the central question. The piece resists tidy binaries and invites reflection through particulars (licking frozen metal, digesting architecture into memory). However, several lines edge toward thematic echo: "certainty was the truest illusion of all" and "some knowledge must be given, not guarded" state the thesis rather than embodying it through scene pressure, triggering a mid-band penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on the guardian; perceptual signature is consistent (architectural metaphors, dimensional vocabulary). However, diction frequently drifts into elevated, abstract register ("dimensionally homesick," "foggy lucidity," "interiorizing exteriors") that feels authorial rather than character-rooted for a feral creature. Purposeful compression and lyric patterning are evident ("mist had become pages, the ice had become ink"), yet several beats rely on stock philosophical constructions ("waiting became a form of seeing") that flatten voice under pressure. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks, and the narrative stance coheres, keeping the score in mid-band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "waiting in one place felt like a different kind of eternity" → "waiting became a form of seeing" → "waiting was no longer a sentence but a syntax" recycle the same conceptual ground without added pressure. Template cadence runs appear ("It had waited… it was still dimensionally homesick… it had never been exiled"). Stock metaphors cluster in peak beats: "mist thickened," "door began to form," "dew." Register drifts into abstract philosophizing ("foggy lucidity," "braided together") that clashes with "feral" descriptor. Figurative language appears in nearly every sentence of the final third without pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering overwriting and loop penalties totaling approximately −1.2, and the final-third artifact spread disallows 9+ globally and caps high-band entries at 8.8.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The "library guardian trapped between dimensions" premise offers a fresh angle on exile and knowledge, and the pendant as conceptual lens rather than plot device shows ingenuity. The transformation of "waiting" into syntax and the interiorization method provide non-obvious synthesis. However, several beats lean on familiar metaphors (mist as uncertainty, ice as stasis, door as possibility) without sharp transformation, and the final image—door forming from mist while the protagonist waits—echoes threshold-fantasy templates. The piece commits to its premise and follows implications without retreat, avoiding safety-middle hedging, which lifts it into mid-band despite derivative elements.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Character present throughout; guardian's choices (pawing ice, licking pendant, letting door settle) create small turns and the final stance shift. However, decisions feel interior and contemplative rather than tactically altering external options. Meets two gates (setup, payoff) but middle development is weak; the guardian observes and reflects more than it acts under pressure. Causal pressure is mild; cost connection abstract.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Pendant introduced early (gate 1), handled across multiple beats (appears as warmth, lens, memory trigger, chest weight), and charges the final image as "no longer warm, simply present—a friend to uncertainty." Three gates met; two distinct beats (discovery, licking/tasting, final resting); closure linkage strong. However, its mechanics (showing "what light could never reach") remain abstract and do not constrain a concrete tactical choice. Specificity and irreplaceability moderate; cost connection conceptual rather than visible.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Concept appears early ("boundary of light") and recurs thematically ("where vision itself became meaningless," "boundaries of light no longer troubled it"). However, it functions as theme claim rather than shaping on-page stakes or tactics. The guardian does not face a choice about light versus darkness that alters outcome. Present and logically consistent but swappable with "boundaries of knowledge" or similar abstraction. Meets setup and payoff gates; middle development weak. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Attribute labeled early and recurs ("dimensionally homesick," "nostalgia for a place it was still building"). Constrains the guardian's stance (cannot leave, must wait) and motivates the interiorization method. However, cost is conceptual; no on-page action shows the guardian sacrificing something tangible due to homesickness. Meets setup and payoff gates; middle use is label-repetition rather than tactical friction. Shapes one key turn (acceptance at closure) but swappable with "exiled" or "trapped."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Action present throughout as dominant method; waiting reframes from passive to active ("waiting became a form of seeing," "waiting was no longer a sentence but a syntax"). Drives the closure effect (Earned Stasis) and shapes the guardian's arc across multiple beats. Three gates met; causal pressure strong; closure linkage undeniable. However, the mechanics of waiting do not narrow live tactical options or force visible trade-offs on the page; the transformation is interior and conceptual. Cost connection moderate; irreplaceability high.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Method introduced mid-text ("interiorizing exteriors, a technique learned in the deeper stacks") and explained through the licking/digesting beat. Shapes the final turn (guardian "interiorized every exterior" and dissolves garden into library). Meets development and payoff gates but lacks early setup. Two beats (licking pendant, final dissolution); causal pressure moderate; closure linkage strong. However, the mechanics are abstract and the method could be replaced with "remembering" or "absorbing" without structural loss. Late introduction caps at 4.6 baseline; causal work and closure lift to mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setting present throughout; frozen garden, mist, and ice provide recurring anchors. The ice constrains movement (guardian must paw/lick to reveal pendant) and the mist charges the final image ("mist had become pages"). Three gates met; two beats (ice revelation, mist transformation); closure linkage strong. However, the garden's spatial layout remains vague and does not force tactical choices that alter outcome. Micro-setting (ice, pendant, body) does more causal work than the macro-environment. Specificity moderate; irreplaceability low for "frozen garden" alone, higher when ice/mist are considered as textural elements.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Timeframe recurs as phrase ("through the veil of sleep") and frames the guardian's state (waiting across "centuries," "millennia"). However, time does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the guardian exists in stasis and the narrative clock is absent. The phrase functions as atmospheric marker rather than constraint. Meets setup and payoff gates; middle development weak. Ornamental use; no visible pressure from elapsed time or deadline. Swappable with "across ages" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Motivation stated explicitly ("no longer to know, but to make friends with uncertainty") and drives the arc from guarding knowledge to accepting not-knowing. Shapes the closure effect (befriending the pendant, accepting the door's ambiguity). Three gates met; two beats (realization, final acceptance); closure linkage strong. However, friction between want and cost is told more than dramatized; the guardian does not face a concrete on-page choice where certainty and uncertainty compete with visible sacrifice. Causal pressure moderate; cost connection conceptual.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Tone coheres as dreamlike, philosophical, and abstract throughout; "foggy lucidity" captures the texture. Modulates subtly (pendant discovery adds warmth, final image charges with resolution) and supports the accumulative lens. The tone charges the final image ("foggy lucidity between waking and sleep") and remains consistent through turns. However, the tone is static in mood—no sharp pressure shifts or tonal breaks that mark escalation—and leans heavily on repetitive phrasing ("mist," "fog," "veil"). Coherence strong; modulation weak; closure linkage present.</comment>
