<question>1</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The investigator remains a professional role rather than a differentiated character with embodied contradictions. Her internal life consists largely of summary statements ("She wanted to cultivate foresight") and label-only emotions ("the weight of the silence"). The sole micro-choice—quickening her pace in response to new variables—occurs late and feels procedural rather than value-revealing. No visible cost forecloses a path; she drives away with the patch "stitched into her memory," a metaphor without consequence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when adequately by ~120 words and maintains causal sequencing (arrival → measurement → hypothesis → vantage → departure). However, closure is declarative rather than dramatized: "She would publish her findings" tells future action instead of showing a present decisive change or charged reconfiguration. The inferred lens is Causal, but the final paragraph shifts into thematic summary ("the world was a web of converging forces") rather than letting the image land with felt cost. One meaningful tightening occurs when she quickens her pace, but the ending deflates into exposition.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The container labyrinth is vividly established with selective sensory detail (rusted walls, haze, echoing boots, venturi effect). Spatial choreography is coherent across ground-level and catwalk vantage points. The wind patterns constrain her methodology and drive the survey action. However, the setting does not charge the final image—she simply drives away—and the labyrinth's pressure dissolves once she leaves, missing the opportunity to reconfigure meaning through environment at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake (prevent future accidents by mapping wind hazards) is signaled early and coheres throughout. One tightening occurs when she notes the spike in velocity and imagines the rescue-helicopter scenario, narrowing her tactical focus. However, escalation is largely conceptual rather than embodied in on-page pressure; no live obstacle tests her hypothesis or forces a trade-off. The resolution—deciding to publish—is stated intent without visible cost or dramatized consequence, weakening the closure under the Causal lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The theme of convergence emerges organically from the wind/geometry investigation and the flight engineer's patch linking sky and sea. However, the final paragraph over-articulates this theme ("a web of converging forces," "the singular moment when everything aligned") rather than trusting the image to resonate. The patch functions as a talisman but its thematic weight is told more than earned through specific experience. No meaningful ambiguity or counter-reading is offered; the investigator's realization arrives fully formed without struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited throughout with no head-hopping. However, the perceptual signature is generic investigator rather than character-particular; her noticing defaults to procedural observation without idiosyncratic filter. Diction is competent but bland ("She noted," "She realized," "She imagined"), lacking rhythmic modulation under pressure. The voice reads as template rather than singular, with recycled sentence stems ("She moved," "She recorded," "She climbed") that flatten momentum. No dialogue appears.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Multiple text artifacts degrade line-level control. Template cadence dominates: seven consecutive "She [verb]" openers in paragraphs 6–12, plus synonym churn ("rapidly adapting" appears twice, "singular convergence" three times). Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines (e.g., "the wind here was not random; it funneled through specific corridors" restates without added pressure). Peak beats rely on stock metaphors ("heavy fog," "steel skyscrapers") and filter-verb stacks ("She felt the weight," "She imagined the future"). The final paragraph over-explains closure rather than letting the image do work, and the patch metaphor "stitched into her memory" exemplifies unearned figurative language.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The core premise—wind investigation at an abandoned port following an aerial/terrestrial collision—offers modest freshness, but execution defaults to procedural template. The investigator's methodology and internal arc could transplant to any disaster site without alteration. Stock images (containers as "steel skyscrapers," silence as "heavy fog") and the explicit thesis-statement ending ("the world was a web of converging forces") signal surface originality without transformative specificity. No bold structural or perspectival risk elevates the material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The investigator is present throughout and makes one micro-choice (quickening her pace), but most action is observational rather than decision-driven. Her final stated intention to publish findings is told, not dramatized as a turn. Early signal and beat involvement are present, but causal pressure and closure linkage remain weak.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The patch appears in three beats (initial clue, pocket warmth, final metaphor), satisfying the minimum count. However, its presence is largely ornamental: it does not constrain tactics or enable a key choice. The closure reprise ("stitched into her memory") is figurative rather than causal, offering symbolic weight without cost. Swappable with any talisman object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Singular convergence shapes the investigator's hypothesis and tactical focus (venturi effect, wind/geometry alignment). It appears early, drives her middle survey action, and returns in the final image. However, the concept does not narrow options or impose a felt cost; it remains a thematic throughline rather than a stake-altering force. Development and payoff are present but pressure is conceptual rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>The attribute "rapidly adapting" is mentioned twice as a label ("Her training taught her to be rapidly adapting"; "her mind rapidly adapting to the new variables") but never dramatized with visible tradeoff or cost. No on-page action shows adaptation constraining or enabling a choice under pressure. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Survey drives the entire arc: she arrives to survey, conducts measurements throughout, and resolves to publish the survey findings. The action is signaled early, sustains pressure across beats, and anchors the closure (even if that closure is told rather than shown). Major turns trace to this action; removing it would break story logic. Strong beat involvement and causal pressure, though specificity could be sharper.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Wind-pattern documentation is signaled early (handheld anemometer, recording gusts), executed across multiple beats (ground-level readings, catwalk vantage, venturi spike), and directly shapes the closure (publishing findings). The method constrains her tactics and provides the mechanism for hypothesis validation. Strong setup, development, and payoff; moderate causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The container labyrinth pressures every beat: narrow alleys funnel wind, vantage points alter observation, spatial geometry creates the hazard she's investigating. The setting is introduced immediately, constrains her methodology (anemometer readings between containers), and supplies the venturi channel that validates her hypothesis. Strong setup, development, and closure linkage; the environment is indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the town went silent" establishes an eerie backdrop and recurs once ("the absence of dockworkers, the emptied city"). However, it does not tighten decisions or escalate pressure; no live clock constrains her actions. The silence functions as mood rather than stake. Present in setup and one middle beat, but lacks development into tactical pressure or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to cultivate foresight in action" is stated explicitly once and implied in her decision to publish a preventive guide. However, it is told rather than dramatized through conflicted choices or visible cost. No friction appears between this desire and competing wants or fears. Present in setup and closure, but lacks middle development where the motivation would constrain action under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Hazy precision is sustained throughout: vivid container detail and exact wind measurements coexist within atmospheric murk. The tone modulates subtly (silence pressing, haze thickening) and charges the investigator's clarity-amid-murk arc. However, the final paragraph drifts into over-explanation, breaking the precision with thematic summary. Setup and development are strong; closure participation weakens when tone shifts to expository.</comment>
