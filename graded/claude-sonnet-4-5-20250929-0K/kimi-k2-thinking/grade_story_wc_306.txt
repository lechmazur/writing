<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The protagonist as "conscience for hire" remains abstract; interior contradiction exists ("my own conscience was for hire") but the central conflict—advising others while doubting oneself—never forces a difficult micro-choice with visible cost. Embodied emotion is scarce; the cloak and mirror function as symbolic props rather than pressure-testing flaws. The keeper's arrival and the protagonist's letting the cloak slip read as declared transformation rather than earned through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who/where/when anchors arrive early enough. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—atmosphere and motif build toward the keeper's instruction—but closure lacks decisive on-page cost. The protagonist "lets the cloak slip…not to discard it, but to wear it more loosely" is declaration, not a felt forfeiture or resonant reconfiguration; no visible option is foreclosed. Motifs (campfire spark, hollow mirror, wind chimes) recur but do not constrain choice or reweight meaning at the ending with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse, wind chimes, and mirror shard are vividly sketched and sensory details (salt scent, jingle, spectrum of light) ground the reader. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or charge the final image; the iron lantern hook and staircase serve as stage-setting rather than tactical obstacles. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—welcoming nuance into certainty—is signaled early but never tested by a meaningful tightening that forecloses a live option. Unhooking the lantern and ascending the stairs are unopposed; no reversal or deepening forces a trade-off. The keeper's instruction and the protagonist's acceptance occur without dramatized resistance or visible price, leaving escalation flat under any lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Theme—nuance over certainty—emerges clearly from motifs (hollow mirror, cloak of doubt) but is stated overtly in multiple passages: "You have unhooked the certainty within yourself," "truth is never a single note." The final image (touching the mirror shard, remembering the spectrum) recycles prior material without a non-literal reweighting; the ending summarizes the thesis rather than letting particulars resonate.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Narrative voice carries a distinct, elevated register ("breezy lighthouse," "bruised horizon," "protected vulnerability") that remains consistent. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. However, diction occasionally drifts into abstraction ("the paradox I wore," "invitation to embrace") that softens immediacy, and the keeper's sparse dialogue does not reveal distinct idiom. Purposeful compression in lyric passages is legible but does not fully escape self-commentary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is mostly coherent, but paraphrase loops appear: "emptiness…void…emptiness" restates across adjacent lines; "hollow mirror shard" is repeated verbatim six times without evolving function. Template cadence runs appear ("I lifted…I grasped…I reached") across three or more sentences. Stock metaphors ("pale eye blinking," "inner fire burned bright") reduce specificity at key beats. Apply −0.6 for loops and stems, −0.3 for stock strings in closure paragraph: total −0.9.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The "conscience for hire" frame and symbolic objects (cloak, mirror, chimes) are fresh in isolation, but the arc—journey to mentor, receive wisdom, internalize lesson—follows a familiar template without transformation through lived cost. The final campfire-reprise and "inner fire burned bright" cliché undercut specificity. No bold structural or perspectival risk heightens stakes; the piece hedges toward median resolution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The "conscience for hire" frames the protagonist's trade and appears in setup and ending narration, but no on-page decision leverages this attribute to create a key turn or cost. The protagonist observes and narrates internal conflict without dramatizing a choice where being-for-hire forecloses an option or imposes a price. Present across beats but functionally ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The hollow mirror shard appears in setup (carried, reflecting grey sky), is lifted to catch sunrise light mid-story (splitting into spectrum yet staying void), and is touched in the final paragraph as a reminder. Three beats total. However, its use is descriptive; it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. The ending reprise ("touch the hollow mirror shard and remember") recycles prior meaning without reweighting the stake with cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "cloak of doubt" is worn from the start, pulled tighter once, then "slip[s] from my shoulders…to wear it more loosely" near the end. Present in setup and closure, but the moment of slipping is told, not shown through a tactical choice or visible cost. It shapes the protagonist's internal monologue but does not narrow options or enable a specific action under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Sincerely insincere" appears twice as a label: once describing the cloak ("a paradox I wore sincerely insincere") and once mirroring the keeper's smile. No on-page action traces to this trait; it remains thematic decoration. Late in first third, label-only, no cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Unhook" appears twice with causal weight: unhooking the lantern that blocks the entrance allows ascent, and the keeper's instruction to "unhook the certainty within yourself" frames the thematic turn. Present in middle and ending; the physical act enables the next beat, and the metaphorical extension charges the closure moment. However, the lantern is unopposed and the internal "unhooking" is declared rather than dramatized with visible cost, capping the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Deciphering wind chime selections" is introduced early with specific mechanics (high/low/clash meanings), appears in three beats (initial discordant melody, clash during reverie, gentle cascade while ascending, final symphony), and the protagonist learns the language. Present across beats and mentioned at closure. However, the chimes signal mood rather than constrain a choice; the protagonist does not use the deciphering method to solve a problem or alter tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The "breezy lighthouse at dawn" anchors who/where/when in the opening, provides the spiral staircase and gallery for mid-story movement, and frames the ending departure. Present in setup, middle (ascent), and closure (stepping out). The wind and chimes add sensory texture, but the setting does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it remains atmospheric backdrop.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After the campfire's last spark dies" bookends the story (opening and closing lines) and dawn light triggers the mirror-spectrum moment mid-story. Present in setup and closure with one middle beat. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency; the protagonist's journey unfolds at a reflective pace with no live clock altering tactics. The reprise at the end is lyric but does not reweight a cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"To welcome nuance into certainty" is stated as motivation in the keeper's instruction and echoed in the protagonist's reflection ("desire to shed black-and-white judgments"). Present in middle and closure. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through a choice where nuance and certainty conflict with visible cost. No on-page friction between the want and a competing pressure forces a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Protected vulnerability" is named once ("I wore my protected vulnerability like a badge of honor") and implied in the cloak-as-shield-and-prison paradox. The tone oscillates between wistful introspection and declarative insight but does not modulate sharply with pressure or charge the final image with emotional cost. Present thematically but not cohering through turns to elevate closure.</comment>
