<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael's interiority is present but often declarative rather than embodied under pressure. The pyramid scheme backstory frames motivation, but internal contradiction remains abstract—"shame converting into quiet resolve" reads as summary rather than simultaneous impulses in scene. The final choice to collect diamonds and donate them lacks visible emotional friction or cost; we're told he "smiled" but not shown what path this forecloses. Micro-choices exist (turning the bolt, reprogramming the timer) but feel frictionless, as though the pressure to act never competes with doubt or competing need.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Drive lens infers as Causal-Hybrid with lyric undercurrents, but the closure unit is weak: the diamonds appear via pressure application, then are deposited in a fund without visible cost or foreclosed path on the page. The owner "could only marvel," erasing potential consequence. Orientation is delayed—who Kael is and why he's at the farm emerges piecemeal across the first third—but the disorientation is not taught as pattern and does not charge the ending (−0.4 per Orientation Test; Q3 capped at 7.0). The quantum promise mechanism feels coincidental rather than earned; the glitchy texts guide without Kael wrestling with belief or trade-off. One tightening occurs (the bolt turn at bloom peak) but the aftermath diffuses rather than deepens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The bioluminescent mushroom farm supplies vivid sensory anchors (blue glow, sapphire cast, mycelium) and the submarine porthole bolt is handled concretely. Spatial choreography is clear within the cavern. However, the setting does not materially constrain Kael's choice—he adjusts irrigation and turns a bolt without environmental resistance or resource scarcity shaping tactics. The final image uses the glow as backdrop but the environment itself does not charge the closure decision. Capped at 7.0 per Orientation Test application in Q2.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>One dominant stake is signaled: repay debts by creating diamonds. The bolt-turn at bloom peak provides a single tightening, but escalation is minimal—Kael encounters no on-page obstacle, setback, or competing pressure that forces a trade-off. The owner's potential disapproval is mentioned but never dramatized; the resolution ("could only marvel") neutralizes cost rather than landing it. Agency is present (he turns the bolt) but the act feels unopposed, and the stakes declared (debts, community fund) remain abstract rather than viscerally tested. Coincidence (glitchy texts arrive without Kael's pursuit) complicates setup but does not resolve, meeting one bar, yet the lack of friction caps the band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme of pressure-as-transformation and redemption emerges organically from the mushroom/diamond alchemy and Kael's past. The quantum promise and "shadowseam wonder" motifs recur, but the final paragraph risks thematic summary: "turned his darkest pressure into the brightest gems" borders on stated moral. The ending offers a resonant image (porthole bolt glinting, glitchy texts silent) yet lacks ambiguity or non-literal answer—the transformation is delivered cleanly without complicating cost. Subtext operates in the glitchy messages but Kael's internal reconciliation with failure is told more than dramatized at closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Voice is consistent, with a lyric-philosophical register ("probabilistic bond," "waveform collapsing") that fits the sci-fi premise. Psychic distance is stable third-limited. However, diction occasionally elevates beyond the moment's urgency—"virtuously mischievous" and "shadowseam wonder" feel authorial rather than character-rooted. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext bullets are non-applicable. The prose modulates with pressure (short bursts during the bolt turn) but filter verbs ("knew," "realized," "wondered") cluster in reflective passages without always anchoring to present stimuli. Perceptual signature is present but not deeply idiosyncratic.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language (sapphire glow, stardust, threads of seam) is vivid. Paraphrase loops appear: "The quantum promise, Kael realized, was not a contract but a probabilistic bond" restates prior exposition without new pressure. Template cadence emerges in the final third with repeated "He [verb]" and "The [noun]" stems across adjacent paragraphs. Stock phrases—"heartbeat the world seemed to split," "quiet resolve," "mischief and virtue"—dilute specificity. Clarity remains high and no causality breaks occur, but density dips in the reflective back half (−0.6 for paraphrase + template patterns per Q7 artifact pack). Information density is uneven: early beats advance multiple jobs, later ones elaborate theme without new action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The quantum-promise + bioluminescent-farm premise is conceptually fresh, but execution leans on familiar redemption-arc scaffolding: fallen protagonist, exile, inventive gambit, community benefit, smiling resolution. The glitchy-text mechanism and pressure-to-diamonds alchemy offer novelty, yet neither is transformed through specific lived friction—Kael's doubt or the owner's resistance could sharpen the stakes but remain generic. Emotional truth (shame, resolve) is present but template-shaped. The final image (porthole bolt glinting, texts silent) gestures toward resonance without a non-obvious synthesis that reweights prior material. No close echoes of famous lines, but the safety middle (virtuous mischief rewarded without lasting cost) avoids bold risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Pyramid scheme survivor is setup in the opening line and frames Kael's motivation (debt repayment, redemption). It constrains his initial exile choice and colors his obsession with the quantum promise. However, the past failure does not shape a key on-page turn—he acts without dramatized friction between old shame and new risk. The trait is thematic anchor but does not force a visible trade-off or alter tactics under pressure at closure. Two gates met (setup, middle motivation); payoff is ornamental (mentioned in final reflection but not causally active in the diamond collection). Swappable with "debt-ridden inventor" or similar. Score: functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Submarine porthole bolt appears early (salvaged console description), is handled concretely in two beats (Kael discovers the release function, then turns it at climax), and recurs in the final image ("porthole bolt glinted"). The bolt enables the pressure burst that crystallizes diamonds, making it causally active at closure. However, the bolt's submarine origin and pressure-gauge history feel decorative; any valve or release mechanism could serve the same function with minor edits. Specificity (porthole, submarine provenance) does not constrain choice uniquely. Three gates met; causal involvement in climax and closure participation earn mid-7 eligibility, but swappability and ornamental backstory cap the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Quantum promise is introduced early via glitchy texts and shapes Kael's belief that cross-dimensional commitment can materialize diamonds. It colors his interpretation of the messages and frames the experiment's stakes. However, the concept remains thematic rather than tactical—Kael does not wrestle with the promise's mechanics, test its limits, or face a choice where quantum uncertainty constrains action. The "probabilistic bond" and "waveform collapsing" exposition in the final third is told reflection, not dramatized pressure. Setup and middle development present; closure participation is tangential (concept is named but does not drive the final image or choice). Functional in motivation but swappable with "alchemical secret" or "mystical catalyst."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>Virtuously mischievous is declared once ("Kael's grin was virtuously mischievous") as he reprograms the timer without owner approval. The trait colors one action—unauthorized experiment for communal good—but the friction is minimal and the cost is neutralized when the owner marvels instead of confronting. No visible trade-off between virtue and mischief appears on the page; the label asserts a duality the scene does not test. Setup late (beyond first third); development weak (one beat, label-only); closure absent. Ornamental use, swappable with "rebellious philanthropist" or "rogue benefactor."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Volunteer frames Kael's presence at the farm ("self-imposed exile after the digital smoke cleared") and provides access to the mushroom beds, irrigation console, and bolt. The action is setup and enables all subsequent beats, but it does not generate a key turn—Kael's decision to volunteer is backstory, not a live choice under pressure. The role constrains his environment (underground chambers, mycologist's warnings) but does not force a mid-story tactical shift or closure-moment trade-off. Setup strong; middle development present (access to tools); closure participation indirect (the farm thrives, but volunteer status is not reweighted in the final image). Functional and necessary for spatial logic, but one-note causal role caps score in mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Glitchy text messages from parallel dimensions appear early (first message by ~10% mark) and recur across three beats: initial prank dismissal, irrigation console echo, and final confirmation text. The method shapes Kael's belief and timing (messages guide pressure peak at bloom). However, the mechanism is passive—messages arrive without Kael pursuing or testing them; he does not decode, respond, or adapt when they conflict. The final text ("Promise kept") closes the loop but does not alter Kael's action or choice; it arrives after the diamonds appear. Setup early; development present (console echo, bloom timing cue); closure weak (confirmatory rather than causal). The method enables but does not constrain; swappable with "encrypted radio signals" or "prophetic dreams."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Bioluminescent mushroom farm is anchored early and sustained throughout: underground chambers, blue glow, mycelium substrate, irrigation console, and bloom cycle. The setting supplies the resource (carbon-rich substrate) and constraint (mushrooms thrive under pressure; timing must align with bloom peak). Spatial choreography is clear; the cavern's glow charges multiple images. The setting shapes tactics (Kael adjusts irrigation, waits for bloom, releases pressure at peak) and the final image (diamonds in glowing mycelium, farm thriving). Three gates met; causal pressure in climax and closure charge. Specificity (bioluminescent, submarine relic) matters but could be simplified to "pressure-sensitive farm" without breaking core logic, capping score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.4</grade><comment>When concepts become physical is stated as the catalyst condition ("the process required a catalyst, a trigger that existed only when concepts became physical") and echoed in Kael's realization ("quantum promise was not a contract but a probabilistic bond"). The timeframe motivates Kael's experiment (align pressure burst with bloom/spore-light release) but remains abstract—no ticking clock or urgency tightens decisions on the page. The moment arrives ("The moment arrived as the bioluminescent mushrooms reached their peak") but is narrated passively, and no trade-off or tension around timing appears. Setup present; middle development weak (timeframe mentioned but not pressured); closure absent (time is not reweighted or made visible in cost). Thematic more than tactical; swappable with "at the alchemical convergence" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>To translate pressure into diamonds is Kael's driving goal, stated early ("Kael saw an opportunity to translate that pressure into something tangible, something that could repay his debts") and pursued across the arc: discovery of bolt, reading texts, adjusting irrigation, turning bolt at bloom. The motivation is clear and shapes all major actions. However, internal friction is minimal—Kael does not face a competing desire (safety vs. risk, personal gain vs. community) or a moment where the cost of pursuit is tested on the page. The owner's potential disapproval is mentioned but never confronts Kael. Setup strong; development sustained (goal drives beats); closure present (diamonds collected, fund donation) but without dramatized tension between want and price. Functional across arc but lacks embodied conflict at closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Shadowseam wonder is named explicitly ("a shadowseam wonder forged from mischief and virtue," "the farm as a living seam") and evoked through imagery (blue glow, parallel dimensions, the shimmer at pressure peak). Tone is consistent—lyric, speculative, hopeful—and modulates slightly at the climax (tighter syntax during bolt turn, then expansive reflection). However, the tone does not tighten under peak pressure or charge the final image with new meaning; the ending diffuses into thematic summary rather than crystallizing wonder with cost. Setup early (luminescence, secrets); development present (shimmer, seam metaphor); closure weak (tone stated rather than embodied in final line). Coherent but static; does not deepen or reweight at closure.</comment>
