<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara's journey from numbness to feeling is present, but her interior life consists largely of poetic summary rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The climactic moment ("She felt the rustle of turning seasons within her, a thaw after eternal winter") reads as label-only emotional shift without micro-choices or dramatized struggle. The drum maker remains a vehicle for exposition rather than a character who applies pressure. Deafness functions thematically but does not constrain on-page tactics in concrete ways.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes who and where by the cavern arrival and advances through a single transformation: Elara receives the needle, experiences the backward song, and leaves changed. The closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (her heart becomes "a resonant chamber"), but cost remains abstract—no visible forfeiture or path foreclosed on the page. The lens reads Accumulative/Textural (density increase around the phonograph ritual reweights her numbness), yet the final image tells the change rather than showing a decisive trade-off or renunciation that alters her options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The cavern is anchored early with cold stone air, damp walls, and the phonograph in the darkest corner. The drum and needle function as micro-setting objects that constrain the ritual, and the needle is later embedded in the drum skin, charging the closure. Sensory selection favors sound-adjacent detail (vibration, shimmer, air shiver) filtered through Elara's deafness. However, spatial choreography remains generic; we do not track how she moves through the cavern or how proximity to objects alters her choices during the peak beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—defeating numbness—is signaled early and tightens when Elara accepts the needle and feels the backward song. Yet escalation is passive: she receives, listens, feels, leaves. No on-page reversal forces a trade-off; the drum maker hands her solutions without complication. The "mirrored hush" ritual succeeds immediately with no friction, and the cost ("numbness finally defeated") is declared rather than dramatized as a forfeiture or endurance that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme of silence-as-bridge emerges through the filament-of-hush conceit and backward song, avoiding overt statement until the final paragraph's thesis ("her deafness became a bridge, not a barrier"). The phonograph ritual and drum reprise offer a non-literal answer to numbness, but the last lines ("Thus, the deaf music teacher found her song") summarize rather than trust the image. The "mirrored hush" motif recurs but does not constrain a choice or charge the final image with undeniable cost—it remains a poetic label.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, anchored in Elara's perception. Diction leans lyric ("cotton silence," "filament of hush") throughout, which reads as consistent voice rather than register drift. However, perceptual signature is generic; the narrator's way of noticing does not reveal character-specific bias. The drum maker's explanation ("silence could be carved like wood") and the backward-song mechanics arrive as exposition rather than filtered through Elara's understanding, creating a small psychic distance slip at the pivotal beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative language appears in most sentences across high-pressure beats ("cocoon of echoing quiet," "fissures spreading like ice on a warming lake") without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating density overload (−0.5). Paraphrase loops cluster in the final third: "her numbness finally defeated" / "her heart no longer a silent drum" / "found her song" restate the closure three times without added pressure (−0.4). Template cadence runs through the middle (she accepted, she placed, she closed, she felt, she opened) without variation (−0.4). Information density suffers; many lines do two jobs (image + emotion claim) but momentum stalls in the resolution summary.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The backward-recorded-song ritual and filament-of-hush conceit offer surface novelty, but the arc (teacher seeks cure, receives magical object, feels transformation) follows a retrieval-quest template without moral calculus or trade-off. The drum maker as wise-giver and the phonograph as artifact read as stock fantasy roles. Transformation test fails: swap "deaf music teacher" for "mute painter" and "backward song" for "reversed color," and the emotional beats remain identical. No bold risk heightens stakes; the piece retreats into poetic summary at closure rather than trusting a charged image.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Elara is present throughout and her quest to defeat numbness frames the arc, satisfying setup and development. However, her choices are passive: she climbs, accepts, places, feels. The drum maker hands her the needle; the phonograph ritual succeeds without complication. At closure she "left the cavern carrying the drum" and "taught her students," but these are told outcomes rather than on-page decisions that alter tactics or foreclose a path. She observes and receives rather than driving turns.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The broken phonograph needle appears in three beats: the drum maker withdraws it and explains its function (setup), Elara accepts it and places it on the phonograph (development), and she embeds it in the drum skin at closure (payoff). Its "broken" state and "filament of hush" property are specific and irreplaceable. However, the needle does not constrain a choice—Elara never struggles with its use or sacrifices an alternative path. It enables the ritual without friction, trending toward tool-as-gift rather than object that pressures tactics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The "filament of hush" is named early and explained by the drum maker ("silence could be carved like wood, a thin thread of quiet woven into sound"). It reappears when the backward song "stretched through the cavern" and again when the drum "sang through wood and air." The concept shapes the ritual's mechanism and charges the final image, but it does not alter Elara's options or force a trade-off. It remains a poetic label for the transformation rather than a constraint that narrows tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Audibly muted" describes the backward song's quality ("an audibly muted pulse, a shimmer of sound barely there") but does not constrain Elara's action or impose a visible cost. The phrase is ornamental, clarifying the ritual's texture without altering her choices. It could be replaced with "faint" or "hushed" without structural impact. No tradeoff or tactic shift hinges on this specific attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Enthrall" appears once: "The backward song enthralled her, pulling at the locked chambers of her heart." This moment precedes the emotional thaw and drives the climactic reversal from numbness to feeling. However, the action is passive (she is enthralled) rather than a decision she makes. Swapping "enthrall" for "move" or "overwhelm" would require only minor edits. The verb labels the effect rather than shaping Elara's response or constraining her next move.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Backward recorded songs are signaled early when the drum maker explains the method, used at the cavern climax when the stylus traces the groove in reverse, and mentioned again when Elara's drum resonates with the "backward song." The method's mechanics matter: reversing the song produces the "mirrored hush" that breaks Elara's numbness. However, the backward-play technique arrives as a gift rather than a constraint Elara navigates; she does not attempt, fail, or adapt. The method enables closure but does not shape her tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The drum maker's cavern is anchored early (cold stone air, damp walls, forgotten rhythms) and houses the phonograph in its "darkest corner," supplying the spatial resource for the ritual. The cavern's isolation mirrors Elara's numbness and its "mirrored hush" at closure charges the theme. Yet the setting does not constrain a choice or complicate access—Elara climbs the path without obstacle, and the cavern grants its resources freely. It functions as meaningful backdrop rather than active pressure on her tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>"The faint rustle of turning seasons" bookends the piece (autumn arrives at the opening, the rustle follows her down the mountain at closure) but does not tighten decisions or track elapsed time. The timeframe remains vague; we do not know how long the ritual lasts or what temporal cost Elara pays. The seasonal frame adds thematic resonance (thaw, new life) but does not function as a live clock that alters her moves or imposes a deadline.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to defeat emotional numbness is established early ("Deafness had wrapped her heart in a cotton silence") and drives her climb to the cavern. The goal is tested when she trembles accepting the needle and again when "the numbness cracked" during the ritual. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices. She does not weigh alternatives, sacrifice a competing want, or endure friction; the ritual succeeds immediately. Cost is emotional-label ("tears streaming") rather than a visible forfeiture that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Mirrored hush" names the tone and recurs as a motif: the backward song produces it, the cavern fills with it, and Elara teaches with it. The tone is coherent—lyric, meditative, charged with quiet—and modulates subtly when "the numbness cracked." The phrase charges the final image ("the mirrored hush lived on"). Yet the tone remains static across beats; the piece sustains one mood without tonal escalation or break that pressures the ending. The hush mirrors itself without transforming under stress.</comment>
