<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The survivor's motivation is concrete and embodied through tactile collection rituals (pressing palms, layering scraps), though the interiority occasionally drifts toward abstract philosophical phrasing ("topology of erasures"). The final choice—placing the box and watching it refuse to float—carries visible cost (anchoring versus erasure) but arrives through accumulation rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Micro-choices throughout (recognizing handwriting, layering fragments) reveal hierarchy of values, yet the protagonist remains largely reactive until the final third. Emotional progression is credible but lacks the irrational layering or self-deception that would elevate complexity.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (Grid, survivor, containers) land by ~100 words; the pattern of fragment-collection is taught early and held. Closure achieves Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): the survivor places the box, watches it resist the tide, and stands "nameless, real," with the cost legible in the anchoring image—he has chosen weight over disappearance. One meaningful deepening occurs when the poison label's handwriting is recognized, reweighting his erasure. Pressure coheres through tidal rhythm and layered fragments, though some beats (stevedore's memory, customs agent's regret) feel ornamental rather than causally necessary to the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The Grid's spatial logic (containers stacked twenty high, vent holes, salt-stained concrete) remains coherent and constrains the survivor's collection method. Tidal rhythm functions as micro-setting, shaping when fragments appear (lowest tide, high tide) and charging the final image when water "licks the edges" of the box. Sensory selection is purposeful: salt on skin, corrugated metal, "wet hours." The poison bottle wedged between Container B-7734 supplies both a concrete object and a spatial anchor that drives the recognition beat. The box's refusal to float depends on the tide's physical presence, fulfilling the 9+ gate (environment charges the final image).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering memory's texture) is signaled early and deepens when the poison label reveals his own handwriting—erasure becomes personal rather than abstract. The three-day vigil watching tides adds pressure through temporal constraint, and the final placement of the box crystallizes his stance: he will not disappear. One clear tightening occurs (recognition of handwriting), though the stevedore/customs-agent fragments feel like illustrative padding rather than escalating pressure. Cost is visible in the ending image (anchored versus erased) but arrives through patient accumulation rather than a protagonist decision that forecloses a live option under duress.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (erased histories concentrate rather than vanish; memory's texture is "salt on skin after water has dried") emerges through concrete particulars—layered scraps, the tackle box's growing weight, tidal rhythm. The poison label as proof of prior existence anchors the conceptual question in a physical object with visible cost (brittle paper, bitter memory). The ending image (box refusing to float) offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. Minor slip: "the texture of what it means to have been dead and still be living" edges toward thematic summary, though it remains tied to on-page action. The final paragraph's ship's horn and readiness to collect more fragments extend the question rather than closing it prematurely.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: the survivor notices corrugated metal texture, vent-hole confessions, tidal marks. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent ("ghost with fingerprints," "topology of erasures"), though occasional register drift into elevated abstraction ("administrative erasure," "cosmic scale") feels slightly unmotivated for a character living in containers. Narrative distance modulates purposefully (closer during the poison-label recognition, wider during tidal summaries). No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts serve emotional beats. Minor template cadence in some paragraph openings ("The survivor...," "He...") but not pervasive enough to flatten rhythm.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character understanding or thematic weight. Rhythm varies purposefully, accelerating at the poison-label recognition and slowing during the three-day vigil. Minor paraphrase loop detected: "filters reality differently" (paragraph 5) is restated as "filtering the morning light through the reality of his own making" (paragraph 39) without added pressure—this recurrence feels ornamental rather than pattern-taught. Some figurative language is dense ("sediment of stories—fragments that drift like tidal debris") but remains coherent. Sentence openings vary adequately. No grammar errors or pronoun confusion. The loop and elevated register in a few beats prevent entry to 8+.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Core premise (administrative death-certificate error leaves survivor unmade, collecting others' memories to rebuild selfhood) offers a fresh synthesis of bureaucratic erasure and lyric fragment-collection. The poison label as tactile proof of prior existence is a specific, non-obvious hinge. Tidal rhythm as heartbeat and containers as sealed histories avoid generic "port city" tropes. The transformation test holds: this story would collapse with different anchors (death certificate, poison label, tides). Minor proximity concern: "ghost with fingerprints" and "nameless, real" echo familiar literary paradoxes without fully transforming them. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and fragment-layering method elevates but does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Character present throughout; drives fragment-collection and final box-placement. Recognizing own handwriting on the poison label (middle beat) alters his understanding, and the decision to place the box at high tide (ending) crystallizes stance. Two key turns trace to his choices, though much of the middle is observational. Early signal, middle choice, closure participation all present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Poison label appears at dawn discovery (beat 1), is studied for three days (beat 2), layered between other fragments (beat 3), written on (beat 4), and placed in the box at the ending (beat 5). It proves prior existence and provides the handwriting-recognition turn. Strong causal pressure (narrows options from abstract to personal), closure linkage (box contains it at ending), and specificity (CAUTION: POISON with scratched-out eyes, his handwriting). Irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Erased histories as concept frames the survivor's situation (death certificate, database typo) and motivates fragment-collection. The concept reappears explicitly in "topology of erasures" and "erased histories don't disappear—they concentrate." It shapes stakes (he seeks memory-texture to counter erasure) and the ending reweights it (the box's mass registers existence). Setup early, middle development (layering fragments), payoff at closure. Causal pressure moderate; the concept guides tactics but does not force a single irreversible choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Filters reality differently" appears in paragraph 5 ("Reality filters through differently when your existence is a typo") and is restated in the ending ("filtering the morning light through the reality of his own making"). It enables the perceptual mode (colors bleed, sounds echo futures) but does not constrain a specific on-page action with visible cost. Label-only in setup; lyric reprise at closure reweights slightly but remains abstract. Two-gate presence (setup, payoff); no middle development beat where the trait alters a choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Layer" as action drives the story: he layers the poison label between confessions (beat 1), adds the woman's whisper above the label (beat 2), writes on the label's back as final layer (beat 3), and the box's layered weight anchors it at the ending (beat 4). Removing "layer" would break the story's texture-discovery logic and the ending's mass metaphor. Early signal, multiple beats, closure participation, irreplaceable. Strong causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Method signaled early: crouching near vent holes, pressing palms, catching overheard confessions. The stevedore's memory and customs agent's regret are collected this way (middle beats), and the woman's whisper about her vanished brother arrives "through a vent" (late-middle beat). The method shapes his tactics (he moves through containers, listens, collects) and the final stance (ready to collect the ship's horn story). Three-gate presence, causal role in multiple beats, closure linkage. Mechanics matter and are irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Shipping-container labyrinth provides spatial logic (Container B-7734, stacked twenty high, vent holes, corrugated metal), supplies the poison bottle's wedge-spot, and constrains the survivor's collection method (he moves through them, crouches near vents). The Grid is named and its namelessness noted ("those who live here have no words for it"). Setting pressures choices (access via vents, tide proximity) and charges the final image (he turns toward the ship's horn, ready to navigate the labyrinth again). Early signal, middle constraint, closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Tidal rhythm is introduced early ("the rhythm of tides"), structures the three-day vigil ("lowest tide of the month," "high tide"), and becomes the survivor's heartbeat ("flood, ebb, flood, ebb"). The ending's high tide sets the timing for placing the box. Time tightens the poison-label vigil and shapes the ending action. Three-gate presence, moderate causal pressure (the tide schedules the final act), closure linkage. Not a live countdown that forces urgent choices, but a recurring frame that charges the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Motivation ("to discover the texture of memories") is stated early and dramatized through on-page actions: collecting fragments, studying the poison label, layering scraps. The middle beats test it (he wonders if memories feel like burlap or silk, if they cut or console) and the ending answers it (salt on skin, the sharp edge of refusal). The motivation drives all collection beats and is resolved at closure with visible cost (the box's anchoring weight). Setup, development, payoff all present; friction between the want and the cost of carrying the weight is legible.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Nameless identity" as tone: the survivor is a "ghost with fingerprints," exists in a nameless state, and ends "nameless, real." The tone of erasure-yet-presence coheres through turns (recognition of handwriting reaffirms existence, box-placement anchors it). Modulates with pressure (quiet vigil, sharp final stance). The ending crystallizes the nameless-real paradox in the image of standing without a name but filtering light through his own reality. Three-gate presence, coherent modulation, charges the final image. Slightly abstract but purposeful.</comment>
