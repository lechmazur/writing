<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael's motivation is clear and remains consistent throughout, but the piece operates largely in summary and reflection rather than pressing him with contradictory impulses in scene. His micro-choices—painting the phrase, watching from a hidden vantage—are methodical acts without visible internal friction or cost beyond sleeplessness as a static condition. Mira's gesture is observed, not encountered, so no relationship crucible tests him. The "methodically hopeful" trait is asserted more than it constrains a choice with on-page cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story assembles recurring images (moon, brush, greenhouse, script) toward a final resonance where tokens appear at the mural, but the closure unit is diffuse—watched ripples rather than a decisive on-page change in Kael's options or knowledge. The orientation is clear early (rooftop greenhouse, Ashglow, Kael). One tightening occurs when Mira notices the mural and leaves herbs, yet that beat is narrated from Kael's distance without a felt cost that forecloses a path. The ending recapitulates the vigil without a visible price or renunciation on the page, landing as thematic echo rather than resonant reconfiguration with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse, smog-choked city, and moonlight are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (amber haze, saffron quiet, indigo ink mixed with crushed starlight). The greenhouse functions as sanctuary and provides the moon-access required for the brush, constraining when Kael can work. Spatial choreography is clear across the greenhouse and later the derelict factory wall. The final image returns to the greenhouse under the waxing moon, charging the setting with thematic weight, though the body and tool do more causal work than the room itself.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: prove that strangers remember kindness. The story signals this early and Kael pursues it methodically, but the escalation is thin—he paints, Mira notices, others leave tokens—without a meaningful tightening that narrows his options or forces a trade-off. The reversal (Mira's herb bundle) is coincidental rather than driven by Kael's agency; he watches from hiding and feels hope, but no on-page choice or renunciation alters his tactics or forecloses a path. The lens is Accumulative, yet the final cadence shift is more summary ("continued his vigil") than a deepening that reweights cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—kindness mediated by lost languages, hope as vigil—emerges from concrete particulars (the brush, the phrase, the herb bundle) rather than direct statement. The final image of the vigil and the line "lost languages...lived in the breath of strangers" offer a resonant answer to the central question, though it leans toward assertion rather than non-literal reweighting. Subtext operates in Kael's hiding and Mira's gesture, but the ending paragraphs risk thematic echo ("methodically hopeful," "rouse a little more kindness") that restate rather than deepen.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV anchored to Kael; psychic distance is stable and voice carries a lyric, elevated register ("saffron quiet," "moon-singers," "quiet prayer"). The prose maintains distinct texture in word choice and rhythm, with purposeful compression ("insomnia became a ritual"). No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. Perceptual signature is present but narrow—Kael's lens stays in hopeful observation mode throughout. Under peak pressure (the fullest crescent, the herb bundle), diction remains elevated without modulating to match urgency, which slightly flattens the emotional arc.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The prose is generally clear and carries vivid images, but suffers from recurring scaffold and template cadence: "He was an insomniac painter who believed...," "His tool was...," "He understood that...," "The lost languages he painted were no longer lost; they lived in..." These stems and the reliance on list-like exposition ("a formula he had perfected through countless sleepless trials," "a tradition of her homeland that signified gratitude") dull momentum. Paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines ("insomnia became a ritual" / "insomnia persisted, but it was now a willing sentinel"). Filter verbs ("felt his heart rouse," "seemed to hum") cluster without voice motivation. The overwriting is consistent but not dense enough to obscure causality, so penalties remain within Q7. Figurative language ("pocket of green breathing," "moon-tipped brush") is vivid but occasionally mixed (does the brush tip shimmer or glow?). Information density is moderate; many sentences do one job rather than layering action, image, and choice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The premise—lost lunar script painted on city walls to rouse kindness—offers a fresh synthesis of calligraphy, insomnia, and urban alienation. Specific details (moon-tipped brush, crushed starlight ink, Mira's herb bundle) anchor the concept in particulars rather than abstraction. However, the emotional arc and plot structure follow a familiar template: solitary artist creates, stranger notices, community responds, artist feels validated. The transformation test is weak—swap the brush for another magical tool and the arc remains unchanged. No bold risk heightens stakes; the story plays safely within its lyric mode without pressing Kael into a costly choice or renunciation that would deepen originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kael is present throughout and his choices (cataloguing scripts, painting the phrase, watching from hiding) structure the narrative. However, these are methodical, low-friction acts; no on-page decision alters his tactics or forecloses a path with visible cost. His insomnia and hope are stated conditions rather than dramatized constraints. The middle beat (painting the mural) and the ending (continuing the vigil) involve him, but as an observer and executor rather than an agent under pressure. Swappable with "determined artist" without major edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The moon-tipped brush appears in three beats: introduction (passed down by Li Wei), active use (dipped in indigo ink, painted the phrase), and closure (resting in its jade case, "seemed to hum"). Its mechanics—shimmer only under moonlight—constrain when Kael can work and charge the fullest-crescent beat. The final reprise reweights it as a sentinel or affirmation. However, the brush does not force a choice with cost; Kael uses it without friction or sacrifice. Strong presence and symbolic weight, but not indispensable to the closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Lost languages are signaled early (Kael catalogues them, believes they unlock kindness) and the lunar script is the vehicle for the mural. The concept shapes the dominant stake and is present in the closure ("lost languages...lived in the breath of strangers"). However, the mechanics remain abstract—what makes a language "lost" or "lunar" is not dramatized through friction or cost. The concept functions as theme and tool but does not narrow options or alter tactics on the page. Solid thematic integration, but replaceable with "forgotten art" or "ancient symbols" without breaking the plot.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Methodically hopeful" is asserted in the opening and echoed at the end ("methodically hopeful that each stroke...might rouse a little more kindness"). It describes Kael's approach—cataloguing scripts, perfecting formulas, working until dawn—but does not constrain a choice with visible cost. The trait is label-only; no beat shows him forced to choose method over spontaneity or hope over despair with a dramatized price. Present and consistent, but ornamental to the plot logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Rouse" appears in three contexts: the heart that "rouses with a hopeful rhythm" when Mira leaves herbs, the city's heart "slowly rouse from its smog-laden slumber," and the final hope "to rouse a little more kindness." The action is the story's goal and resolution, present in setup and closure. However, it is passive and observed—Kael watches others rouse, rather than rousing them through a difficult on-page choice. The verb charges the final image and ties the arc together, but is swappable with "awaken" or "stir" without structural loss. Strong thematic linkage, but not causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Daydreams sparked by moonlight are introduced in the fourth paragraph ("daydreams sparked by moonlight would carry him into ancient conversations") and recur in the closure section ("ushering him into moonlit daydreams where lost languages bloomed"). The method is signaled and fits the lyric tone, but it is summary-only—we are told about the daydreams, not shown their mechanics or cost. The method does not shape an on-page attempt or choice; moonlight enables the brush, but the daydream layer is decorative. Present in setup and closure but functionally inert.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The rooftop greenhouse is introduced in the first line, serves as Kael's sanctuary and workspace across multiple beats, and returns in the closure ("The rooftop greenhouse remained his sanctuary...where the waxing moon's glow promised renewal"). It supplies the moon-access required for the brush's glow and isolates Kael from the smog-choked city, constraining when and where he can work. The smog provides thematic contrast (choking metropolis vs. breathing green). The setting is essential to the story's spatial logic and charges the final image. Strong integration across all three gates with clear causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The waxing moon is present in the opening, the middle beat ("the waxing moon reached its fullest crescent"), and the closure ("under the waxing moon's glow"). It provides a rhythm (sleepless nights, lunar phases) and triggers the brightest brush-glow at the crescent, creating a ticking-clock effect. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—Kael could paint on any night, and the choice to paint on the fullest crescent is opportunity rather than deadline. The moon charges the atmosphere and enables the brush but does not force a trade-off with visible cost. Solid atmospheric and mechanical presence, but not narratively indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation—"to prove that strangers remember kindness"—is stated in paragraph nine and drives the mural project. It is present in setup (Kael's belief), development (painting the phrase), and closure (Mira's gesture and the ripple of tokens validate the belief). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through friction; Kael does not face a choice between proving his belief and another want, nor does the cost of the proof (sleepless nights) alter his tactics. The desire is coherent and resolved on the page, but without internal conflict or visible sacrifice that would elevate integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Saffron quiet" appears twice: in the second paragraph ("casting saffron quiet across the leaves") and near the end ("the moonlight faded into a pale saffron quiet as the sun rose"). The phrase is vivid and establishes a lyric, contemplative tone that coheres through the piece. However, the tone does not modulate with pressure—Kael's discovery of Mira's gesture and the ripple of tokens are narrated in the same elevated, unhurried register. The tone is static rather than charged by the final image, functioning as atmospheric consistency rather than dynamic escalation. Strong seed-and-reprise structure, but mid-band for lack of tonal arc.</comment>
