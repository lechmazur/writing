<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The witness exists primarily as a vessel for abstract concepts rather than as a character with contradictory impulses acting in scene. Motivation is declared ("motivation to unravel cosmic illusions burned brighter") but never tested through competing desires or costs that force a difficult choice. The final merger with the dictionary reads as metaphysical event rather than earned character transformation, with no visible psychological price for becoming "what she observed." Interiority consists largely of cosmic abstractions rather than embodied, particular perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural—density of cosmic imagery meant to reweigh meaning—but the closure lacks visible cost; the witness achieves her aim (unification) without forfeiting anything on the page. Orientation is delayed: who/where/when remain vague through ~200 words, and "lost between tick and tock" teaches disorientation as decorative rather than functional. The Orientation Test penalty (−0.4) applies; the effect does not charge closure. The spiral arbitration "concludes" but no before/after options are legible; the witness simply "becomes" without dramatized consequence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The temple library supplies vivid images—dust motes, shafts of light without sun, halls that lengthen into paradox—but these remain atmospheric rather than constraining choice. The dictionary grows heavier and its pages flutter, yet this weight never prevents an action or alters a tactic. Spatial choreography stays coherent (stacks, corridors, nautilus center) and the setting's timeless quality supports tone, but the environment does not shape the witness's decisions at any pivot.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—unify scattered truths before the hiccup ends—is declared early but never tightened through a live trade-off or complication that narrows options. The spiral arbitration "turns through the stacks" and delivers one line of dialogue, yet this does not force a new choice or escalate cost. The witness's journey reaches its "apex" and she presses the dictionary to her chest, but this fulfills her goal without visible sacrifice; no option is foreclosed, no price paid on the page. Coincidence does not resolve, but neither does protagonist agency under pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme of observer-as-participant emerges through the journey-inward/walking-out motif and the dictionary merging with the witness, avoiding overt statement. The final image—"witness who had learned that to see the end was to hold the beginning"—offers conceptual resonance tied to prior material. However, the penultimate paragraph's explicit articulation ("What you seek to unify cannot be held... surrendered to the pattern you already are") functions as thematic summary rather than dramatized discovery, flattening subtext at a key moment.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with elevated diction ("wanderingly exact," "entropy's yawn") that fits the cosmic-temple register. Perceptual signature exists but leans abstract: "definitions bleeding at edges" and "false narratives pressed against her skin like moths" are vivid yet generic to any mystical observer rather than character-particular. The whispered phrase "Journeying inward while walking out" reads as thematic device rather than the witness's own idiom. Psychic distance holds, but the prose feels authored for effect rather than emerging from her specific consciousness under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Figurative density is high and often striking ("entropy's yawn," "lie that felt like truth," "scream wrapped in resounding hush"), yet many metaphors layer without clear progression or causal linkage, dulling momentum. Paraphrase loops appear: "the library dissolved into the void's forgetting" echoes "swallowed the last star"; "resounding hush" recurs four times without functional reweighting. Template cadence: "She [verb], [object]" and "The [noun] [verb], its [noun] [adj]" structures repeat across paragraphs. Sentence openings show variety, but information density sags mid-passage where cosmic imagery accumulates without advancing plot or choice. Combined artifacts justify −1.0 total in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—lone witness at history's end in a time-suspended library—draws from familiar mystical-observer templates (Borges, end-of-time fantasies) without a transformative angle rooted in specific stakes or lived detail. The dictionary merging with the witness and becoming "a codex written in her bloodstream" offers a vivid image, yet the emotional and causal mechanics remain abstract. The spiral arbitration and cosmic illusions function as decorative mysticism rather than particular world-logic with cost. Transformation test: plot and arc could transfer to any mystical threshold without loss, indicating mid-band originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The witness character is present throughout and makes one on-page choice (pressing the dictionary to her chest), but this action feels symbolic rather than a turn that alters tactics or forecloses an option. She observes, walks, and "becomes," yet these are metaphysical states rather than decisions under competing pressures. Swappable: "witness" could be replaced with "wanderer" or "seeker" with minor edits. Baseline functional presence without causal pressure or closure-driving agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The softcover dictionary appears in four beats: initial handling (pages flutter, definitions bleed), growing heavier mid-journey, pressed to chest, and merge at closure. Setup is early, development shows evolving weight, and closure participation is explicit. However, the dictionary's properties do not constrain a choice or enable a tactic; it remains a symbolic object whose transformation mirrors theme rather than altering on-page options. Lyric reprise with thematic reweighting qualifies for mid-5s, but lack of causal pressure and visible cost caps the score below 6.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Spiral arbitration is named twice and described as "turning through the stacks" and judging "which fragments of reality deserved to survive," but it never presents a dilemma or choice that the witness must navigate. The whisper "What you seek to unify cannot be held" delivers thematic commentary, not a rule or constraint that alters her tactics. Present and thematically consistent, but functionally replaceable with "cosmic judgment" or "temporal arbitration" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Wanderingly exact" appears twice: once as label for dust motes' paths, once describing footsteps that "measured the spiral's curve." Both are descriptive rather than constraining; the attribute does not enable a tactic or impose a trade-off. No visible cost tied to being wanderingly exact versus direct or chaotic. Ornamental use without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Unify" is the explicit goal, stated early and referenced throughout ("unify the scattered truths," "all that would be and had been were unified"). The witness's final act—merging the dictionary with her body—dramatizes unification and lands at closure. Two beats involve unify: the declaration of intent and the final transformation. However, the mechanics are metaphysical: no on-page obstacle tests her method or forces a trade-off between unifying versus another path. Closure participation with thematic charge earns mid-5s; lack of causal pressure and swappability with "reconcile" or "integrate" prevents higher.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Journeying inward while walking out" is introduced explicitly at midpoint as "her method," and the text states "each step through the library's corridors was a descent into her own architecture of memory." The phrase recurs at the apex moment. Setup is clear, mechanics are named (walking = internal descent), and closure references the apex. However, the method's execution remains abstract: no on-page obstacle arises from walking versus standing, no tactical cost from choosing this method over another. Present in setup, middle, and closure, earning two gates, but lacks causal friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The ancient temple library is established in the opening line, described across multiple beats (stacks, corridors, nautilus heart), and remains the sole location through closure. The library's time-lost nature and lengthening halls create atmosphere and reflect the witness's internal state. The environment does not block a path or supply a crucial resource that changes her tactics, yet the nautilus structure and "halls lengthening into paradox" charge the final transformation by spatializing her journey. Early setup, persistent presence, closure participation with thematic resonance justify low-6s under lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Across a universe's hiccup" is named twice: opening frame ("that infinitesimal gasp between annihilation and rebirth") and penultimate paragraph. The timeframe establishes stakes (library will dissolve when the hiccup ends) but no ticking clock pressures her choices; she completes her goal "across" the hiccup without urgency or a near-miss. Present in setup and closure but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. Functional framing device without escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Motivation "to unravel cosmic illusions" is declared explicitly twice ("motivation to unravel cosmic illusions burned brighter," "cosmic illusions began to unravel") and frames the dominant stake. The witness pursues this goal throughout, and the ending claims success ("all that would be and had been were unified"). However, the desire is never tested by a competing want or fear; no on-page moment shows her choosing to unravel illusions at the cost of safety, certainty, or another path. Told-only motivation without friction or visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Resounding hush" appears four times, framing the opening atmosphere, the witness's inner fire, the final unraveling moment, and the phrase "hush resounded louder" at climax. Tone is coherent—quiet, vast, contemplative—and modulates slightly when the hush "resounds louder" to mark the peak. However, the tonal consistency risks static mood; no sharp tonal shift dramatizes a turn. The charged reprise at closure (hush as frequency harmonizing contradictions) reweights the opening image, earning mid-5s under lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>
