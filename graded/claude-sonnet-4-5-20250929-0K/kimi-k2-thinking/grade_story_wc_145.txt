<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kael's internal life is present through concrete actions (tracing condensation, consulting the phrasebook) and the piece avoids therapy-speak. However, motivation remains largely declarative—he "tracked beginnings" and "charted beginnings" without embodied contradiction or competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. The final transformation ("He was the map now") reads as assertion rather than earned through prior micro-choices that foreclose a visible path. Agency at closure is poetic but lacks the felt cost of renunciation or endurance that would ground the change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens early (condensation patterns, phrasebook dog-ears, recurring "nishan") and attempts a Conceptual Repricing at closure: Kael becomes the source, the rivers flow with his word. Orientation anchors (outpost, frozen lake, dusk) appear promptly. However, the closure unit relies heavily on metaphor ("passed through him like an idea through silence," "He was the map now") without a concrete on-page cost—no visible forfeiture, injury, or tactical narrowing. The Cost Proof Test fails: I cannot point to a sentence where the price of stepping into the water is legible beyond poetic assertion. This caps the score despite the coherent lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The rusted outpost, frozen lake, and ice provide vivid micro-setting that charges multiple beats: Kael traces condensation on glass (a method), walks onto ice (a spatial constraint), kneels and feels currents beneath. The phrasebook's physical warmth against his chest and the feather's placement on the map integrate setting details into action. The final image—ice cracking, water weeping—uses environment to charge closure. However, the ice itself does not meaningfully constrain Kael's choice to step onto it ("subtly confident that the ice would hold"); the environment enables rather than pressures, which limits the band.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—"to find where the rivers begin"—is signaled early and sustained. One tightening occurs when the falcon returns with a feather instead of a message, prompting Kael to reinterpret his maps. The condensation pattern accelerates his decision to leave. Yet Kael's agency at closure is largely receptive: the falcon passes through him, the ice cracks, he steps into water. No visible trade-off or tactical narrowing under pressure is dramatized; coincidence (falcon's dive, ice cracking) enables rather than forces the resolution. Cost clarity is poetic but not tactile, preventing higher scores.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: water's language, the paradox of finding beginnings at the point of absence, translation as listening. The recurring phrasebook dog-ear and "nishan" (unsprung) avoid overt statement. However, the piece edges into thematic echo with lines like "To find where the rivers begin is to become the source" and "maps must be rewritten by those who know endings are beginnings reversed"—these articulate the thesis rather than letting the final image hold it tacitly. The closing images (seven rivers, the word "Nishan") carry resonance but are slightly diluted by preceding explanation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout. Kael's perceptual signature (cartographer's eye, polyglot's ear) filters details consistently: he reads condensation as script, knows "the Thaw-tongue word" by heart. Diction is controlled and poetic without major register drift. The piece uses purposeful compression ("To find where the rivers began, he'd followed their silence upstream") and patterned syntax ("A spiral, then a line, then a dot"). However, the final third employs repeated sentence stems ("To find where the rivers begin…") across multiple lines, creating template cadence that flattens rhythm under peak pressure, preventing 9+ eligibility.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("dark comma against the white page of sky," "frost on iron," "phrasebook dog-ear fluttered in the draft") and mostly coherent. However, several beats loop conceptually: "He tracked beginnings" immediately follows "mapping what others called the end of the world. But Kael charted beginnings." The phrase "To find where the rivers begin" recurs five times with minor variation, creating paraphrase loops in the final third. The closure beat—"The bird passed through him like an idea through silence"—is evocative but mixed: can an idea pass *through* silence, or does silence absorb it? Accumulation of these artifacts across the final third triggers the patterned-artifact cap and disallows 9+ globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of cartography, polyglot phrasebooks, falcon symbolism, and water-as-language offers specific texture. The premise—finding river sources by understanding their "absence"—is conceptually fresh. However, the emotional arc (solitary expert completes mystical transformation) and structure (isolated figure receives omen, interprets signs, undergoes metaphysical merge) follow familiar mystical-journey templates. The piece does not transform the archetype through lived friction or non-obvious moral calculus; Kael's confidence and knowledge insulate him from genuine struggle. Risk-taking in voice and imagery is present but does not overcome the derivative frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Kael is described as having "dry wit" ("'Subtle,' Kael muttered") but this single line does not drive a turn or create pressure. His role as cartographer matters structurally, but the "dry-witted" trait itself is ornamental—swappable with "laconic" or "sardonic" without altering his choices. He makes key decisions (leaving the outpost, stepping onto ice) but those are motivated by his quest and the falcon's return, not by his wit. Present but not integrated causally.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The phrasebook dog-ear appears in four distinct beats: introduced as worn from use, consulted for "nishan," warmed against Kael's chest as he walks, and finally flutters free onto the widening fissure to "herald the river's voice." It shapes his understanding (he knows the words "by heart" from prior study) and charges the closure image. Early signal, beat involvement across the arc, and closure linkage are strong. However, the cost connection is oblique—its departure signals transformation but does not narrow a tactical choice under pressure, capping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Singular convergence" frames Kael's goal from early on: he traces seven rivers on maps, seeks "where all seven blue lines would meet," and the condensation pattern shows him the convergence point. His finger finds "the spot" and he walks to "the center of the frozen lake, where the feather's shadow pointed." At closure, "The singular convergence pulsed beneath his hand" and seven rivers flow out. The concept shapes his spatial goal and the final image, but does not force a choice between competing options or impose a visible cost—it is the answer he sought, not a dilemma. Strong setup and payoff, but middling causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Subtly confident" is attributed to Kael twice: he recognizes it in the polyglot who taught him, and later "his steps confident in a way that suggested knowledge, not pride." At the ending, "He was subtly confident that the ice would hold." The trait enables his final action but does not constrain it or generate visible cost—his confidence proves correct, so no tradeoff materializes. Label-only in the first instance; enacted in the walk onto ice but without friction. Present in setup and closure, but the attribute does not alter tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Herald" appears structurally: the polyglot tells Kael the falcon "will herald convergence," the falcon's cry is "distant and approving," crews will find Kael gone and "the phrasebook dog-ear...heralded the river's voice," and the closing line references "those who know endings are beginnings reversed" after "the falcon returns." The action organizes expectations and marks the threshold for Kael's departure and transformation. It drives two major beats (return with feather, final dive through Kael) and frames closure. However, "herald" as action is largely symbolic—other sign-bearing actions could replace it with minor edits. Strong integration but not fully indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Condensation patterns are introduced early: Kael traces them on the windowpane, they show him "a spiral, then a line, then a dot" that night, and the method is called "old, older than the outpost." At closure, "Condensation patterns on Kael's palm matched the one he'd traced on glass." The method signals his interpretive skill, provides the immediate trigger for his decision to walk onto the ice, and recurs at the ending to link body and environment. Setup, middle, and payoff are present. However, the mechanics remain vague—how exactly does condensation guide him?—and the method does not constrain his choices (he already knew where to go from maps). Solid integration but middling specificity and causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The rusted outpost and frozen lake anchor every beat: Kael traces condensation on its window, releases the falcon from its door, leaves a note on its wall, and walks onto the lake's ice. The setting provides the spatial stage for all action and charges the final image: "Under the ice, seven currents stirred." The outpost is described as "the last cartographer's source" and "marked" the endpoint of prior data. At closure, it "creaked behind him, a comma in its own sentence of abandonment." Early signal, beat involvement, and closure participation are strong. However, the setting does not pressure Kael's choice—the ice holds as expected—so it enables rather than constrains, capping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"After the falcon returns" structures the entire narrative: the opening establishes Kael "waited for the falcon," it "returned at dusk," and the closing line repeats "After the falcon returns, maps must be rewritten." The timeframe organizes causality and is signaled in setup and closure. However, within the continuous present action there is no live clock or tightening deadline—Kael has "three seasons" already behind him, and he departs "Morning would bring the melt crews" at his own pace. The temporal frame is more thematic marker than tactical pressure. Present in two gates (setup, closure reprise) but does not constrain choices, placing it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"To find where the rivers begin" is Kael's explicit goal, repeated as refrain. He has "followed their silence upstream," his maps show seven rivers, and he walks to their convergence. The motivation drives his spatial movement and interpretive acts (consulting phrasebook, reading condensation). At closure, he becomes the source: "To find where the rivers begin is to become the source." The desire is dramatized through sustained action across all beats. However, the motivation is never conflicted—no competing want or fear creates friction, no cost is paid to pursue it. He succeeds without sacrifice. Strong setup and development, but lacks the friction between wants and costs that would push the score higher.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Worrying tranquility" is named once: "the lake breathed slowly, its surface a mirror of the worrying tranquility." The tone is implied earlier through images of stillness and cold (groaning outpost, frozen lake, "quiet certainty of water finding its level") and paradoxical motion under stasis ("seven currents stirred. They had never stopped. Only waited"). At closure, the ice "began to weep" and crack, breaking the tranquil surface with consequence. The tone modulates from frozen waiting to active transformation. However, the label "worrying tranquility" arrives late (final third) and is told rather than sustained through rhythm and diction across the arc. Present in closure but not consistently embodied in voice, limiting the score.</comment>
