<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The dealer's motivation is stated repeatedly ("to fuse insight with empathy") but remains abstract—never tested by a concrete choice that costs something. The client undergoes transformation, but the dealer's arc is purely observational; the "faint affection" and "borrowed frequency" are asserted rather than dramatized through embodied contradiction. Interior voice leans heavily on poetic labels ("counterfeit heartbeats," "synthetic sympathy") without grounding them in specific sensory contradiction or micro-choices under pressure. The piece offers reflective interiority but lacks the simultaneous contradictory impulses acting in scene that would lift characterization into the high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (grotto, dealer, client transformation). The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: amber imagery, static electricity, and borrowed emotion recur with mounting density. However, closure operates as Resonant Reconfiguration without clear cost—the dealer's final reflection on "hidden heart" and "one day" signals longing but no visible foreclosed path or decisive change in tactics. The "borrowed truth" and "static hum" charge the final image, but the before/after stakes for the dealer remain conceptual rather than felt; the client exits, leaving the dealer in the same detached observational stance. Under the accumulative lens one meaningful deepening is present, but cost legibility at closure is weak.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The amber grotto is vividly rendered through honeyed light, resinous scent, stone texture, and the water-drip clock. Dusk timing and the pulsing walls create atmospheric pressure. The blotter petal and static electricity function as micro-setting elements that constrain the dealer's method and charge the final tactile moment. Spatial choreography (stone bench, exit, grove beyond) tracks cleanly. The setting charges the closure image (amber fading, night claiming warmth) and the static on skin acts as a recurring sensory anchor, meeting the 9+ gate of environment constraining choice and charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—testing and delivering synthetic empathy—is signaled early and remains coherent. The client's transformation provides one pressure point: inhaling the petal, emotional shift, departure. Yet the dealer faces no escalating choice or visible tradeoff; the "professionally thorough" process unfolds without friction. The dealer's internal stake ("to fuse insight with empathy") is declared but never tested by an on-page decision that narrows options or imposes cost. The accumulative lens allows for deepening via imagery recurrence, but the lack of a tightening choice or foreclosed path for the protagonist caps escalation credit. The client's arc is complete; the dealer's remains observational.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—the gap between counterfeit and genuine feeling, the dealer's longing to inhabit emotion—emerges through recurring images (static, amber, borrowed warmth) rather than statement. The "half truths" motif threads through but risks becoming a verbal tic rather than a pressure lever. The final image ("static quieted, settling into patient wait") offers a non-literal answer to the dealer's longing, though the answer is essentially "not yet," which defers rather than reweights. The piece resists moralizing and invites reflection, but the thematic question lacks a decisive confrontation or repricing at closure; the dealer's stance at the end mirrors the opening detachment. Subtext operates in gesture and silence, earning mid-band credit.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Single close-third POV maintains stable distance and a lyric, meditative register throughout. Diction is elevated and poetic ("moth's wing," "fragile bridge," "borrowed frequency"), consistent with the dealer's artisan self-concept. The voice is distinctive but leans on repeated sentence stems ("I…", "The…") and recycled constructions ("half truth," "professionally thorough"). Dialogue is minimal and functional. Under peak emotional moments the register remains uniform rather than degrading or sharpening, flattening the sense of pressure. Perceptual signature is present (static as sensory method, affectionate detachment), but lacks the rhythmic modulation that would elevate voice control into the high band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose is lyric and imagistic with clean grammar and varied paragraph structure. However, the piece suffers from paraphrase loops and template cadence: "half truth/truths" appears thirteen times, "static electricity" seven times, "fuse insight with empathy" four times, often in adjacent or parallel constructions without added pressure. Sentences frequently open with "I" or "The," creating rhythmic monotony. Figurative language is dense ("honeyed light," "moth's wing," "borrowed heartbeats") but occasionally stacks without causal work, blurring momentum. The final third recycles "static," "borrowed," and "half truth" without reweighting them, resulting in conceptual redundancy. These artifacts touch the closure beat, preventing high-band entry and disallowing 9+ globally per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The counterfeit-emotion dealer premise offers a fresh angle on empathy-for-hire, and the sensory method (static electricity) provides specificity. The amber grotto and blotter petal are vivid, particular details. However, the core arc—detached observer remains detached—echoes familiar "artisan yearns but cannot partake" templates without a decisive transformation. The dealer's final reflection ("perhaps one day") defers rather than reconfigures, and the journey from opening to close lacks a non-obvious synthesis. The half-truths motif and professionally-thorough detachment are present but not transformed through lived cost. Emotional specificity is strongest in the client's transformation, weakest in the dealer's interior. Risk-taking in lyric structure is present but does not heighten stakes sufficiently to elevate originality into the high band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The dealer is present throughout and prepares the dose, delivers it, and observes the client's transformation. Yet all major turns trace to the client's inhaling and emotional shift; the dealer makes no on-page decision that alters tactics or forecloses a path. The final reflection signals longing but remains observational. The character shapes the frame but does not drive causal pressure at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The blotter petal is introduced early (paragraph 8), handled in the preparation beat (dipped into vial, spark confirms readiness), handed to the client (who inhales), and returns in the penultimate beat when the dealer touches it again and finds "only the memory of a borrowed truth." It appears in three distinct beats, enables the central action, and is repurposed with reweighted meaning at closure. The petal is irreplaceable within the story's logic (fragrance-chemist specificity, moth's-wing fragility, static charge). However, its final handling does not constrain a new choice or impose visible cost on the dealer, capping the score below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Half-truths are named thirteen times and function as both thematic motif and world detail (the client's payment, the blotter's absorbed content, the dealer's warnings, the nature of synthetic empathy). They shape the stakes conceptually and prime the reader's understanding of the counterfeit trade. However, they do not constrain an on-page choice or alter tactics in a pivotal beat; their presence is more atmospheric and thematic than causal. The concept appears early, recurs through the middle, and is present in the closure reflection, meeting the gate model's setup and payoff but lacking decisive middle development that forces a tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Professionally thorough" is declared in paragraph 6 and illustrated by the dealer testing the blend and adjusting dosage drop-by-drop. The trait enables the preparation action but does not constrain or complicate a later choice; the thoroughness proceeds without friction or visible cost. It appears early and shapes one beat, but remains label-adjacent rather than driving a tradeoff that would elevate integration above mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Subsume" appears three times: the dealer watches empathy "subsuming" the client's apathy, the dealer describes being "the one who subsumes others' voids," and the opening mentions the transformation completes. The action is thematic and descriptive but does not turn the plot; the client's transformation could be described with "absorbs," "replaces," or "fills" with minimal structural change. The word appears in setup and thematic reflection but is not causally indispensable to a key beat or the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Static electricity is signaled early (paragraph 10) as the dealer's sensory method, used to test potency and guide dosage adjustment. It recurs when a spark confirms readiness (paragraph 18), and returns in the final beats as the dealer feels "the static of those lives" and the "static electricity within me quieted." The method appears in three beats, shapes the preparation tactic, and charges the closure image as a metaphor for connection. However, the method does not constrain a difficult choice or impose a visible cost on the dealer, capping the score below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The amber grotto at dusk is established in the opening line and sustained through honeyed light, stone bench, resinous scent, pulsing walls, and the water-drip clock. Dusk deepens across the story, creating temporal pressure, and the final image of amber light fading anchors the closure. The setting provides atmosphere, a tactile environment for the ritual, and a lyric charge to the ending. However, the grotto does not constrain the dealer's choices or supply resources that alter outcome; the transaction could occur in another intimate, atmospheric location with modest edits. The setting shapes tone and supports closure participation, earning solid integration credit but falling short of indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "as the transformation completes" is declared in the opening and tracked through dusk deepening, the client's arrival, the ritual's duration ("minutes passed, measured by distant drip"), and night claiming the grotto. Time provides a gentle arc and atmospheric pressure, but it does not tighten a decision or force a tradeoff; the pacing is contemplative rather than urgent. The timeframe is present early and at closure, meeting setup and payoff, but lacks middle development where a live clock alters tactics or narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The motivation "to fuse insight with empathy" is declared four times across the story, anchoring the dealer's professional stance and hinting at personal longing. It primes the dealer's observational method and is present in the final reflection ("perhaps one day I would find a truth"). However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting choices; the dealer never faces an on-page friction between the desire to connect and the cost of doing so. The motivation shapes the thematic frame and appears at setup and closure, but lacks middle development where it forces a tradeoff, capping integration in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Affectionate detachment is sustained throughout in the dealer's "professionally detached, yet a faint affection" stance, the "gesture both warm and distant," and the repeated "silent observer" framing. The tone is coherent across beats and modulates subtly when the dealer notes the client's "fragile sincerity" and feels the "faint hum" of borrowed emotion. The final image ("static quieted, settling into patient wait") charges the tone with longing and restraint. However, the tone remains relatively static; emotional pressure does not degrade or sharpen the detachment in a way that reveals new cost. The tone is integral to voice and thematic resonance, earning solid integration, but does not undergo a decisive shift that would lift it into the high band.</comment>
