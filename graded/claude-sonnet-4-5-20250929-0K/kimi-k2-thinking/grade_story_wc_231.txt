<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Cornelius's gift is established early and his investigation follows clear choices, but his interior life remains abstract—he "felt the pressure" and "sensed a quiet desperation" without embodied contradiction or visceral stakes that test him personally. The borrowed memory mechanic is more premise than pressure cooker; no genuine blind spot or flaw complicates his reading, and the stranger's question "Who will remember me?" is answered too cleanly without visible cost to Cornelius's own stance. The final smile and placement of the sketch feel like closure by satisfied understanding rather than renunciation or transformation with felt sacrifice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when early (nautical twilight, opal dock, Cornelius) and accumulates lyric detail toward a Resonant Reconfiguration—Cornelius becomes "keeper and witness" with the stranger's memory settling into his own. Cost is implied (his ongoing isolation now charged by the memory) but the final paragraphs loop through multiple closural gestures (the sketch arrives, he smiles, the memory settles, the story "lives on") rather than landing one decisive image, diluting the closure's felt weight. The causal link between the boutonniere's fragmented memory and the letter's arrival the next morning is coincidence that complicates without resolving, acceptable under Situational allowances, but the proliferation of summary retrospectives in the final third ("From that day forward... would often pace... lived on") flattens present-tense pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The opal dock, mist, and lighthouse are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (amber glow, trembling shadows, the low hum of gears). Nautical twilight and the persistent mist constrain Cornelius's investigation spatially and temporally, charging the final beam-sweep image. The edelweiss boutonniere functions as micro-setting—its "fragile veins" and glass-jar preservation anchor the memory physically. The boat's barnacled hull and the letter add concrete detail, though the alpine air flashback risks postcard brevity without local grounding.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decoding the stranger's final gesture—is signaled early and tightens once when Cornelius shifts from interpreting the wave to understanding it as a gift and question. However, the escalation is primarily cognitive (he "realized," "understood") rather than a choice that forecloses options; no live option is sacrificed, and the arrival of the confirmatory letter the next morning feels like external validation rather than a hard-won turn driven by Cornelius's agency. The cost—his isolation now "witnessed" and charged—is legible but oblique, more reconfiguration of meaning than visible price paid on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—memory, witness, and the need to be seen—emerges organically from the boutonniere, Cornelius's gift, and the recurring beam-sweep image. The line "Memory is the true keeper of light" arrives as a sketch caption rather than character epiphany, keeping it non-intrusive. The final image of the lighthouse beam as "silent promise" reweights prior material, and the edelweiss's return in Cornelius's pocket ("softly persistent") charges the ending without overt moralizing. However, the proliferation of thematic summary in the final paragraphs ("quiet testament," "power of being seen," "forever illuminating") edges toward assertion rather than leaving the resonance implicit in image alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, and the perceptual signature (lantern swinging, focus on gaps, whispered name) is consistent. The phrase "softly persistent" recurs purposefully as a textural anchor. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register ("vestige of light dissolved," "borrowed memory settle gently") that feels more authorial than lighthouse-keeper particular, and the final paragraphs' retrospective summary ("From that day forward... would often pace") shifts out of present-scene focalization into distant narration without dramatized cost, flattening immediacy at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The prose is rhythmically varied and sensory, with strong images (opal dock, trembling shadows, great lens spinning). However, paraphrase loops appear across adjacent lines: "softly persistent" recurs six times with diminishing effect; "borrowed memory" is repeated in similar constructions across the final third; and multiple sentences open with "The" or "Cornelius" in template cadence (lines 18–22). The final six paragraphs loop through closure gestures—each one restating that the memory is now part of the lighthouse—without propulsion, and stock phrases like "quiet testament," "silent promise," and "deepest fog of isolation" blur specificity. Apply −0.8 for paraphrase/template runs and −0.3 for elevated stock phrases touching the closure zone.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The borrowed-memory mechanic and the edelweiss boutonniere as memory vessel offer a fresh synthesis, and the method of "observing gaps" between memory frames is a specific, non-obvious investigative choice. The lyric tone and the lighthouse-as-witness frame are executed with care. However, the emotional arc—lonely keeper finds connection through a stranger's memory—follows a familiar template (witness/redemption through empathy), and the confirmatory letter that arrives the next morning to validate Cornelius's interpretation feels like a safety device rather than a bold, open-ended close. The story transforms the premise with lived detail but does not take the risk of leaving Cornelius's interpretation unconfirmed.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cornelius appears in the opening, drives the investigation by kneeling to brush the petals, closing his eyes to sift memories, focusing on gaps, and whispering a name—three distinct beats. His choice to place the boutonniere in a jar and return to the lantern room alters his stance from observer to witness. Present in the closure (pacing the dock with the boutonniere in his pocket). Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure (his method shapes the realization) +0.8, closure linkage +1.0, specificity (the gift of reading objects) +0.5 = baseline ~7.3. Swappability concern (another investigator could fill the role) −0.3, and the final smile/settlement feels more summarized than dramatized −0.2 = 6.8.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The boutonniere appears in paragraph 4 (stranger's memory washed ashore), is handled in paragraph 5 (fingers brushing petals), returns in paragraph 12 (hand clutching it), is held to light in paragraph 19, placed in a jar in paragraph 21, sketched in the letter (paragraph 29), and carried in Cornelius's pocket in the final paragraph—six beats across setup, middle investigation, and closure. Early signal +0.7, beat involvement (six touches) +1.4, causal pressure (its fragmented memory drives the investigation) +1.0, closure linkage (pocket carry, sketch) +1.2, specificity (alpine edelweiss, dried, veins visible) +0.6 = baseline ~7.9. Ornamental touches in final summary (described rather than used) −0.3, and the sketch's arrival as external validation rather than protagonist discovery −0.2 = 7.4.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Borrowed memories are introduced in paragraph 6 ("objects held echoes of their owners' final moments") and shape Cornelius's gift explicitly. The mechanic enables the investigation (paragraphs 10–17 dramatize the sifting) and is named again in paragraphs 14, 26, 30, 31—five beats. The concept constrains his method (he must read gaps) and the closure hinges on the memory "settling" into his own. Early signal +0.7, beat involvement +1.2, causal pressure (the gift is the investigative engine) +1.1, closure linkage (the memory becomes part of him) +1.0 = baseline ~7.0. However, the mechanics remain abstract (how does touching an object transfer memory? why is this one fragmented?) and the borrowed-memory label appears more as theme echo than tactical constraint in the final third −0.5; the letter's independent arrival bypasses the borrowed-memory mechanic −0.3 = 6.2.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Softly persistent" appears as descriptor of the mist (paragraphs 1, 10, 23), the borrowed memory's echo (paragraph 14), Cornelius's heart (paragraph 27), and the boutonniere in his pocket (paragraph 32)—six mentions. The attribute is tied to atmosphere and emotional tone but does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost; it functions as lyric refrain rather than tactical limiter. Presence across beats +0.9, closure linkage (final paragraph) +0.7, thematic resonance +0.4 = baseline ~5.0. Label-only use without embodied tradeoff −0.3, swappability (another atmospheric adjective could serve) −0.4, no specific moment where "softly persistent" enables or blocks a choice +0.0. Late lyric reprise partially elevates = 5.1.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Investigate" is named in paragraph 8 ("He needed to investigate the stranger's final gesture") and drives the middle sequence: observing gaps (paragraph 9), closing eyes to sift (paragraph 10), focusing on the moment fingers loosened (paragraph 15), studying the petals (paragraph 19). The investigation yields the realization in paragraph 17 and the answer in paragraph 20, shaping the turn from question to gift. Early signal +0.6, beat involvement (four investigative moves) +1.2, causal pressure (the method produces the insight) +1.0, closure linkage (the answer feeds the final witness role) +1.0 = baseline ~6.8. Swappability concern (another verb like "decipher" or "interpret" could substitute with minor edits) −0.4, and the confirmatory letter bypasses further investigation +0.5 for mid-story essentiality = 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The method "observing gaps" is introduced in paragraph 9 ("The method he trusted most was observing gaps, the spaces between memory frames") and applied in paragraphs 10, 15, and 16 (he focuses on the moment fingers loosened, the coat hem, the silence after the horn). The gaps yield the insight in paragraph 16 ("In those gaps, he sensed a quiet desperation"). Early signal +0.6, beat involvement (three applications) +0.9, causal pressure (the method is the investigative tool) +0.9, specificity (gaps as opposed to content) +0.5 = baseline ~6.9. However, the method is told more than shown—paragraphs 10–16 summarize the sifting rather than dramatize discrete gap-observations that each narrow options −0.3, and the letter's sketch bypasses the method entirely −0.2 = 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The opal dock appears in the title and paragraphs 1, 18, 23, 33, providing spatial anchor throughout. Cornelius paces the weathered planks (paragraph 3), kneels on it (paragraph 5), returns to it (paragraph 22), and paces it again at twilight (paragraph 32). The mist and dock constrain the investigation spatially (visibility limited, atmosphere charged) and the final image of the dock "wrapped in mist, held its breath" charges closure. Early signal +0.7, beat involvement (five touches) +1.2, causal pressure (the setting's isolation and mist shape the mood and method) +0.8, closure linkage +1.0 = baseline ~7.7. Postcard/ornamental description in paragraph 1 and looped summary references in final third reduce tactical weight −0.6, swappability (another dock/shore could serve with minor edits) −0.4 = 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Nautical twilight is named in paragraphs 1, 26, and 32, anchoring the opening and final pacing. It signals low light (the lantern is needed, the beam cuts the water) and isolation (Cornelius is "the only soul who braved this hour"). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—no clock pressure forces faster investigation, and the night's passage is summarized ("when the night finally swallowed the opal dock") rather than tracked. Early signal +0.7, beat involvement (three mentions) +0.9, atmospheric constraint (low visibility) +0.5 = baseline ~6.1. No tactical pressure (time does not narrow options or impose cost) −0.5, summary treatment in final third −0.3 = 5.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation "to decode a stranger's final gesture" is stated in paragraph 8 and drives the investigation across paragraphs 9–20. Cornelius's need to interpret the wave (farewell, warning, plea?) shapes his method and the realization. The motivation converges with the stranger's implicit question "Who will remember me?" (paragraph 17) and is answered in paragraph 26 ("the stranger's final gesture was not a question but a gift"). Early signal +0.6, beat involvement (investigation sequence) +1.2, causal pressure (the desire drives the plot) +1.0, closure linkage (the answer redefines his role) +1.0 = baseline ~6.8. However, no internal friction or competing desire complicates the motivation—Cornelius pursues it cleanly without cost or doubt −0.5 = 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Witnessed isolation" coheres throughout: Cornelius is alone (paragraph 2), his isolation is named explicitly (paragraphs 26, 31), and the lighthouse beam functions as the witnessing eye (paragraphs 22, 28). Tone modulates from ghostly/melancholy (opening mist, jagged silhouette) through investigative focus (paragraphs 10–16) to quiet companionship (final paragraphs). The final image—beam as "silent promise that someone, somewhere, was seen"—charges the tone with meaning. Early coherence +0.8, modulation under pressure +0.6, closure charge (the tone reweights the premise) +1.4, specificity (witness + isolation as paired concepts) +0.6 = baseline ~7.4. Stock phrasing in final summary ("deepest fog of isolation") −0.2 = 7.2.</comment>
