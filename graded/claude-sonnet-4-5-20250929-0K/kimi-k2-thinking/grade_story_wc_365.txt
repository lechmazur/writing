<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lira's sensory mapper identity is asserted through labels ("attuned to the subtle textures of worlds unseen") but rarely embodied in micro-choices under pressure. Her final act of weaving feels externally choreographed rather than driven by internal contradiction; the revelation about her predecessor's failure arrives as exposition that does not alter her present stance. Motivation remains abstract—"the weight of the withheld truth" is referenced seven times but never dramatized as a live impediment forcing trade-offs. The closing acceptance ("a compass") lands as a declarative thesis rather than an earned renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who Lira is and where she stands remains vague past the 120-word mark, triggering the Orientation Test penalty (−0.4). The closure unit—Lira's acceptance of the guardian role—occurs on the page, but the causal chain is thin: the shard's "cyclically spontaneous" pulse guides her hands without obstacle, and the rift disperses across parallel universes via a process that feels externally narrated rather than protagonist-driven. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural, yet the final image ("a compass") is stated rather than charged by prior particulars, and no visible cost forecloses a path. The piece violates the Cost proof test: no exact sentence shows what Lira sacrifices or loses.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The spaceport repair bay supplies atmospheric detail ("rusted hull plates," "cracked concrete") and returns at closure ("quiet sanctuary"), but it does not constrain a single choice. The shard's location in a "shadowed corner" and the rift beneath concrete are stage dressing; Lira's weaving would function identically in any abandoned setting. Sensory selection is present ("metallic memory," "low murmur") but filtered through generic poetic phrasing rather than POV-specific bias. The body and tools are abstract: "invisible threads" and "weaving" lack tactile specificity, and no environmental feature alters tactics or charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The dominant stake—prevent the rift from swallowing the repair bay—is signaled early but escalates without protagonist agency: the shard "demanded a specific action," and Lira's weaving succeeds on the first attempt with no setback or choice between competing goods. The revelation about her predecessor's failure arrives as a told epiphany mid-action and does not change her tactics. The resolution dispels the rift without visible trade-off; the shard vanishes, but Lira's readiness to "map the next cycle" suggests no path has been foreclosed. No on-page tightening narrows options or forces a cost legible in the ending beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The theme of inherited burden and cyclical guardianship is stated overtly in the final third: "she was the next guardian of the rift," "the weight of a withheld truth was not a burden to be shed, but a compass." These declarations replace scene pressure rather than emerging from it. The green glass shard recurs but without shifting meaning—it remains a mystical fragment from first mention to final pulse. The murmur of half-remembered dreams is invoked in opening and closing as a thematic bookend but does not constrain a choice or reweight prior material. Thematic Echo penalty applies (−0.6): the final paragraph articulates the thesis in prompt-like language.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>POV remains stable in third-person limited with sensory-focused texture ("tasting the metallic memory," "invisible threads stretched across the bay"). However, perceptual signature is generic; Lira's way of noticing could belong to any mystical protagonist. The narrative distance slips into omniscient framing: "his spirit, fragmented and lost, had become the green glass shard" is presented as absolute fact rather than Lira's inference. Filter verbs cluster in the final third ("She realized," "She understood," "She felt"), flattening immediacy during the climax. No dialogue is present to evaluate, and the prose voice reads as neutral-literary rather than character-particular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Template cadence runs through the final third: five consecutive sentences open with "She [verb]" or "The [noun]," creating rhythmic monotony (−0.5). Paraphrase loops appear: "the weight of the withheld truth" is restated across three adjacent paragraphs without added pressure (−0.2). Stock metaphors ("echo of his final act," "living force that bound her to the cycle") and elevated diction ("tangible presence," "ambient hum of distant stars") drift from the POV's established sensory lexicon. Information density is low; many sentences narrate Lira's understanding rather than advancing situation or image. The final beat summarizes closure ("ready to map the next cycle") instead of anchoring it in a concrete action or image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The premise—a sensory mapper sealing rifts with inherited mystical knowledge—leans on fantasy-quest templates without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus (Derivative Premise Guardrail, −0.8). The green glass shard as fragmented predecessor is a familiar trope executed without fresh synthesis. The cyclically spontaneous pulse and parallel-universe redirection are asserted rather than grounded in specific world logic or constraint. Emotional specificity is absent; Lira's acceptance of guardianship feels like a genre obligation rather than a character-particular choice. The piece does not take bold structural or perspectival risks, and the final image ("stepped out of the dream") reads as symbolic convenience rather than an earned particular.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lira is present throughout and her title (sensory map maker) frames her perception, satisfying Setup. Her choice to weave and redirect the rift constitutes Development and Payoff, meeting all three gates. However, her decisions feel externally prompted: the shard "demanded a specific action," and she follows its pulse without internal conflict or tactical revision. The revelation about her predecessor does not alter her weaving method. Her final stance (guardian readiness) is declared rather than enacted through a choice with cost. Swappability is moderate; a generic mystic could perform the same beats with minor edits. Base ~5.0 for three gates, −0.8 for summary-only key involvement and low causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The green glass shard appears in four distinct beats: discovery, touch/ripple, mid-weave epiphany (predecessor's spirit), and vanishing at closure, meeting all three gates with strong beat involvement (+0.9). It enables the weaving (Causal pressure, +0.6) and its disappearance charges the final image (Closure linkage, +0.8). Early signal (+0.4). However, its cyclically spontaneous rhythm and mystical properties remain abstract; specificity is low (−0.4). The shard resolves the rift without having complicated it earlier, reducing irreplaceability (−0.5). Base ~5.0 for three gates and multiple beats, net adjustments +1.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Weaving between worlds is present in Setup (Lira's profession), Development (she weaves "invisible threads" through "unseen dimensions"), and Payoff (disperses the rift across parallel universes), satisfying all three gates. However, the concept remains label-only; the mechanics are never shown, and no cost or constraint differentiates this weaving from generic magic. It does not narrow options or create friction. Swappability is high: "sealing" or "channeling" could replace it with trivial edits (cap 3.8). Base ~5.0 for three gates, −1.2 for ornamental use and lack of causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Cyclically spontaneous appears three times as a descriptor of the shard's pulse but never constrains or enables an on-page action with cost. Setup is present (the trait is named early), but Development and Payoff are absent: the rhythm guides Lira's hands without resistance or trade-off, and its cyclical nature does not affect tactics or closure. The phrase reads as a label rather than a functional attribute. Missing two gates (cap 2.8 per the lower of missing-middle and missing-closure caps). Ornamental use (−0.4).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Redirect is present in Setup (implied by the stakes: "redirect the rift's energy"), Development (Lira decides to "redirect the surging energy... through parallel universes into the shard's glowing heart"), and Payoff (the rift disperses). All three gates met. The action drives the climax (Causal pressure, +0.8) and shapes closure (Closure linkage, +0.7). However, it succeeds without setback or alternative, reducing irreplaceability; "disperse" or "channel" could replace it with minor edits (−0.5). Base ~5.0 for three gates, net adjustments +1.0, cap at 5.3 due to swappability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Through parallel universes is signaled in Development ("channel the rift through those other worlds") and appears at Payoff ("cascade of parallel universes unfolded... guided the rift's chaotic stream through each corridor"), satisfying two gates. The method enables the dispersal (Causal pressure, +0.6) and appears in the closure beat (Closure linkage, +0.7). However, Setup is absent: the existence of parallel universes is not established until the action begins (late first appearance, −0.3). The mechanics remain abstract; no cost or constraint differentiates this method from a generic portal (low specificity, −0.5). Base ~5.0 for two gates, net adjustments +0.5, lowered by late signal to 4.7.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The abandoned spaceport repair bay is named in the opening line (Setup) and returns at closure ("quiet sanctuary"), but Development is missing: no spatial feature constrains a choice or supplies a resource that alters outcome. The bay is postcard description; the weaving would function identically in any abandoned building. Missing middle gate (cap 3.4). The lyric reprise (opening → closing) reweights tone but not the dominant stake (+0.2 for resonance allowance). Net 3.6.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>In the murmur of half-remembered dreams appears in the opening and closing lines (Setup and lyric Payoff) but does not constrain timing or pressure in Development. Time remains vague throughout; no clock or urgency shapes tactics. The murmur is a thematic frame, not a functional timeframe. Missing middle gate (cap 3.4), ornamental use (−0.5), and summary-only involvement at closure (−0.3). Lyric reprise acknowledged (+0.2), but insufficient to overcome ornamental debt. Net 2.1, capped by missing Development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>To discover the weight of a withheld truth is present in Setup ("the weight of the withheld truth press against her chest"), Development (the epiphany about her predecessor's failure), and Payoff ("the weight of the withheld truth now a tangible presence"). All three gates met. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized in choices; Lira's weaving does not hinge on uncovering this truth—she would act the same without it. No visible friction between want and cost (−0.6). Base ~5.0 for three gates, −1.1 for label-only involvement and lack of choice-shaping pressure.</comment>
