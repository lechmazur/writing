<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The librarian's motivation is clear but remains abstract—longing to capture the dream—without internal contradiction or genuine struggle. Her actions align with goals, but the sequence reads like a series of poetic gestures rather than choices under pressure that foreclose paths. Embodied emotion is sparse; most interiority is label-driven ("her motivation sharpened") or allegorical. The final acceptance feels thematic rather than earned through on-page cost that changes her.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (librarian, floating library, dawn) arrive early. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density and cadence shifts reweight the dominant stake (capture vs. release). Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—the empty well becomes "trophy of luminous loss"—with conceptual cost legible in the final image. However, the cost is asserted more than dramatized; the cipher's lesson ("what is captured must also be released") arrives as revelation rather than through prior causal pressure, weakening the hinge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The whispering archipelago and watercolor palette constrain the librarian's attempts: islands arrange themselves, palette wells fill with hours of light, and the painted bridge dissolves in real time. These details are filtered through allegorical perception and shape tactics. Spatial choreography (volcanic rock, water's edge, channel) remains clear. The empty well charges the final image, qualifying for the 9+ gate test, but some setting elements (mist, palms) remain postcard-pretty without pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capture the runaway dream before it dissolves—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs: the painted bridge dissolves, forcing a tactical shift to "painting with light shape of safekeeping." The dream's leap into the palette's well provides closure participation. However, escalation reads as thematic assertion ("she understood then") rather than a choice that narrows live options or imposes visible cost. Under the Accumulative lens, the single deepening is sufficient but costs remain conceptual.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Theme (longing, capture vs. release) emerges from the cipher and the palette's empty well, which recurs with reweighted meaning at closure. The final image—luminous absence as gift—offers a non-literal answer to the central question. However, the piece repeatedly states its thesis ("some things could only be captured by letting them go," "longing itself was true subject") rather than dramatizing it through concrete cost, lowering resonance. The watercolor palette and cipher function more as symbolic conveniences than lived particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on the librarian. Perceptual signature (allegorical, lyric) is consistent: "dreams that wandered from their shelves," "dawn began slow performance of luminous absence." However, diction frequently drifts into elevated register ("vitalize," "cipher of longing," "luminous transactions") that feels imposed rather than character-particular. Sentence structure is rhythmic but mechanically uniform—most clauses follow noun-verb-metaphor construction. No dialogue present. The voice reads generic-lyric rather than singular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and synonym churn pervade: "capture runaway dream" / "capture … by letting them go," "luminous absence" / "absence shone brighter" / "luminous loss," "vitalize" recurs seven times without fresh meaning. Template cadence dominates: "She [verb], [metaphor]" across dozens of lines. Figurative density (nearly every sentence) lacks pattern-teaching or payoff and often muddles clarity: "dawn began slow performance of luminous absence" is more ornament than sense. Trigger: artifacts touch closure ("luminous absence became gift"), disallowing 9+ globally and capping high-band entries at 8.8 per the Patterned-artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The premise—librarian chasing an escaped dream through a magical archipelago—echoes template fantasy-allegory structures without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. The "cipher of longing" and sunrise photography offer surface novelty but function as symbolic set-dressing rather than constraints with unique properties. The final insight (letting go is capture) is familiar wisdom. Emotional specificity is absent; the librarian's arc could transfer to any protagonist with minor edits. No bold risk heightens stakes; the piece retreats into safe abstraction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The odd-hour librarian is present throughout, makes choices (packs palette and camera, paints bridge, paints "shape of safekeeping"), and her final decision to accept the dream's return shapes closure. She appears in all three gates (setup, middle, ending). However, her choices feel allegorical rather than under pressure; the decision to "let go" is conceptual rather than tactical. The character drives the arc but could be replaced with another dream-keeper archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The watercolor palette is handled in multiple beats: discovered beneath desk, wells fill with condensed memory/light during photography, she dips brush and paints bridge, dream leaps into final well. It returns at closure with reweighted meaning (empty well as "trophy of luminous loss"). Present in all three gates. The palette constrains tactics (bridge dissolves, forcing new stroke) and charges the final image. Specificity (wells filled with hours, philosopher's eyelash brush) raises irreplaceability, but the mechanics remain abstract.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The cipher of longing appears early (faded watermarks in atlas, "illuminate what flees with borrowed light") and recurs at the turn ("what is captured must also be released") and ending ("cipher of longing was … a presence to honor"). It shapes the thematic question but does not constrain on-page tactics; the librarian acts on intuition, not cipher-decoding. The concept is more motif than active stake. Present in setup and closure; minimal middle development caps it at ~4.6 range.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Paints with light" is enacted through sunrise photography and watercolor strokes (painting bridge, painting safekeeping shape). The attribute is dramatized in multiple beats and enables the capture attempt. However, the mechanics are allegorical—light as medium is asserted, not shown through constraint or cost. The trait is functionally present and shapes key beats but could be generalized to "magic art" without structural change. Setup and ending present; middle use is descriptive.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Vitalize" recurs across seven beats (title + six uses): she vitalizes through sunrise photography, vitalizes image with exposure, vitalizes not images but intervals, vitalizes morning by witness, next impossible thing to vitalize. The action drives the capture attempt and closure. However, "vitalize" reads as thematic label rather than specific action with mechanics; the word substitutes for showing the act. Major turns trace to it, but the action is easily swappable with "capture" or "preserve." Setup, middle, ending present.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sunrise photography is signaled early (she packs grandfather's camera), enacted at the peak beat (shutter click captures photons, exposures fill palette wells), and persists into the ending ("camera grew heavy with captured sunrises"). The method matters: photography provides the mechanism for light-painting and capture. It appears in all three gates and constrains tactics (timing, exposure). However, the mechanics remain metaphorical rather than shown with cost. Strong closure linkage and beat involvement elevate it into the 6+ band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The whispering archipelago is present throughout: islands murmur secrets, arrange themselves like question marks, offer mist at first island, and whisper differently after the dream's return. The setting provides atmosphere and minor guidance (volcanic rock climb, water's edge) but does not constrain choices with real pressure. It functions as backdrop with thematic resonance rather than tactical resource. Setup and ending present; middle presence is descriptive. Micro-setting (palette, camera) does more work than the archipelago itself.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"In the hush of improbable beginnings" bookends the story (opening and repeated near the end) and frames the timeframe (before dawn, sunrise performance, morning erasing her work). Time pressure is implied (dream dissolves in daylight) but never tightened or tracked; the librarian climbs, paints, descends without urgency on the page. The phrase is lyric motif rather than active constraint. Setup and closure reprise present; no middle development that alters tactics. Cap at ~4.6 for missing middle gate.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation—to capture a runaway dream—is stated early, drives every beat (discovery, chase, photography, bridge-painting, release), and transforms at closure (capture through letting go). It is on-page throughout and shapes the arc. However, the desire is told more than dramatized; we see little friction between cost and want. The librarian's longing is asserted ("her motivation sharpened") rather than embodied. All three gates present with causal role in two beats and closure linkage, placing it in the 6–7 band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Luminous absence" recurs as motif: hollow pulse of card catalog, dawn as "luminous absence," empty palette well as "luminous absence" gift, and final image. Tone is coherent—elegiac, allegorical, hushed—and modulates minimally (discovery urgency, acceptance calm). The phrase charges the final image with conceptual weight. Setup and closure present; middle presence is atmospheric. The tone supports theme but does not shift under pressure. Strong closure linkage and specificity lift it into the mid-6s.</comment>
