<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mira remains entirely externalized—no embodied emotion, no interior contradiction, only summary labels ("desperately jocular," "elusive"). The station's residents are abstract "denizens" and "souls" who never individuate; Gus and Elara are named but perform only plot functions. The piece tells us Mira "cataloged each narrative" and "her mission complete" without showing a single micro-choice under pressure or a contradictory impulse that would dramatize cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation Test: who/where/when anchors arrive by line 3, so no penalty. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural—ivy, moon rock, and "improbable rumor chain" recur—but the ending asserts a cycle ("the cycle beginning anew") without visible cost; Mira departs and the rock "glows softly," a declared promise rather than a felt reconfiguration. The rumor-chain mechanics are summarized ("Within hours…transformed") rather than shown through motivated linkage, breaking causal traceability even under an Accumulative lens. No Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing lands with on-page cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The ivy-clad station anchors setting throughout and the rusted clock tower frames the climax, satisfying the Micro-setting test. Sensory detail is present but generic ("cracked," "crumbling," "shimmer") and spatial choreography remains vague—where are characters relative to the tower, the platforms, the ivy? The fragment embedded in the cornerstone is a purposeful reprise, but the station itself does not constrain a single choice or tactic on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—curing loneliness—is signaled early but never tested by a live choice with alternatives. Mira's plan unfolds as summary declaration: "she hatched," "she began," "she chose," "she asked." The confessions scene ("One by one, they whispered") reports a collective act without showing a single resident's hesitation, resistance, or cost. No escalation tightens options; no reversal or deepening forces Mira to trade one path for another.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges clearly—loneliness cured through shared stories—but is stated rather than embodied: "the cure for loneliness is not a potion but a promise" is on-the-nose moralizing. The moon fragment and ivy recur, yet neither shifts meaning through character action; they remain static symbols. The ending's "gentle rebellion against the silence of isolation" asserts a thematic payoff the scene work has not earned through concrete, conflicted particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Third-person narration maintains stable distance and the prose carries a faint lyric texture ("sleep beneath a blanket of ivy," "polite anarchy"). Dialogue is absent, so subtext cannot be evaluated. Psychic distance remains consistent, but diction drifts into elevated abstraction under pressure ("harmonious resonance of shared loneliness") rather than sharpening through the focalizer's lens. No perceptual signature distinguishes this narrator's way of noticing from generic literary voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "rumors instead of tickets" / "tales of distant disasters, each whispered rumor"; "loneliness that haunted" / "weary of isolation" / "shared loneliness turning into shared hope." Template cadence: "She spoke…She began…She chose…She stood." Stock metaphors: "beacon," "glimmer of recognition," "collective glow." "Desperately jocular" appears three times but never manifests in concrete speech or gesture. Applying patterned-artifact penalty pack: −1.0 total for loops, template stems, and label repetition.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The core synthesis—moon rock as rumor-chain catalyst for collective hope—reads as a template "healing object in ruin" design without lived specificity. Mira's logistician role is ornamental; swap "logistician" for "wanderer" and the plot is unchanged. The ending's cycle (Mira → Elara → stranger) echoes countless torch-passing frames. No bold structural risk or non-obvious moral calculus distinguishes the premise from its archetype.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>2.8</grade><comment>Mira is named and her title anchors premise, but her choices are summarized rather than dramatized. "She hatched a plan," "she chose," "she asked" are plot declarations without on-page agency or cost. She departs before dawn—setup and closure presence—but no middle development beat shows her weighing options or altering tactics under pressure. Caps: late closure participation (she vanishes without cost), swappable role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The moon-rock fragment appears in beat 1 (satchel clink), beat 2 (Mira mentions it glows), beat 3 (she cradles it during confessions), and beat 4 (embedded in cornerstone). It shapes the rumor-chain tactic and anchors the final image. However, its "glowing when loneliness ebbs" is asserted, not shown; no on-page moment demonstrates the rock constraining or enabling a choice with visible cost. Three gates met, but causal pressure and specificity remain thin.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Reciprocity" is declared in paragraph 6 ("every favor…demanded a story in return") and echoed at closure ("small act of reciprocity"). It frames the exchange logic but does not constrain a tactical choice on the page—no scene shows Mira refusing help until a story is offered, or a resident withholding a tale. Setup and thematic closure presence, but no middle development beat where reciprocity narrows options or imposes cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"Desperately jocular" is named three times but never enacted. No line of dialogue, gesture, or micro-choice shows Mira laughing at crumbling walls "as if they were old friends" or softening "into something genuine" through specific action. Label-only trait without embodied cost or tactical consequence. Caps: ornamental, label-only (−0.6), no middle development or closure payoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Catalyze" appears in paragraph 9 ("could catalyze more than memory") and again in the final lines ("forever catalyzing connection"). The confession scene is framed as catalytic activation ("the fragment pulsed…merging"), but the mechanic is asserted, not shown—what changes because of the catalysis? Setup and thematic closure, one functional beat (confessions), but swappable with "inspire" or "kindle" without structural loss. Specificity and causal pressure are moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Improbable rumor chain" is introduced in paragraph 7, seeded to Gus in paragraph 11, passed to the fiddler and children in paragraph 12, and referenced at closure ("improbable rumor chains"). Setup, one middle development beat (Gus→fiddler→children), and closure presence satisfy the gate model. However, the mechanic is summarized ("Within hours…transformed") rather than shown through on-page friction or verification; how does a rumor become tangible promise? Functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The disused railway station appears in paragraph 1, frames every beat (platforms, ivy, clock tower), and the cornerstone anchors the final image. The clock tower is chosen as "stage for her final act," providing spatial focus for the climax. However, the setting does not constrain a choice—no locked door, no ivy blocking access, no time limit imposed by train schedules. Strong presence across all three gates, moderate causal linkage, but no on-page moment where setting alters tactics with cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"When the story changes" is mentioned once (paragraph 16: "On a night when the story changed") as a poetic marker, not a functional timeframe. The clock is "frozen at midnight," eliminating time pressure. Mira "slipped away before sunrise" signals duration, but no ticking clock or deadline forces earlier choices. Setup (frozen clock introduced early), closure echo, but no middle development where time narrows options. Caps: ornamental, no pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Cure for loneliness" is Mira's stated goal (paragraph 4) and the thematic spine, echoed at closure ("the cure for loneliness is not a potion but a promise"). It drives her rumor-seeding tactic and the confession-gathering scene. However, the desire is told, not embodied through conflicted choice—does Mira risk anything to achieve it? Does a resident's loneliness resist her plan, forcing adaptation? Setup, one middle beat (confessions), closure presence; friction and cost remain thin.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Polite anarchy" appears twice: paragraph 16 ("ghosts gathered in polite anarchy") and the penultimate paragraph ("the polite anarchy of shared stories reigns"). It colors the gathering but does not modulate with pressure or charge the final image through rhythm or diction shift. The tone remains lyric-declarative throughout, with no escalation from polite to anarchic tension. Thematic label rather than embodied tonal arc. Caps: ornamental, no middle development.</comment>
