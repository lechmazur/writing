<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to "harvest lessons from loss" is articulated but the interiority relies heavily on abstraction ("here-and-gone pulse," "flicker that vanished when she looked directly"). The carving action provides embodied movement, yet the internal contradiction never sharpens into competing impulses that act simultaneously—grief is processed linearly through therapeutic metaphor. The ending "smile" and "rust-hued peace" land as declarations rather than earned contradictions with visible cost. Backstory is minimal and anchored, but the reflective mode dominates without micro-choices that alter present stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Mara carves, places the prism, pours tea, and reflects on transformation. However, no on-page reversal or tightening narrows her options—each stroke and the prism placement occur without resistance or cost that forecloses a path. The closure reconfigures meaning thematically ("the lesson was not to hold on, but to let the memory transform") but the conceptual cost remains asserted rather than felt in a specific image or forfeited option. The prism's "crystallized time" method is invoked but not dramatized as a constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight, kettle, workbench, and quartz prism anchor the loft vividly. Sensory detail is selective: rust-hued light, chamomile scent, ash wood texture. The kettle's whistle functions as a temporal marker, and the skylight droplet offers a charged micro-image at midpoint. However, none of these environmental features constrain a choice or shift tactics—the carving proceeds unobstructed. The final placement "beside the window, where the light could catch its mane" charges the closure image modestly but does not reweight stakes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming grief into "something that could sit on a shelf"—is signaled early. Yet no on-page pressure forces Mara to choose between competing options or pay a visible cost. The carving unfolds smoothly without reversal; the prism placement occurs without resistance. The kettle boils as ambient time rather than a countdown that alters her tactics. The ending "smile" and deepened "rust-hued peace" describe resolution without showing what she forfeited or how her options narrowed under the chosen Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges from the "here and gone" concept and the carving's transformation, avoiding overt thesis statements in most of the text. The quartz-prism ritual and the lion's "both here and gone" status operate as metaphor. However, the final paragraphs slide into thematic summary: "the true harvest was not in preserving the past, but in allowing it to become part of the present" and "to contain a memory is not to freeze it, but to let it flow like water." These assertions replace scene pressure and state the lesson rather than letting the carved lion's image earn it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Single POV is stable; focalization through Mara is clean. Diction carries a poetic register ("hauntingly practical," "ghost-sharp," "rust-hued peace") that remains consistent but occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("crystallized time," "fleeting imprint on a surface"). The kettle's whistle and carving rhythm provide purposeful sensory modulation. No dialogue appears. The perceptual signature is present—grief filtered through artisan detail—but the voice lacks contradiction or pressure-driven compression at peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Clarity is generally high; sentences are grammatical and spatial choreography tracks. However, the text exhibits paraphrase loops: "here-and-gone pulse" / "here and gone" / "both here and gone" recurs without added pressure. Phrases like "hauntingly practical" appear three times, and "rust-hued peace" is restated in multiple beats without functional reweighting. Template cadence in the final third: "She realized... She had learned... And so the lion remained..." Stack of filter constructions ("She could feel," "She imagined," "She understood") in reflective beats dull immediacy. Figurative density ("like smoke," "like a whip crack," "like dew," "like water through the crystal") clusters without pattern-teaching.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The widow-carver premise and quartz-prism ritual offer a specific synthesis of grief and craft. The ash-wood lion, skylight loft, and "crystallized time" method are particular rather than generic. However, the emotional arc—transform loss into acceptance—follows a familiar template, and the final realization ("not to hold on, but to let the memory transform") lands as conventional wisdom. The piece does not take structural or perspectival risks; the prism method remains ornamental rather than driving a non-obvious turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mara is present throughout; she lifts the chisel, carves the mane, places the prism, and pours tea. Setup and development gates are met. However, her choices do not create key turns—the carving proceeds without obstacle or competing desire. The ending smile and realization are told rather than shown as decisions that alter tactics. Closure participation is thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The ash wood blank appears in the opening paragraph, is carved across multiple beats, and remains in the final image beside the window. Setup, development, and closure gates are met. The blank's transformation into a lion with hollow eyes provides evolving use. However, the wood does not constrain a choice or supply a cost—Mara's hands move "with a rhythm she thought she had forgotten" without struggle tied to the material's properties.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The "here-and-gone" concept is seeded early ("here-and-gone pulse of his presence"), recurs at midpoint ("everything is here-and-gone"), and charges the final whisper: "Here and gone, just like the rain." It frames Mara's stake—containing the fleeting—and the ending reweights it thematically. However, it does not change on-page options or tactics; it remains a reflective lens rather than a pressure that narrows choices.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Hauntingly practical" appears three times: describing the carving act, the lion emblem, and the ending reminder. Setup and closure gates are met. The trait labels Mara's approach but does not constrain or enable a specific action with cost. It functions as a descriptor rather than a decision hinge—no moment shows her choosing practicality over sentiment or vice versa with visible consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Contain" is central: Mara wants to "contain his spirit within the wood," places the prism to press the moment, and learns "to contain a memory is not to freeze it." Setup and closure gates are met. The action drives the carving sequence and the prism placement. However, the act of containment does not create a turn or reversal—nothing escapes, resists, or forces a trade-off. The resolution redefines containment thematically without showing what that redefinition cost her.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The "crystallized time" method is introduced early via Mara's reading and explained late: "focus on the memory, allow the crystal to hold it... and the wood would absorb the echo." Setup and closure gates are met. However, the mechanics remain told rather than shown—no step fails, no constraint alters her approach. The prism placement is a single gesture without depicted procedure or cost tied to the method's demands.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight loft anchors the opening and final images; the workbench, window, and skylight droplet provide spatial detail across beats. Setup, development, and closure gates are met. The kettle and skylight contribute sensory texture and the window placement at the end offers a charged reprise. However, the loft does not constrain Mara's choices or supply a resource that alters outcome—it functions as vivid backdrop rather than tactical element.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The kettle is introduced in the opening line, its "rumble grew louder" at midpoint, it "began to whistle" during the prism placement, and Mara pours the water near the end. Setup, development, and closure gates are met. The boiling provides ambient time, yet it does not tighten decisions—Mara carves at her own pace without racing the whistle or using it as a ritual timer with stakes. The method description mentions "letting the steam be a timer" but this remains summary rather than dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The desire "to harvest lessons from loss" is stated in the opening paragraph, drives the carving and prism ritual, and is reprised in the reflection: "every moment of that afternoon was a lesson harvested." Setup, development, and closure gates are met. The motivation shapes the overall arc but is not dramatized through conflicting wants—no moment shows Mara torn between holding on and releasing with visible cost in the scene. The friction remains reflective rather than enacted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Rust-hued peace" appears in the opening ("casting a rust-hued peace across the worn floorboards"), returns at the prism placement, and deepens in the final sequence ("rust-hued peace settle deeper, a color that tasted like old copper and warmth"). Setup and closure gates are met. The tone modulates from initial calm through reflective intensity to settled warmth, supporting the arc. However, it does not charge the final image with new meaning—the repetition reinforces rather than reweights the established mood.</comment>
