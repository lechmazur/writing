<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The balladeer remains an abstract figure with no embodied contradictions or micro-choices under pressure. Her motivation to "articulate unspoken needs" is declared but never dramatized through conflicting impulses or visible cost. The scribe's entrance in the second half introduces a second character whose actions (tracing, singing) mirror the balladeer without distinct voice or stakes. No meaningful change or credible endurance is earned; the ghost's "freedom" arrives through atmospheric description rather than a choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive within the opening lines, satisfying the test. The piece gestures toward accumulative/textural mode with recurring glyphs and mist, but pressure never tightens or deepens—each paragraph restates the encoding action without narrowing options or raising cost. The "closure" dissolves into light and mist with no decisive change, resonant reconfiguration, or conceptual repricing; the ghost drifts upward as atmospheric assertion rather than earned transformation. No visible or felt cost lands on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The misty courtyard is vividly sketched with sensory detail (mist, thunder, stone walls blooming with graffiti). However, the setting functions as backdrop rather than constraint—no environmental feature pressures a choice or alters tactics. The flower press bolt plate, mentioned repeatedly, is never handled in a way that changes the outcome; it glows decoratively at the end. The courtyard's suspension "above the clouds" remains a postcard image rather than a spatial pressure that shapes the balladeer's or scribe's moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.5</grade><comment>The dominant stake—giving voice to the ghost's unspoken needs—is signaled early but never tested or tightened. Each beat (stamping patterns, walls blooming, ghost flickering, scribe tracing) cycles through the same encoding action without escalation, reversal, or visible cost. The ghost's "freedom" at the end is not earned by a protagonist decision or sacrifice; it simply happens as atmospheric description. No choice narrows options, no failure compounds, and coincidence (the scribe's arrival, the bolt plate's glow) advances the resolution without agency.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>A theme of articulating hidden pain emerges from the encoding imagery, and the graffiti-as-language motif recurs across beats. However, the final image offers no non-literal answer or reweighting—"the ghost in code, now free, drifted upward" restates the premise rather than repricing it. The balladeer's vanishing and the scribe's echo gesture toward continuity, but these remain thematic claims ("voices never truly die") rather than particulars that charge the closure. No earned wisdom or insight arises from the on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The prose maintains a consistent lyric register with stable third-person distance and purposeful compression ("tinkersong wonder," "driftingly alert"). Perceptual signature is present but not character-specific—both balladeer and scribe notice and act in identical patterns without distinct voice. No dialogue appears. Filter constructions ("felt the motivation," "seemed to echo") dull immediacy in several beats, and the elevated diction ("suspended garden," "luminous echo") remains uniform under pressure rather than modulating with urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "encode secrets into the stone" / "messages encoded in graffiti art" / "encode the unspoken needs" / "encoded love, loss, and hope" / "encoded in the stones" cycle without added pressure or detail. Template cadence runs appear ("She pressed... the glyphs flared... the ghost surged") and synonym churn (swirling glyphs, shimmering glyphs, pulsing glyphs) obscures causality. Mixed metaphors—"walls bloomed with graffiti roses, each petal a cipher"—strain coherence. Figurative density in nearly every sentence (ghost's symphony, ink and memory, living manuscript) without pattern-teaching triggers overwriting penalties. These artifacts touch the closure beat ("drifted upward, a luminous echo"), warranting escalated deduction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The ghost-in-code premise and graffiti-as-encoding method offer a fresh synthesis, and the suspended courtyard is a striking image. However, the emotional arc (giving voice to the silenced) follows a predictable template without transformation through specific lived detail or moral calculus. The scribe's arrival and the bolt plate's late glow resolve the ghost's need without prior groundwork, reducing inevitability. No bold risk heightens stakes; the piece stays safely within lyric mode without testing its implications under genuine pressure.</comment>
