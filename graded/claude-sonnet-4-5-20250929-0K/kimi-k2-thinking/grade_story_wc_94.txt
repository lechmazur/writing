<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The poet's interiority is consistently present but largely abstract—"furiously tranquil," "trembling core," "scars on his tongue"—without embodied contradiction or micro-choices that reveal competing impulses in scene. The final decision to write and leave the poem feels declared rather than earned through prior pressure that forecloses other paths. Internal conflict is asserted ("a surface of calm glass over a seething undercurrent") but not dramatized through simultaneous contradictory wants acting on the page. The vigil and writing gestures function more as meditative backdrop than crucible forcing a cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece layers poetic images (storm, scars, masks, timer, envelope) without clear causal linkage; the poet's opening of the envelope and decision to write arrive without prior beats that narrow options or raise cost. The closure moment—writing the uncensored poem and descending with it—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the poet now "reads" his scars and breaks the vigil), but the cost is implied rather than made undeniable on the page; no visible price (risk, forfeiture, relational loss) anchors the shift. Orientation is stable (poet, observatory, storm night), but the accumulative pressure does not tighten or deepen meaningfully; the final act feels like a thematic declaration rather than a reweighting shaped by prior constraint.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The observatory above clouds, storm, brass instruments, and darkroom timer establish vivid atmosphere and anchor the vigil. The timer's tick and the storm's pulse recur purposefully, and the old bus timetable with the envelope functions as a charged object. However, the environment does not constrain a choice—rain, wind, altitude, visibility do not alter tactics—and the final descent is mentioned but not staged, so the setting charges mood without forcing action. Sensory detail is selective and poetic but not filtered through immediate urgency or professional priorities.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—to understand the cartography of scars, to speak uncensored—is signaled early but never tested by on-page opposition or trade-off. The poet waits, opens the envelope, reads his own past message, and decides to write; no reversal narrows options, no cost is visible (no censor enters, no resource is spent, no prior path is foreclosed). The timer and storm intensify atmosphere but do not escalate pressure; the "vigil in pause" remains a tableau rather than a gauntlet. The ending gesture (descending with the sealed envelope) is announced rather than earned by prior agency under constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Theme—silence, censorship, scars as maps, the persistence of voice—is woven throughout via recurring motifs (masks, scars, cartography, storm). The final image of the poet descending with the sealed envelope attempts Resonant Reconfiguration, reweighting the scars as readable terrain rather than wounds. However, the thematic payoff leans on direct statement ("scars were the true cartography of survival," "When masks slip, the truth is a storm you must weather") rather than earning the insight through concrete cost. The piece invites reflection but the ending moralizes more than it resonates through image alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single POV, stable distance, and a consistent lyric register ("furiously tranquil," "storm-kissed wonder," "rarefied air") create a coherent narrative voice. Diction remains elevated and poetic throughout, appropriate for the poet focalizer. Minor issues: some filter verbs ("he felt his own mask slip," "he could almost hear") dull immediacy in peak moments, and a few phrases ("the timer's steady tick was the only clock in a vigil that had paused the world") edge toward over-elaboration. The voice is distinct but occasionally tips into abstraction under pressure rather than tightening.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Figurative language is dense and often purposeful ("lightning carving white scars," "storm-kissed wonder," "cloak sewn from lightning and quiet"), but several beats stack metaphors without advancing causality: paragraphs on scars, maps, silence, and storms loop semantically. Template cadence appears in adjacent lines: "He placed… He recalled… He opened… He folded… He breathed… He understood… He placed… He thought… He knew…" The repeated "He [verb]" stems across the final third create a drumbeat monotony. Paraphrase loops (e.g., "cartography of scars" rephrased multiple times without added pressure) lower density. Apply −1.2 in Q7 for template cadence + loops touching the closure third, and disallow 9+ globally per artifact rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The premise—censored poet in an isolated observatory during a storm, finding a message from his past self—offers a lyric frame with some freshness. However, the beats (waiting, opening envelope, reading own message, deciding to write, descending) follow a familiar arc of artistic self-actualization without a non-obvious turn. The metaphor system (scars, maps, storms, masks) is poetic but not transformed into specific, irreplaceable detail; similar language could appear in many stories about silenced voices. The emotional core is earnest but the resolution (writing and descending) feels like a median choice rather than a bold synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Censored poet: present throughout as focalizer. He opens the envelope (beat 1), reads the message (beat 2), and decides to write (beat 3), but these are low-agency moves—waiting, reading, deciding—rather than choices that narrow options under pressure. No visible cost tied to his decisions; no censor confronts him, no tool breaks, no social price is paid on the page. Early signal +0.3, three beats +1.4, closure linkage (writes and descends) +0.7, but swappability (another silenced artist would serve) −0.6, lack of causal pressure −1.0, ornamental suffering (scars mentioned repeatedly without constraining action) −0.5. Base 3.0 +2.4 −2.1 = 3.3, round to 4.2 for the final writing gesture.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Darkroom timer: introduced early ("clutched in his palm"), placed on the table aligned with the envelope, ticks throughout the storm, clicks at the rarefied moment when the poet opens the envelope, and is placed on the windowsill at the end. Three beats (intro, click/trigger, final placement) +1.4, early signal +0.3, closure linkage (final placement) +0.7, but the timer does not constrain a choice—its click coincides with the poet's decision but does not cause it. Swappable with any ticking clock −0.6, no causal pressure −0.8. Base 3.0 +2.4 −1.4 = 4.0, adjusted to 5.8 for sustained presence and symbolic reprise.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Vigil in pause: the poet's waiting is framed as "a vigil that had paused the world," and the ending states "a moment when the censors' black ink could not reach the light." The concept shapes the tone and the poet's stance (waiting, holding breath), but does not constrain tactics—he could write at any point; the vigil is description, not a rule that alters options. Early signal +0.3, thematic presence across beats +0.4, closure reference ("vigil in pause, waiting for the next storm") +0.5, but swappability (meditative wait) −0.6, ornamental (label rather than mechanism) −0.5. Base 3.0 +1.2 −1.1 = 3.1, adjusted to 4.9 for thematic coherence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>Furiously tranquil: mentioned early ("He was furiously tranquil") and reprised late ("the furious tranquility settle into his bones"). The trait is a poetic label but does not enable or constrain an on-page action with visible cost—his tranquility does not stop him from opening the envelope or force a trade-off. Early signal +0.3, two mentions +0.4, closure reprise +0.5, but label-only (no embodied contradiction in choices) −0.5, swappable (calm under pressure) −0.6. Base 3.0 +1.2 −1.1 = 3.1, adjusted to 3.7 for lyric reprise.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Rarefy: "the storm would rarefy the air," "the rarefied moment when the air thinned," "rarefied night." The action is atmospheric rather than causal—thinning air does not mechanically enable the poet's choice to open the envelope or write. Two mentions +0.4, early signal +0.3, closure proximity (rarefied air frames the writing) +0.5, but swappable (any storm intensification) −0.6, ornamental (metaphor, not constraint) −0.5. Base 3.0 +1.2 −1.1 = 3.1, adjusted to 4.1 for thematic integration.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Sealed envelope wedged in old bus timetable: introduced in the first third, the poet places it on the table, opens it to find his own message, refolds it, and wedges it back into the timetable at the end. Three beats (placement, opening, resealing) +1.4, early signal +0.3, closure linkage (poet descends with the envelope in his pocket) +0.7, but the method does not constrain—he could have opened the envelope at any point; the timetable is decorative. Swappable (any hidden message) −0.6, ornamental (the bus routes are described but do not affect tactics) −0.5. Base 3.0 +2.4 −1.1 = 4.3, adjusted to 5.1 for sustained presence and final reprise.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Stormlit observatory above clouds: present throughout, anchors the scene, brass instruments illuminated by lightning, the storm rattles glass, dawn breaks over cloud sea. The setting charges atmosphere and the final image ("still above the clouds, held its breath"), but does not constrain a choice—the poet could write or descend regardless of the storm. Early signal +0.8, closure linkage (final image of observatory and dawn) +1.0, sensory detail +0.5, but no tactical constraint (storm does not block exit or alter options) −1.0, postcard description in places −0.3. Base 3.0 +2.3 −1.3 = 4.0, adjusted to 6.3 for strong atmospheric charge and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>When masks slip: the phrase appears in the envelope's message ("When masks slip, the truth is a storm you must weather") and in the beat "the poet felt his own mask slip, the furious calm cracking." The timeframe is poetic metaphor rather than a ticking clock; it does not tighten decisions. Two mentions +0.4, early signal +0.3, closure linkage (mask-slipping frames the ending) +0.5, but vague (no live countdown) −0.8, swappable (moment of vulnerability) −0.6. Base 3.0 +1.2 −1.4 = 2.8, adjusted to 4.6 for thematic reprise and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>To understand the cartography of scars: stated explicitly in the first third ("each cut a contour line he longed to understand"), recalled in the first censored poem line, and reprised at the end ("his scars now a map he could finally read"). Three beats +1.4, early signal +0.3, closure linkage (final realization) +0.7, but the desire is told rather than dramatized through conflicting choices—no friction between wanting to understand and a cost of seeking. Swappable (any quest for meaning) −0.6, summary-only (longing asserted, not tested) −0.5. Base 3.0 +2.4 −1.1 = 4.3, adjusted to 5.3 for thematic coherence and closure reprise.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Storm-kissed wonder: the phrase appears twice ("storm-kissed wonder that made the scars shine," "storm-kissed wonder settled over him like a cloak"), and the tone of awe and lyric intensity is sustained throughout the storm and dawn sequences. The tone modulates slightly (tension rises with the storm, settles at dawn) and charges the final image. Early signal +0.5, closure linkage (final cloak image) +1.0, coherence across beats +0.6, but single static register (lyric elevation without variation under peak pressure) −0.4, label-driven (phrase stated rather than built through rhythm alone) −0.3. Base 3.0 +2.1 −0.7 = 4.4, adjusted to 6.2 for strong tonal charge at closure.</comment>
