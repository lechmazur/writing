<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The archivist's motivation is clear—preserving memories and regenerating a lost covenant—but her interiority remains abstract and label-driven ("haunted euphoria," "quiet resolve") rather than embodied through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The decision to leave the bouquet and write in her journal feels more symbolic than earned through prior micro-choices under pressure. The piece shows "gently thorough" through action but lacks genuine internal conflict; the archivist moves smoothly toward renewal without visible struggle or cost that forecloses a path. No second character appears on the page to test relationship dynamics.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece orients quickly (archivist, archive, scroll discovery) and builds through layered images (locket, jetty, walnut ink, bouquet), culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where the archivist's private ritual sparks communal healing. However, the closure unit lacks sharp cost: the "regenerated covenant" arrives through atmosphere and ritual rather than a legible choice that forecloses an option. The causality is soft—discovery leads to decision leads to offering—with motivated ellipsis but minimal on-page tightening. The villagers' response feels coincidental rather than earned by protagonist agency, and the final journal entry ("When context changes, the heart must choose whether to anchor or drift") reads as thematic summary rather than dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setting details are vivid and purposeful: cedar shelf, walnut ink, blooming jetty, moss-covered stones, night-blooming jasmine. The jetty functions as a charged site that anchors both memory and renewal, and the steep hillside climb provides physical texture. Sensory selection (scent of jasmine and rain, water lapping, twilight cool) reflects urgency and filters through the archivist's preservationist lens. The jasmine bouquet left on the jetty charges the final image, meeting the 9+ test—environment constrains ritual and the recurring object (jetty, ink, jasmine) reweights meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: regenerating the lost covenant and preserving small moments. The archivist's climb to the jetty and act of writing provide one meaningful deepening, and the villagers' response adds accumulative pressure. However, escalation lacks protagonist agency—discovery of the locket leads smoothly to ritual without a reversal or trade-off that narrows options. The bouquet offering sparks communal healing, but this feels coincidental rather than driven by a choice with visible cost. Under the Accumulative lens the cadence shift is present but the price remains atmospheric rather than legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: small moments become covenants, memory anchors identity, context can renew what was lost. Walnut ink, locket photo, and jasmine recur with reweighted meaning, and the archivist's ritual avoids overt moralizing until the final journal line, which edges toward explicit thesis ("When context changes, the heart must choose whether to anchor or drift"). The piece invites reflection through image and accumulation, but "haunted euphoria" and "regenerated covenant" risk becoming prompt labels rather than earned insights. The ending offers a resonant answer through the villagers' tokens, yet the conceptual cost remains oblique rather than undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited, filtered through the archivist's preservationist lens. Diction is elevated and lyric ("salt-kissed twilight air," "ghostly echoes") with a consistent texture, though register occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("proximate cause," "context"). Perceptual signature is present: she notices ink, paper, scent, weight. No dialogue to judge. Psychic distance modulates appropriately with emotional beats, and tense remains consistent. Brief compression at peak moments (climb, writing, offering) fits voice and does not obscure clarity. Purposeful lyric elevation supports the accumulative design without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Prose is lyric and image-rich but shows template cadence and synonym loops: "gently thorough" appears twice, "proximate cause" recurs mechanically, "weight of small moments" is paraphrased across multiple lines. Figurative density is high throughout ("like a dark ribbon," "like ghostly echoes," "like a lantern") without clear pattern-teaching or payoff, triggering the overwriting check. Sentence rhythm varies, but stems repeat ("She withdrew," "She realized," "She opened"). Information density is moderate; some lines (tea steeping mirroring hillside steep) feel ornamental. No causality breaks, but the accumulation of decorative metaphor and conceptual redundancy ("proximate cause" as a repeated motif without mechanical clarity) lowers momentum. Apply −0.6 for template cadence and loops, −0.4 for figurative density without coherent payoff.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The frame—archivist preserving fragile histories discovers a locket that sparks personal renewal—is competent but not fresh. Walnut ink and night-blooming jasmine provide texture, yet the emotional arc (loss → ritual → communal healing) follows a familiar template without transformation through lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus. "Regenerated covenant" and "proximate causes" read as thematic placeholders rather than specific, irreplaceable particulars. The piece commits to its lyric premise and avoids overt moralizing until the final journal entry, but proximity to stock archivist-rediscovering-love plots and the safe middle choice (renewal without visible sacrifice) limit originality. No derivative-premise guardrail applies, but freshness is insufficient for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The walnut-ink archivist appears early (setup ✓), makes the decision to climb and write (middle development ✓), and her bouquet offering shapes the villagers' response at closure (payoff ✓). Her choices—lifting the scroll, climbing the hillside, writing with ink, leaving jasmine—drive beats, but these feel observational and ritualistic rather than decisive turns that narrow options. The character constrains action through her preservationist lens and "gently thorough" trait, yet no single choice forecloses a path with visible cost. Two distinct beats (discovery, ritual) + early signal + closure linkage, but causal pressure and cost connection are weak. Swappability moderate; another memory-keeper role would fit with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The locket photo appears early when discovered in the ledger (setup ✓), sparks the archivist's resolve to regenerate the covenant (middle development ✓), and is tucked into the fresh journal at closure, preserving the moment (payoff ✓). Handled in two distinct beats (discovery, preservation) with reweighted meaning: initially a relic, then a seed for renewal. The object enables the protagonist's ritual and charges the closure image. However, the locket does not constrain a choice or impose visible cost; it remains a symbolic trigger rather than a tool with unique properties. Early signal + two beats + closure linkage + charged reprise, but cost connection and irreplaceability are modest.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "regenerated covenant" is named early (setup ✓) and articulated at closure through the villagers' tokens and the archivist's journal entry (payoff ✓), but middle development is thin—no on-page choice tests what regeneration costs or how it narrows options. The concept shapes the dominant stake thematically but does not alter tactics or force a trade-off on the page. It reads as an atmospheric claim rather than a causal engine. Present in two segments (resolve, ending), but the mechanics remain abstract. Late explicit use, ornamental integration, summary-only dramatization of the covenant's effect. Cap at 4.6 for missing concrete middle development.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Gently thorough" is demonstrated early (lifting the scroll, brushing dust) and again in the closing line ("gently thorough, preserving the weight of each memory"), framing the piece (setup ✓, payoff ✓). Middle development is present in her careful climb and deliberate writing (middle ✓). The trait constrains her approach—meticulous, reverent—but does not impose a visible cost or enable a specific turn that another trait would foreclose. It colors her actions without creating friction. Early signal + embodied in two beats + closure echo, but cost and irreplaceability are weak. Swappability moderate; "careful" or "patient" would serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Steep" appears in three contexts: the hillside climb, the act of steeping tea, and the metaphorical echo between them. Setup occurs mid-story when the archivist climbs (after the first third; late setup −0.3), development is present in the climb enabling access to the jetty (middle ✓), and payoff arrives in the tea scene where the word is reprised with thematic resonance (payoff ✓). The climb drives spatial progression and the tea moment charges reflection, but the action is not irreplaceable—any physical effort could serve. One clear beat (climb) + lyric reprise + modest causal pressure. Late first use, swappability moderate, no unique cost tied to steepness itself.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Through proximate causes" is named repeatedly (five mentions) as a thematic refrain but never dramatized as a method that shapes tactics or alters the archivist's choices. Setup is present early (locket as proximate cause), but there is no middle beat where the protagonist uses causal linkage as a tool, and the closure merely recapitulates the label without mechanical payoff. The phrase reads as conceptual ornamentation rather than a constraint or technique. Present across beats but summary-only, no causal work, swappable with "through connection" or "through memory." Cap at 3.8 for label-only use without on-page mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The blooming jetty at twilight is introduced early (setup ✓), becomes the destination that focuses the archivist's climb and ritual (middle development ✓), and hosts both her writing and the villagers' offerings at closure (payoff ✓). The setting supplies the jasmine, the wooden planks, the water's whisper—resources that enable and charge the ritual. Twilight modulates tone and marks the threshold moment. Three distinct beats (arrival, writing, communal response) + causal pressure (setting enables ritual) + closure linkage (final offering placed here). The jetty is irreplaceable as the covenant's original site and its renewal location. Cost is implicit in the pilgrimage required to reach it.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"When context changes" appears as the journal's closing line (payoff ✓) and the piece implies temporal transition (archivist's past at the jetty, present discovery, twilight ritual, next morning's villagers), but the timeframe is not tracked or weaponized to tighten decisions. Setup is vague—no clear anchor for when the original covenant was made or how long it has been lost. Middle development shows passage (twilight → candlelight → morning) but no live clock that alters tactics. The phrase "when context changes" reads as thematic summary rather than a constraint. Present across segments but not as a pressure mechanism. Cap at 4.6 for missing concrete setup and middle mechanics; lyric reprise at closure partially recovers.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To preserve the weight of small moments" is signaled early (the archivist's reverence for fragile histories), drives her climb and writing (middle ✓), and is crystallized in the closing line (payoff ✓). The motivation shapes her choices—discovering the locket, writing with walnut ink, leaving the bouquet—and frames the dominant stake. However, the desire is never tested by a conflicting want or cost that would force a trade-off on the page. It guides action without friction. Early signal + two beats + closure linkage, but no visible struggle or renunciation. Cost connection weak; the archivist pursues preservation without sacrifice or doubt.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Haunted euphoria" is named twice (at the jetty, watching from the window) and implied through the blend of salt-kissed memory and blooming renewal. Setup occurs mid-story when the archivist feels the tone at the jetty (late setup −0.2), development continues in her shiver and the "past and future collided" moment (middle ✓), and payoff arrives when she watches the villagers with the same feeling (closure ✓). Tone is coherent across beats, modulating from melancholy (dust, brittle scroll) to charged hopefulness (jasmine, offerings) without static uniformity. The phrase itself edges toward label-speak, but the tonal layering (loss + renewal) charges the final image. Two beats + closure linkage + modulation under pressure, but late first mention and label reliance reduce integration.</comment>
