<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lira is given tasks and emotions but never faces a genuine internal contradiction or a choice that reveals competing values. Her actions—sorting, building monuments, climbing—proceed without friction or cost that would test her commitment. The "mossy delight" label appears repeatedly without embodied texture, and her heart "quickens" on cue but no decision forecloses a path or imposes visible sacrifice. The ending grants fulfillment without struggle, erasing any opportunity for earned change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Orientation arrives slowly (who, where, what task by ~150 words) but the piece never teaches a coherent drive lens: events accumulate without causal links (dust appears, seeds transform, map points, prophecy unfolds) and no reversal or tightening narrows options. The "closure" is a declared fulfillment—prophecy complete, arbor blooming—without on-page cost or a before/after legible in Lira's situation or stance. Moonstone dust solves every problem it encounters, collapsing pressure rather than escalating it, and the final image is pure satisfied completion with no felt price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor is evocatively named and receives atmospheric detail (twilight, mossy light, silken roots), but it functions as backdrop rather than constraint. Spatial choreography is vague—Lira "moves through branches," "climbs the ashen bark," "reaches the hollow"—without legible distances or effort that would pressure her choices. The arbor's blooming at the end is a reward, not a resource or obstacle that shaped tactics earlier.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decode the prophecy before the hush falls—is declared but never tested by deadline pressure or competing costs. Lira encounters no reversals: moonstone dust appears and immediately grants transformation, the map points her to the First Seed without complication, prodding releases the prophecy without risk. Escalation is absent; each step succeeds on first attempt, and the resolution is a gift from the dust rather than a choice Lira makes under constraint.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Theme—memory, prophecy, the arbor's renewal—is asserted through repeated phrases ("tiny monuments to forgotten things," "mossy delight") rather than emerging from specific conflict. The ending states the message ("arbor must be fed with moonstone dust") as exposition, not dramatic discovery, and Lira's final satisfaction is declared rather than earned by particulars. The recycled phrase "mossy delight" (four appearances) and "emerges transformed always" function as motif tokens without accruing new meaning or cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV is stable, but diction drifts between lyric register ("ashen skyborne arbor," "cocoon of silken roots") and flat exposition ("The map points toward the forgotten grove"). Narrative certainty is unmodulated—Lira "realizes" and "knows" on cue without visible inference—and interiority consists of summary emotional labels ("her heart quickens," "mossy delight") rather than character-particular perception. Sentence openings recycle stems: "She decides," "She gathers," "She sprinkles," "She climbs."</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops pervade: "build tiny monuments" (three times), "emerges transformed always" (twice identically), "mossy delight" (four times), and synonym churn for the same concept (forgotten voices/tales/folklore, tiny monuments/cairns, transform/unfold/split). Template cadence—"She [verb]s... She [verb]s"—runs across eight consecutive beats without variation. The phrase "the hush where past meets prophecy" appears verbatim three times. Mixed metaphor: leaves "fall like whispers" then form a "mosaic that shimmers with mossy delight," conflating sound, texture, and light incoherently.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>3.7</grade><comment>The premise—seed sorter decodes prophecy via magical dust—combines familiar elements (chosen-one prophecy, memory seeds, ancient arbor) without a fresh synthesis or non-obvious inflection. Emotional arc is generic fulfillment without complication, and no detail is irreplaceable: swap "moonstone dust" for any magical catalyst and the plot holds unchanged. The "tiny monuments to forgotten things" recurs as a label but never constrains a choice or charges the closure with cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Lira sorts, builds monuments, gathers seeds, climbs, and sprinkles dust across multiple beats, but none of her actions is a choice that narrows options or imposes cost. She executes tasks in sequence without friction; the narrative would break without her presence, but her agency does not create turns. Late setup (~10% mark) and swappable with "dutiful protagonist."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Moonstone dust appears at ~20%, transforms seeds (~30%), guides Lira's fingers (~60%), and is sprinkled over seedlings at closure (~85%). It drives multiple beats and participates in the ending, but it functions as an omnipotent solve-all rather than a tool with cost or tradeoff. Removing it would collapse the plot, elevating necessity, but its mechanics are frictionless.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>Regional folklore is mentioned three times as thematic backdrop ("folklore whispers," "known in folklore," "new folklore") but never constrains a present choice or tactic. It appears early (~8%) yet remains ornamental—Lira does not navigate competing traditions, interpret ambiguous lore, or pay a social cost for belief. Swappable with "ancient prophecy."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>1.8</grade><comment>"Emerges transformed always" is stated twice identically (verbatim at ~25% and ~85%) as a descriptor of what happens to seeds touched by dust. It is a rule of the world, not a character attribute, and does not constrain or enable Lira's action with visible cost. No on-page tradeoff ties to this phrase.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Prod" appears twice: Lira prods a leaf with the silver needle (~42%), causing it to split and reveal a map, then prods the First Seed (~72%), which unfolds and releases the prophecy. Both uses are mechanically causal and irreplaceable—without prodding, the prophecy remains hidden—and the action participates in closure. Early setup (~42%) and beats across midpoint and ending lift the score, though the second prod is identical in function to the first, limiting depth.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>Building tiny monuments is signaled early (~15%: "She builds tiny monuments to forgotten things") and returns at closure ("Lira stands among her tiny monuments, each now a beacon of memory"). The method constrains no middle choice and its mechanics (gathering dust, stacking petrified leaves) do not shape tactics under pressure. The lyric reprise reweights the image slightly, but the method is swappable with any ritual gesture.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor is named in the opening line and returns in the final third ("The ashen skyborne arbor begins to glow"). It provides evocative atmosphere (twilight, mossy light, spiral roots) but does not constrain movement, supply a resource Lira must locate, or impose terrain cost. Lira climbs "the ashen bark" and reaches "the hollow," yet spatial logic remains vague. The arbor's blooming is a result, not a pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.1</grade><comment>"During the hush where past meets prophecy" opens the story and recurs verbatim twice more, but no deadline is dramatized. "Before the next hush falls" is declared (~28%) yet never becomes a live clock that alters Lira's tactics or forces a tradeoff. Time remains atmospheric rather than a constraint with teeth.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"To decode the message in falling leaves" is stated explicitly (~28% and ~52%) and organizes Lira's task, but the desire is never tested by competing costs or friction. She gathers, arranges, and deciphers without obstacle; the prophecy is delivered to her via prodding rather than wrested through interpretive struggle. The motivation is functional but does not create internal conflict or a difficult choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"Mossy delight" appears four times (opening atmosphere, leaf mosaic, arbor's glow, Lira's final emotional state) as a label rather than a modulated tone. The phrase is identical each time and does not shift meaning or charge the closure beyond summary satisfaction. Tone remains static—no tension, dread, or ambiguity—throughout, and the repeated label reads as ornamental rather than purposeful.</comment>
