<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Elara's motivation to unite the community is declared early but her internal contradictions never surface—she moves through the story with steady resolve, no genuine struggle between competing goods. The "empathetically decisive" label appears without cost: she feels everyone's pride yet faces no on-page friction when asking them to surrender linguistic autonomy. Minor characters (Klaus, Ania, Miguel) function as cooperative props rather than sources of resistance. The ending's communal harmony arrives without visible sacrifice or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Orientation is delayed: who Elara is, her role, and the town's geography emerge piecemeal across the first third without spatial anchors (−0.4). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural (phrases gathered, sung together), but no meaningful tightening occurs—Elara convenes the talk, teaches the melody, the town sings, the clock works. Closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration in theory (bridges built, elevators hum), yet the cost is asserted rather than dramatized: no character refuses participation, no language is lost, no prior silence pays a price on the page. The final image ("bridges spanned the silos, built of melody and starlight") restates the premise without reweighting it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The astronomical clock tower, grain elevators, and borrowed starlight anchor the world with vivid particulars and purposeful recurrence. The brass weight (engraved with wheat sheaves) ties setting to action when Elara places it in the belfry. Spatial choreography remains clear across vertical (tower) and horizontal (elevators, stage) planes. However, the elevators' constraint is decorative: they "talk across the fields" but never block a choice or alter tactics; the railroad tracks are mentioned as a divider yet never tested. The setting charges the final image but does not pressure the protagonist's path.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>One dominant stake (unify the divided town) is signaled early. No meaningful escalation: Elara's plan (gather phrases, teach a melody) proceeds without resistance, adaptation, or reversal. The convening of the "first grain elevator talk" implies risk, but all participants cooperate immediately—no refusal, no linguistic pride defended, no cost to interspersing tongues. The clock's revival depends on collective will, yet that will materializes without dramatized persuasion or trade-off. Closure reconfigures the town's listening, but the path from silence to song lacks on-page friction or a choice that narrows options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The theme (community as polyphony, listening as bridge-building) emerges from concrete images: the clock's multilingual call, the elevators' separate songs, the interspersed chorus. However, the final paragraph moralizes overtly ("time, like music, flows best when it carries every voice"), replacing earned resonance with thesis statement. Subtext is thin—dialogue and gesture carry no tension or implication counter to the surface meaning. The brass weight and starlight recur with shifted meaning at closure, lifting the score, but the emotional arc resolves into tidy satisfaction without ambiguity or lingering cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV holds cleanly on Elara; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated and lyric-consistent ("vigorous tender," "hush of borrowed starlight"), but lacks perceptual signature—sensory detail feels authorial rather than character-filtered. Dialogue (Klaus, Ania, Miguel) is functional and culturally tagged by language snippets, yet their voices converge in tone and syntax; no distinct idiom or subtext. Psychic distance remains stable. The prose reads as a single authorial texture rather than Elara's particular way of noticing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Sentence openings repeat stems: "Elara…" (×4), "The…" (×8), "She…" (×6) across adjacent paragraphs without pattern-teaching (−0.5 template cadence). Stock metaphors proliferate: "time is a river," "bridges from silos," "heart of the community." Paraphrase loops appear ("rehabilitate the clock… rehabilitate the town's listening ear"; "celestial gears had frozen… cuckoo's call swallowed by rust and time" restates stasis). Filter verbs stack in peak beats ("She had learned that to rehabilitate…"). Purple density in the festival sequence ("constellations danced," "stars aligned," "borrowed starlight") blurs concrete action. Information density is low—many sentences restate rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The core premise (multilingual choral restoration of a clock unites a divided town) follows a template reconciliation arc without transformation. The astronomical clock and grain elevators are vivid particulars, yet their combination serves a predictable harmony-through-music resolution. Emotional beats (weeping elders, laughing children) feel generic rather than character-specific. No bold structural risk or non-obvious moral calculus. The ending's "festival to celebrate" and "borrowed starlight" lean into cliché rather than fresh synthesis.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Elara is on-page throughout and makes decisions (climb the tower, gather phrases, convene the talk, teach the melody, place the weight). However, her choices do not create key turns—each step proceeds without opposition or adaptation. Her role as "harmonious choral librarian" functions more as thematic vessel than driver of causal pressure. Setup clear, development present, but swappable with "community organizer" or similar archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The cuckoo clock weight appears in beat one (discovered in the tool shed), beat two (placed in the belfry cradle), and the ending (gleaming, swinging the town's rhythm). It enables the clock's revival and gains symbolic weight at closure. However, it does not constrain a choice—Elara places it without obstacle. Early signal, multi-beat presence, closure linkage present; causal pressure and irreplaceability moderate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The grain elevator talks shape Elara's plan (gather community beneath the silos) and frame the ending (elevators "hummed in harmony"). The concept drives one key beat (the convening) and charges the final image. However, the talks themselves are not dramatized—we see the chorus sing but not the persuasion or friction that such talks would entail. Setup clear, closure linkage strong, but middle development is summary-only.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Empathetically decisive" is declared twice ("Elara was empathetically decisive," "empathetically decisive, her heart full") but never constrains action. She feels each community's pride yet encounters no on-page cost or trade-off when asking them to blend languages. The attribute exists as label rather than embodied trait. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Rehabilitate" governs the protagonist's entire arc: rehabilitate the clock (place the weight), rehabilitate the town's listening (teach the interspersed melody), rehabilitate community (convene the talk). The action is signaled early, drives multiple beats, and structures the ending. However, the rehabilitation proceeds without complication or reversal—each step succeeds. Essential across beats but not irreplaceable (could swap "restore" with minor edits).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Interspersing languages is introduced in beat one ("Her method was interspersing languages"), demonstrated in the middle (Elara gathers German, Polish, Spanish phrases), and executed at closure (the chorus sings interspersed lines; the cuckoo's call holds three tongues). The method shapes tactics and the ending image. Mechanics are shown (stitching refrain to verse) and matter to the outcome. Setup, development, closure all present; causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The astronomical clock tower anchors the opening, middle (Elara climbs to place the weight), and ending (the tower's stars dance, the clock sings). It supplies the central object (the clock) and the stage for the final image. However, the tower does not pressure Elara's choices—climbing is routine, the belfry offers no obstacle. Early signal, closure linkage strong, but constraint absent.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Under the hush of borrowed starlight" recurs in the opening, midpoint, and final third, creating rhythmic cohesion. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—night persists without urgency, and "borrowed starlight" functions as mood rather than clock. The approaching dawn is mentioned once but does not alter tactics. Lyric reprise present; causal pressure absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation (construct bridges from silos) is declared early and governs her arc. She chooses to gather phrases, convene the talk, and teach the melody in service of this goal. However, the desire is never conflicted—no cost, no want versus fear. The ending asserts success ("bridges spanned the silos") without on-page friction. Setup and closure present; internal struggle absent.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.0</grade><comment>"Vigorous tender" is declared in one line ("In the vigor of that tender night") and implied in phrasing ("vigorous and tender" chorus). The tone is present in diction (lyric, elevated, gentle intensity) and coherent across beats. However, it does not modulate meaningfully under pressure—the prose maintains one register throughout. The final image echoes the tone but does not charge it with new cost. Functional but static.</comment>
