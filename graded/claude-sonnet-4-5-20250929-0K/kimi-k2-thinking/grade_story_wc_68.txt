<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Malach's motivation is clear and consistent—preservation of method over mythology—and his choices reflect a rationally rebellious nature under pressure. Interiority is concrete ("his calm as abrasive as the brick dust in his throat") and the final choice to encode "the calculus of collapse itself" feels earned. However, internal contradiction is limited; Malach's philosophical stance never truly wavers or costs him emotionally in a way that complicates his resolve. The patrolman's confusion at his flat affect offers a micro-turn but doesn't deepen Malach's inner conflict.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The story follows a clear causal arc: Malach discovers the cog, deliberates which narrative to encode, files the data, and hides it before the patrol passes. Orientation anchors (sewer, plague aftermath, Malach's purpose) arrive early. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Malach completes his encoding and slips away, leaving the cog as a quiet rebellion; the cost is visible in his choice to preserve method over safety and his acceptance of erasure. One persistent constraint—Council patrols and executions—shapes his tactics throughout, charging the final image of the hidden cog.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sunken city's layered ruins—sewer tunnels, sediment strata, drowned basilica, plague graves—are vividly drawn and filter through Malach's archaeologist-philosopher lens. The cog itself, handled and filed across multiple beats, functions as micro-setting that constrains his choice and charges the closure. Spatial choreography is clean (two hundred feet of brick, the niche behind loose bricks). The phosphorescent fungus lamp and the brick dust in his throat anchor sensory immediacy without catalog excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving an honest record against Council censorship—is signaled early and escalates through the patrol's approach. Malach's agency is decision and endurance: he chooses to encode the "calculus of collapse" rather than a comforting myth, and his filing intensifies even as footsteps approach. The cost is legible in his acceptance of erasure and the patrol's potential violence. One meaningful tightening (the patrol's arrival) forecloses the option of prolonged deliberation, forcing him to commit and hide the cog.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from Malach's conflict: truth as craft, method over mythology, the tension between comfort and accuracy. The cog's inscription—"Tempus edax rerum"—and Malach's decision to encode "the math of how cities drown" offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without stating a moral. The final image of the hidden cog, "waiting for someone who could read its math," reweights prior material (three competing narratives, Council executions) with undeniable conceptual cost. No thematic echo or sermonizing mars the ending; the story earns its philosophical stance through specifics.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and tightly filtered through Malach's archaeologist-philosopher perspective. Diction is controlled ("rationally rebellious," "voice flat as a tidal table") and reflects his scientific bent without slipping into exposition. The single line of dialogue—"This is what happened"—carries subtext (defiance, precision) and advances the beat. Psychic distance is consistent; no head-hopping or unmotivated register shifts appear. Under pressure, the prose compresses appropriately ("He filed faster, his rebellion not in shouts but in precise, defiant geometry").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most lines advance character, setting, or theme simultaneously. The opening line anchors stakes ("corpse-bloat three months after the plague ended"); the closing image ("quiet rebellion in the ruin's heart") recharges the cog motif. Minor scaffold appears: "Malach would not be remembered, but the cog would tell its own story" restates the prior beat's implication without added pressure (−0.2). A few figurative phrases ("time devours all things, but it was human teeth doing the devouring now") read slightly elevated but remain voice-consistent and legible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—philosopher in a sewer encoding truth in a cog against Council censorship—synthesizes familiar post-apocalyptic and resistance tropes through specific archaeological and mathematical detail. The decision to encode "the calculus of collapse" rather than a single narrative feels fresh and inevitable in hindsight, arising from Malach's established rational-rebellious nature. The sedimentary layers as both physical evidence and narrative structure offer a non-obvious angle. Risk-taking in the quiet, detail-dense climax (filing under patrol threat) heightens stakes without gimmickry; the ending resists sentimentality and refuses convenient martyrdom.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Malach appears in the opening beat, drives every major choice (which narrative to encode, how to file the cog, where to hide it), and his decisions shape the closure. His "wannabe philosopher" status and sewer residence are causally integrated: he lives there to access the drowned archive, and his philosophical training informs his choice to preserve method. Removing this exact character would break the story's logic and thematic core.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The cog is handled in at least four beats: discovery in the brickwork, examination under fungus lamp, filing new notches, and hiding in the niche. Its "teeth worn smooth by centuries" and the inscription establish specificity; Malach's choice to encode data points rather than a single myth reweights the object's meaning at closure. The cog's final state—hidden for future scavengers—charges the ending image with undeniable cost. Irreplaceable: no other object could carry this exact function (precision timekeeping device as medium for truth).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The three competing narratives (plague, earthquake, deliberate submersion) frame Malach's stakes from the second paragraph and pressure his central choice: which story to encode. The concept shapes tactics—Malach sifts sediment, maps contradictions—and reaches closure when he rejects all three singular narratives for "the calculus of collapse itself." The truth mattering "because each story erased different ancestors" gives the concept social cost. However, the competing narratives function more as context for Malach's decision than as live tactical obstacles within the scene.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Rationally rebellious" is signaled early ("Malach, rationally rebellious by nature") and constrains his approach: he gathers evidence rather than accepting the Council's version, and his rebellion manifests in "precise, defiant geometry" rather than shouts. The trait enables the filing action and his calm under patrol threat. However, the trait reads somewhat label-heavy; more dramatized friction between rational caution and rebellious impulse would elevate integration. Present in the closure beat (his calm when confronted) but not irreplaceable—a similar analytical-defiant character could function with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Agonize" is dramatized in the deliberation beat ("Tonight, he would agonize over which narrative to encode") and shapes his six-month research and final choice to encode complexity rather than simplicity. The agonizing is visible in his weighing of three narratives and the Council's threat. However, the actual on-page filing feels decisive rather than agonized; the story tells us he agonized but shows confident action. The term appears once as setup but doesn't recur or reweight at closure, and "deliberate" or "calculate" could substitute with minimal structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sedimentary layers are signaled early (second paragraph: "sifted through sedimentary layers of collapsed archives") and recur throughout: plague graves above flood silt, fire scars beneath water lines, compression rates, thermal fracturing. The method shapes Malach's investigative tactics and the final encoding choice—he files "sediment compression rates" and other data points into the cog. The layering metaphor charges the final image ("another layer added to the city's stratigraphy of silenced voices"). The mechanics matter and constrain his conclusions, though the method could be swapped for another archaeological technique (e.g., dendrochronology) with moderate edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The sunken city appears in every beat: sewer tunnel with corpse-bloat, drowned basilica two hundred feet above, sediment and brick, the niche where Malach hides the cog. The setting pressures Malach's choices—he lives underground to access archives others burned, the patrol's approach through the tunnel triggers his urgent filing, and the sediment layers provide the evidence he encodes. The ruins supply resources (waterproofed Aristotle, phosphorescent fungus lamp, loose bricks for hiding) and the physical constraint of "two hundred feet of brick and sediment" emphasizes his isolation. Essential to stakes and closure; removal would eliminate the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After the plague ends" is established in the opening line ("three months after the plague ended") and frames the Council's motive (blame the plague alone). The timeframe enables Malach's investigation—the water has cleared, archives are accessible—and the "tonight" deadline creates modest urgency. However, the timeframe doesn't tighten decisions in a live-clock sense; Malach has had six months and "tonight" reads more as narrative framing than an on-page pressure. The aftermath setting is necessary context but relatively swappable with another post-crisis window.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Malach's desire to "preserve ancient methods" is dramatized in his opening action (examining the cog's precision), his six-month mapping project, and his final choice to encode "the method of knowing" rather than a myth. The motivation conflicts with safety—the Council executes archivists, the patrol threatens him—creating visible friction. The inscription "Tempus edax rerum" and Malach's underlined Aristotle ("philosophers had a duty to preserve method, not mythology") anchor the want in concrete objects and prior commitment. The final beat crystallizes this motivation with cost: Malach accepts erasure to preserve the cog's encoded method.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Abrasive calm is established early ("Malach didn't flinch, his calm as abrasive as the brick dust in his throat") and sustained through the patrol confrontation ("voice flat as a tidal table"). The tone modulates appropriately—urgency rises with the filing beat ("He filed faster") but never breaks into panic or sentiment. The oxymoron charges key images: "quiet rebellion," "abrasive calm of the sunken city," and Malach's flat defiance when caught. The tone is coherent across turns and supports the philosophical stance, shaping the final image's understated power. Strong integration, though "abrasive calm" as a phrase appears somewhat labelled rather than entirely embodied.</comment>
