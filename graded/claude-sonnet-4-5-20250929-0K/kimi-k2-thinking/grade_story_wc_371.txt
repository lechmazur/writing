<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and drives her choices throughout, though her interiority leans toward poetic abstraction rather than embodied contradiction. The "creeping normality noticer" frame provides a coherent lens, but her emotional progression reads smooth rather than conflicted—she moves from solitary witness to leader without visible internal cost or doubt. The congregation members remain gestural (the veteran kneeling, the daughter crying) without distinct voices or counter-pressure. The final choice to scatter breadcrumbs feels thematically resonant but lacks a foreclosed alternative that would make the renunciation or commitment felt as a tradeoff.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear Accumulative/Textural lens: Mara's repeated acts of guerrilla gardening build density until the breadcrumb ritual crystallizes as a communal act of witness. Orientation is clean (Mara, abandoned palace courtyard, post-bakery-closure winter) within the first paragraph. The closure—scattering breadcrumbs as benediction and the epilogue flash-forward—reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), where the final image reweights the dominant stake (resisting erasure through attention) with conceptual cost (the palace remains abandoned, the bakery vanished). However, the cost is asserted rather than dramatized on the page: we are told the participants find absolution and witness, but no prior live option is foreclosed by this choice, weakening the felt pressure at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The secret tea house, overgrown courtyard, and sensory details (frost-nipped streets, moss on fountains, wet earth smell) are vivid and integrated into Mara's action. The stone-hard bread and the act of crumbling it with a stone give tactile specificity that grounds the ritual. The courtyard's ivy, yew tree, and flagstone cracks constrain and enable Mara's guerrilla gardening, shaping her method and the congregation's gathering. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout, and the setting charges the final image (public garden, autumn bread offerings) without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—resisting collective forgetting—is signaled early and remains coherent. Pressure accumulates through Mara's solitary work, then deepens when she gathers witnesses and performs the breadcrumb ritual. The tightening occurs when she moves from private tending to public witness, but this shift is more additive than a true reversal or narrowing of options. No live cost appears: Mara's choice to scatter the bread does not foreclose a competing path (e.g., hoarding memory privately, confronting officials, abandoning the courtyard). The epilogue flash-forward tells us the courtyard becomes a public garden, but this resolution is presented as inevitable rather than earned through a dramatized consequence of the breadcrumb act.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The theme—ordinary things made sacred through attention, witness as sacrament—emerges organically from Mara's actions and the bread ritual. The final image (public garden, autumn bread offerings) reweights the premise without overt moralizing. However, the piece edges toward thesis statement in lines like "witnessing together was its own kind of sacrament" and "heuristically gentle persistence of those who refuse to look away," which articulate theme rather than letting the scene carry it. The breadcrumb scattering as "benediction" and "absolution" feels purposeful but borders on stated significance. The epilogue's summary distances the thematic resonance rather than letting the ritual moment stand as the final answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The narrative voice is distinct and lyric, with controlled rhythms ("crinkled like dried leaves," "whisper encouragement to struggling sprouts") and a consistent register that blends Mara's perceptual signature with poetic distance. Psychic distance is stable in third-person limited. However, certain phrases—"heuristically gentle rebellion," "tenuous absolution," "liminal space between what had been and what might be"—drift into elevated academic diction that feels authorial rather than rooted in Mara's lived idiom. The congregation members do not speak, so dialogue is absent. Free indirect style is clean, and no head-hopping occurs, but the voice occasionally prioritizes texture over immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The prose is dense with figurative language and shows strong sentence-level craft in many passages ("stone-hard...ghost of yeast and memory," "ivy had consumed the western wall"). However, several areas show template cadence and paraphrase loops: "We let it disappear. We let so many things disappear by calling it progress..." repeats structure without added pressure; "heuristically gentle" appears three times as a label without dramatization; "creeping normality...creeping erasure...Creeping normality had met its match in creeping beauty" cycles the same root metaphor. The epilogue paragraph summarizes rather than advancing, and certain high-register phrases ("liminal space," "conspiracy of silence") read as writerly overlay. Filter-verb stacks ("She'd discovered," "she'd been tending," "They'd watched") appear in sequence in the middle third, dulling immediacy. These artifacts do not obscure causality but reduce propulsion and information density.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise—guerrilla gardening as resistance to cultural amnesia—offers a fresh angle on memory and witness themes. The specific details (caraway rye, wax paper, portable burner, nasturtium seeds) ground the concept in lived texture. However, the "creeping normality noticer" frame and the sacramental witness arc follow a familiar template of solitary-witness-to-communal-ritual that has been explored widely in literary fiction. The epilogue's summary resolution (courtyard restored, bread offerings institutionalized) reads as safe wish-fulfillment rather than a bold, open-ended stance. The story transforms its materials through specificity but does not take structural or perspectival risks that would elevate originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara is named and focalized throughout. Her observation drives every beat: she notices the bakery's closure, retrieves the bread, plants seedlings, gathers witnesses, and performs the ritual. However, her "noticing" is largely internal and does not force a key on-page choice with competing alternatives. The ritual decision (to scatter breadcrumbs) is presented as natural extension rather than a turn that alters tactics or forecloses a path. She is essential to the narrative but her role trends toward witness-bearer rather than decision-maker under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The bread appears early (paragraph 2), is handled in the secret tea house scene, and becomes the centerpiece of the ritual (broken with a stone, mixed with soil, scattered). Its hardness and ghost-scent anchor memory, and its transformation from relic to offering reweights its meaning at closure. The bread drives two distinct beats (retrieval, ritual) and charges the epilogue image (autumn bread offerings). It is indispensable to the thematic and causal arc, though the epilogue's summary presentation slightly dilutes the on-page closure pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Tenuous absolution" is named explicitly twice in the text but remains a thematic claim rather than a dramatized stake. The ritual offers absolution to the participants, but no prior guilt or moral calculus is established on the page that the breadcrumb act would resolve. The concept echoes in the theme but does not constrain choices or generate cost. It is ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Heuristically gentle" appears three times as a label ("heuristically gentle rebellion," "heuristically gentle hands," "heuristically gentle art of noticing") but is never dramatized as a constraint or tradeoff. The trait describes Mara's method but does not force a visible cost—we do not see her reject a faster, harsher tactic in favor of gentleness, nor does the gentleness fail in a way that complicates her goal. It is present but replaceable with "patient" or "quiet" without structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Uncloak" appears once in the phrase "uncloaked her purpose before an unlikely congregation" and again as "Mara's guerrilla gardening had uncloaked not a conspiracy, but a conspiracy of silence." The act of revealing her purpose to the witnesses is a meaningful beat that shifts the narrative from solitary to communal, and it is tied to the thematic turn (witnessing together). However, the action is summarized rather than dramatized in scene, and the second use is a thematic echo rather than a distinct causal moment. It shapes one key turn but does not drive the closure directly.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Guerrilla gardening is signaled early (paragraph 4) and its mechanics matter throughout: Mara tucks sage seedlings into cracks, scatters nasturtium seeds, waters with rainwater, and the breadcrumb-soil mixture becomes the ritual's physical method. The gardening shapes her tactics and draws the congregation's attention, making it essential to both escalation and closure. It appears in multiple beats and is indispensable, though the epilogue's summary (courtyard becomes public garden) tells rather than shows the method's final payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The secret tea house in the overgrown palace courtyard is established early (paragraph 5) and recurs as the spatial anchor for the ritual scene. Its hiddenness enables Mara's work (officials assume the grounds are lost), and its resources (salvaged table, kettle, mismatched cups) shape the ritual's texture. The courtyard's cracks and flagstones constrain her planting, and the space charges the final image (public garden). The setting is causally active across multiple beats and essential to the story's logic and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the birds fly south" is mentioned once in the opening and recurs in the closing line ("The birds would return in spring"), creating a lyric frame. The season (winter, frost) provides atmosphere and one constraint (early frost that the seedlings survive), but the time element does not tighten decisions or create a live clock that alters tactics. It is present and purposeful as a seasonal marker but not essential to escalation or closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mara's motivation "to find the sacred in the ordinary" is stated explicitly ("her motivation was simple, or perhaps impossibly complex") and dramatized through her actions: she retrieves the bread, tends seedlings, performs the ritual. The motivation drives every choice and shapes the thematic arc. However, it is not conflicted on the page—Mara never doubts, hesitates, or faces a cost that tests this desire. The motivation is coherent and essential but lacks friction or dramatized tradeoff.</comment>
