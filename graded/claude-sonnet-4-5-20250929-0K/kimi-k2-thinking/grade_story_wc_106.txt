<question>1</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Lux remains a label-only construct throughout; "quietly savvy" is declared but never dramatized through contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Her actions trace a tourist's treasure hunt rather than genuine internal conflict—she decodes, finds, pours moonbeams, and boards a train without any foreclosed path or visible cost. The grandmother's journal and jar function as inherited props that require no struggle or renunciation. Interiority relies heavily on stock phrasing ("luminous disbelief," "destiny's door") recycled across beats without embodied emotion or character-particular texture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>No meaningful closure occurs on the page. Lux acquires the portrait, decodes it via convenient moonbeams, boards a train, and promises to chase more portraits—a serial setup rather than a Decisive Change, Resonant Reconfiguration, or Conceptual Repricing with felt cost. The "fleeting golden sunset" time constraint evaporates without consequence; she acts "swiftly" yet faces no ticking clock or price for delay. Causality is convenient: flower code, hidden panel, moonbeam inscription, and painted door all unlock in sequence without resistance,误判, or tactical trade-off. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early, but the drive lens remains ambiguous—touches of accumulative texture, causal unlocking, and situational mood never cohere into a dominant pressure that the ending can resolve.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The emerald station is anchored early with vivid repeated motifs (copper sky, emerald tiles, moonlight), and the jar of moonbeams functions as a tactile micro-object handled across multiple beats. However, the setting remains postcard atmosphere rather than a constraint that alters choice—platform three's bench and hidden compartment are discovered without spatial friction, and the station's "breathing" tiles are metaphorical decoration. The flower arrangements seed the code but do not pressure Lux's tactics; she decodes them off-page between paragraphs. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through a lyric voice, but no environmental element blocks or redirects her at a key turn.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—capture illuminated moments via portrait theft—is signaled early but never tested by meaningful opposition or cost. Lux's goal pursuit is a frictionless scavenger hunt: flower code → bench → portrait → moonbeam reveal → train, each step unlocking the next without a blocked path, tactical pivot, or visible price. The clock chimes twice as atmospheric punctuation, not as a tightening constraint that narrows options. No reversal occurs; the painted door "shimmers" open on cue when she whispers the riddle's answer, a convenience resolution rather than protagonist-driven escalation. Agency is observational—she listens, pours, decodes—never forced to renounce, endure, or choose between competing goods with on-page consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Theme gestures at destiny, illumination, and the act of translation versus theft, but relies on overt labels ("press your ear against destiny's door," "luminous disbelief," "map of illuminated moments") repeated without earned irony or reweighting. The portrait's "secret heartbeat" and the "melody of futures branching like rivers" are asserted rather than embodied in a concrete choice that forecloses one path. The final train departure and whispered instruction to moonbeams offer lyric closure but no non-literal answer or conceptual repricing—Lux confirms she will repeat the pattern forever, a thematic echo rather than a resonant shift. The grandmother's journal functions as inherited wisdom without on-page friction or counter-reading.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent—lyric, elevated, fairy-tale register with patterned repetition of signature phrases ("golden-hour portrait thief," "illuminated moments," "destiny's door"). No dialogue appears, so conversational tests do not apply. However, perceptual signature is generic rather than character-particular; Lux notices emerald tiles, moonlight, and constellations in the same poetic register across calm and peak beats without modulation under stress. Psychic distance remains stable third-close with no filter-verb stacks or head-hopping. The prose teaches its ornamental pattern early and sustains it, meeting experimental tolerance for lyric compression, but the voice does not degrade or sharpen when pressure would demand it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Paraphrase loops and template cadence pervade the text: "illuminated moments" recurs nine times, "luminous disbelief" four times, "destiny's door" five times, often in identical syntactic slots without added pressure or detail. Runs of "She [verb]" stems (lines 11–14, 20–23, 28–31) create drumbeat rhythm. The moonbeam-pouring sequence (lines 21–27) cycles through metaphor (silver thread, glow, pulse) without causal linkage—each sentence restates enchantment rather than advancing it. Filter-verb stacks ("felt," "knew," "realized") cluster in the final third, dulling immediacy. Core information density is low; many lines do decorative work (e.g., "the emerald station by moonlight stood silent, its tiled walls reflecting a mosaic of light and memory") without altering knowledge or choice. Grammar and tense are clean, but clarity suffers from synonym churn and scaffold repetition across adjacent beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The core premise—portrait thief who decodes floral messages and uses captured moonbeams—assembles fantasy furniture without a fresh synthesis or moral calculus. Tropes (secret codes, magical heirloom, painted portal, night train to the next adventure) arrive unmodified; the "quietly savvy collector" and constellation-map twist are familiar beats from treasure-hunt templates. Emotional specificity is absent—Lux's interior remains a catalog of poetic labels rather than contradictory lived experience. The transformation test fails: swap "emerald station" for "obsidian library," "moonbeams" for "starfire," and the plot and arc remain unchanged. No bold structural or perspectival risk elevates the material; the lyric voice is competent but safe, avoiding stakes that might break the enchanted mood.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Lux is present throughout and her role as portrait thief frames the quest, but her choices do not create key turns—she decodes, retrieves, and departs without a blocked path or tactical pivot. Swappable with "artifact hunter" or "relic seeker" with minor edits; the "golden-hour" and "portrait" specifics are ornamental labels rather than constraints that shape her methods or costs.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The jar appears in four beats: carried (line 4), spilled onto canvas (lines 11, 21), warmed (line 15), and tucked aboard the train (line 33), meeting the ≥2-touch threshold. It enables the moonbeam-inscription reveal (lines 21–22) and charges the final whisper (line 37), participating in closure. However, its mechanics are magical convenience—pouring light into a painted keyhole to reveal text—without cost, risk of depletion, or tactical trade-off. Early setup (+0.5) and closure linkage (+0.7) lift the score, but swappability (any enchanted light source would work) and lack of on-page cost cap it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Illuminated moments" recurs as thematic label throughout (lines 3, 12, 28, 35, 38) and frames Lux's motivation, but it does not constrain tactics or alter options on the page—she chases portraits because the concept declares she does. The brushstroke-constellation map (line 13) and painted-door reveal (lines 17, 25) are applications of the concept, yet neither forces a choice between competing interpretations or imposes cost for misreading. Functional across beats but replaceable with "fragments of destiny" or "stolen light" without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.7</grade><comment>"Quietly savvy" is mentioned once (line 3, 18) as a label but never dramatized through a visible trade-off or on-page action where caution enables success or silence costs opportunity. Her decoding and listening could be performed by any archetype; the trait does not constrain her speech, risk calculus, or final choice. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Reinterpret" appears explicitly in line 12 and drives the turn from stolen memento to celestial map, reshaping the portrait's function. This pivot enables the constellation-code discovery (line 13) and painted-door focus (line 17), affecting two beats and participating in the ending's recursive theme (line 28: "translation, turning stolen light into a map"). Early signal (+0.4), two-beat involvement (+0.9), and thematic payoff lift the score, but no cost attends the reinterpretation—she performs it successfully without误判 or foreclosed alternative reading—and "translate" or "decode" could replace it with minor phrasing edits, capping it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The flower code is set up (line 6) and decoded (line 7–8) to direct Lux to platform three, shaping one beat. Mechanics are explained: "red rose among white lilies" signals the hidden compartment. However, it does not recur or constrain later choices—once decoded, it vanishes, replaced by moonbeam and canvas mechanics. Functional but single-use; introduced early (+0.5) and affects one causal beat (+0.4), but missing middle development and closure participation cap it below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The "emerald station by moonlight" anchors all scenes and its motifs (copper-to-indigo sky, emerald tiles pulsing, clock chimes) recur across the text (lines 1, 8, 16, 19, 30). Moonlight enables the jar's glow and charges the ending (lines 34, 38). However, the setting does not constrain choice—platforms, benches, and night trains are generic quest infrastructure; Lux could perform identical actions in a moonlit archive or garden. Early setup (+0.6), repeated presence (+0.9), and closure linkage (+0.8) elevate the score, but lack of tactical pressure (no guard, locked door, or crowd to navigate) and high swappability friction (−0.6) hold it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.9</grade><comment>"Fleeting golden sunset" frames the opening (lines 1–2) and the text notes the shift to moonlight (line 19), but elapsed time is vague and imposes no deadline pressure. The station clock chimes twice (lines 19, 32) as atmospheric punctuation without altering Lux's pace or forcing a rushed choice. The "swift" action mentioned (line 20) is told, not shown through compressed syntax or a cost for delay. Timeframe is present but untracked and does not tighten decisions; replaceable with "under cover of night" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"To press your ear against destiny's door" is stated as belief (line 5), enacted literally (lines 14, 26, 33), and thematized (line 32: "listening for destiny's knock"). It shapes Lux's listening tactics across three beats and her final whisper (line 37), meeting setup, development, and closure gates. However, the desire is never conflicted or tested—no moment where listening costs her speed, safety, or certainty, and no friction between "wanting to hear destiny" and "fearing what it says." Early signal (+0.5), beat involvement (+0.9), closure linkage (+0.9), but lack of on-page friction or cost (−0.8) and swappability with "seek hidden truths" (−0.5) hold it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Luminous disbelief" recurs four times (lines 11, 25, 29, 33) and the tone of enchanted wonder remains stable across beats—no modulation under the fleeting time pressure or when the painted door opens. The final image sustains the mood ("a trace of golden hour lingering like a promise"), charging closure with consistent lyric texture. Early setup (+0.5), multi-beat presence (+0.9), and closure linkage (+0.8) support the score, but the tone does not deepen or shift when stakes would demand it (e.g., urgency, doubt, cost), and "awed wonder" could replace it with minimal edits (−0.6).</comment>
