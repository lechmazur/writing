<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ren's journey from meekness to quiet determination is traced through embodied choices—standing at council despite trembling knees, packing the rings, conducting with his hammer. The barter's emotional cost (his inheritance dissolving) lands concretely, and the shift from "meek" to "merely quiet" reads as earned. However, the interior voice occasionally drifts into elevated register ("defiance he didn't yet understand," "grief turned inside-out") that feels authored rather than lived, and the council scene's pressure remains abstract rather than dramatized with interpersonal friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The causal chain is clear: cracking arches → Ren's research → mine descent → barter → restoration. The closure lands with visible cost (the copper rings dissolve) and the arches seal, fulfilling a Decisive Change under a causal lens. The four-day mine descent compresses time but maintains forward pressure. Minor orientation slip: the "planet's quiet edge" and council location remain spatially vague in early beats, though this does not obscure the dominant stake or finale.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating arches, azure dust, mine shafts, and heart-chamber supply vivid anchor points that guide Ren's descent and shape the barter's staging. The magician's silk "lifting like a breath" in the chamber and the final image of arches "floating blue against the sky" charge the closure. Spatial choreography in the mine (spiraling deeper, fourth day, heart-chamber) is coherent. The orchards themselves remain somewhat abstract—roots and blossoms appear but the lived texture of tending them does not constrain Ren's early choices, keeping the setting functional but not fully tactical.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—saving the orchards and arches—is signaled early and tightens through the mine descent and barter. Ren's agency drives the escalation: he chooses to speak, to research, to descend, and finally to offer the rings. The barter itself narrows options with visible cost (inheritance lost, meekness transformed). The council's declaration that the orchards are "past saving" establishes opposition, but the magistrate and other voices remain off-stage abstractions rather than on-page pressure, slightly reducing the felt friction Ren must overcome.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme of resilience coaxed through barter and the transformation of meekness into deliberate strength emerges organically from Ren's actions and the recurring azure motif. The final image—arches bearing fruit "that tasted of copper and courage," hammer's clang as "azure defiance"—reweights the opening without moralizing. The line "resilience is not found, but coaxed from what we fear to lose" borders on thematic statement but is delivered as Ren's answer to the council, staying character-rooted. The barter's wisdom (trading inheritance to wake what others abandoned) resonates without platitude, though "meekness was not weakness but a different kind of strength" edges toward abstraction.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Ren throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present—his lens on the forge, the anvil, his mother's teaching—but under peak pressure in the heart-chamber, diction elevates ("grief turned inside-out," "azure and clear") beyond his established blacksmith idiom. The interior voice shifts from grounded ("his knees trembled") to literary flourish ("the color of twilight betrayed by dawn") without consistent tonal anchoring. Dialogue is absent, so naturalism and subtext bullets do not apply. Filter verbs ("He understood," "He felt") cluster in the barter sequence, dulling immediacy slightly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Information density is high and most lines advance. However, paraphrase loops appear: "meek blacksmith" / "meekness had been his shield," "the arches weren't dying, they were sleeping" / "to wake what others had abandoned," and "azure dust" recurs decoratively without functional variation. Template cadence in the mine-descent paragraph ("He found… He understood… He raised…") flattens rhythm. Mixed metaphor: "grief turned inside-out" as a sound lacks sensory coherence. The closing lines ("not meek but merely quiet, his defiance no longer a question but a fact") restate the same shift twice. Figurative density in the barter beat (silk "lifting like a breath," "streamed upward… a river of light") is vivid but borders on overwriting without pattern-teaching. Apply scaffold and loop penalty of −0.6.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The combination of meek blacksmith, magician's silk, and mine-descent barter offers a workable fantasy premise, but the arc—reluctant hero finds ancestral artifact, descends into dangerous place, makes sacrifice, saves community—follows a well-worn template without sharp transformation. The "azure defiance" motif and the specific image of copper rings dissolving provide texture, yet the emotional beats (trembling knees, mother's wisdom, emerging confident) track predictable stations. The barter mechanism (offering "what made him want to save them") gestures toward fresh stakes but resolves abstractly rather than through a non-obvious moral calculus tied to blacksmithing or forge-work that would anchor originality in Ren's craft.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Ren appears throughout and his choices (standing at council, unpacking the chest, descending, offering the rings) drive all major turns. Setup is immediate (first sentence). Development: his research and descent constrain the middle. Payoff: the barter and his transformation anchor closure. Causal pressure is strong (+1.2), closure linkage solid (+1.0), beat involvement across three phases (+1.4). Minor friction: his meekness is more labeled than shown constraining an early on-page action with visible cost (−0.3). Total band guidance: 3.0 base + 3.6 positives − 0.3 = 6.3, round to 5.8 given swappability (another reluctant craftsman could fill the role with minor edits, −0.4).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The silk is unpacked mid-story, handled in the heart-chamber, and streams upward to seal the arches at closure. Setup by second third (borderline late, −0.2). Development: it "responded to the room" and absorbed the rings, enabling the barter (+0.9 two beats). Payoff: the silk's upward stream effects the restoration (+1.2). Causal pressure moderate (+0.8), specificity moderate (its "humming" and "twilight" color are noted but do not uniquely constrain the mechanics, −0.3). Band guidance: 3.0 + 2.9 − 0.5 = 5.4, but the closure linkage is strong enough to lift into mid-6s; round to 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Bartered awakenings frames the premise: Ren offers the rings to wake the arches. Setup in the archives ("barter" named explicitly). Development: the concept shapes his choice to use the silk and rings. Payoff: the exchange completes on-page. Causal pressure moderate (+0.7), closure linkage present (+0.9). Friction: the barter is more thematic echo than on-page tactical constraint—Ren does not weigh multiple barter options or face a dilemma between competing sacrifices; the choice is presented as singular and inevitable (swappability −0.5, ornamental framing −0.4). Band guidance: 3.0 + 1.6 − 0.9 = 3.7, lifted slightly by closure presence to 5.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Quiet determination is labeled throughout ("quiet determination had always been there," "not meek but merely quiet") but rarely constrains or enables a specific on-page action with visible cost. Setup present (first paragraph "defiance he didn't yet understand"). No clear middle beat where the trait alters tactics. Payoff: the trait is asserted in the final paragraph but not dramatized as a trade-off. Label-only treatment (−0.6), no causal beat involvement (−0.4). Band guidance: 3.0 + setup 0.5 + closure mention 0.3 − 1.0 = 2.8, lifted marginally by closure assertion to 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Deliberate action is woven throughout: Ren's standing at council is hesitant, his packing "deliberate," his footfalls "deliberate," and the barter is framed as "the moment between knowing and not knowing when a meek man chose to be deliberate." Setup early (+0.6). Development: the trait shapes the mine descent and chamber approach (+0.9). Payoff: it anchors the final self-description and thematic closure (+1.0). Causal moderate (+0.7). Friction: "deliberate" as an action is abstract and repeats as label rather than embodied micro-choice with cost (swappability −0.6, label treatment −0.3). Band guidance: 3.0 + 3.2 − 0.9 = 5.3, round to 6.1 for closure linkage strength.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The abandoned mine shafts are signaled mid-story ("sealed after the last magician died"), supply the means for accessing arch-stone, and shape Ren's four-day descent. Setup by second third (−0.2 for timing). Development: the shafts' sealed state and depth create obstacle and duration (+1.0). Payoff: the heart-chamber and upward shaft enable the barter's physical execution (+1.1). Causal pressure strong (the mine is necessary, +1.0), specificity moderate (the shafts' particulars—spiraling, glittering walls—add texture but do not uniquely constrain tactics, −0.2). Band guidance: 3.0 + 3.1 − 0.4 = 5.7, round to 6.9 for necessity at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The orchard planet with floating arches frames all action: cracking arches incite the plot, the orchards are the stake, the heart-chamber stages the barter, and the restored arches provide the final image. Setup immediate (+0.8). Development: the arches' dying/sleeping state and the mine's location constrain Ren's choices (+1.2). Payoff: the sealed arches and blooming orchards anchor closure (+1.5). Causal pressure high (+1.4), irreplaceability strong (the floating-arch mechanic is unique, +0.6). Band guidance: 3.0 + 5.5 = 8.5, but the orchards themselves are not tactically engaged (no on-page tending, harvest logic, or root-access choice), reducing micro-setting impact (−0.8). Round to 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "between understanding and confusion" is named in the archives paragraph but functions as thematic label rather than live clock. Ren spends "three days in the archives" and finds the heart-chamber "on the fourth day," providing duration markers but no tactical pressure or narrowing window. Setup as theme only. No middle tightening where time alters choices. Payoff: the phrase is echoed at closure but remains abstract. Ornamental use (−0.7), no causal beat (−0.5). Band guidance: 3.0 + 0.3 − 1.2 = 2.1, lifted slightly by closure echo to 3.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Ren's desire to coax resilience is articulated in the archives ("resilience coaxed from rubble") and dramatized through his descent and barter. Setup mid-story (archives, −0.2). Development: the motivation shapes his choice to enter the mine and persist (+0.9). Payoff: the final line delivers the earned insight ("resilience is not found, but coaxed from what we fear to lose") and the arches' renewal (+1.1). Causal pressure moderate (+0.8). Friction: the motivation is more told than shown in friction—Ren does not face a competing desire that would complicate the choice (told-only bias −0.5). Band guidance: 3.0 + 2.8 − 0.7 = 5.1, lifted by strong closure articulation to 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Azure defiance threads from the opening (blue dust, "defiance he didn't yet understand") through the mine (glittering blue mineral) to the final image (arches "floating blue," hammer's clang "a song of azure defiance"). Setup immediate (+0.7). Development: the azure motif recurs as sensory anchor and thematic color (+1.0). Payoff: the tone crystallizes in the closing image and directly charges it (+1.6). Coherence strong (tone modulates from meek to defiant without contradiction, +0.8), specificity high (azure as color and concept is unique, +0.5). Band guidance: 3.0 + 4.6 = 7.6, minor friction from one mid-story dip into abstraction ("azure and clear" as sound, −0.2). Round to 7.4.</comment>
