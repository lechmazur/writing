<question>1</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Lira's "sympathetic skeptic" trait is stated early but never constrains a choice under pressure—she proceeds with the tile work without dramatized internal conflict between skepticism and belief. The fisherman remains a silent prop; his grief is asserted but not embodied through contradictory impulse or micro-choice. Motivation is told ("as deep as the ocean") rather than shown through competing wants. The final softening of skepticism reads as summary rather than earned shift with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Closure is attempted through Lira's realization that "some truths are felt, not proven," but this conceptual repricing arrives as assertion rather than dramatized pressure with on-page cost—no path is foreclosed, no tactical shift occurs. The tile "fulfills its purpose" and the tower "becomes a sanctuary" through summary rather than causal linkage; the fisherman's healing is told, not shown. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) appear early, but the drive lens wavers between accumulative (whale song mapping) and causal (tile unlocking memories) without cohering at closure. The piece reads as a sequence of declarations rather than because/therefore progression.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The open tower is anchored early and the whale migration timeframe is signaled, but setting functions mostly as backdrop—spatial details (telescope, floorboard, stone walls) do not constrain choices or supply resources under pressure. The murals and magic square tile receive vivid description yet remain static objects rather than tools that alter tactics. Micro-setting opportunity (the tile's pulse, the tower's acoustics) is mentioned but not leveraged to shape a beat or charge the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—sculpting space for the fisherman's grief—is declared early but never tested by opposition or scarcity; Lira proceeds without obstacle, and success is summarized rather than dramatized. No meaningful tightening or trade-off occurs: the tile unlocks on first attempt, the fisherman enters and is healed, and Lira's skepticism dissolves without cost. The whale migration functions as atmosphere rather than pressure; no reversal or escalation forces a higher-stakes choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theme (memory, connection, healing through art) emerges from the premise but is stated overtly in multiple lines: "some truths are felt, not proven," "the power of courageously kind acts," "all that connects us." The magic square tile and whale song offer symbolic potential, but their meaning is explained rather than charged through action. The final image ("the unheard symphony played on") gestures toward resonance but does not reweight prior material with fresh cost or insight—it reiterates the setup.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, but Lira's perceptual signature is generic: "her heart was courageously kind" and "she realized" constructions repeat without embodied texture. Diction remains consistent but lacks character-specific rhythm—sentences often begin with "She" or "The," creating template cadence. No dialogue appears. Fisherman interiority is asserted ("his silence a heavy shroud") without dramatized access, reading as distant omniscience rather than focalized perception.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Heavy paraphrase loops and synonym churn permeate the text: "transcribed the tile's memories" / "transcribe the silent symphony," "unheard symphony" recycled across twelve lines, "courageously kind" / "courage of kindness." Template cadence runs of "She [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" span most paragraphs. Stock metaphors ("his silence a heavy shroud," "grief could dissolve into starlight") appear in peak beats without fresh embodiment. Figurative language density in non-peak passages ("ocean into a restless echo chamber," "entangled memories," "timeless lullaby") blurs clarity. These artifacts touch the closure paragraph, triggering disallow-9+ and high-band caps per the artifact penalty pack.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>The premise—magic object unlocks memories to heal grief—is familiar and executed without transformation: the tile works on first attempt, the fisherman is healed through passive viewing, and Lira's arc follows a predictable skeptic-to-believer path. Whale song and star charts are mentioned but not integrated through specific, non-obvious mechanics. No bold structural or perspectival risk heightens stakes; the piece reads as a checklist assembly of required elements (sympathetic skeptic, magic square, forgotten patterns) without synthesis into a fresh whole.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>Lira as "sympathetic skeptic" is labeled early but her skepticism never constrains an on-page choice—she accepts the tile's magic immediately and proceeds without friction. The trait is present in setup and mentioned at closure ("her own skepticism softened") but does not drive a middle beat or create cost. Swappable with "curious researcher" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The magic square tile appears in setup (hidden beneath floorboard), is handled in the middle (pulsing when touched, translating numbers), and is mentioned at closure (left in its nook, "still pulsed"). However, it functions as a passive device rather than shaping choices—Lira does not struggle with its mechanics, and it unlocks memories without constraint. Present across three beats but largely ornamental; its "purpose fulfilled" is told, not dramatized through cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"Entangled memories" is a thematic label repeated throughout but never dramatized as a concrete stake or mechanic that alters options. The tile stores memories and Lira transcribes them, but how "entanglement" differs from simple recording is unexplained and does not constrain her work. Present as atmosphere, absent as causal driver.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Courageously kind" is asserted early ("her heart was courageously kind") and restated at closure ("the courage of kindness she had witnessed within herself"), but no on-page action tests the courage component—Lira faces no fear, danger, or sacrifice. Kindness is demonstrated through her project, but the "courageous" modifier is label-only. Functional but swappable with "compassionate" or "dedicated."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Transcribe" is the core action: Lira transcribes the tile's memories and whale song into murals. It appears in setup, middle (mapping patterns, painting walls), and closure (the work complete). However, the mechanics are vague—"each number translating into a fragment of sound"—and the action does not face obstacle or cost. Present across beats but largely procedural; removing "transcribe" and substituting "interpret" or "translate" would not break story logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Forgotten patterns" (whale song routes, ancient star charts) are introduced in the middle and used as Lira's method to unlock the tile. They shape one beat (mapping the routes) but the mechanics are told rather than shown, and no wrong pattern or failed attempt creates friction. The method is mentioned at closure ("forgotten patterns merged whale song with starlight") but as summary. Functional in one beat, ornamental elsewhere.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The "stargazer's open tower" is anchored early (telescope, floorboards, stone walls) and returns at closure as the transformed sanctuary. However, it supplies description rather than constraint—spatial details do not pressure choices or provide resources under stress. The tower's "open" quality is stated but not leveraged; it could be any workspace. Present in setup and closure, but largely postcard function.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"During whale migration" is mentioned in the opening and the whales' song is a recurring atmospheric element, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency—Lira works at her own pace with no deadline or seasonal pressure. The migration is backdrop rather than clock. Present but ornamental; swappable with any season.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Lira's motivation "to sculpt space for reflection for those who grieved" is stated early and drives her project across multiple beats (mapping, painting, creating the sanctuary). However, it is never dramatized through competing want or cost—she succeeds without sacrifice, and the fisherman's healing is assured. The motivation shapes the plot but lacks friction or felt trade-off. Present in setup, middle, and closure, but told rather than tested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>"Unheard symphony" as tone label recurs heavily (twelve mentions) but functions as thematic repetition rather than modulating with pressure. The tone remains soft and elegiac throughout—no cadence shift or tension spike occurs even when the fisherman enters or the tile pulses. The phrase charges the premise but not the final image, which restates rather than reweights it. Present across beats but static in effect.</comment>
