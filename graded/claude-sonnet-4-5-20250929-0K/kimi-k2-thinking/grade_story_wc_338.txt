<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elena's "methodical curiosity" and "empathy" are label-dominant rather than embodied in contradictory impulses under pressure. Her journey from studio to henge to chapel proceeds without meaningful internal conflict—no competing desires or visible struggle that would earn the final "shielded openness." The final choice to document quietly rather than proclaim is asserted as growth but not dramatized through a micro-choice that forecloses a live option with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive clearly in the opening paragraph. The closure unit—Elena framing the restored map with a silver thread marking the tear—offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (RR) that reweights "unknown becomes known through listening," but the cost remains conceptual and oblique; no visible forfeiture or tactical constraint appears on the page. The accumulative design (studio → archival whispers → site → silent footage comparison → chapel entry → framing) teaches its pattern and coheres, yet the final image feels more like thematic summary than a charged reconfiguration with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The rain-scoured fresco vault and the henge stones are vividly rendered and return with reweighted meaning at closure. The fresco's "rectangular seam" that becomes "slightly more pronounced over the years" supplies the key discovery, and Elena's tactile engagement ("pressed her palm," "feeling the textured history") grounds the moment. The micro-setting (body, tool, recurring object) test is satisfied: the fresco vault constrains the search and charges the final image when rain washes the hillside again, preserving the whispers.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reopening the silence of the whispered chapel—is signaled early and pursued methodically. One meaningful tightening occurs when Elena detects the faint outline in the footage comparison, narrowing her search to the specific fresco seam. However, the discovery lacks a visible trade-off or tactical cost; no live option is foreclosed, no resource spent, no relational or temporal price paid on the page. The accumulative pressure coheres but does not escalate through protagonist agency under duress.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The theme—"the unknown becomes known through listening"—emerges organically from the map's tear, the silent footage, and the chapel's whispered prayers. The recurring motif of silence (silent video, whispered chapel, Elena's empathic listening) reweights at closure when the rain washes the fresco yet "its whispers now heard." The final image of the silver thread marking the tear offers a non-literal answer. However, the last three paragraphs tip into mild thematic summary ("all spoke the same truth") rather than trusting the image alone, and Elena's "shielded openness" is asserted more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-person limited focalization. The perceptual signature—Elena's methodical, empathic attention to "faded ink," "textured history," and "the silence to speak"—is consistent and distinct. Diction remains controlled and voice-apt throughout. However, the prose occasionally drifts into explanatory interiority ("her methodical curiosity now tempered by a deep empathy") that tells rather than trusts the reader to infer from her actions, and the final paragraphs' cadence flattens into summary rather than maintaining the specificity of earlier beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Information density is generally high; sentence-level rhythm supports the accumulative design. However, paraphrase loops appear in adjacent lines: "She traveled to the remote site, where rain-scoured fresco vaults clung to the hillside" is immediately followed by "At the exact spot where the map's tear divided known from unknown, Elena stood before the weathered stones," restating arrival without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence runs cluster in the chapel sequence: "Elena felt," "Elena pressed," "Elena stepped," "Elena touched," "Elena closed," "Elena felt," "Elena decided," "Elena carried"—eight "Elena [verb]" stems across nine sentences in the final third (−0.6 in Q7; disallow 9+ globally per the artifact rule). The closure beat itself ("In her studio, Elena framed...") is clean, so the Non-closure Accumulation Cap applies: −0.8 total for the two distinct issues.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of map-framing, archival silence, and the whispered chapel is purposeful and emotionally coherent. The use of silent video footage comparison to find a hidden door offers a specific, non-obvious method. However, the core premise—discovering a lost sanctuary through methodical detective work and empathic interpretation—follows a widely used template (hidden relic + perceptive protagonist + methodical search + thematic payoff). The emotional arc and thematic question work unchanged with different names and places; transformation through lived detail is present but insufficient to escape the derivative guardrail (−0.8 within Q8).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Setup: present from line one. Development: Elena's perceptive trait enables the footage comparison that detects the seam (middle beat). Payoff: her final choice to document quietly rather than loudly honors the chapel's existence (closure beat). Three gates met; eligible for ≥6.1. However, her observation drives the discovery, but the key decision—to frame the map with a silver thread and document methodically—feels more like thematic summary than a choice that narrows live options with visible cost. Causal pressure is modest; the trait enables tactics but does not force a trade-off. Score: 5.2 (two-beat involvement +0.9, early signal +0.5, closure linkage +0.7, modest causal pressure +0.5, but label-only interiority −0.3, and the final choice is told rather than dramatized −0.5; swappability −0.6).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: present in paragraph four ("the rip ran precisely through the drawn stones of an ancient henge"). Development: Elena travels to the henge, stands before its stones, and the henge anchors the exact spot where the map's tear divides known from unknown. Payoff: the henge houses the whispered chapel; Elena's discovery fulfills the map's invitation. Three gates met; eligible for ≥6.1. The henge is the spatial anchor for the central stake and the container for the closure image. However, it is not handled or used in evolving ways; it functions as setting rather than object-with-agency. Score: 6.8 (early signal +0.6, two-beat involvement +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.4, but static/descriptive use −0.5, no visible cost tied to the henge itself −0.4).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setup: signaled in paragraph six ("a hidden chapel embedded within the henge's inner ring"). Development: the whispered chapel is the object of Elena's search; the silent footage comparison is motivated by the need to find it. Payoff: Elena enters the chapel, interprets its silence, and her final framing honors its whispered existence. Three gates met; eligible for ≥6.1. The concept shapes stakes throughout and charges the closure image. Score: 7.3 (early signal +0.7, three-beat involvement +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.6, but ornamental description in the chapel sequence −0.5, label-only "whispered chapel" −0.3).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Setup: present in line one ("perceptive") and paragraph five ("methodical curiosity"). Development: the trait motivates the silent footage comparison ("her methodical curiosity drove her to seek a record of the past"). Payoff: "her methodical curiosity now tempered by a deep empathy" appears in the chapel, and the final report is described as "methodical." Three gates met; eligible for ≥6.1. However, the trait is label-dominant across all beats; no on-page action shows Elena constrained or enabled by methodical curiosity with a visible trade-off. Score: 4.8 (early signal +0.6, two-beat involvement +0.9, closure linkage +0.9, but label-only −0.6, no visible cost −0.8, swappability −0.6).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: the map's tear is present in paragraph three; the action "reopen" is signaled in paragraph eight ("Elena felt a quiet urgency to reopen that silence"). Development: the footage comparison reopens the search, and Elena physically reopens the doorway in paragraph seventeen. Payoff: the final framing explicitly marks "the place where her journey had reopened the world." Three gates met; eligible for ≥6.1. The action "reopen" drives two major turns (discovery of the seam, physical entry) and charges the closure image. Score: 7.6 (early signal +0.7, three-beat involvement +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.5, but late first physical use −0.3, modest cost −0.3).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: signaled in paragraph eleven ("silent video footage archived from a 1970s excavation" and "recent drone recordings"). Development: the method is dramatized in paragraphs thirteen–fifteen; Elena aligns frames and detects the seam. Payoff: the discovery enables entry; the method is not present in the closure image itself but causally shapes it. Three gates met; eligible for ≥6.1. The mechanics matter and the method is irreplaceable. Score: 6.4 (early signal +0.6, two-beat involvement +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage indirect +0.5, specificity +0.7, but summary-only in final third −0.4, no visible cost tied to the method itself −0.5).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: present in paragraph nine ("rain-scoured fresco vaults clung to the hillside"). Development: the fresco vault is the site of the seam discovery (paragraph fifteen); Elena presses against it to reopen the doorway (paragraph seventeen). Payoff: Elena touches "the rain-scoured fresco vault above" in the chapel, and the final paragraph notes "the fresco remained, its whispers now heard." Three gates met; eligible for ≥6.1. The setting constrains the search, supplies the discovery, and charges the closure image when rain washes it again. Score: 7.8 (early signal +0.7, three-beat involvement +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.7, micro-setting that alters tactics +0.6, but modest cost −0.4).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Setup: the map's tear "dividing known from unknown" is present in paragraph three. Development: "At the exact spot where the map's tear divided known from unknown, Elena stood" (paragraph ten). Payoff: the closure image references "the place where her journey had reopened the world." Three gates met; eligible for ≥6.1. However, the timeframe is spatial metaphor (the spot) rather than a live clock or temporal constraint. No deadline, urgency, or passage of time alters tactics. Score: 4.1 (early signal +0.4, two-beat involvement +0.9, closure linkage +0.8, but metaphoric rather than temporal −1.0, no cost tied to time −0.6, swappability −0.8).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Setup: "to listen with empathy to the voices that had been erased" (paragraph eight). Development: Elena's empathy is invoked repeatedly ("methodical curiosity now tempered by a deep empathy," "allowing the silence to speak, interpreting its emptiness"). Payoff: the final report "honored the chapel's whispered existence" and Elena "carried the silence with her...each line drawn with empathy." Three gates met; eligible for ≥6.1. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized in conflicted choices; no on-page friction between empathy and competing wants. Score: 5.6 (early signal +0.6, three-beat involvement +1.4, closure linkage +1.0, but label-only −0.6, no visible cost or friction −0.8, summary-only −0.4).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setup: "shielded openness" is not signaled until paragraph twenty-four ("a shielded openness that would guide her future maps"). Development: the tone of careful reverence and methodical discovery is consistent through the middle beats. Payoff: the final paragraph maintains the tone ("shielded openness") and modulates into quiet closure ("a thin silver thread...marking the place"). Two gates met (development, payoff); eligible up to ~6.0. The tone coheres and charges the final image with restrained wonder. Score: 6.1 (two-beat involvement +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, coherence through turns +0.8, cadence shift at end +0.5, but late label introduction −0.5, lyric reprise allowance applied +0.3, label-only mention −0.3).</comment>
