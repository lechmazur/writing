<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interior transformation is traced through embodied thermal patterns rather than articulated thought, showing contradictory impulses (grief vs. hope) acting simultaneously. The mid-story shift from passive survivor to active collaborator demonstrates agency, though the final choice feels more like acceptance than a decision with visible cost. Professor Chen remains a facilitator without his own pressure or arc. The emotional progression from "jagged reds of early trauma" to "softer hues" reads somewhat mechanically—closer to summary than lived contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the installation builds through repeated acts of thermal mapping until the final image (tuning fork case pressed to heart) reweights the opening trauma. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis)—Mara accepts permanent silence and discovers meaning in bodily heat-mapping. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. One persistent constraint (the lost voice/hearing) shapes all tactics. The final "deeper frequency" line borders on stating theme rather than letting the image do the work, but the leather-bound book and tuning fork case anchor the closure with tangible cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory as damaged refuge charges every beat: fractured prisms, frozen fountain, warped floorboards become surfaces for thermal touch. The tuning fork case—velvet-lined, unharmed amid destruction—functions as micro-setting that constrains choice and returns in the final image. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through Mara's new silence: she feels vibration, watches color bloom on screens, experiences the conservatory's cold. Spatial choreography (entrance, path of panels, stations) remains coherent throughout the installation sequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—translating silence into meaning after catastrophic loss—is signaled early and tightens through the collaborative installation process. One meaningful deepening occurs when private thermal experiments become public exhibition, raising the cost of exposure. The final night's leather-bound book reveals transformation chronologically, showing "jagged reds" incorporating "softer hues." Agency reads as acceptance and endurance rather than decision; Mara's collaboration with Chen and the choice to exhibit are narrated more than dramatized as turning points with visible tradeoffs in the moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (music exists between sound and silence; survival creates new forms of expression) emerges through concrete particulars: tuning fork vibrations, thermal blooms, the heat-sensitive installation. The final image of the tuning fork case pressed to heart answers the central question without moralizing. "The ocean had taken something permanent...replacing words with an endless internal roar" and the closing "landscape of survival itself" risk stating theme, but the thermal-mapping methodology grounds abstraction in physical process. The chronologically arranged thermal maps function as a earned visual motif that reweights early trauma.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Mara's sensory deprivation: perception narrows to vibration, visual pattern, and touch. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during memory beats (ferry capsizing, mother's face). The prose carries a distinct texture—"winterglass," "phantom thunder in her skull," "thermal signature of feeling made visible"—that feels purposeful rather than ornamental. Professor Chen's notepad communication ("Your body still sings, even if your voice cannot") reads slightly expository but maintains diegetic logic. No head-hopping; filter verbs ("feeling," "watching") fit the sensory-translation focus.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high: most lines advance character state, world detail, or thematic image. The opening sentence establishes voice, setting, and damage in one move. Minor loops appear: "the ocean had taken something permanent" / "the ocean had silenced her" restate without added pressure. "Silently expressive" and "unshaken marvels" feel like prompt-element insertions with elevated diction that doesn't quite match the surrounding register. Stock phrases cluster: "bloomed across her skin," "beautiful wreckage," "deeper frequency" trend generic in peak beats. Paragraph structure varies; no major grammatical errors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The thermal-mapping-as-music premise offers a fresh angle on trauma-and-art-making, transforming the "survivor finds expression" template through specific methodology (infrared emotion capture, heat-sensitive panels). The winterglass conservatory and single surviving tuning fork create a coherent symbolic system. Risk: the piece commits to sensory translation without retreat. However, the progression follows a predictable arc—trauma, refuge, collaboration, public installation, acceptance—and the final insight ("music existed in the spaces between sound and silence") articulates rather than dramatizes the realization. The thermal colors (purples, gold, pink) function but don't surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara (capsize survivor) drives the piece, but her key turns—discovering the tuning fork, agreeing to collaborate, mounting the installation—occur mostly in summary. The opening establishes survivor status; the final image shows her transformed stance. Middle beats narrate collaboration rather than dramatize micro-choices under pressure. Present in setup and closure; middle development is recounted.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The tuning fork case appears in three beats: discovery amid ruins (paragraph 2), struck against palm (paragraph 2), pressed to heart in the final image. The velvet lining and "unharmed amid destruction" status matter thematically. The final reprise ("pressed the tuning fork case to her heart, feeling its solid weight, its unshaken presence") reweights prior mentions. Could be replaced by the tuning fork itself with minor edits; the case's containment function is noted but not causally tested.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Unshaken marvels" appears once as a phrase (paragraph 4) describing emotional patterns that survive catastrophe. The concept resonates thematically—trauma coexists with hope—but doesn't shape on-page choices or tactics. It's claimed rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting in scene. Ornamental language that supports theme without constraining action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Silently expressive" appears as a descriptor (paragraph 4: "patterns were silently expressive") for the thermal images. The attribute fits the premise but doesn't enable or constrain a choice with visible cost. The installation's success depends on silence being expressive, yet this is told rather than tested against skepticism or failure. Present in development; no closure cost tied to the trait itself.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Rectify" appears once (paragraph 4): "they began to rectify what the accident had broken." The sentence signals collaboration but the action could be replaced with "heal," "repair," or "transform" without structural change. The thermal-mapping work that follows is the causal engine; "rectify" names it without unique mechanical properties. Functional but swappable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Heat-mapping emotions (infrared photography of thermal patterns) is introduced in paragraph 3, demonstrated across paragraphs 4–6, and shapes the entire installation methodology. The mechanics matter: Mara touches surfaces, Chen photographs, screens display color. The method enables the public exhibition and charges the final leather-bound book of thermal maps. Early signal, beats involvement (discovery, private sessions, public installation), and closure linkage (chronological maps reveal transformation). Essential to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The winterglass conservatory is present in every beat: fractured walls, frozen fountain, warped floorboards provide surfaces for thermal touch; the damaged refuge explains Mara's repeated presence; the installation uses the space's heat-sensitive panels. The setting supplies both emotional resonance (beauty in wreckage) and physical resources (the conservatory becomes the exhibition venue). Environment constrains and enables: "not despite its damage but because of it." Setup, development, and closure participation with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After noise becomes impossible" frames the entire narrative—Mara's deafness is the inciting condition. The timeframe is signaled ("three weeks prior," "most afternoons," "as winter deepened," "final night") and tightens toward the installation's close. The pressure is accumulative rather than urgent; no ticking clock forces choices in the moment. Present throughout; constrains all action (she cannot hear); closure shows acceptance. Development is steady rather than escalating.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation (translate silence into music) is stated in the final paragraph and demonstrated through thermal-mapping collaboration. Mara's desire is shown through repeated acts (striking the tuning fork, pressing hands to panels) but not conflicted on the page—no moment where she doubts the project or weighs its cost against privacy or grief. The want aligns with outcome without visible friction. Told more than tested; present in action but not dramatized as difficult choice.</comment>
