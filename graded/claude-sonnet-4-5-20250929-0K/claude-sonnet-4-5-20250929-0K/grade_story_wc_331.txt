<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Cordelia's motivation is clear and her quirks (prime-number hours, hyperbolic mapping) are grounded in consistent worldview. Internal contradiction appears when she wrestles with theory yet remains distant as "documentarian," but the contradictory impulses don't act simultaneously in scene—her walk-and-whisper ritual unfolds without visible cost or refusal. The final smile observes rather than chooses, leaving no path foreclosed on the page. Backstory (grandmother's scarf) anchors concretely but occupies roughly 15% without altering a present micro-choice beyond mood.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches its pattern early (prime hours, curved space, analog memory accumulating) and deepens through Cordelia's ritual walk, which thickens atmosphere and bends lamplight. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the library "remembers itself," patrons feel it, and the final image crystallizes the pocket dimension where "science and story shared the same strange, beautiful space." Cost is conceptual—boundaries soften, reality warps—felt in the graduate student's startled whisper and the scarf growing warm. The piece holds its lens cleanly, orientation anchors early, and one meaningful tightening (the walk at 4:17 AM) reweights the dominant stake. No causality breaks.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The library's hyperbolic architecture (1889, Lobachevsky-and-Poe architect, corridors that double back) is established early and constrains Cordelia's theory. The scarf functions as micro-setting object: she trails it as "measuring line in curved space," it grows warm at closure, anchoring the final beat. Sensory detail is selective (lavender, paper dust, lamplight pooling in impossible corners) and filtered through Cordelia's scholarly POV. Spatial choreography is coherent; the three patrons remain placed in atrium, reading corner, and topology textbook positions. The architecture charges the ending by enabling the "reawakening."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (find the place where stories live) is signaled early and pursued through hyperbolic mapping. One meaningful tightening: Cordelia's ritual walk at 4:17 AM raises atmospheric pressure and the graduate student's question confirms the shift. Cost is conceptual and relational—reality bends, isolation deepens into shared solitude—legible when the scarf warms and the library "breathes." No off-stage resolution; the pocket dimension manifests on the page. Agency is attention and enactment (the walk, the whispered equations) rather than decision, fitting the Accumulative lens. Pressure coheres under that lens and the final image reweights the library's nature.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (stories have physical location in curved memory-space) emerges from events and the scarf-as-topology conceit without meta-commentary. The ending offers a non-literal answer: the library always was the place where stories live, accessible through "precise mathematics of wonder." No moralizing; the final image (prime-number closure, pocket dimension, Cordelia's smile) reweights prior material. Subtext operates in silence (observed patrons, tender distance) and the scarf's warmth. Analog memories accumulate pressure organically. The piece resists tidy binaries and invites reflection through purposeful ambiguity (is the reawakening literal or perceptual?).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited with stable distance; Cordelia's perceptual signature is scholarly and particular (topology, Lobachevsky, hyperbolic planes). Diction matches her POV ("sanely eccentric," "documentarian," "membrane of ordinary space"). One brief dialogue exchange ("Do you feel that?") serves witness function without subtext demand at this length. Psychic distance shifts purposefully (close on scarf memory, mid-distance on patrons). No head-hopping. Syntax modulates with pressure: short declaratives at the walk ("The air thickened. The lamplight bent strangely.") charge the climax. Free indirect style is clean. Voice is distinct but leans into elevated register throughout, which fits character yet risks monotony under peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, figurative language is dense but coherent (curves, wells, membrane, hyperbolic planes), and information density is high. Minor paraphrase loop: "She understood. She was searching too" restates without added pressure (−0.2). Template cadence in opening: "They came... She watched... She understood..." uses similar stems across three beats (−0.4). No filter-verb stacks or clarity breaks. Sentence openings vary after the setup. Metaphors are consistent (geometry as emotional architecture). Proofreading is clean. The elevated diction (villanelles, iambic pentameter, Lobachevsky) matches POV but remains uniform across stress levels, dulling immediacy slightly. Overall propulsion is strong; the walk sequence accelerates cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis (scientific poetry library + hyperbolic geometry + analog memory topology) is specific and non-obvious. Prime-number hours and the scarf as measuring line feel particular to Cordelia's voice. The 1889 architect detail (Lobachevsky and Poe) transforms the haunted-library trope through geometric grounding. Emotional truth (solitude as shared space, grief encoded in objects) avoids generic templates. The final reconfiguration (library remembering itself) grows from established architecture and the scarf ritual, earning hindsight inevitability. Risk (abstract concept dramatized through sensory accumulation) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece commits fully to its premise and resists safety hedging. No proximity to famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Cordelia is present throughout, frames the stake early (finding story-space), and her ritual walk at 4:17 AM drives the central beat. Her smile at closure observes the outcome but does not alter tactics or foreclose a path; she enacts rather than decides. Two gates (setup, payoff cameo) with middle development (the walk) present but not choice-driven. +0.8 early signal, +0.4 one beat, +0.5 causal (the walk enables the reawakening), +0.3 closure linkage (she smiles, knowing). −0.5 swappability (another eccentric curator could perform similar ritual). Final: 3.0 base +2.0 positives −0.5 friction = 4.5, round down to 4.5; adjust to 6.2 for beat involvement and closure presence under Accumulative lens where enactment counts.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The scarf appears in three beats: backstory anchor (grandmother physicist, lavender/paper smell), ritual use (trailing along shelves as measuring line), and closure charge (grows warm). Early signal, distinct beats, causal (enables topological measurement), closure linkage (warmth confirms shift), specific properties (analog memory, crimson-to-rose fade) matter. Three gates met. +0.8 early, +0.9 two beats, +1.2 causal, +1.2 closure, +0.6 specificity = base 3.0 +4.7 = 7.7, round down to 7.7; adjust to 7.8 for irreplaceability (no other object encodes grandmother's physics love-letters).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Analog memories (scarf, typewriter poems, fountain-pen equations, candlelight margin notes) are signaled early, shape Cordelia's theory (topology of memory), and frame the dominant stake. The concept enables the ritual (analog objects pool in hyperbolic curves) and is present at closure ("accumulated weight... pressing against the membrane"). Three gates met. +0.8 early, +0.9 two beats (theory formation, ritual payoff), +1.0 causal (concept enables topology walk), +1.0 closure (analog memories reawaken library). −0.4 some swappability (digital/analog binary is familiar). Base 3.0 +3.7 −0.4 = 6.3, round down; adjust to 6.4 for specificity (lavender scent, typewriter keys).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Sanely eccentric" is labeled early (prime hours, hyperbolic mapping) and demonstrated through ritual walk. The trait enables the action (only an eccentric would map shelves hyperbolically) and is consistent. Two gates (setup, development). +0.7 early, +0.4 one beat (walk), +0.8 causal (trait enables ritual). −0.3 label-only in places ("sanely eccentric" phrase itself). Base 3.0 +1.9 −0.3 = 4.6, round down; adjust to 5.8 for visible tradeoffs (her isolation, patrons' solitude).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Reawaken" appears at midpoint ("attempt to reawaken what she suspected had always been dormant") and frames the ritual walk. The action drives the climax (air thickens, lamplight bends, library breathes) and closure (library remembering itself). Three gates met. +0.5 mid-story signal, +0.9 two beats (attempt, manifestation), +1.4 causal (the walk enacts reawakening), +1.4 closure (reawakening completes). −0.3 slight swappability (discover, unlock). Base 3.0 +4.2 −0.3 = 6.9, round down; adjust to 7.1 for specificity (verb matches library-as-memory conceit).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Hyperbolic geometry is signaled early (Lobachevsky, non-Euclidean planes, curved spaces) and explained in Cordelia's theory. The method shapes the ritual (scarf as measuring line, corridors that double back) and is present at closure (curved spaces where meaning dwells). Three gates met. +0.8 early, +0.9 two beats (theory, walk), +0.8 causal (geometry enables mapping). −0.6 mechanics remain abstract (no on-page constraint from hyperbolic vs. Euclidean choice). Base 3.0 +2.5 −0.6 = 4.9, round down; adjust to 5.3 for thematic resonance (geometry-as-metaphor charges ending).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The Scientific Poetry Library is established early (treatises as sonnets, astronomical villanelles, mathematical iambic pentameter), pressures Cordelia's theory (where do these hybrid texts live?), and supplies the hyperbolic architecture (1889 Lobachevsky-Poe design, doubling corridors). Setting enables the ritual (shelves as planes, atrium as anchor) and charges closure (pocket dimension manifests here). Three gates met. +0.8 early, +1.4 three beats (theory, architecture reveal, reawakening), +1.4 causal, +1.6 closure. Base 3.0 +5.2 = 8.2, round down; slight −0.3 for postcard detail (villanelles, sonnets catalog). Final 7.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Time anchors open (2:47 AM) and close (11:03 AM, "another prime number"), frames the ritual walk at 4:17 AM, and patrons settle into "deepest concentration" before Cordelia acts. Two gates (setup, payoff mention). +0.7 early, +0.4 one beat (4:17 walk), +0.4 closure mention. −0.5 time does not tighten tactics (Cordelia chooses when to act; no external clock pressure). Base 3.0 +1.5 −0.5 = 4.0, round down; adjust to 4.8 for thematic fit (prime boundaries matter to Cordelia's worldview).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Motivation ("find the place where stories live") is stated early, drives Cordelia's theory and ritual, and is fulfilled at closure ("place where stories lived had been here all along"). Three gates met. +0.8 early, +0.9 two beats (theory, walk), +1.0 causal, +1.0 closure. −0.4 friction between want and cost is implied (isolation, years of work) but not dramatized as visible trade-off on the page. Base 3.0 +3.7 −0.4 = 6.3, round down; adjust to 6.9 for desire embodied in scarf ritual and final smile.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tone (observed solitude) is established early ("tender distance of a documentarian," patrons in separate orbits) and modulates at the walk (air thickens, silence charged) without breaking. The final image ("observed, solitary patrons... each found their own way into the curves") reprises and reweights solitude as shared access to the pocket dimension. Three gates met. +0.8 early, +0.9 two beats (observation, ritual), +1.2 closure (tone charges final image). Base 3.0 +2.9 = 5.9, round down; adjust to 7.4 for coherent modulation (detachment → warm recognition) that supports Accumulative lens.</comment>
