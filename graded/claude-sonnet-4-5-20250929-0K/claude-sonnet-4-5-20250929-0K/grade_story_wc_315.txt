<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vera's interior life is concrete and embodied—the parachute buckle, muscle memory, jaw tightening—grounding her resistance to Command's pressure. The contradiction between her need to please Ground and her commitment to truth creates genuine internal conflict that drives the climax. Minor issue: the predecessor's breakdown is summarized rather than felt through Vera's present fear, slightly weakening the stakes. The final choice to hold her ground feels earned by prior causality with visible cost (isolation, career risk).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Vera's refusal to revise her report and Command's subsequent validation reweight her observer role from questioned to recognized, with visible cost (twenty minutes of defended stance, isolation above the clouds). The causal lens holds throughout—radio contact triggers doubt, which triggers her memory of the predecessor's failure, which triggers her defense. Orientation is swift (radio call at 2:47 AM, observation platform, three months stationed). One meaningful tightening when Command herself joins the call raises stakes decisively.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The nocturnal arbor is vivid and purposeful: bioluminescent trails, glass dome observatory, clouds as "silver sea" create a coherent sensory world. The parachute buckle's tactile weight and the notepad's muscle-memory use ground the micro-setting effectively. The arbor's indifference—"constant in its ancient rhythms"—charges the final image by contrasting human doubt with natural certainty. Spatial choreography is clean throughout (platform above clouds, trees through troposphere).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve observational integrity vs. Command's doubt) is signaled at the first radio exchange and tightens meaningfully when Command herself enters. Vera's agency—choosing to defend her notation system rather than comply—forecloses the path of easy agreement with visible cost (professional tension, isolation). The predecessor's fate provides a clear alternative she refuses, sharpening the choice. Escalation is driven by protagonist decision under causal pressure; the cost (standing alone against institutional doubt) is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of solitary witness and institutional trust emerges organically from the conflict without direct statement. The parachute buckle and muscle memory motifs recur with shifting weight (survival → certainty), charging the final image. However, "the watcher's burden" is named twice in near-identical phrasing, edging toward label rather than dramatized cost. The ending offers a resonant answer (bearing witness requires refusing to flinch) without moralizing, though "preserved trust by refusing to abandon truth" leans slightly expository.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is distinct: Vera notices light patterns, muscle memory, the buckle's edges biting skin—details filtered through her observer role. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; Command's measured "Walk me through your notation system again" carries subtext of potential belief. Psychic distance remains stable throughout. Minor slip: "soundless echo" in paragraph three reads slightly precious for the established voice, though it recovers quickly. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clean with strong propulsion. Information density is high: "parachute buckle against her palm—a talisman from her first descent, when everything had gone wrong" does three jobs efficiently. Minor loop: "the watcher's burden" appears twice in near-identical construction without added pressure. Template stem: "She'd been stationed... she'd been attentively inventive... she'd held it" runs a "she'd been/held" pattern across key beats. No figurative muddle; rhythm varies appropriately. Closure image is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The nocturnal arbor concept is fresh—trees breaking through the troposphere with bioluminescent communication—and the protagonist's role as solo pattern decoder offers a non-obvious angle on observer-authority conflict. However, the "lone expert defends truth against institutional doubt" frame is familiar, and the story executes it well without fully transforming it. The muscle-memory notation system adds specificity. Risk is moderate; the piece stays within earned territory without bold structural deviation.</comment>
