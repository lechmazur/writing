<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The vine dresser's motivation is concrete and embodied through her ritual with the marbles, each polishing commemorating a transformation from deception to mastery. Her interiority shows through physical action rather than exposition, with contradictory impulses visible in her steady voice while her hands "polished faster." Marcus functions cleanly as witness-participant; his arc from seeking validation in measurements to recognizing unmeasurable truth is earned through observation and the garden's response. Minor slip: the vine dresser's backstory arrives in exposition rather than fragmented discovery, though it tilts her present stance effectively.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Orientation anchors within the first paragraph (maze's heart, morning after announcement, Marcus's score). The dominant lens reads as Accumulative/Textural with situational pressure: the vine dresser's ritual and story accumulate to reweight Marcus's initial stake (his negative-seven score) through the garden's impossible blooming/withering that demonstrates her unmeasurable relationship. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing: Marcus stands among the polished marbles while "the garden bloomed and withered around him, keeping its own measurements"—the Institute's quantification is reweighed against cultivated truth. The cost is conceptual but undeniable: his score remains unchanged, yet its authority is dismantled. One meaningful deepening occurs when the garden's simultaneous seasons are revealed as response rather than backdrop.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The maze functions as active constraint: its "walls of hornbeam and yew forming passages that shifted with the seasons" and the path that "opened before her like water parting for a stone" at closure. Impossible blooming (lavender in November, spring crocuses through autumn mulch) charges the final image by making the garden's knowledge concrete. The marbles on velvet, fountain with crimped pipes, and potting shed anchor the vine dresser's lived-in relationship. Spatial choreography holds (maze heart, scattered marbles, paths). The simultaneous seasons are filtered through Marcus's witness-POV and escalate from atmospheric to proof.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Marcus seeks understanding of his negative-seven score and what it means for the damned. Pressure tightens when the vine dresser's ritual reveals an alternate measurement system (the garden's response to her presence) that cannot be quantified, forcing Marcus to choose between the Institute's authority and lived proof. The garden's impossible blooming/withering operates as both complication and evidence, raising conceptual cost. One meaningful deepening: the marbles shift from curiosity to proof that "some truths can't be quantified, only cultivated." The vine dresser's agency (polishing, arranging, walking into the maze) drives escalation. Cost is visible in Marcus's stance among the marbles as hierarchies crumble around him.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the marble ritual and garden's response rather than statement: quantification versus cultivation, institutional measurement versus embodied knowledge. The cracked marbles function as charged recurrence—first as husband's deceptions, then as commemorations that "mend the deception that I didn't belong to this soil." No moralizing; the ending offers a non-literal answer through the garden blooming/withering in its own metrics. The wisteria dying overnight and the path opening "like water parting for a stone" carry subtext about recognition and belonging. Complexity holds: the Institute's measurement isn't dismissed but revealed as incomplete, and the vine dresser's victories required three years of searching for crimped pipes—truth through endurance, not revelation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited through Marcus. Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during his initial statement about the score, pulling back to witness the vine dresser's ritual, tightening again at "understanding dawning like light through leaves." Her dialogue carries distinct pragmatic texture ("wisely pragmatic as always") without therapy-speak; the exposition about her husband's deceptions risks summary but remains anchored to present marble-polishing. Perceptual signature: Marcus notices the garden's impossible simultaneity because he's seeking answers about measurement. Diction stays consistent; no filter-verb stacks or register drift. The vine dresser's voice distinguishes through economy and certainty: "Every polished marble...mends the deception." Brief passive constructions ("were my husband's," "had been designing") serve backstory compression without momentum loss.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies effectively: short declaratives during revelation ("You're measuring something else"), longer descriptive sentences for the garden's impossible blooming. Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (the wisteria dying overnight anchors time and foreshadows the garden's knowledge). One paraphrase near-loop: "He'd been designing the maze to disorient me" followed by "Making me believe I had no instinct" restates without adding pressure, triggering −0.2. Figurative language ("light through leaves," "water parting for a stone") charges beats without overwriting. The marble descriptions risk ornamental density but each ties to a specific deception. Sentence openings vary; no template cadence. Minor scaffolding in the husband's notebook exposition could tighten, but it doesn't obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The core premise—luck quantification meets garden knowledge—offers a fresh synthesis that avoids writing-prompt genericism through the marble ritual's specificity. The transformation of cracked marbles from evidence of lies into proof of belonging is non-obvious and earned. Risk: the impossible blooming/withering could read as magical-realism convenience, but it's framed as the garden's response to recognition, constrained by the vine dresser's three-year search for the crimped pipe. The ending resists explaining how the garden knows, trusting image over mechanism. Minor proximity concern: "gardens know their gardeners" as thesis risks abstraction, but it's dramatized through the path opening and seasonal simultaneity. The luck-measurement frame feels slightly template (Institute breakthrough, scored hierarchies) but transforms through the counter-measurement enacted on the page.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The vine dresser appears in the opening beat, her polishing action frames the entire encounter, her backstory revelation narrows Marcus's options, and her walk into the maze at closure demonstrates the garden's knowledge. Her decision to commemorate rather than merely grieve transforms deception into proof and drives the thematic turn. Cost is visible: three years searching for the crimped pipe, the marble collection as permanent record. Irreplaceability high; her specific history with the garden creates the proof Marcus witnesses. All three gates met with strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The marbles appear in the opening image, anchor the middle exposition (each tied to a specific deception), are arranged in spiral ceremony mid-scene, and remain as Marcus stands among them at closure. They evolve from curiosity to commemoration to proof, with each handling (polishing, positioning "three times," arranging with thyme sprigs) adding pressure. Reweighted meaning at closure: scattered cracked marbles become evidence that "some truths can't be quantified, only cultivated." Cost connection: each represents a specific lie transformed through labor. High irreplaceability; the cracks function as both record and transformation.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Mended deception" shapes the dominant stake: the husband's lies were mended with further lies, and the vine dresser mends those deceptions through commemoration that proves her garden knowledge. It constrains middle tactics (she must explain each marble's origin to demonstrate the pattern) and charges closure (Marcus recognizes "every polished marble...mends the deception that I didn't belong to this soil"). The concept alters options: Marcus's negative-seven score is reframed as a mended deception about what can be measured. Visible cost: three years finding the crimped pipe, permanent marble collection.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Wisely pragmatic" is signaled in the opening third ("wisely pragmatic as always") and demonstrated through her steady voice while hands polish faster, her matter-of-fact recounting of betrayals, and her refusal to engage Marcus's Institute anxiety. It enables one key action: she transforms marbles (pragmatic objects) into ceremonial proof rather than discarding them in bitterness or clinging to grief. The trait constrains her rhetoric—no emotional ventilating, just fact and demonstration. Modest cost visibility: her pragmatism required enduring three years of gaslighting before acting. Present in closure stance but not explicitly named there. Mid-band ceiling due to label-reliance and single-beat demonstration.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Polish" appears in the opening line, recurs during the marble exposition, and charges the final image: "every polished marble...mends the deception." The action is irreplaceable—not mere cleaning but ceremonial transformation that takes repetition and care. It drives the middle revelation (each polishing commemorates a victory) and enables closure (the polished collection proves accumulated knowledge). Swappability test: "cleaned" or "kept" would lose the connotation of patient, repeated labor that mirrors garden cultivation. Cost: time and ritual attention across years. All gates met with strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Commemorating small victories elaborately" is signaled early (polishing that catches light, adjusting marble position three times) and demonstrated through the spiral arrangement with thyme sprigs. The method shapes middle tactics: each marble requires story and placement, creating the accumulative proof. It charges closure by leaving Marcus among the elaborately arranged collection while the garden itself performs elaborate simultaneity. Mechanics matter: the threefold positioning and botanical offerings mirror the garden's response. Modest cost: the ritual takes time and emotional labor. Not swappable with "remembering" or "recording"—the elaboration is the point. Missing explicit payoff in final action but present in final image.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The garden maze appears in opening orientation, supplies the impossible blooming/withering that demonstrates unmeasurable knowledge, and opens its path for the vine dresser at closure "like water parting for a stone." It constrains choices: Marcus sought the maze to understand his score, the layout reflects the husband's manipulation, the sections the vine dresser walked past most frequently shaped the deception. The maze actively responds—shifting passages, opening/closing for recognition. Irreplaceability high; no other setting could demonstrate "gardens know their gardeners" as premise and proof simultaneously. All gates met with strong causal and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After luck becomes measurable" anchors the opening ("morning after the Institute announced its luck-measurement breakthrough") and creates urgency: society has shattered into "numbered hierarchies" with "the fortunate strutting, the cursed hiding." It tightens Marcus's need (he's scored negative-seven and seeks answers now, not later). The timeframe enables the thematic contrast—quantification has just arrived, so the counter-evidence is fresh. Modest cost: Marcus must act while the score's authority is peak. Missing: no ticking clock that alters tactics mid-scene, no deadline pressure. Present at setup and thematically relevant to closure, but not tracked or leveraged for escalation. Lyric reprise: "after" creates before/after but doesn't constrain the encounter's unfolding.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The vine dresser's desire "to prove that gardens know their gardeners" drives her marble ritual, her exposition of the husband's sabotage, and her walk into the maze that demonstrates the garden opening for her. Friction: proving requires patient accumulation (three years, multiple commemorations) against Marcus's need for immediate understanding. The motivation is dramatized through action (polishing, arranging, walking) rather than stated until the penultimate exchange. Cost is visible: she must relive each deception to transform it. The motivation shapes closure directly—her walk is the proof enacted. All gates met with strong causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Blooming withering" operates as compound tone throughout: wisteria dies overnight in the opening, lavender blooms in November, spring crocuses through autumn mulch, maple leaves on summer daisies. The simultaneity modulates from atmospheric oddity to evidence to closure charge: "the garden bloomed and withered around him, keeping its own measurements." Tone coherence: creation and decay as inseparable, recognition and loss intertwined (the husband's deceptions, the vine dresser's victories). It charges the final image by making contradictory states coexist as proof rather than confusion. Irreplaceable; no single-mood descriptor could carry the same conceptual weight.</comment>
