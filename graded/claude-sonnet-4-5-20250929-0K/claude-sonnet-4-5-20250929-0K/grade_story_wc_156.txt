<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lena's interiority is concrete and consistently filtered through her restorer's lens ("methodically playful," mixing pigments as conversation). Her choice to tap the wall and then clean rather than report the discovery shows agency with visible cost (professional risk). Internal contradiction appears when she acknowledges she should report but chooses curiosity over certainty, embodied through tactile engagement with the work. Minor slip: the dream sequence functions more as atmospheric backstory than immediate pressure on present choice, though it primes the nested-awakening theme.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure accrues through layered discoveries (coin → hollow wall → older mural → gold-leaf phrase) with a cadence shift at closure when Lena commits to cleaning rather than sealing. Closure reads as Earned Stasis with Charged Poise: her choice to continue work "bewitched by questions she'd never finish answering" forecloses the safe path (reporting, sealing) with felt professional and epistemological cost. Orientation anchors quickly (scaffolding, Cathedral Quarter, sound garden). One meaningful deepening occurs when she discovers the nested murals and chooses restoration over preservation protocol. Cost is visible in her smile and acceptance of perpetual incompletion.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is vividly rendered with specific mechanics (parabolic dishes, bronze chimes, curved walls bouncing footsteps) and directly constrains Lena's choice—she hears her own voice reflected impossibly, drawing her back to the mural with new conviction. The hobo nickel as micro-setting object charges the final image, sitting on the workbench pointing "always downward, always toward the next layer." Spatial choreography is clean (scaffolding, garden, wall). The vibration she feels through stone and brush is filtered through her professional attention and becomes a tactile anchor for the nested-awakening premise.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: epistemological—to know versus to question, certainty versus curiosity. One meaningful tightening when Lena taps the wall and discovers the hollow, then escalates by removing plaster and confronting the nested images. Her final choice (clean rather than report/seal) is protagonist-driven and forecloses the institutional path with visible professional cost. The garden's reflected voice complicates but does not resolve; Lena's brush-touch decision closes the sequence. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens through discoveries that reweight her relationship to the work.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from nested images and the gold-leaf inscription "To know is to sleep. To question is to wake." The ending offers a non-literal answer: Lena's choice to remain "bewitched by questions" rather than seal certainty reweights the entire restoration project as perpetual re-dreaming. The hobo nickel's downward-pointing staff and the woman-twin in the older fresco create resonant recursion without overt statement. The sound garden's mechanics (reflecting, transforming) subtly mirror the thematic method. No sermonizing; the final smile and "methodically playful" callback trust the reader to infer the stance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited through Lena's sensory and professional filter. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices cracks, pigments, vibrations, and layers. Diction stays within her restorer's idiom ("dead pigment," "methodically playful," "finest tools"). The phrase "methodically playful" recurs purposefully as a character anchor. One minor register slip: "making them reveal hidden geometries" reads slightly elevated for in-the-moment perception, though it could be Lena's learned architectural vocabulary. No dialogue to judge. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally, and information density is high (most lines advance image, discovery, or choice). Opening anchors voice and stakes; final image ("pointing always downward") resonates. Minor loop: "dreams itself awake" / "dreaming this discovery" / "having dreamed" recurs without escalating pressure mid-story, though the recursion serves theme. One template-cadence run in the discovery sequence ("Behind it... Behind that...") is brief and pattern-taught. No major clarity issues. Figurative language ("conversation with the dead artist," "splinter," "Russian dolls") is coherent and serves the nested premise without muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The nested-mural premise is fresh and specifically grounded in restorer's craft (pigments, scaffolding, plaster removal). The sound garden as a bewitching installation is a non-obvious synthesis with the nested-awakening concept. However, the core emotional arc (choosing curiosity over certainty) is familiar; the story elevates it through tactile detail and the recursive image rather than a transformed moral calculus. The hobo nickel's carved wanderer is a purposeful inflection. No close echoes of famous scenes. Risk-taking in the nested structure and the refusal to resolve heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Mid-band originality; specific enough to feel earned.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lena's choices drive both key turns: tapping the wall (discovery) and choosing to clean rather than report (closure). Her restorer identity shapes perception throughout. Present early, involved in at least three beats (noticing vibration, climbing to garden, tapping wall, final brush-touch), and essential to the closure choice. Strong causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The hobo nickel appears in three beats: wedged in crack with phrase, warm in pocket during garden reflection, and on workbench at closure pointing downward. It signals the nested/wanderer motif and charges the final image ("pointing always downward, always toward the next layer"). However, Lena does not handle or use it in a way that alters tactics; it functions more as a symbolic anchor than a tool. Two gates (setup, closure reprise) plus lyric resonance, but lacks middle development where it constrains a choice.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Nested awakenings structure the entire story: dream-within-dream prologue, mural-behind-mural discovery, the gold-leaf inscription that names the concept, and Lena's closing acceptance of perpetual questioning as a form of waking. The concept shapes stakes (certainty vs. curiosity) and closure (choosing incompletion). Early signal, beat involvement across discovery and ending, high causal pressure, and irreplaceability. Removing it would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Methodically playful" is named twice and shown once (tracing the saint's halo with her fingertip, "turning restoration into a kind of conversation"). It bookends the story at closure ("methodically playful, bewitched by questions"). However, it does not visibly constrain a choice or create on-page friction; it describes her stance rather than testing it under pressure. Present early and at closure (lyric reprise), but largely label-driven. Two gates, moderate thematic linkage, but no visible cost tied to the trait itself.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Bewitch" appears explicitly once when Lena enters the sound garden ("architect who believed sound could bewitch spaces") and implicitly at closure ("bewitched by questions"). The garden's reflected voice complicates her resolve but does not create the major turn; that arises from tapping the wall. The action charges the final image and ties to the thematic question, earning closure linkage. Two gates (middle complication, closure charge), but the mechanics do not shape the discovery beat. Moderate causal involvement.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.5</grade><comment>Reflected sound is signaled early (sound wave garden mechanics), drives the middle beat when Lena hears her own voice reflected "from some impossible angle," and reappears at closure when "reflected sound making the newly exposed fresco seem to breathe." However, the mechanics do not constrain her choice to tap the wall or clean the mural; they atmospherically support but do not enable the resolution. Two gates (setup, closure presence), purposeful reprise, but the method is more thematic echo than tactical necessity. Lyric allowance applies.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The sound wave garden is vividly detailed (parabolic dishes, bronze chimes, curved walls) and drives one key beat: Lena hears her reflected voice, which recharges her conviction and draws her back to the mural. It reappears at closure, where reflected sound makes the fresco "seem to breathe." Early setup, middle turn, and closure participation. The garden's mechanics (reflecting, transforming) thematically mirror the nested premise. Strong integration, though the final choice (clean vs. report) arises more from the mural discovery than garden pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "in the pause between question and reply" appears once as a named moment when Lena hears her reflected voice. It does not structure the narrative clock or tighten decisions elsewhere. The phrase is evocative and thematically apt (suspension, nested time), but it functions as a single image rather than a constraint on tactics or pacing. One beat, no middle development, no closure pressure. Ornamental rather than structural.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation to exchange certainty for curiosity is dramatized through Lena's career choice (gallery conservation → street restoration, named explicitly) and her climactic decision (report/seal vs. clean/continue). The gold-leaf inscription ("To know is to sleep. To question is to wake") names the tension, and her final smile and acceptance of perpetual incompletion enact it. Present early as backstory anchor, drives closure choice with visible professional cost (sealing away discovery vs. risking her position). Strong causal pressure and cost connection.</comment>
