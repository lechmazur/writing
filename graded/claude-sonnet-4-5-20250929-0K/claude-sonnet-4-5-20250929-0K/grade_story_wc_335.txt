<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The archivist's nervous backward-walking habit is established early and her motivation to "mentor resilience quietly" drives her interaction with Finn. Internal states rely heavily on metaphor ("defensive formations around a central void") rather than embodied contradiction. Finn's "combative tenderness" is told and illustrated but his micro-choices under pressure lack genuine cost—he softens predictably rather than choosing between competing goods. The archivist's final admission ("still nervous about being found") touches vulnerability but arrives as articulated insight rather than a dramatized forfeiture.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening lines. The piece follows an accumulative/textural lens: the archivist demonstrates tea-leaf reading, shares reversible-exile theory, and both characters move toward mutual understanding. However, the closure lacks a decisive on-page cost—Finn begins copying annotations and the archivist names her fear, but no live option is foreclosed and no visible price paid. The final paragraph summarizes theme rather than landing a charged image that reweights prior pressure, reducing the RR to a soft convergence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The forgotten library is anchored early with dust, broken windows, annotation table, and copper kettle. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout (Finn's perch, the archivist's movements). The shard-mirror and tea leaves function as micro-setting objects that enable the teaching beat. The closing sensory image of wind through cracked windows and playground-swing silence effectively mirrors the dual exile motif, charging the final moment without needing breadth.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—mentoring an exiled child toward self-acceptance—is signaled early. Pressure accumulates through Finn's skepticism softening into engagement, but escalation is gentle rather than narrowing: he moves from "That's garbage" to leaning closer to copying annotations without a visible tradeoff or cost. The tea-leaf geometry and reversible-exile theory deepen understanding but do not force a choice that forecloses another path. Under the accumulative lens one deepening suffices, yet the final beat summarizes resonance rather than dramatizing a felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme of reversible exile and finding strength in brokenness emerges through the shard-mirror, tea-leaf geometry, and the archivist's backward walk. The piece avoids overt moralizing until the final paragraph, which delivers thematic summary ("resilience grows quietly in forgotten places, that the sharpest wisdom wears the softest voice") in place of a resonant image. The central question—can exile reverse?—is answered affirmatively through Finn's notebook action, but the answer is then re-stated rather than trusted to particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single-POV third limited holds steady with the archivist's perceptual signature (backward walking, shard-mirror collecting, decades of annotation practice). Dialogue carries distinct idiom: Finn's combative shorthand ("That's garbage") versus the archivist's patient exposition. Free indirect style remains clean. One brief dip: "the way he insulted her methods while desperately seeking her approval" reads as authorial diagnosis rather than filtered perception. Otherwise voice modulates appropriately from action to reflection without head-hopping or register clash.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Two pattern issues: "combative tenderness" is named three times without fresh embodiment after the first instance, risking label-loop; the final paragraph stacks abstract theme statements ("that exile can reverse... that even trapped shadows hold light... that even frozen moments can teach movement... that brokenness has architecture... that what seems shattered can become a lens") in paraphrase-loop form, each clause restating the core insight. The metaphor "afternoon shadow caught in glass" is vivid but its mechanics—how a shadow is preserved decades—remain unexplained, creating mild conceptual fuzz. Proofreading is otherwise clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The premise—archivist mentoring exiled child via tea-leaf geometry and reversible-exile theory—offers specific texture. However, the mentor-teaches-outcast-to-value-difference frame is familiar, and the emotional arc (skepticism softening to trust) follows a predictable path without a non-obvious turn. The shard-mirror and tea-leaf annotation provide fresh detail, but the final thematic summary foregoes risk in favor of tidy reassurance. No close echo of famous material, but the resolution lacks the bold friction or conceptual cost that would lift it beyond competent execution of a known template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The archivist is present throughout, teaches Finn via tea leaves, and reveals her own ongoing struggle at closure. Her backward walking constrains movement and her choice to share the shard-mirror enables Finn's engagement. However, her actions are primarily facilitative—brewing tea, annotating, explaining—rather than forcing a high-cost turn. The ending admission ("still nervous about being found") is self-disclosure, not a choice that alters tactics or forecloses an option. Two gates (setup, closure mention) are met; middle development is observational rather than decisional, capping near mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The glass shard appears in the opening (trapped afternoon shadow), is placed on the annotation table, pointed to during the tea-leaf lesson, and held up near closure ("even trapped shadows hold light"). It returns with thematic weight but does not constrain a choice or visibly alter an outcome. The object's symbolic function—exile and preserved light—supports theme but remains static across beats. Three gates present (setup, middle, closure mention) with thematic reprise, landing solidly in mid-6s for purposeful recurrence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Reversible exile is introduced via the theory texts, discussed explicitly ("exile can reverse... you can choose to walk back toward yourself"), and echoed in the final paragraph's thematic summary. It frames the archivist's motivation and Finn's trajectory from rejection to tentative re-engagement. However, the concept is expounded more than enacted: no on-page moment dramatizes a literal or symbolic return that narrows options or imposes cost. It shapes the stakes thematically and provides the mentor's core belief, meeting setup and development, but closure treats it as a lesson learned rather than a tactical constraint, placing it in mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The backward-walking habit is named in the opening, repeated ("walked backwards again"), and admitted near the end ("I'm still nervous about being found"). It provides character texture and a physical tic that embodies her anxiety. However, it does not constrain a tactical choice or impose a visible cost—she walks backward, stops when reminded, and continues teaching without friction. The trait is present and consistent but remains ornamental relative to plot turns, landing in functional-but-replaceable mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Annotation anchors the archivist's identity, drives the tea-leaf teaching beat (she annotates the patterns in her ledger), and Finn's first earnest action at closure is copying patterns into his own notebook. The act of annotating enables the central mentoring exchange and provides the vehicle for Finn's engagement. However, the annotation itself does not create a reversal or narrow options—it illustrates understanding rather than forcing a choice under pressure. Three gates met (setup, middle vehicle, closure participation) with causal involvement in the teaching beat, scoring low-7s but lacking the cost linkage for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Tea-leaf geometry is introduced when the archivist pours tea onto a plate, explained ("by analyzing the geometry... we can understand the architecture of difficult truths"), and used to diagnose Finn's thought patterns. The method enables the teaching beat and provides specificity. However, its mechanics are asserted rather than demonstrated—we see the leaves scattered but not how their geometry reveals "defensive formations around a central void." The method shapes one middle beat and is referenced at closure when Finn studies the patterns, meeting two gates and landing in mid-5s for functional but under-dramatized use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The forgotten library is established in the opening line, anchors all action (dust-laden aisles, broken window, annotation table, copper kettle, cracked windows), and its "forgotten" status mirrors the exile theme. The setting's isolation provides the crucible for mentoring without interruption. At closure the wind through cracked windows carries "ghost-sound of playground swings," reinforcing the exile motif. The library does not impose a tactical constraint—no resource scarcity or environmental pressure—but it charges the final image with thematic resonance. Three gates met with purposeful atmosphere, scoring low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>The timeframe phrase "as an empty playground swing drifts in the breeze" is used once as a simile for the quality of silence ("footsteps echoing... that particular quality of suspended silence where absence becomes tangible") and reprised in the final paragraph as sensory image. It provides atmospheric texture and thematic echo but does not function as a temporal constraint—no clock tightens decisions, no urgency shapes tactics. The phrase is present in setup and closure as mood rather than pressure, landing in low-3s for ornamental but non-causal use.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The archivist's motivation "to mentor resilience quietly" is stated early and drives her interaction with Finn: she teaches via tea leaves, shares exile theory, and models vulnerability. The motivation is tested when Finn challenges her ("you think I'm useless here") and she responds with patient instruction. However, the mentoring unfolds without friction—no cost, competing desire, or moment where she must choose between her own healing and Finn's needs. The motivation is present, consistent, and shapes the teaching beat, meeting two gates but lacking on-page conflict between want and price, scoring low-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Combative tenderness is named explicitly ("the way he insulted her methods while desperately seeking her approval") and illustrated in Finn's dialogue: sharp skepticism ("That's garbage") softening into vulnerability ("My parents said I needed 'fixing'"). The tone modulates from antagonism to openness across the scene. However, after the label is introduced it recurs as summary rather than fresh embodiment, and the final convergence is warm without retained tension. The tone is coherent and shifts purposefully but loses its "combative" edge at closure, landing mid-5s for purposeful setup and development with incomplete follow-through.</comment>
