<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistently rooted in her backstory ("she'd been one of those voices once"), and her professional calm under pressure reads as embodied competence. The piece shows micro-choices (adjusting equipment, making calls) that align with her protective stance. However, Lily's arrival feels more like a plot convenience than an earned character beat—her decision to come is told rather than dramatized, and the bruise functions as a visual cue without internal contradiction or struggle on the page. Internal conflict in Mira is minimal; she moves through the scene without meaningful friction between competing impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the hearing aid's stored vibrations layer Margaret's warning, the manipulator's voice, and Lily's isolation into a pattern that coheres at closure when the grandmother's message is "delivered." The ending offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Mira makes calls to shelters and advocates, crystallizing the next steps with felt urgency, and the hearing aid falls silent after its message lands—options are reconfigured and the cost (Lily's isolation, the bruise, the need for external intervention) is visible. Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored early). One meaningful tightening occurs when Lily enters and the abstract signal becomes a concrete person in danger. The closure coheres under the lens, though the cost is more situational than decisively paid on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mist-clad atrium at twilight is established early and sustained through sensory details (spilled ink, skeletal ferns, spiderweb shadows, ventilation mist). The setting charges the final image: "in the mist-clad atrium, two women stood together beneath the watchful ferns" anchors the moment of protection. The hearing aid as a recurring object constrains Mira's method and participates in closure when it "fell silent at last, its message delivered." Spatial choreography is clear (iron table, door, standing positions). However, the atrium itself does not materially constrain a choice or tactic—it functions more as atmospheric backdrop than active pressure, limiting the score's ceiling.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—protecting Lily from isolation and manipulation—is signaled early through Margaret's posthumous warning and sustained through the escalating pattern Mira traces. One meaningful tightening occurs when Lily arrives with a visible bruise, shifting the abstract signal into immediate danger and forcing Mira's response (calls to shelters, advocates). The cost is legible: Lily's vulnerability, the need for external intervention, and the acknowledgment that "incidental heroism" is insufficient without professional support. However, the escalation is driven more by Lily's entrance (a situational complication) than by Mira's agency or a decision that narrows her options. The resolution feels more like a handoff than a climactic choice, and the price paid is social/logistical rather than deeply personal to Mira.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The theme—love's persistence across death and the duty to hear vulnerable voices—emerges organically from the frequency map, the hearing aid's stored vibrations, and the grandmother's refusal to let go. "That was the thing about hearts: even traced through static and decades, they never stopped trying to save each other" lands as earned wisdom rather than a moral. The concept of "incidental heroism" is directly stated in the penultimate paragraph ("It wasn't heroism...just Mira doing her job"), which edges toward thematic echo but is somewhat redeemed by the specificity of "following a pulse, asking questions that needed asking." The final image—grandmother's love crackling through corroded circuits—resonates without didacticism. However, the theme statement is close to prompt language and risks feeling imposed rather than discovered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mira; psychic distance is controlled and no head-hopping occurs. The prose carries a distinct perceptual signature: Mira notices "the shape of concern, the texture of warning" and "edges like broken glass"—sensory metaphors filtered through her professional lens. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Lily's whisper and Mira's calm responses ("Your grandmother is very persistent") feel natural and goal-driven. The opening simile ("twilight poured through the glass ceiling like spilled ink") and the closing image (grandmother's love "crackling through corroded circuits") demonstrate rhythmic control and purposeful compression. Free indirect style is clean. However, "reeling hush" appears only once and does not modulate across the piece, limiting tonal range under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening/closing lines anchor voice and image effectively. Information density is high: the hearing aid, photograph, and frequency map all do multiple jobs. No loops or paraphrase cycles appear. However, minor register drift occurs: "persistently curious nature" and "when hearts connected across distance or time" read slightly elevated for the urgent present moment. The phrase "their resemblance unmistakable in the curve of their smiles" is efficient but edges toward generic descriptor. The final paragraph's "real darkness had finally fallen" restates the time anchor unnecessarily. Figurative language is controlled and purposeful overall, but the density of metaphor in the opening paragraph (bruised hour, spilled ink, skeletal ferns, spiderweb shadows) slightly exceeds the scene's present pressure without teaching a pattern that pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The concept of "contact tracer for hearts" and electromagnetic signatures of emotional resonance offers a fresh speculative frame, and the hearing aid as a vessel for stored warnings is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. The grandmother's posthumous protection through recorded vibrations transforms a familiar ghost-story trope. However, the isolation/manipulation plot is a widely used template, and the resolution (Mira makes calls to shelters) does not transform it through unique moral calculus or lived detail—the ending is competent but predictable. The phrase "incidental heroism" feels like a prompt echo rather than an organic insight. The story's emotional specificity (grandmother's love, Lily's fear) is strong, but the core arc could be transposed to a different setting with minimal change, limiting transformation depth.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira (contact tracer for hearts) is present throughout, frames the opening, drives the investigation by adjusting equipment and mapping connections, interprets the frequency pattern, and makes the closing decision to call shelters and advocates. Her professional role shapes every beat and enables the resolution. The trait is irreplaceable: remove "contact tracer" and the story's method collapses. Early signal, causal pressure across multiple beats, and closure linkage all present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The photograph appears early (second paragraph: "the last photograph—Margaret and her granddaughter Lily"), is handled again when Mira "pressed it into Lily's shaking hands," and charges that beat with grandmother's protective presence. However, it does not constrain a choice or reweight the ending image—it functions as an emotional anchor in one middle beat but is absent from closure. Two-beat presence with purposeful use, but no closure participation or causal pressure limits the ceiling.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Incidental heroism" is explicitly named in the penultimate paragraph ("It wasn't heroism...just Mira doing her job") but does not shape stakes or tactics earlier. The concept is told as theme rather than dramatized through choices that test whether Mira seeks recognition versus quiet service. The story's arc would function identically if the phrase were removed—she follows the signal and makes calls because of her professional role, not because of tension between heroism and incidentalism. Present as a thematic claim but not as a constraint or option-changer.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Persistently curious" is named in the third paragraph ("Her job required a persistently curious nature") and motivates Mira's willingness to track "something that shouldn't exist." The trait enables the investigation but does not visibly constrain a choice or carry an on-page cost—Mira's curiosity is never tested against caution or self-preservation. The attribute is functional and consistent but replaceable with "determined" or "professional" without altering the plot. One-beat causal enablement without tradeoff or closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Assure" appears when Mira responds to Lily's arrival: "working to assure Lily with the steadiness of her voice" and continues through "You're not" and the explanation of the frequency map. This action defuses Lily's fear and enables the handoff to professional resources, shaping the resolution. However, it occurs in one sustained beat rather than across multiple turns, and the action could be swapped for "calm" or "explain" with minor edits. Causal role in the ending but modest irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The hearing aid is introduced in the second paragraph, handled and calibrated in the fourth ("Mira adjusted her equipment"), produces the rhythm and voices Mira traces in the fifth and sixth paragraphs, intensifies its pulse in the eighth, and "fell silent at last, its message delivered" in the final paragraph. The method (tracking faint pulses) is signaled early, shapes every investigative beat, and directly enables the closure when the message reaches Lily. The mechanics matter: the corroded battery, stored vibrations, and electromagnetic signatures are not ornamental. Early signal, multi-beat involvement, causal pressure, and closure participation all present.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "mist-clad atrium at twilight" is anchored in the opening line and sustained through "spiderweb shadows," "ventilation system" mist, and the closing image where "two women stood together beneath the watchful ferns." The setting charges the final image and maintains atmospheric coherence. However, it does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics—Mira could conduct the investigation in any enclosed space with similar emotional effect. Early signal, closure presence, but no causal pressure limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"When the dead call" is named in the fourth paragraph ("This was when the dead called, if they called at all. Twilight in places thick with mist and memory") and frames the investigation's timing. The timeframe justifies why Margaret's signal is detectable now, but it does not tighten decisions or create a live clock—Mira works without visible urgency until Lily arrives, and the hearing aid's silence at the end is a completion rather than a deadline met. Functional framing but no tactical pressure or closure shaping.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation "to protect vulnerable voices" is anchored in backstory ("She'd been one of those voices once") and drives every beat: tracking the signal, interpreting the manipulation pattern, and making calls to shelters. The desire is dramatized through action rather than told, and it carries a visible cost in the form of Mira's personal history and the emotional weight of recognizing the pattern. However, the motivation is not conflicted—Mira never hesitates or faces friction between protection and self-preservation. Early signal, causal pressure, closure linkage, but minimal internal friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Reeling hush" appears once in the ninth paragraph ("the reeling hush that followed felt like the world holding its breath") and modulates the tone at a key threshold when Lily is about to enter. However, the phrase does not recur or evolve, and the overall tone is more sustained atmospheric dread than a hush that charges and releases. The tone is coherent and supports pressure, but the specific phrase is ornamental rather than structural. One-beat presence with modest tonal effect, no closure charge.</comment>
