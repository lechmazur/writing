<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Kess displays consistent interiority through her barefoot wandering and pattern-seeking, but her epiphany arrives through observation rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The "awkwardly confident" trait is asserted more than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The final resolve to gather others and teach them feels declared rather than earned by prior internal conflict with visible cost—she moves from solitary observation to collective mission without foreclosing a competing path on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: sensory details (hum, glowing symbols) deepen until the final image reweights the rebellion premise. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—the stone circle and its message reframe the rebellion's failure—but the cost remains conceptual and oblique; no on-page action or renunciation forecloses a live option with felt pressure. The lens holds, but the ending reconfigures meaning through assertion ("understood what she needed to do") rather than a dramatized choice or visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The spaceport repair bay is vividly rendered (cold metal grating, rusted scaffolding, glass crunching underfoot) and the stone circle's hum provides a recurring sensory anchor. The setting constrains Kess's movement (barefoot across debris) and the circle's spatial arrangement drives her discovery. The opera glasses function as a micro-setting tool, refracting her search and aligning the symbols at closure, which charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—discovering meaning in the rebellion's wreckage—is signaled early and coheres through Kess's search. The stone circle's hum provides one tightening (subsonic vibration to full envelopment), but the escalation is passive: she receives the symbols' message rather than making a trade-off or facing a dilemma. No live option is foreclosed; the decision to gather others is frictionless, without visible cost or competing desire on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the rebellion's lull, the ancient stones, and the contrast between rigid tactics and older frequencies. The opera glasses and "Remember what you were before you forgot how to see" offer a resonant non-literal answer. However, the final paragraph edges toward thesis statement ("teach them to feel the hum") rather than trusting the image alone. The stones' hum as motif works because it constrains her perception and charges the ending, not mere recurrence.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "that awkwardly confident gait," "thunderous serenity," opera glasses as lens. Diction remains consistent and voice-specific throughout. One brief elision—how she concluded the rebellion failed—is paid off on the page when the symbols crystallize her insight. No head-hopping, and psychic distance modulates purposefully as the hum envelops her.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally, and figurative language ("bleeding away," "thunderous serenity") mostly coheres. Minor loop: "something dormant inside her" and "something both ancient and revolutionary" restate the same concept without added pressure. One template stem: "She raised the opera glasses..." recurs three times with similar phrasing. Information density is solid, and no pronoun confusion. The loops are contained to non-closure beats, preventing deeper penalty.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The spaceport setting and ancient stone circle juxtaposition offers a fresh synthesis. The "barefoot stargazer" and vintage opera glasses add specificity. However, the core arc—failed rebellion reframed by ancient wisdom—follows a familiar template (disillusionment → mystical insight → resolve to teach others) without transforming it through lived cost or moral calculus. The premise is elevated by setting detail but the emotional trajectory remains predictable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Kess is present throughout and her observation drives the discovery sequence. She lowers the glasses, crosses the bay, presses the stone, raises the glasses again—multiple beats. However, her choices are exploratory rather than stake-altering; she reacts to stimuli (hum, symbols) without facing a dilemma or paying a cost. The final decision to gather others is declared, not dramatized as a turn. Setup and development present; payoff is conceptual rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The opera glasses appear in beat one (sweeping scaffolding), recur when she notices the pattern, and return in the ending ("raised the vintage opera glasses one final time"). The second use aligns the symbols into a sentence—specific causal work. The final reprise reweights them as "a tool for seeing differently." Three beats with evolving function and closure linkage, but they could be swapped for binoculars or a scope without breaking story logic; specificity is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The rebellion's lull frames the entire piece: "three months since the last coordinated strike," scattered comrades, apathy. It shapes Kess's motivation (discover meaning) and her final resolve (begin something new, not reignite the old). The lull is the wound the story treats. Removal would collapse the stakes. Present early, drives middle insight, and closure directly addresses it by offering an alternative path.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Awkwardly confident" is asserted in the opening ("someone who had convinced herself that walking barefoot...was a philosophical statement") but not tested under pressure. It colors her barefoot choice but does not constrain or enable a peak action with visible cost. The trait is label-present without dramatized friction. Setup clear; development and payoff absent.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Reignite" is the ghost action: Kess explicitly rejects reigniting the old rebellion in favor of "something older and newer at once." The story's arc depends on this negation—her decision not to reignite but to gather and teach. However, the action itself is future-facing and declared rather than on-page dramatized. It anchors her final resolve but lacks immediate causal pressure. Setup and thematic payoff present; middle beat absent.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The hum appears when Kess touches the first stone, intensifies as she presses harder, and envelops her at the circle's center—three escalating beats. The hum provides the mechanism for her insight (symbols align, understanding crystallizes). Its subsonic frequency contrasts with the rebellion's noise and charges the final moment. Removing it would break the story's sensory logic and thematic resonance. Early signal, causal pressure, closure linkage all present.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The spaceport is anchored early (cold grating, rusted scaffolding, collapsed roof) and supplies the discovery space. The bay's decay mirrors the rebellion's failure; the circle hidden within it drives the plot. Kess navigates debris (glass crunching underfoot) and the circle's spatial arrangement enables the symbols' alignment. The setting is not merely postcard—it pressures movement and provides the artifact that transforms her stance. Essential to closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Margin of daylight" is invoked twice: opening ("bleeding away") and midpoint ("deepening dusk," "last light faded"). It provides atmospheric pressure but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page. Kess's exploration proceeds at her own pace; no clock forces her hand. The timeframe is present and tracked but does not constrain choice. Setup and mood contribution clear; tactical pressure absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Kess's desire to discover meaning is stated early ("overwhelming need") and drives her search through the bay. The motivation is tested when she realizes the rebellion struck at symptoms, not the disease. However, the friction between this want and any competing cost is minimal—no scene shows her wrestling with apathy, fear of failure, or a safer path. The motivation shapes plot but lacks on-page conflict or visible sacrifice. Setup and thematic involvement present; cost-laden choice weak.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Thunderous serenity" appears twice: once describing the spaceport's atmosphere, once as the emotional register when Kess grasps the rebellion's error. The oxymoron coheres (silence roaring louder than engines) and modulates subtly—external stillness becomes internal clarity. The tone charges the final image (stones humming, something stirring) but does not shift dramatically under peak pressure. Coherent and purposeful, but static across turns rather than dynamically reconfiguring.</comment>
