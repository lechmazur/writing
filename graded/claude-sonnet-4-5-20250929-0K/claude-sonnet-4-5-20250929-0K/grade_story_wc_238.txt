<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Margot's internal progression from cruel columnist to grief-translator is embodied through concrete choices—deleting her article, writing the truth—and the perfume bottle moment carries contradictory emotion ("jasmine and regret"). The reflection on being "frozen" reads a touch diagnostic but anchors in present cues and drives the apology. Vivienne manifests through rage and paper but her interiority is accessed via "induced current," which straddles metaphor and actual presence; the mechanism holds under the story's logic. Minor: the "mechanical conductor" backstory could be more particular to avoid stock setup.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page as Resonant Reconfiguration: Margot's public correction and Vivienne's rest constitute a decisive change with visible cost (career shift, public stance). The causal lens holds—Margot's apology and article deletion enable the ghost's release—and the orchard's impossible blossoms charge the final image. Orientation anchors quickly (archive, Margot, perfume bottle). One meaningful tightening (papers swirl, bottle opens, presence fades) narrows options and the price (Margot's former cruelty, Vivienne's lost life) is felt. The fifteen-year backstory compresses efficiently and reweights the present.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sheet music archive supplies tactile constraint (dust, manuscript pages scattering, perfume scent) and the orchard's "impossible blossoms" charge the final image with specificity. Sensory detail is selective—jasmine, rustling paper, cold draft—and filtered through Margot's professional lens (exorcist vocabulary, metaphor habit). Spatial choreography is clean (music stand, shelves, pages landing at feet). The "converted barn" and orchard setting frame the time pressure but remain slightly generic; more particularAnnotation or local idiom would lift this higher.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (deliver overdue apology, release the ghost) is signaled early and tightens through the induced-current escalation: papers scatter, vortex forms, bottle opens. Margot's agency—typing the deletion, writing the truth—drives the turn with visible cost (public admission of cruelty, professional pivot). The orchard's pending destruction adds external pressure and forecloses delay. The "frozen river" metaphor narrows Vivienne's anger into understanding, and the final blossoms embody earned forgiveness. One credible tightening and a clear price meet the lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme (imperfect redemption, words as weight, incomplete miracles) emerges through particulars—the deleted article, the Chopin nocturne with annotations, blossoms "out of season." The ending's white petals "falling like forgiveness" reweights prior material without stating a moral. Margot's shift from "convinced my sharpness made me strong" to "translator of unfinished business" is earned through concrete apology and action. Minor: "imperfect miracles blooming out of season" is slightly on-the-nose as a thematic echo in the final third; the image carries it but the phrase itself flirts with summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Voice is distinct—"exorcist who worked in metaphor," "grief made tangible"—and the close third stays anchored to Margot's perceptual signature (professional vocabulary, metaphor-driven thought). Dialogue is minimal but purposeful ("I know you're here, Vivienne"). The river-freezing metaphor and "induced currents" maintain idiom. Minor register drift: "emotional electricity" and "induced currents" occasionally feel like prompt-label carryover rather than fully inhabited diction. POV distance is stable; no head-hopping. Free indirect style is clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes. Rhythm varies (short urgent lines during the vortex, longer reflection on the affair). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs detected. The opening anchors voice and stakes efficiently. Minor: "imperfect miracle" and "induced current" recur as thematic labels without always earning fresh metaphorical weight; the final orchard image is vivid but "falling like forgiveness" leans toward stock simile. Clarity and propulsion are strong; no artifact obscures closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The gossip-columnist-turned-exorcist premise offers a fresh synthesis, and the "induced current" frame transforms familiar haunting mechanics through metaphor made concrete. The sheet music archive and conductor affair add specificity. The transformation test passes: swapping names or setting would weaken the archivist/music particularity. Minor: the orchard's pending destruction is a familiar deadline device, and the "impossible blossoms" as forgiveness reads slightly convenient. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows implications; risk-taking is present but not bold.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Margot's identity as gossip-column exorcist frames the entire story, drives her apology choice, and her professional shift at closure ("translator of unfinished business"). Present in opening, middle reflection, and final stance. Causally essential to stakes and resolution. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Perfume bottle appears early (music stand), intensifies presence mid-scene, and unscrews itself to release "jasmine and regret." Used in three beats; its scent marks Vivienne's release. Specific and tied to closure, but the bottle itself could be swapped for another personal object without fundamental plot break. Solid but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Imperfect miracles" explicitly shapes Margot's explanation to Vivienne ("miracles don't work that way—they're always incomplete, always leaving scars"), drives the resolution logic (partial redemption, scars remain), and the orchard blossoms embody it at closure ("imperfect miracles blooming out of season"). Present across setup, middle argument, and final image. Concept is causally load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Margot uses metaphor twice on-page: "frozen river" to reach Vivienne, and earlier references to "translating the language of the dead." The river image narrows Vivienne's anger and enables the apology to land. Trait is signaled early and constrains her method. Could be replaced with direct speech without collapsing the plot, but it charges her professional idiom and the persuasion beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Reconnect" is the story's spine: Margot reconnects Vivienne to "what mattered" (her love, her gift), reconnects herself to the living, and the final line names it ("she'd reconnect with the living now"). Drives the apology, the article rewrite, and closure. Removing this exact action would break the resolution. Essential and causally central.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Induced currents" frame the ghost mechanics: "emotional electricity, grief made tangible," "induced current flowing between living and dead." Mentioned early and mid-scene, shapes Margot's professional method. The vortex and bottle-opening read as induced effects. However, the mechanics remain abstract; the method could be renamed "channeling" or "tethering" without rewriting beats. Functional, not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sheet music archive supplies the ghost's medium (papers swirling, Chopin nocturne with annotations), anchors Vivienne's identity, and provides the perfume bottle's placement. The "converted barn" and orchard frame the time pressure. Setting constrains tactics (papers as manifestation) and enriches character (archivist's meticulous care). Removing the archive would require substantial rewrite. Strong integration.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The orchard's pending destruction ("Tomorrow the developers would arrive") tightens the tonight-only window and charges the final image (blossoms before chainsaws). Mentioned in opening and closing brackets. The deadline shapes urgency but does not visibly alter Margot's tactics mid-scene; she does not race the clock on-page. Purposeful framing, moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Delivering the overdue apology is Margot's explicit goal ("I'm sorry," "I can't give you back what I took"), drives the article deletion and truth-writing, and enables Vivienne's rest. Motivation is dramatized through reflection on her cruelty and embodied in the typing action. The apology carries visible cost (public admission, career shift). Central to stakes and closure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>"Ethereal grit" coheres through contrasts: dust and jasmine, rage and forgiveness, "terrible silence" and singing orchard. Tone modulates from cold opening to charged vortex to quiet blossoms. The prose balances lyric images ("white petals falling like forgiveness") with concrete action (deleting archives, typing). Tone charges the final image and supports pressure throughout. Coherent and purposeful.</comment>
