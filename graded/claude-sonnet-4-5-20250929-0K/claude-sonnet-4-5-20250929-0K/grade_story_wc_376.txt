<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's physical response to dishonesty is established clearly and her motivation to seek the Archive is legible, but her interior life remains somewhat generic—"body recognized dishonesty before her mind did" is stock phrasing. The choice to take over the Archive at the end feels inevitable given setup but lacks meaningful internal conflict or contradiction in the moment; she accepts the role without visible cost or foreclosed alternative. The grandmother backstory works mechanically but doesn't charge the present choice with enough friction to reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story anchors who/where/when adequately early (Veridium, gilded-leaf calligrapher, toxic sky). Drive lens reads as Causal with accumulative texture—Mira discovers the map, follows it, and arrives at the Archive where she accepts a role. The closure unit is a Charged Poise moment ("Show me how to deliver what was meant to be heard") that crystallizes her new stance, but the cost remains implied rather than viscerally present on the page; no live option is visibly foreclosed, no tactical price paid in the final beat. The oasis-dried backstory and multi-level descent provide texture but the because/therefore chain from map discovery to acceptance is thin.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The greenhouse city under toxic skies is vivid and specific ("skies the color of spoiled milk," "crystalline domes"). The postal plate fragment functions as a recurring object that guides action across beats (discovery, assembly, descent, recognition of grandmother's hand). The lower-level descent and reservoir setting provide spatial coherence. The gilded leaves Mira crafts and the glass vessels in the Archive create a charged parallel that supports the closure image. Micro-setting (her worktable, the maintenance corridors) shapes choices and the final Archive space alters her stance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Mira's need to find where honest words go—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens when she discovers the map, descends, and learns her grandmother started the Archive. However, the escalation is largely spatial (moving down through levels) rather than decisional; no meaningful reversal or tactical cost emerges. The final offer to deliver the messages is an invitation, not a hard choice between competing goods. The wilting-near-dishonesty trait provides texture but doesn't create on-page friction that narrows options at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme of candor versus polite fiction emerges organically through Mira's profession (permanent words on gilded leaves), her physical reaction to lies, and the Archive's function. The "words we swallow don't disappear, they settle" line and the glass vessels create a resonant image without overt moralizing. The final question—"But they're still unspoken"—introduces complexity, and Mira's decision to help deliver them offers a non-literal answer. The closure reweights the premise (preservation versus delivery) with undeniable pressure, though the conceptual cost could be sharper.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited on Mira; no head-hopping. The prose has a consistent literary register with purposeful compression ("Days blurred into weeks"). The dialogue with the elderly woman feels slightly expository ("Your grandmother understood that candor in small moments...") but serves to anchor the thematic question. Perceptual signature is present in Mira's noticing of text and physical responses to dishonesty. Distance control is clean, and the final lines maintain voice under pressure without drifting into therapy-speak or over-articulation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. Minor scaffold appears: "Mira reread the notations compulsively" followed shortly by "Mira walked among the vessels, reading fragments"—slight synonym churn on the reading/piecing action. "Her motivation crystallized slowly, like frost on greenhouse glass" is elegant but borders on decorative in a high-pressure beat. No major loops or coherence breaks. The opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Propulsion is steady but a few beats (the weeks of map assembly) are summarized where dramatization might have sharpened pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The greenhouse-city setting and wilting-near-dishonesty trait offer specific texture. The Archive of unspoken truths is a fresh inflection on the "words have power" premise, and the grandmother's map provides an earned inheritance link. However, the core arc—reluctant inheritor discovers hidden legacy, accepts mantle—is a familiar template. The transformation lies in the specificity of gilded-leaf calligraphy and the physical dishonesty reaction, but the final turn (accepting the role) lacks a bold risk or non-obvious synthesis. The piece commits to its premise but does not radically reimagine the form.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira drives all major beats: she discovers the fragments, assembles the map, descends, and makes the final choice to learn the Archive's work. Her decision to take over alters her future tactics (from solo calligrapher to deliverer of lost messages). Early setup is clear, middle choices (following the map) are hers, and closure hinges on her acceptance. Swappability is low; the calligrapher's patience and sensitivity to dishonesty are tied to her profession. Cost is implied (she's committing to a new role) but not viscerally dramatized on the page. Two beats and closure participation push the score toward 6, but the lack of visible tradeoff or foreclosed path in the final moment caps it here.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The zinc-etched postal plate fragment appears in discovery (under floorboards), becomes the anchor for map assembly, and is reread/folded into her pocket at the end. It carries the grandmother's handwriting reveal and guides the entire descent. Three distinct beats (discovery, recognition, final reprise). Causal pressure is present—without this fragment, Mira would not find the Archive. Closure linkage is solid: "Mira reread her grandmother's map fragment one final time, then carefully folded it into her pocket" charges the acceptance moment. Specificity is high (zinc-etched, postal plate). The object is indispensable to plot logic and closure; removing it breaks the story's causal chain.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The concept of candor in small moments is articulated explicitly by the elderly woman ("candor in small moments—a genuine apology, a real thank-you, an honest I-love-you—matters more than grand speeches") and implicitly through the Archive's contents. It shapes the thematic question and Mira's final choice to help deliver unspoken truths. However, it does not constrain a tactical choice on the page; Mira's wilting near dishonesty is a physical reaction, but no on-page beat forces her to choose between candor and evasion. The concept is named and echoed but not tested in action. Setup is late (second half), and closure participation is thematic rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>The wilting-near-dishonesty trait is established early ("tightening in her chest, a weakness in her knees") and explains why Mira seeks the Archive. It provides texture in the descent ("She felt stronger with each descending level, as if moving away from the concentrated dishonesty above"). However, it does not constrain an on-page choice with visible cost; it is a passive response, not an active tradeoff. The trait is mentioned rather than tested. Setup is strong, but middle development and closure participation are observational. No moment where she must endure dishonesty to gain something or choose truth at a price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Rereading the map fragments and letter scraps occurs across multiple beats: initial discovery, "reread the notations compulsively," and "Mira reread her grandmother's map fragment one final time" at closure. The action reveals the Archive's purpose and the grandmother's identity, which drives Mira's decision. Setup is clear, middle involvement is present (rereading to decode), and closure reprises it with reweighted meaning (recognition and acceptance). Causal pressure is moderate—without rereading, she wouldn't understand the legacy. However, the action itself is somewhat passive (reception rather than agency) and could be swapped for "studied" or "examined" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The shredded treasure map is discovered under floorboards early, and Mira pieces it together over weeks using her calligrapher's patience. The map's mechanics matter: it shows lower levels, strange annotations, and guides her descent through maintenance corridors. Setup is strong, middle beats depend on the map's directions, and closure links back to the map fragment she pockets. The method shapes attempts (she follows the map's path) and enables the discovery. Specificity is high (zinc-etched postal plate fragment as anchor). Removing this method would break the story's logic; she would have no way to find the Archive.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The greenhouse city is established vividly early (toxic sky, crystalline domes, water synthesis, tiered structure). The setting supplies the premise (city choking on polite fictions about resources) and the multi-level architecture enables the descent to the Archive. However, the environment does not constrain a key choice or alter tactics; Mira's path is guided by the map, not by setting-imposed obstacles. The lower levels provide spatial texture and thematic resonance (moving away from dishonesty) but function more as backdrop than pressure. Closure participation is atmospheric rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The oasis dried three years prior, establishing the world's water scarcity and the culture of euphemism. However, the timeframe does not tighten Mira's decisions; there is no live clock or deadline that alters her tactics. The "months ago" when she began noticing her reaction and "weeks" of map assembly are mentioned but not dramatized as pressure. The past (grandmother's Archive, dried oasis) provides context but does not constrain present action. Setup is present, but middle and closure beats lack temporal urgency. The timeframe is functional but replaceable with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to find where lost conversations go is seeded early ("all those honest words people carried but never spoke") and drives the entire plot: she assembles the map, descends, and ultimately accepts the role of deliverer. Setup is clear, middle beats are shaped by this desire, and closure directly answers it ("Show me how to deliver what was meant to be heard"). The motivation is dramatized through action (following the map) and the final choice. However, friction between want and cost is low; no on-page moment where seeking the Archive conflicts with another value or exacts a visible price. The desire is clean and uncontested, reducing complexity.</comment>
