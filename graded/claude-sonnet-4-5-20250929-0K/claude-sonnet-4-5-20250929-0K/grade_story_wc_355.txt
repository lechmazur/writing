<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marlow's arc from cataloging silence to witnessing it is broadly coherent, but the pivotal choice—closing the diary again—arrives without visible internal conflict. The character's self-aware interiority ("I was too afraid to ask") operates at diagnostic distance rather than embodied pressure. The shift from lockpicking attempts to radio transmission feels more conceptual than emotionally contradictory, and the final renunciation lacks the felt cost of forgoing knowledge that seventeen years of effort promised.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page: Marlow opens the clasp, reads the first line, then closes the diary in an Earned Stasis that forecloses immediate knowledge—a visible renunciation. The accumulative lens (frequencies, varieties of silence) holds through the ending image, and the cost is legible (she defers understanding after seventeen years). Orientation anchors arrive promptly (workshop, collapsed roof, sister's diary). One meaningful deepening occurs when she shifts from mechanical unlocking to empathic listening, reweighting her goal from possession to witness.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The workshop with skeletal rafters and visible stars recurs and charges the final moment ("she looked up through the broken roof"), constraining the scene's metaphorical weight. Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("amber hum of childhood summers," "burgundy resonance"). Spatial choreography is clean (workbench, microphone, diary clasp, fireworks outside). The body and tool (radio transmitter) are integral to the central action, shaping Marlow's method and the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—recovering connection with her silent sister—is signaled early and tightens when Marlow realizes opening the lock was never the true goal. One meaningful deepening occurs: she shifts from mechanical attempts (lockpicks, prayers) to empathic transmission, narrowing her options from possession to witness. The final choice (closing the diary) forecloses immediate knowledge with visible cost, though the escalation is more conceptual than tactical. Pressure coheres under the accumulative lens but lacks a live constraint that forces the choice under duress.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (empathy as listening, not demanding) emerges through image and action: the brass clasp, varieties of silence, the radio frequencies. The diary's first line ("I was never silent. You just didn't know my frequency") answers the central question without moralizing. Marlow's realization that "recovery" means recovering her own capacity to hear, not extracting secrets, reconfigures prior material. One small slip: "the path to empathy... wound through all the small violences of misunderstanding" edges toward abstraction mid-story, though the ending restores concrete resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV remains stable (single focalization, third-limited on Marlow). Voice carries a distinct lyric texture ("the amber hum of childhood summers," "fertile quiet of understanding") that modulates under pressure without breaking register. Dialogue (Marlow's transmission to the microphone) feels purposeful and voice-specific, advancing her shift from demand to witness. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices frequencies, textures of silence, and the workshop's sensory particulars. One brief filter-verb cluster ("she had learned," "she had discovered") in backstory does not materially dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several phrases tip toward overwriting: "the eclectic pacifist who had once traveled with protest singers, radio archaeologists, and monks" front-loads exposition; "the fertile quiet of understanding that one's own listening has only just begun" is labored. Template cadence appears in paired backstory summaries ("she had tried everything... she had discovered"). The closure image is clean, but mid-story figurative density ("amber hum," "silver scratch," "deep burgundy resonance") stacks without clear payoff beyond atmosphere. No loops or major scaffold, but elevated diction occasionally drifts from the scene's immediacy.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of radio archaeology, silence cataloging, and emotional recovery is specific and non-obvious. The metaphor of locks as "frozen conversations" and the idea that silence has frequencies are fresh inflections that grow organically from Marlow's history. The final reversal—that opening the diary was preparation for closing it again—feels earned in hindsight. One limitation: the eclectic résumé (protest singers, radio archaeologists, monks) reads as curated quirk rather than lived necessity, and the fireworks frame, while purposeful, arrives late and functions primarily as atmospheric contrast.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marlow's pacifism is signaled early ("violence lived not in raised fists but in the refusal to hear") and shapes her method (radio transmission rather than lockpicking force). The trait constrains her approach across two beats (failed mechanical attempts, then empathic tuning) and informs the closure choice (witness without demanding). Present in setup, middle, and ending; drives tactics with a visible renunciation cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The brass clasp appears in four distinct beats: setup (locked for seventeen years), Marlow's failed attempts, the vibrating moment of unlocking, and the final closure when she shuts it again. It is causally active in the turn (opens under frequency tuning) and charged at closure (she closes it, reweighting possession as witness). The object's changing state (locked → open → closed) alters her stance and the story's meaning. Irreplaceable and specifically grounded.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The path to empathy is named explicitly mid-story and shapes Marlow's realization that recovery meant "recovering her capacity to witness without demanding." It drives the method shift (from force to listening) and underpins the closure choice. Present in setup (her history of listening), development (tuning frequencies), and ending (the diary remains closed). The concept constrains tactics and reweights the stake, though the on-page dramatization of conflicting choices is thin; cost is more reflective than embodied.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Intuitively descriptive" is mentioned twice: applied to Marlow's voice ("pitched to carry... with theatrical sincerity") and to Elena's handwriting ("intuitively descriptive in its own way"). The trait labels rather than constrains; Marlow's descriptions (amber hum, burgundy resonance) read as authorial lyricism, not a dramatized skill under pressure. No visible trade-off or cost tied to this specific attribute. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Recover" is the story's engine: Marlow seeks to recover connection, catalogs silence to recover understanding, and ultimately recovers "her own capacity to hear" rather than her sister's secrets. The action shapes the goal, the method shift, and the closure image. Present in all three gates (setup, development, ending) and irreplaceable; swapping it for "find" or "understand" would flatten the thematic resonance. Two beats pivot on it (unlocking, then re-closing), and the final line reweights it conceptually.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Tuning frequencies is signaled early (modified radio transmitter, dials, microphone) and used on the page in the central beat: Marlow layers "amber hum," "silver scratch," "burgundy resonance," adjusting the transmission until the clasp clicks open. The method constrains her approach (no lockpicking, no force) and is causally active in the turn. Present in setup, dramatized in the unlocking beat, and echoed at closure ("Tomorrow, she would try again, tuning her frequencies"). The mechanics shape her tactics, though the final reprise is more thematic than causal.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The shadowed workshop with skeletal rafters and visible stars provides the spatial anchor, recurs in the final image ("looked up through the broken roof at the stars"), and supplies the atmosphere that charges the ending. The collapsed roof allows the night sky to witness, reinforcing the theme of openness and patience. The workbench holds the diary and transmitter; the fireworks outside provide temporal and tonal contrast. The setting constrains the method (Marlow works alone in her sanctuary) and elevates the closure image with specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "in the final stillness before fireworks ignite" is named in the opening line and paid off when "the first firework screamed upward" near the end, bracketing the scene with a live clock. However, the timer does not tighten Marlow's choices; she could perform the same actions at any time. The fireworks provide atmospheric contrast and thematic resonance (theatrical declarations vs. fertile quiet) but do not escalate pressure or alter tactics. Present at setup and closure; functional but replaceable with any other evening marker.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Marlow's desire to catalog silence is seeded in backstory (thirty years learning, six months discovering frequencies of silence) and dramatized on the page: she catalogs varieties (snowfall, held breath, swallowed words), layers them into her transmission, and at closure catalogs "a new variety of silence—the fertile quiet of understanding." The motivation shapes her method and recurs at the ending with reweighted meaning. Present in all three gates and drives two beats (the transmission, the final reflection). One friction: the cataloging itself is more told than shown in conflict with a competing want.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Theatrical sincerity is named once ("her voice neither whispered nor shouted but pitched... with theatrical sincerity") and threads through the transmissions to Elena and the fireworks contrast. The tone holds: earnest without irony, lyric without deflation. Modulates subtly (desperation → realization → acceptance) and charges the final image when theatrical fireworks outside frame Marlow's quiet interior turn. Coherent through beats and legible at closure, though the label feels more authorial than enacted through diction and rhythm.</comment>
