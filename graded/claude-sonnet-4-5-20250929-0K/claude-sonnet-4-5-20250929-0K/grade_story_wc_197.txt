<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and her underestimation functions as survival tactic, but her choices feel more procedural than internally conflicted—she photographs, packs, and escapes without a moment of genuine hesitation or contradictory impulse. The resistance work is carefully motivated, yet the final descent into the vault reads as tactical retreat rather than a choice that forecloses a visible cost or reveals hierarchy of values. Embodied emotion is present in the crouch and the freeze, but the piece favors observational competence over messy internal friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is swift and clear. The structure follows a single continuous scene with coherent causal progression: puddle-map photographed → searchlight forces retreat → vault escape. Closure reads as Charged Poise—Mira waits in darkness, already planning persistence—with the conceptual cost (continuing erasure, ongoing risk) felt rather than paid on the page. The inferred lens is Situational/Accumulative hybrid: pressure accumulates through the searchlight intrusion, and the final image reconfigures her stance from active documentation to patient endurance. One meaningful tightening (searchlight forces immediate adaptation) is sufficient for this length.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The auric lagoon is vivid and purposeful: mineral content enables the puddle-map, the hatch beneath the rocky edge provides escape, and the searchlight sweeping golden water charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective—starlight, lapping water, darkness—and filtered through Mira's operational priorities. The phone booth key and the vault function as micro-setting elements that constrain and enable tactics. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—documenting erased histories to crack consensus reality—is signaled early and sustained. The searchlight intrusion provides one meaningful tightening that forces tactical retreat and forecloses the northern checkpoint plan. Agency is present in Mira's choice to photograph and distribute, but the escalation feels more circumstantial than protagonist-driven; the searchlight arrives rather than being triggered by her prior moves. Cost is legible in the need to vanish more thoroughly, though the price feels operational rather than deeply personal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—truth persisting in overlooked places against soft tyranny—emerges organically from the puddle-map, obsolete keys, and auric lagoon without overt statement. The final image of water "that predated all the lies" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of resistance. Subtext operates through the Ministry's "patient erasure" and Mira's careful resourcefulness. The cognitive dissonance strategy and the metaphor of coded freedom integrate well, though "careful resourcefulness" and "hold the line" risk becoming thesis-adjacent in the closing paragraphs.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Mira notices underestimation, obsolete tech, and tactical details. Diction remains controlled—"auric," "phytoplankton," "emulsion"—without jarring register shifts. No dialogue appears. The prose modulates appropriately from observational calm to compressed urgency when the searchlight sweeps. One minor slip: "already planning how she would reappear" in the final line edges toward summary rather than staying in the vault's present moment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most lines advance situation, character, or world. Clarity is strong throughout. Two paraphrase loops appear: "Everyone dismissed her" / "That underestimation had kept her alive" restates the same idea across adjacent sentences; "small acts, easily dismissed, but cumulatively devastating" / "The resistance wasn't spectacular. It was persistent" echoes the same thematic claim in close proximity. The phrase "carefully resourceful resisters" and later "careful resourcefulness" repeats the prompt language without transformation. Apply −0.4 for loops and scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The auric lagoon as natural information repository and the puddle-map mechanic offer fresh particulars, and the "Ministry of Continuity" revising star charts is a strong specific inflection on soft authoritarianism. However, the underestimated-rebel-resisting-revised-histories frame follows a widely used template, and the emotional arc—competent operative escapes, vows to continue—does not transform the premise through unexpected moral calculus or lived ambiguity. The phone booth key and vault are well-integrated but feel more clever than inevitable. Risk-taking is present in the accumulative, lyric texture but does not fully heighten stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira ("underestimated rebel") is present throughout and her underestimation enables survival. She makes key tactical choices: photograph the puddle-map, pack equipment, retreat into the vault. Setup is immediate, and she drives the middle and ending beats. The underestimation trait is told early and informs her cover identity plan, but her actual on-page choices (documentation, escape) do not hinge on being underestimated in a dramatized way—she acts alone, unopposed until the searchlight appears. Two beats (photograph, vault retreat) involve her agency; closure shows her planning persistence. Swappability is moderate—"resourceful rebel" would work with minor edits. Score reflects solid presence and causal involvement without deep irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The phone booth key appears early ("pulled…from her pocket"), is handled on the page, and used at closure to open the maintenance hatch. Setup is strong, and closure participation is direct. However, it functions as a single-use tool: mentioned in paragraph three, then used in the penultimate paragraph. The key's backstory (defunct telecom, passed through the underground) adds texture but does not constrain middle choices or alter tactics under pressure. The key enables escape but does not shape the puddle-map documentation or force a tradeoff. Two-beat presence (introduction, use) with closure linkage but limited causal pressure beyond unlocking the hatch.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Revised histories" is the story's dominant stake: the Ministry alters records, star charts, and satellite imagery; Mira photographs ghost-streets to crack consensus reality. Setup is immediate (paragraph two), and the concept drives every beat—her mission, the puddle-map's value, the cognitive dissonance strategy, and the closing vow to persist. The concept shapes tactics (film camera to evade monitoring, distribution channels) and charges the ending ("truth…persisting in overlooked places"). Specificity is high: rewritten textbooks, adjusted astronomical databases, digitally excised neighborhoods. The concept is indispensable; removing it collapses the story's logic and theme.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Carefully resourceful" is named in paragraph two and demonstrated through Mira's use of obsolete film, portable darkroom, and knowledge of the vault. The trait enables the puddle-map capture and escape, appearing in setup and closure. However, it functions more as character texture than constraint—no on-page moment shows Mira forced to choose between careful planning and urgent action, or paying a cost for her resourcefulness. The trait is consistent but does not narrow options or generate friction. Swappability is moderate; "methodical" or "prepared" would fit. Solid presence without visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Reappear" is mentioned twice: Mira plans to resume her cover identity at the northern checkpoint (middle), then reconsiders in the vault ("already planning how she would reappear"). The action shapes her tactical thinking but does not drive a major on-page turn—it is a plan discussed, not executed. Setup is late (beyond midpoint), and closure mentions it only as future intention. The action is swappable with "return," "resurface," or "emerge." Functional but replaceable; it colors her operational mindset without creating irreversible consequence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The puddle-map method is seeded early (dusk deepening, reflections), executed in the fourth paragraph (shapes emerge, photographed with film camera), and its product drives the distribution plan and the story's thematic core. Setup is clear, middle development is causal (the map reveals erased streets), and closure echoes its purpose ("truth…persisting"). The mechanics matter: auric water + twilight + obsolete film = unalterable documentation. The method enables the resistance strategy and cannot be swapped without rewriting the lagoon's function. Strong across all three gates with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The auric lagoon is present from the title and first line, functions as the natural repository ("coded freedom"), provides the puddle-map resource, supplies the hidden hatch for escape, and charges the final image (water lapping, searchlight on golden water). Setup is immediate, middle development shows its mineral/phytoplankton properties enabling documentation, and closure links the lagoon's pre-tyranny persistence to Mira's vow. The setting constrains action (authorities cordon it, searchlight patrols) and enables tactics (vault, puddle-map). Removing the lagoon collapses both the documentation method and the escape. Indispensable across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"When plans unravel" is signaled in paragraph five ("plans had unraveled spectacularly two days ago") and provides the inciting incident (safehouse raided, contacts scattered). The timeframe establishes urgency and explains why Mira is at the lagoon with only the key and coordinates. However, the unraveling is backstory rather than on-page event, and the live pressure in the scene comes from the searchlight, not the prior collapse. The timeframe sets context but does not tighten present decisions—Mira's choices (photograph, escape) would be similar if her network were intact. Setup is clear, middle involvement is indirect, closure does not revisit it. Functional but not causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Hold the line against the tyranny of indifference" is articulated in paragraph two and returned to in the final paragraph ("hold the line…with careful resourcefulness"). The motivation drives Mira's documentation mission, distribution strategy, and closing vow to persist. Setup is early, and the desire shapes every choice on the page. However, the motivation is largely harmonious—no on-page moment shows Mira tempted to abandon the line, weigh personal safety against the cause, or face friction between resistance and survival. The phrase "hold the line" is repeated verbatim, risking thematic echo. Strong presence and thematic weight, but limited dramatized conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Coded freedom" appears as a label in paragraph five and describes the lagoon's information-embedding quality. Tone-wise, the piece sustains a measured, operational texture—neither triumphalist nor despairing—that fits the concept of persistence against soft tyranny. The tone modulates subtly from observational patience (opening) to compressed urgency (searchlight) to quiet resolve (vault). However, "coded freedom" functions more as thematic descriptor than tonal driver; removing the phrase would not alter the story's emotional cadence. The tone charges the final image (dark vault, patient waiting) but the specific phrase is not indispensable. Coherent tone with moderate concept-linkage.</comment>
