<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Celestine's journey has clear motivation (freeing the Keeper to free herself), but her internal contradiction feels asserted rather than dramatized through micro-choices under pressure. The moment she "understood with the peculiar clarity" bypasses earned discovery; her choice to "deliberately introduce imperfection" arrives without visible cost or foreclosed options. The Keeper's backstory is vivid but remains told rather than tested through present conflict. The final "moonstruck dreamer no longer" reads as therapy-speak epiphany rather than embodied renunciation with visible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when early; the archway setting and aurora frame are legible. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density builds through overlapping images (astrolabe, aurora, stardust memory) toward a final reweighting. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Celestine's final traced star and whispered "Create" crystallize her stance shift with felt pressure. Cost is oblique but legible in the phrase "moonstruck dreamer no longer"—she forecloses her prior fearful rigidity. One minor causality softness: the astrolabe "had grown cold now, its purpose fulfilled" tells the transition rather than dramatizing what changed her grip or her need for it.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The aurora-lit archway constrains the encounter spatially and charges the final image when Celestine walks away; the tundra-sky edge and frozen ground anchor her rest. The astrolabe's warmth-to-cold arc tracks causally and reweights at closure. Sensory detail (green/violet ribbons, frozen fingers, wind-through-cathedrals voice) is vivid and filtered through her perception. The archway stands silent behind her at the end—micro-setting shifts with the resolution. No occupational depth issues; the wandering astronomers and "unwritten calendar" enrich without cluttering.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—freeing the Keeper and thus freeing her own calcified dreams—is signaled early and tightens when she chooses to "deliberately introduce imperfection." One meaningful deepening occurs: her intuition replaces precision, narrowing the Keeper's control-bound loop. However, the tightening lacks on-page friction or visible tradeoff; Celestine's choice succeeds immediately without cost or complication. The escalation reads as accumulative density rather than protagonist struggle, and the astrolabe's cooling feels declared rather than paid. Coincidence does not resolve, but agency remains thin in the peak beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—art as wonder unbound by control, the price of perfection—emerges through the Keeper's trapped creativity and Celestine's final imperfect star trace. The astrolabe and falling stars carry thematic weight without overt moralizing, and the final whisper "Create" offers a resonant answer without thesis statement. One friction: "By freeing the Keeper, she had freed herself" edges toward explicit summary in the penultimate section, reducing oblique charge. The stardust-as-memory conceit enriches the world logic and ties to the thematic question. No thematic echo in the final beat; the ending image reweights prior material cleanly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Celestine; perceptual signature (hears unspoken words, dreams in coordinates) is character-specific. The Keeper's dialogue—"I was an artist once"—carries subtext of centuries of regret, though it edges toward expository confession. Distance control slips once: "she heard the words the universe itself wanted spoken" claims cosmic certainty beyond her focalization. Diction is elevated but consistent ("shadowed rapture," "painted breath"); no mid-paragraph head-hopping. One template stem recurs: "The [noun] [verb]" opens several sentences in the middle third without pattern-teaching, slightly dulling rhythm under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Clarity is generally strong; sentence rhythm varies and figurative language (aurora as "painted breath," stars "singing") enriches without overwhelming. Two line-level artifacts degrade momentum: "across an unwritten calendar" appears twice as ornamental filler, and "shadowed rapture" in paragraph two is not dramatized on the page before being invoked. Minor paraphrase loop: paragraphs explaining the Keeper's calcification restate "creativity crystallized" without added pressure. Filter verbs ("began to see," "felt warm") cluster in the middle third, dulling immediacy. The final image—tracing an imperfect star—has clean propulsion, but the penultimate paragraph ("she understood finally why") summarizes rather than trusts the scene.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—trapped artist freed by embracing imperfection—is familiar but executed with specificity (astrolabe mechanics, stardust memory, aurora archway). The "moonstruck" trait and "unwritten calendar" timeframe add fresh texture, though neither transforms the emotional arc's template shape (rigid dreamer learns to let go). The Keeper's voice and dissolution into starlight feel earned, but the final realization ("an artist who had remembered that stardust falls... because falling itself is a kind of freedom") leans toward thesis statement rather than synthesis through image. Transformation test: swap names/places and the arc holds unchanged. No close echoes of famous lines; tone and voice cohere.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Celestine is present throughout and her choice to introduce imperfection drives the Keeper's release and her own transformation. She is signaled early (paragraph one), shapes two beats (arriving, tracing), and participates in closure (walking away "no longer moonstruck"). However, her key decision lacks on-page friction or cost; the Keeper dissolves immediately after her intuitive tracing, so the reversal feels granted rather than earned through struggle. Her "moonstruck dreamer" trait is more label than lived constraint in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The astrolabe is handled in three beats: inherited warmth (paragraph two), seeing the Keeper's vision through it (middle), and growing cold at closure. Its mechanics matter—brass rings spinning, tracing trajectories—and its temperature shift tracks causally with the ritual's completion. It constrains her method (she must use it to see and trace) and charges the ending when it grows cold, signaling fulfilled purpose. Strong integration; removal would break the ritual logic and closure image. One small swappability note: another navigational artifact could serve similar symbolic work with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Remembered stardust" appears in the middle third as the Keeper's explanation: every atom retains quantum memory of stellar fire. It shapes the Keeper's formulae and Celestine's understanding, giving thematic depth to the falling-star method. However, it does not constrain an on-page choice or alter tactics; it functions as world-building exposition rather than active pressure. It is not present in the closure image, and swapping it for "ancient star-paths" would not break the arc. Setup is late (40% mark); no middle or closure participation as a live pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Celestine's ability to hear unspoken words is established early (paragraph one: "silent songs that stars sang") and enables her to perceive the Keeper's truth and the universe's whispered "Create" at the end. It constrains her method—she listens rather than calculates—and participates in closure. However, the trait is not tested with visible cost; it grants access without tradeoff or friction. The trait shapes two beats (perceiving the Keeper, hearing the final whisper) but remains more enabling gift than constraint with price. Early signal and closure linkage lift it into mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Rest" is signaled in the middle: "She needed to rest, to let the journey's exhaustion fall away so she could truly listen." It frames the Keeper's revelation and the astrolabe vision, but the rest itself is passive framing rather than a choice that alters tactics or narrows options. The story would hold if she simply sat to work rather than resting; the exhaustion claim is asserted but not dramatized in her body or thought. Present in setup and middle but not causally tied to closure; the final traced star does not depend on having rested. Functional but easily swappable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Tracing falling stars is the method: the Keeper traced them into formulae; Celestine traces them with deliberate imperfection to break the bind. The method is signaled early (paragraph one: "predict their descent"), developed in the middle (Keeper's mapped trajectories), and enacted at closure (Celestine's intuitive tracing releases the Keeper). It shapes two beats and the ending, and the shift from precision to intuition drives the thematic turn. Strong causal role; removal would collapse the ritual logic. One swappability note: another predictive art (music, geometry) could serve with moderate edits, slightly lowering irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The aurora-lit archway anchors all action spatially, frames the Keeper's threshold existence ("between earth and heaven"), and stands silent in the final image as Celestine walks away. It is present in setup, middle (ritual site), and closure. It constrains the encounter—Celestine crossed seasons to reach it—and charges the ending when she leaves it behind. However, the archway itself is more backdrop than active pressure; it does not supply a resource or obstacle that alters her tactics. Strong thematic resonance (threshold, liminal space) but functionally closer to postcard framing than micro-setting with tactical cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Across an unwritten calendar" appears twice as atmospheric phrasing but is never dramatized as a live constraint or ticking clock. Time is vague: "three unmarked seasons" signals long journey but does not tighten decisions in scene. The phrase recurs at closure ("sat beneath the archway across an unwritten calendar, feeling time lose its sequential grip") as thematic echo rather than pressure device. No middle development; time does not narrow options or raise cost. Present as ornamental motif; swappable with "timeless vigil" without structural loss. Late setup (introduced paragraph one but not explained until near end); no tactical participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Freeing trapped creativity is Celestine's stated motivation (implicit in her journey, explicit when she tells the Keeper "You need to let go") and drives her key choice to introduce imperfection. The motivation is seeded early (dreams guiding her), tested in the middle (she must understand the bind), and paid off at closure (freeing the Keeper frees her own calcified dreams). It braids with her internal stake—her own fear-trapped visions—adding friction. However, the desire is more told than shown in conflicted micro-choices; her internal resistance to her own rigidity is asserted in reflection rather than dramatized through hesitation or cost. Strong causal role; visible thematic price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Shadowed rapture" is invoked once (paragraph five: "Now it existed in shadowed rapture") to describe the Keeper's state and recurs implicitly in the aurora imagery and Celestine's awe. Tone is coherent—melancholy wonder, ancient beauty—and modulates with pressure (rising intensity at the ritual, quiet resolve at closure). The final traced star and whispered "Create" carry rapture tempered by cost (the moonstruck dreamer no longer). However, "shadowed rapture" as phrase is not dramatized early or returned to at the end; it remains more label than embodied mood. Tone charges the final image but the exact phrase does not. Coherent modulation; mid-integration on the specific phrase.</comment>
