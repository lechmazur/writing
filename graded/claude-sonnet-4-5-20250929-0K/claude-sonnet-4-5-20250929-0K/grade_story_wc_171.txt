<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren's operational gentleness is dramatized through calibrated speech and clipboard ritual, showing embodied method rather than label. Her seventeen truces and fourteen failures create credible weariness, and the ritual forces commanders to inhabit loss rather than abstraction. Internal contradiction appears in "knowing the lie even as she thought it," and the final assessment "space between one violence and the next" shows earned endurance. Minor deduction: the junior negotiator's question at the end feels like a convenience prompt rather than an organic presence, and some interiority ("operatively gentle—not soft, but deliberately calibrated") edges toward exposition.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: the imperfect treaty with "empty pages fluttering" crystallizes the recurring choice with cost ("space between one violence and the next, stretched as long as courage allows"). The lens reads Situational-Causal hybrid: ritual pressure forces stance crystallization, and the naming ceremony causally enables negotiation. One tightening occurs when talks collapse twice and the clipboard's gravity pulls them back. Minor slip: the junior negotiator's final question is a slight convenience frame, though Maren's answer delivers genuine cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The terrace's "scorch marks from bombardments and blood from ancient sacrifices" layers history into setting without catalog. Midsummer heat "pressed down like divine attention" during the ritual, and the clipboard's tactile presence (dark wood absorbing light, pages fluttering) charges multiple beats. The object constrains choice by creating ritual gravity that pulls negotiators back twice. Minor gap: the valleys where harvests burned remain abstract; no sensory detail grounds the immediate negotiation space beyond the terrace stone.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—ending the cycle of names—is signaled early and tested when talks collapse twice. The ritual's gravity provides the tightening mechanism: each reading increases cost, and retrieval of the clipboard after shouting matches narrows options back to naming the dead. The price is visible: commanders' voices crack, delegates weep, and the final treaty is "imperfect, compromised, vulnerable." One meaningful deepening: from abstract diplomacy to embodied loss to negotiation constrained by that loss. The "space between one violence and the next" makes the ongoing cost unmistakable.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the ritual's mechanics: peace as alternative to speaking dead children's names creates weight versus "abstract concept meant nothing." The clipboard evolves from diplomatic tool to sacred object through use, and the terrace's scars become "beautiful in its refusal to pretend damage hadn't occurred." Final image answers the implicit question without moralizing: redemption is temporal space "stretched as long as courage allows," with empty pages waiting to record the next price. The layering of violence into sediment and the transformation of ordinary objects through intention avoid thesis statements while making the cost undeniable.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Maren's perceptual signature shows in "operatively gentle" and "penitent's cross," filtering diplomatic tools through spiritual weight. Distance is stable third-limited; no head-hopping. Minor slip: "operatively gentle—not soft, but deliberately calibrated to disarm without diminishing" reads as authorial gloss rather than Maren's lived syntax, and "This is the price of redemption" edges toward thesis articulation. Dialogue when present ("This is manipulation—" / "This is the method") advances goals cleanly. Diction stays controlled except for one or two explanatory asides that break the otherwise strong narrative texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Strong propulsion in most beats: "She had negotiated seventeen truces in this forever war, and buried colleagues after fourteen of them collapsed" is high-density. Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language (ebony clipboard as penitent's cross, celestial dance, violence compressed into sediment) serves pressure. Two minor drags: "operatively gentle—not soft, but deliberately calibrated to disarm without diminishing" is scaffold explaining the term, and "The flawed beauty of the approach lay in its honesty" summarizes rather than trusts the dramatized ritual. No loops or template cadence, but the explanatory asides slightly dull momentum in non-closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ritual of naming the dead before negotiation transforms standard peacemaking tropes through specificity: clipboard commissioned after Valmont massacre, voices cracking on third name, gravity of "stop adding names to this list." The transparency acknowledged ("ritual significance was transparent, almost crude") avoids false cleverness while honoring the method's weight. The forever-war frame and ebony clipboard risk cliché but are grounded through Maren's operational history and the ritual's concrete mechanics. Minor deduction: "forever war" and "ancient terrace" retain some template flavor despite strong execution, and the junior negotiator's closing question is a convenience frame.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's decisions drive all key turns: commissioning the clipboard after Valmont, designing the naming ritual, interrupting the general's objection with steel-edged gentleness, retrieving the clipboard twice when talks collapse. Her choice to anchor abstractions in concrete loss creates the causal engine. Present in opening, middle escalation, and closure assessment.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Clipboard introduced early (paragraph 2), used in setup (ritual announcement), development (passed between enemies, retrieved twice after collapses), and closure (remaining on stone with empty pages). Its transformation from tool to sacred object through use constrains choice: the ritual's gravity pulls negotiators back. The dark wood "absorbing rather than reflecting light" and final image of "empty pages fluttering" reweight its meaning from record to ongoing threat/promise.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Price of redemption shapes stakes and method: Maren must "speak with authority while acknowledging every failure," and peace becomes "the right to stop adding names." The concept drives the ritual's design (forcing acknowledgment of what peace must redeem) and constrains tactics (collapses pull back to the list). Appears in Maren's reflection and the final image ("space between one violence and the next"). Not merely thematic—it alters the negotiation's structure—but one step below indispensable because the ritual could theoretically serve other framings.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Operatively gentle" is dramatized in Maren's speech ("deliberately calibrated to disarm without diminishing") and enables the ritual's acceptance while carrying authority ("gentleness edged with steel"). It constrains her method: she cannot command, only guide. Present in setup and one middle beat (interrupting the general). The attribute shapes her approach but is not tested under opposing pressure; it remains a stable tool rather than a contested trait with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Muster" governs the ritual's demand: "muster the courage to acknowledge what peace must redeem." The word recurs in the challenge to the general and underpins the final reflection ("stretched as long as courage allows"). The action—summoning courage to inhabit loss—drives the naming ceremony's pressure and the commanders' voice-cracking responses. Removing "muster" would require rephrasing the core challenge, but the concept could survive with synonyms. Present in setup, tested in development, charged at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ritual significance is announced ("This is the ritual we will follow"), its mechanics detailed (reading ten names each), and its transparent purpose acknowledged ("forcing them to inhabit their own destruction"). The method's gravity creates the story's primary constraint: it pulls negotiators back twice after collapses. The transformation of the clipboard through ritual use is the causal spine. Present in setup, enables development, and the empty-pages image at closure depends on the ritual's ongoing frame. Indispensable to structure and escalation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Ancient terrace appears in opening, hosts the ritual, and closes the story with Maren studying its scars ("beautiful in its refusal to pretend damage hadn't occurred"). Midsummer heat "pressed down like divine attention" during the ritual, adding sensory pressure. The setting frames but does not constrain: talks could unfold elsewhere with minor edits. The scars provide thematic resonance at closure but do not alter tactics. Present in all three gates but functions more as backdrop than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Celestial dance mentioned in opening ("marked the celestial dance that had witnessed countless failed ceasefires") and appears once more ("celestial bodies continued their slow waltz overhead, indifferent"). The three-day negotiation span is stated but not tracked beat-by-beat; no live clock tightens decisions. Timeframe provides scale (midsummer, slow arc, three days) but does not constrain choices or charge the closure. Present in setup and one middle mention; absent from ending.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Anchoring ideals in practice is Maren's explicit method: "Peace as an abstract concept meant nothing. Peace as the alternative to speaking another dead child's name—that created weight, gravity, pull." The motivation drives the ritual's design, is tested when talks collapse (she retrieves the clipboard to re-anchor), and closes with her acknowledgment that redemption is temporal ("space between one violence and the next"). The desire is dramatized through the naming ceremony's mechanics and conflicts with the generals' resistance. Present and causal across all gates.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Flawed beauty is articulated ("The flawed beauty of the approach lay in its honesty") and embodied: the ritual is "transparent, almost crude," the treaty "imperfect, compromised, vulnerable," and the terrace "beautiful in its refusal to pretend damage hadn't occurred." Tone modulates from weary resolve (opening) through embodied grief (voice cracking, weeping) to restrained hope (empty pages). The acknowledgment of imperfection without retreat charges the final image. Present throughout and coherent, though one direct statement of the tone slightly reduces its implicit resonance.</comment>
