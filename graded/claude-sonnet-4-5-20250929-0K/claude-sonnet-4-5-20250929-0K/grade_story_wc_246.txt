<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's interiority shows concrete embodiment through the pen-handling worry ritual and her fingers stilling at the discovery. Her shift from filtering noise to cataloging changes demonstrates agency with visible cost—she releases "rigid certainty" and accepts living "between drafts." The predecessor's disappearance provides character-specific backstory that primes the closure choice. Minor slip: "confident uncertainty" arrives as inherited label rather than fully dramatized contradiction, though the pen-unbending does enact the paradox physically.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly: Mara moves from interpreter to co-author, filling the pen and beginning to write signals rather than merely catalog them—a Decisive Change with visible cost (abandoning her original analytical stance). The piece establishes a Causal lens through because/therefore links: anomaly pulses → records change → Mara realizes signals are corrections → she shifts role. Orientation anchors (observatory tower, Kepler Station, gravitational anomaly) arrive early. One meaningful tightening when the timestamps precede cataloging dates, narrowing her interpretive options and forcing the paradigm shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly functions as active setting: coffee cups drift sideways, inner-ear tugs, and the "margin between drafts" metaphor charges the station's spatial identity. The pen's question-mark nib is handled across multiple beats (worry stone, unbending attempt, finally filled with ink) and its physical transformation mirrors Mara's psychological shift. The observatory tower's height and the window view of paradoxical stars provide spatial grounding. Scope-appropriate detail; the anomaly constrains Mara's interpretive reality and charges the final image of stars blinking in impossible patterns.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—threshing meaning from celestial noise—is signaled in paragraph three and tightens when timestamps precede catalog dates, forcing Mara to choose between filtering or accepting the implications. The reversal is protagonist-driven: she stops fighting and begins cataloging changes, then moves to writing signals herself. Visible cost: she abandons her mentor's cautionary tale and her own "rigid certainty," committing to a reality where history is fluid. The escalation is causal and the final act (filling the pen, writing) forecloses her prior interpretive stance with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through image and action: the pen's unbending mirrors Mara's release of rigidity; "palimpsest" and "margin between drafts" grow from the celestial-signal mechanics rather than abstract assertion. The piece resists tidy morals—Mara's predecessor was neither mad nor wrong, and her own shift is framed as accepting paradox rather than solving it. The final image (stars blinking in patterns that "wouldn't exist for another century, or perhaps had always existed") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the threshing-meaning question. The "strange comfort" deepens from physical (pen) to existential (living between certainty and revision) without explicit moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Stable third-person limited with Mara's perceptual signature: "whispers and stutters of distant stars," "desperate need for order projected onto chaos." Diction remains voice-consistent ("confident uncertainty," "margin between drafts") and the narrator's certainty calibrates to what Mara can plausibly infer. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the discovery beat. Minor slips: "threshing meaning from experience" in the motivation paragraph feels slightly elevated for the internal moment, and "her station existed in the margin" shifts briefly toward external summary, though it recovers quickly. No dialogue to evaluate. The final line's tone—"confidently uncertain"—lands as character-specific closure rather than label.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance concept or character (the pen functions as worry object, then transformation tool, then writing instrument). Rhythm varies purposefully and the opening grounds voice and stakes efficiently. Two minor artifacts: "through contingent relationships between" appears twice in close succession (paragraph nine and ten) as near-paraphrase, and "the signals...but also corrections, revisions sent backward" could compress without loss. The figurative language (palimpsest, bookmark, margin) coheres without overwriting. No loops that obscure causality, and the final image recharges the pen motif cleanly. Penalty for the contingent-relationships echo: −0.3 within band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of gravitational anomaly as historical bookmark and signals as retroactive edits feels specific and non-obvious. The pen's question-mark nib as both physical object and thematic vehicle avoids symbolic convenience by appearing early and evolving functionally. The piece transforms the "editing reality" trope through the contingent-relationships mechanic and Mara's shift from interpreter to co-author. Slight dock: the "editing history" premise echoes widely used templates (timeline revision, observer-becomes-participant), and while the execution is fresh, the core arc follows familiar ground. Risk-taking in the palimpsest metaphor and paradox-as-comfort ending adds +0.2 within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interpretive work drives two key beats: filtering the signal to discover anachronistic timestamps (middle turn) and deciding to catalog changes rather than resist them (closure). Her final choice—filling the pen and writing signals—fundamentally redefines her role from passive interpreter to active co-author. Setup in paragraph two, development when she realizes the predecessor wasn't mad, payoff when she begins writing. Cost is visible: she abandons her original analytical stance. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; the character's occupation is inseparable from the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The pen appears early (paragraph four) as inherited object and worry stone, is handled again mid-story during the unbending attempt (paragraph ten), and transforms at closure when Mara fills it with ink for the first time and begins writing (paragraphs twelve and fourteen). Its question-mark nib charges the theme of uncertainty, and its straightening mirrors Mara's psychological unbending. The pen's shift from unused relic to active tool is causally tied to her role change. Strong beat involvement (three distinct moments), closure participation, and irreplaceability (the exotic nib and its curve are specific). Minor dock: could have shown the physical unbending completing on the page rather than stating "straightened under her careful pressure."</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>History-editing shapes the story's stakes and mechanics: timestamps precede catalog dates, records rewrite themselves, and Mara's logs alter despite her memory. The concept drives her realization that signals are corrections and motivates her shift from interpreter to co-author. Setup in paragraph six (timestamps), development when records change (paragraph seven), payoff when she begins writing signals (paragraph fourteen). The mechanics—retroactive influence through contingent celestial relationships—are signaled and demonstrated. Strong causal pressure; the concept is inseparable from the closure choice. Removing it would collapse the story's logic entirely.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Confidently uncertain" is introduced early (paragraph three) as the mentor's phrase and returns in the final line to frame Mara's new stance. It constrains her approach—she knows patterns might be projections—and the closure reaffirms it after she has released rigid certainty. Setup and payoff gates are met; middle development is implicit in her initial caution and final acceptance of paradox. The trait is more thematic echo than visible on-page cost driver; it colors her interpretive stance but does not force a specific tradeoff in a middle beat. Lyric reprise lifts it to low-6s, but causal pressure is lighter than required for 7+.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Unbending the pen nib occurs in paragraph ten and is the physical pivot: "as it did, Mara felt herself unbending too—releasing the rigid certainty." The action is concrete, embodied, and directly linked to her psychological shift. It shapes the closure by enabling her to fill the pen and write. Setup (pen introduced early), development (unbending moment), payoff (pen filled and used). Strong causal linkage; swapping "unbend" for another action would require reworking the metaphor and the object's arc. The specificity (question-mark nib bent by anxious handling) makes it irreplaceable. Cost is legible: she abandons her defensive posture.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Contingent relationships are named and explained in paragraph nine: stars connected "through gravity, through light, through the simple fact of being witnessed, and these connections made them vulnerable to retroactive influence." The method is signaled and its mechanics matter—it explains how editing propagates through recorded history. Setup is clear, and the method shapes Mara's understanding of the anomaly and her final cataloging work. However, it does not constrain a middle choice or force a tactical tradeoff; it functions primarily as explanatory world-logic that enables the closure realization. Present in closure (she maps the palimpsest through these relationships) but more conceptual scaffolding than active pressure driver.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The gravitational anomaly is introduced in the opening sentence, recurs when it pulses and Mara feels the inner-ear tug (paragraph seven), and is reframed at closure as a bookmark where "the past remained fluid enough to accept corrections" (paragraph eleven). It grounds the setting physically (coffee cups drift, spacetime hiccups) and thematically (the station exists "in the margin between drafts"). Setup, development (the pulse coincides with record changes), and payoff (Mara understands it as a revision point) are all present. The anomaly constrains the story's reality and charges the final image of paradoxical stars. Strong integration; removing it would eliminate the story's spatial logic and metaphoric anchor.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After planting the wrong seeds" appears once in paragraph eight as a metaphor for the predecessor's discovery and Mara's realization. It does not function as a literal timeframe constraint or clock; instead it marks the conceptual moment when interference begins yielding truth. The phrase reweights the predecessor's "madness" and primes Mara's acceptance, but it does not tighten decisions or alter tactics in a later beat. Setup (implied: predecessor retired early) and thematic payoff are present; middle development is absent. The element functions more as metaphoric hinge than temporal pressure. Lyric use without causal pressure trends mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Mara's motivation—to thresh meaning from experience, find signal in noise—is introduced in paragraph three and drives her work throughout. It is tested when the noise proves to be filtered-out signals (paragraph nine), and the closure directly fulfills and transforms it: she moves from threshing to writing, from interpreting to co-authoring. Setup early, development when she realizes she's been filtering corrections, payoff when she begins documenting and writing signals. The motivation is dramatized through her actions (filtering transmissions, cataloging changes, filling the pen) and conflicted (she must abandon her interpretive certainty to fulfill it). Strong causal pressure and closure participation; visible cost in the shift from passive to active role.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Strange comfort" is introduced in paragraph ten when Mara feels it "in the paradox" of unbending the pen, deepens in paragraph eleven ("settled into her bones"), and frames the final image (paragraph fourteen: she smiles, "confidently uncertain"). The tone coheres through the turns—acceptance of fluidity rather than anxiety—and modulates with pressure, moving from discovery-unease to paradox-comfort to authorial calm. Setup and payoff are strong; middle development shows the comfort deepening as she catalogs changes. The tone charges the final image and distinguishes the piece from a conventional tension arc. It is consistent, purposeful, and inseparable from the closure effect. Strong integration across all three gates.</comment>
