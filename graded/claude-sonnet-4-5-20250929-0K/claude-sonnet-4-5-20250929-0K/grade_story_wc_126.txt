<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maya's acoustic perception is embodied through concrete action—hearing harmonics in glass panels and shipwreck hulls—and her choice to perform unfinished pieces shows internal consistency. Her motivation to honor her great-aunt while addressing the chronic hush is clear and specific. The family members remain lightly sketched but functionally present; the piece stays tightly focused on Maya's interior experience and her micro-choices during the performance. Minor issue: the mendicant's bowl transition (upside-down to water-filled) feels slightly unmotivated but does not break character logic.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly within the opening paragraph: who (Maya), where (sunken greenhouse), and when (after fires, dusk gathering). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through the performance sequence, the chronic hush retreats slightly, and the final fruit-drop reconfigures the "world unfinished, still singing" into Charged Poise with conceptual cost (incompleteness as ongoing vulnerability). One meaningful deepening occurs when Maya realizes incompleteness leaves space for listener stories. The cost is felt in the renunciation of completion and the acceptance of fragility.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The sunken greenhouse with sideways apple trees and shipwreck ribs is vividly specific and pressures the gathering—water depth, fractured glass, and ash-laden wind are sensory anchors throughout. The platform, water, and acoustic properties constrain Maya's performance choices and charge the final image (fruit dropping into water). The chronic hush functions as atmospheric constraint that retreats only within the greenhouse pocket, tightening the sanctuary's fragility. Setting details are filtered through Maya's acoustic perception and integrated into action rather than catalogued.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: perform unfinished pieces to honor tradition and find beauty amid the chronic hush. The escalation under the Accumulative lens is the gradual retreat of the hush and Maya's realization that incompleteness invites participation. Agency is present in her choice to play fragments and her recognition of their purpose. The cost is legible: accepting incompleteness means forsaking closure and accepting ongoing fragility. One tightening occurs at piece twenty-seven when the hush retreats; the final fruit-drop crystallizes the risk of beauty in a world still vulnerable.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme—beauty in incompleteness, defiance amid ruin—emerges organically from the unfinished compositions, sideways apple trees, and the chronic hush without thesis statements. The mendicant's bowl (upside-down, then filled with salt-and-sweet water) and the final fruit-drop offer non-literal answers to the central question: what endures when the world has burned? The piece resists tidy morals; the ending crystallizes potential rather than resolution. Subtext operates in silence, gesture (passing the bowl), and the acoustic particulars that make the greenhouse a pocket of living quiet.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization remains stable; Maya's perceptual signature (hearing harmonics in glass, water vibrations through roots) is distinct and purposeful. Diction stays within her voice—"acoustically perceptive," "unbind the music from possibility"—without register drift. Dialogue is sparse and natural; Maya's brief speech to her family carries subtext (honoring Sora, inviting participation). The prose modulates with emotional intensity: longer, lyric sentences during performance, shorter beats at the fruit-drop closure. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks; psychic distance is controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no template cadence or paraphrase loops. Information density is high—most lines advance setting, character, or theme without padding. Minor scaffold: "turned the horizon amber" and "ash-laden wind" are stock weather phrases; "dusk thickened" is borderline cliché. The final image—fruit dropping into water—is clear and propulsive. No mixed metaphors or register drift. One small clarity slip: "hanging vines" appear suddenly without prior cue. Overall, the prose is clean and momentum is sustained through the performance sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-apocalyptic setting, unfinished music, and family storytelling tradition is specific and non-obvious. The greenhouse-as-sanctuary and sideways apple trees offer fresh visual particulars. The transformation of bonfire tradition into acoustic performance is earned by the premise (world has burned enough). The central insight—incompleteness as invitation—feels inevitable in hindsight. Minor deduction: the chronic hush as post-fire phenomenon reads slightly abstract and could have been grounded in one more sensory particular. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative lyric mode) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's choice to perform the unfinished pieces drives the gathering; her acoustic perception shapes how she hears the greenhouse's resonance; her realization at piece twenty-seven (incompleteness leaves space) alters her understanding and charges the closure. Present in setup, middle realization, and implicit in the final fruit-drop.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The bowl appears in three beats: placed upside-down, mentioned as collecting water, then passed around with tasted salt-and-sweetness. Its transformation from empty inheritance to shared vessel reweights meaning at closure. Functional use in two distinct beats with a charged reprise, but the middle collection (rainwater/tears/condensation) reads slightly convenient rather than causally motivated.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The chronic hush shapes stakes throughout: it's the reason for the gathering's new form, it pressures Maya's performance (will music carry?), and its retreat at piece twenty-seven creates the story's key turn. The final fruit-drop's clarity confirms the hush's recession. Present in setup, pressures middle choices, and the ending image hinges on its partial defeat.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Maya's acoustic perception enables her to hear harmonics in glass panels, water vibrations, and shipwreck hulls singing—specific on-page observations that justify her choice of this location and her realization about resonance. The trait constrains her awareness (she hears what others miss) and charges the final fruit-drop, which she perceives as "magnificently clear." Present in setup, informs middle beats, and validates closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Unbind" appears in Maya's speech explaining Sora's intent: completion would trap music in a single form, so she performs fragments to preserve possibility. This justifies the performance's structure and the thematic payoff (incompleteness invites participation). The action is causal but slightly abstract; the ending enacts it (fruit-drop as ongoing process) rather than a second on-page instance of unbinding.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The bonfire tradition is signaled early as the catalyst for change: "This year, there could be no bonfire—the world had burned enough. So Maya had proposed something different." It shapes the gathering's form (acoustic performance replaces spoken memory) and the family's participation. The method's transformation drives the premise and middle structure, though the original bonfire never appears on the page—only its absence and replacement.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The greenhouse is indispensable: its acoustic properties (glass panels humming, water carrying vibrations, shipwreck hulls singing) enable Maya's realization; the platform and water constrain staging; the sideways apple trees embody defiant beauty; and the final fruit-drop into water delivers the closure image. Setup, middle pressure (chronic hush pocket), and the ending's sensory proof all depend on this exact location.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The timeframe pressures the gathering implicitly: the world has burned, the chronic hush has spread, and this gathering happens now because bonfires are no longer possible. The fires are "distant" but smoke remains, anchoring the scene in a vulnerable present. Dusk-to-stars progression tracks time lightly. The "after" matters more than a countdown, but it tightens the stakes by foreclosing the old tradition and making this performance urgent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Maya's motivation—"to find the beauty she left suspended"—is dramatized through her performance choices and her realization at piece twenty-seven that incompleteness is the point. The friction between wanting to honor Sora and fearing the chronic hush might deaden the music creates micro-tension. The final fruit-drop confirms she has found beauty, though at the cost of accepting fragility. Setup, middle conflict, and closure all hinge on this desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Tone is restrained and lyric throughout: vivid but economical detail (fractured glass, ash-dust tears, sideways apple trees), no overwriting or sentimentality. The prose modulates with pressure—longer sentences during the performance, clipped precision at the fruit-drop—and the final image ("The world unfinished, still singing") crystallizes simplicity with charged weight. Coherent from opening to closure; the magnificence resides in the acoustic clarity and the defiant apple trees, not in inflated language.</comment>
