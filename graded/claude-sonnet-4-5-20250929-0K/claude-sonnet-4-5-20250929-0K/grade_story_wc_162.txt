<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is textured and character-specific—her methodical reading of grain patterns feels earned from her father's architecture. However, the core motivation remains somewhat abstract; her "featherly determined" approach is labeled rather than embodied in contradictory impulses under pressure. The ending choice to "build thresholds" feels asserted rather than dramatized through a visible fork with cost. Thomas functions primarily as a sounding board without applying independent pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: sensory density and recursive imagery build toward a conceptual repricing where Mara reframes her father's absence as "distributed through" the maze rather than lost. Orientation anchors (gray space, terrace, post-butterfly-effect world) arrive within the first 120 words. The closure unit is a Conceptual Repricing—"the necessary distance, she understood now, was love"—that reweights prior material, though the cost remains more felt than visible on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara traces the grain disruption to her father's first maze, reframing his obsession as measurement rather than abandonment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The "drifting prism terrace" functions as micro-setting, providing tactile constraint through the wooden rail whose grain Mara reads for clues. The terrace's "impossible surface" and "crystalline edges refracting nothing into everything" establish atmospheric coherence without overwhelming the scene. The oak rail's growth rings anchor multiple beats and charge the final choice to honor thresholds. Spatial choreography is clear (boundary, rail, Thomas approaching), and the gray expanse pressures direction-finding without conventional space.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding why her father vanished and what "necessary distances" mean—is signaled early and deepens when Mara realizes he was measuring rather than lost. The piece offers one meaningful tightening: her realization that "sacred thresholds aren't about the crossing" but about standing at the edge. However, escalation operates primarily through reflection rather than on-page choice under rising pressure. The cost is conceptual (accepting her father as "distributed" rather than retrievable) but not viscerally tested through a live fork or renunciation.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the grain-reading, maze architecture, and weather codes without overt statement until the final line. The closing image—Mara writing "PRESNT" beside her father's "BECMG"—offers a resonant answer to the central question about thresholds and distances. The piece resists tidy resolution by holding dual truths ("Peace, or dissolution? Transcendence, or abandonment?") and lets the final pronouncement ("The necessary distance, she understood now, was love") land as earned synthesis rather than imposed moral. Minor deduction for the slightly on-the-nose final assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with a distinct perceptual signature: Mara's architectural-analytic lens colors every observation (oak rings, surveyor's precision, pattern analysis). Diction is controlled and lyric without register drift. Thomas's brief dialogue serves subtext without voice bleed. The psychic distance tightens appropriately during the grain-reading beats and opens for atmospheric sweep. Filter verbs ("felt," "heard") are voice-motivated and sparse. Pronoun references stay clear despite the father's off-page presence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and figurative density (prism edges, featherly determined, fractured hush) stays within lyric bounds without overwhelming clarity. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or thematic pressure. Minor loop appears in the "necessary distances" phrasing (repeated three times without added nuance). The phrase "featherly determined" is coined but not fully dramatized on the page. Template cadence appears in the backstory paragraph's list-like recounting ("he'd grown obsessed," "he'd carried," "he insisted"). No critical artifacts touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of maze architecture, pilot logbook weather codes, and post-causality fragmentation feels specific and non-obvious. The grain-reading method offers a fresh angle on grief and inheritance. However, the "drifting terrace after the butterfly effect" frame borders on familiar SFF abstraction, and the ending's wisdom ("it's okay to stand at thresholds") trends toward platitude despite being earned by prior imagery. The piece commits fully to its lyric-philosophical mode without retreating to stock plotting. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, meriting modest bonus within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara (the architect's lost child) drives all major beats: she initiates the grain analysis, dialogues with Thomas, and makes the final choice to "build thresholds." Her decisions alter tactics (writing "PRESNT" in the logbook, reframing her father's absence). Present in setup, middle development (grain analysis narrows options), and closure (final choice to teach threshold-standing). Causal pressure is moderate—most action is reflective rather than a live fork. Cost is conceptual (accepting distributed presence) but not viscerally tested.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The pilot logbook appears in three distinct beats: backstory (found in maze with father's final entry), Mara's carried possession (she's carried it for years), and closure (she writes "PRESNT" beside "BECMG"). The object enables the final act and accumulates meaning across the arc. However, it does not constrain a middle choice or alter tactics under pressure; it functions primarily as symbol and closure vessel. Early signal and closure linkage are strong; causal pressure in the middle is weak.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Necessary distances" frames the father's obsession (backstory), shapes Mara's analysis ("the distance between staying and leaving"), and provides the final thesis ("The necessary distance, she understood now, was love"). The concept drives the dominant stake and alters Mara's understanding on the page. Present in setup (father's maze obsession), middle (Mara's grain reading reframes distance as measurement), and closure (final pronouncement). Causal pressure is moderate—operates more as thematic lens than tactical constraint. Closure linkage is strong.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Featherly determined" is labeled by other residents and mentioned once in narration ("Light as down, persistent as migration") but does not constrain or enable a visible on-page action with cost. It describes Mara's approach but never manifests as a tradeoff or friction. Ornamental use; swappable with "persistent" or "patient" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Intuit" appears twice: other residents "learning to intuit direction" in the setup, and Mara "intuited the answer in the grain's culmination" at the turning point. The second use drives the key realization that thresholds are about standing, not crossing. However, the mechanics are vague (she closes her eyes and reads by touch, but the leap to "peace or dissolution" is not dramatized through sensory detail). Present in middle and closure; causal role in one major beat. Closure linkage is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Analyzing grain in wooden furniture is signaled early (oak rail grain analysis), used in the middle beat (Mara traces the disruption at year twenty-three, fingers reading the story), and provides the vehicle for the climactic realization (rings that "suddenly smoothed"). The method constrains her investigation to tactile/visual reading and enables the final insight. Present across setup, development, and closure. Causal pressure is strong—the grain analysis directly shapes her understanding. Minor deduction: the grain's "perfect equanimity" at the end feels slightly convenient.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The drifting prism terrace provides atmospheric coherence and houses the oak rail (the functional micro-setting). It is present in setup, middle (terrace shimmer reveals other terraces), and closure (terrace as communal space for refugees). However, it does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—it functions more as backdrop than constraint. The oak rail does the causal work; the terrace itself is ornamental. Lyric reprise (first paragraph → penultimate paragraph glimpse) reweights the communal aspect but does not drive the ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"After the butterfly effect" establishes the premise (causality unmade, reality fragmented) and explains why the terrace drifts and residents must intuit direction. However, it does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page—no live clock, no urgency, no countdown. The temporal frame is static context rather than active pressure. Functional setup but no development or closure participation beyond atmospheric grounding.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The motivation "to discover why some thresholds feel sacred" drives Mara's grain analysis and dialogue with Thomas, shapes the middle realization ("about standing at the edge long enough"), and provides the closure thesis (sacred thresholds measure what distance means). Desire is dramatized through action (tracing grain, studying furniture) and tested through friction (grief versus understanding, loss versus distributed presence). Present across all three gates. Cost is conceptual—accepting her father's choice—but the tradeoff between wanting him back and honoring his vision is felt.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Fractured hush" is introduced via Thomas ("his fractured hush—that particular way survivors here had of speaking") and recurs in the penultimate paragraph ("The fractured hush deepened around them"). Tone is coherent—quiet, elegiac, meditative—and modulates subtly with Mara's emotional progression. However, the tone is more static mood than dynamic modulation under pressure. The final image ("heard her father's voice") charges the hush with warmth, lifting it slightly. Closure linkage is moderate; causal pressure is low.</comment>
