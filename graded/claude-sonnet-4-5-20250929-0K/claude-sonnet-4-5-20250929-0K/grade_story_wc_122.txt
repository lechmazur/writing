<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Oskar's motivation is clear and his deafness constrains his approach in meaningful ways. The shift from numbness to "quiet certainty" has causal groundwork through Marie's progress and the discovery method. However, the internal experience relies heavily on abstract labels ("emotional numbness," "quiet certainty") rather than embodied contradiction acting simultaneously in scene. Marie's arc is functional but her interior life remains thin—she arrives determined, reports feeling, and departs accepted—without the contradictory impulses or visible tradeoffs that would elevate characterization into the high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The story establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens: Oskar's experiments with backward recordings build density until Marie's conservatory acceptance reweights his sense of purpose. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (quiet certainty replacing numbness) with felt cost (years of isolation, abandoned performing career). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The one meaningful deepening occurs when Marie reports the effect and Oskar feels "a crack in the numbness," which narrows his emotional options and drives the method's spread. Cost is legible but muted—the "defeat transformed" phrasing in the final section borders on telling rather than showing the price paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cavern is anchored early with autumn/stone/goatskin detail and recurs with seasonal markers (autumn to winter). The broken needle and oscilloscope function as micro-setting objects that enable discovery. Spatial choreography is clean (workbench, entrance, lamplight). The cavern's acoustics subtly guide the backward-recording choice, and the final image links the needle's shadow to a frozen sound wave, charging the closure. Sensory detail skews visual-auditory appropriate to the POV but could layer tactile or temperature cues more densely in high-pressure beats to reach 8+.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—defeating emotional numbness—is signaled early and tightens when Marie's report cracks Oskar's numbness, then deepens when his reputation spreads and she gains conservatory acceptance. One clear pressure point: the method's success forces Oskar to confront whether his deafness has value rather than only loss. The resolution is Oskar's acceptance (Earned Stasis with visible cost: thirty years in isolation, performing abandoned). However, the escalation is gentle; no on-page moment dramatizes a choice between competing goods or a tactical constraint that narrows options under immediate pressure, keeping this in the mid-7s rather than 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—finding meaning in absence—emerges organically from the backward-recording method and deaf-musician premise. The broken needle and "filament of hush" recur with shifting meaning, and the final image (shadow as frozen sound wave) offers a non-literal answer. However, the last two paragraphs edge toward stating theme: "defeat transformed into something else entirely—a victory carved from absence, a symphony composed of the spaces between notes" is close to a Thematic Echo. The on-page discovery and Marie's sensory report do the real thematic work; the closing summary repeats rather than deepens it, preventing entry to 7.5+.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable, with perception filtered through Oskar's deaf experience (reading lips, feeling vibrations, visual oscilloscope patterns). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: close during the needle examination, pulling back for reputation-spread summary. The prose carries a distinct, slightly formal texture ("filament of hush," "mirrored quiet") that matches the contemplative stakes. Marie's single line of dialogue via sign is economical and advances plot. No head-hopping. Minor slip: "enthralling" appears once in Marie's signed speech and once in the closing narration, blurring voice distinction slightly, but the effect is minimal and does not touch closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high. The broken-needle discovery, backward-recording experiment, and method dissemination advance causality without padding. However, several template cadences appear: "He worked... He'd kept... He understood" in early paragraphs, and the final two paragraphs stack parallel constructions ("a way to enthrall... a victory carved... a symphony composed") that edge toward ornamental summary. The phrase "defeat transformed into something else entirely" is abstract when a concrete final image would land harder. No paraphrase loops or filter-verb stacks in peak beats, but the closing section drifts toward telling rather than showing the stakes, applying −0.4 for patterned summary in the closure zone and keeping this below 7.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of deafness, backward recording, and "composing with absence" is specific and non-obvious. The oscilloscope visualization grounds the fantastical premise in plausible technology (1920s recording studio remnant), and the emotional-numbness defeat inverts the expected narrative (hearing loss becomes creative asset). The "filaments of hush" and "mirrored quiet" vocabulary is fresh. The story commits fully to its premise without hedging. Risk distinction: choosing a deaf protagonist teaching through backward-recorded silence is bold and coherent. Proximity check passes; no famous-line echoes. The emotional arc—numbness to quiet certainty—could have been sharpened with a harder tactical choice to reach 8.5+, but the transformation is earned and memorable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Oskar is present throughout, his deafness constrains his teaching method (oscilloscope, visual patterns), and his choice to experiment with backward recordings drives the central turn. His acceptance of Marie's news and return to drumming in the final scene crystallize his stance. The character is indispensable—remove Oskar's deafness and the backward-recording logic collapses. Setup early, development through experimentation, payoff in final drumming and "quiet certainty." Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong, with visible cost (isolation, abandoned performing).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The broken phonograph needle appears in three beats: found three months ago (exposition), examined "that evening" (inciting idea), and mounted above workbench on first frost (closure gesture). It seeds the backward-recording idea and returns with reweighted meaning (shadow as frozen sound wave). However, the needle is not handled or causally active in the middle development—the oscilloscope does the experimental work. The final mounting is symbolic rather than a choice-altering action. Lyric resonance (seed → reprise) is present, but swappability is moderate (any studio remnant could trigger the idea). Setup and payoff present; middle beat is static description, capping near mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Filament of hush" is named when Oskar discovers the backward-recording effect and recurs in the method's description and closing narration. It shapes the teaching method (layering silence) and contributes to Marie's sensory breakthrough. However, the concept is more thematic echo than tactical constraint—it does not narrow a choice under pressure or create a visible tradeoff. Setup in the discovery beat, development through student reports, payoff in the closing "mirrored quiet" phrasing. Moderate causal work but high swappability (other silence metaphors could function similarly). Two gates clearly met, third (development constraint) is weak, placing this in mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Audibly muted" describes the backward-recording zones and appears in the discovery beat ("audibly muted zones"). It enables the teaching method but does not constrain an on-page choice with visible cost—the oscilloscope visualization does the constraint work. The attribute is present in setup and contributes to method development, but it functions as technical description rather than a tradeoff-forcing trait. Swappable with similar acoustic descriptors. Setup and development present; payoff participation is indirect (folded into "mirrored hush"), keeping this in mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Enthrall" appears once in Marie's dialogue ("It's enthralling") and once in the closing narration ("a way to enthrall others"). The action—captivating students through the silence method—drives reputation spread and Marie's conservatory acceptance, shaping the resolution. However, it is not irreplaceable; "captivate," "mesmerize," or "move" could substitute with minor edits. The action is causally linked to closure (Oskar's purpose is to teach through absence) but does not create a unique tactical constraint. Setup via Marie's report, development through reputation, payoff in closing summary. Moderate causal pressure, high swappability, capping near high-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Backward recorded songs are the story's core method: Oskar records drum patterns, reverses them, discovers "filaments of hush," and layers them under live performance. The method is signaled in the discovery beat, shapes all teaching attempts (Marie's breakthrough, reputation spread), and is referenced in the closure (drumming with "mirrored quiet"). Remove this exact method and the plot collapses—Oskar's discovery and teaching approach depend on it. Setup, development, and payoff all strong. High irreplaceability and causal pressure across multiple beats, with visible impact on Marie's arc and Oskar's purpose. Specific mechanics (oscilloscope, reversed waveforms) ground the fantastical premise.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The drum maker's cavern is anchored early (stone, autumn whisper, workbench) and houses all key actions: needle discovery, experimentation, teaching, closure drumming. The space's acoustics enable the backward-recording effect ("cavern became a place of mirrored hush") and its history (1920s recording studio) supplies the needle. The setting constrains choice (isolated workspace allows experimentation) and charges the final image (drumming through stone/bone). Setup, development, and payoff present. Spatial detail is purposeful but could be more tactile—temperature, echo, tool proximity—under pressure to reach 8+. Strong integration with moderate irreplaceability (another isolated acoustic space could function, though less specifically).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Faint rustle of turning seasons" appears in the opening line, and the story arc spans autumn to first frost (winter). However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—Oskar's experiments occur "that evening" and "through the night," Marie arrives "the next week," reputation spreads over unspecified time, and the closure occurs "on the first frost." The seasonal passage is scenic rather than pressuring. No live clock or deadline alters tactics. Setup present (opening), development absent (no mid-story time constraint), payoff is decorative (frost marks closure but does not force a choice). Ornamental time use, capping below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Defeating emotional numbness is Oskar's explicit motivation, signaled early ("emotional numbness that had settled over him") and tested through Marie's mirrored complaint ("I can't feel anything"). The discovery of backward-recording creates "a crack in the numbness," and the resolution shifts numbness to "quiet certainty." Friction between want (to feel/teach) and cost (isolation, lost hearing/performing) is present. Setup, development (crack in numbness via Marie's report), and payoff (quiet certainty, return to drumming) all strong. The motivation drives all major beats and is indispensable to closure. Visible cost and causal pressure across the arc, with specificity tied to deafness and teaching.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Mirrored hush" appears explicitly twice: cavern description ("mirrored hush, where sound and silence reflected each other") and closing beat ("mirrored quiet"). The tone—contemplative, muted, textured silence—is coherent through all turns and modulates with discovery (wonder), teaching (focus), and closure (acceptance). The tone charges the final drumming image and integrates with the backward-recording method. However, "hush" and "quiet" and "silence" recur so frequently they risk becoming ornamental rather than tonally essential. Setup via early "silence now" phrasing, development through method description, payoff in "mirrored quiet" closure. Coherent and purposeful but borders on over-insistence, placing this in mid-6s with credit for strong payoff linkage.</comment>
