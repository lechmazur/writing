<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's journey from grief to mentorship shows clear internal progression, and her teaching of Senna demonstrates consistent motivation. However, key emotional beats rely on therapeutic language ("that particular species of brokenness," "permission to feel") that distances rather than embodies. The final choice to continue mentoring feels inevitable rather than hard-won, lacking visible internal contradiction at the closure moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens early and maintains it through closure. Orientation is clean (who/where/when anchored within opening lines). The ending delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where Mara's broadened purpose—leaving cranes for others—reweights her initial isolation with felt cost (opening to vulnerability again). One meaningful deepening occurs when Senna's successful brooch validates Mara's recovery path, tightening the stakes around transmission of healing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory functions as more than backdrop: its "existed outside time itself" quality charges the healing arc, and the telescope becomes Mara's ritual anchor. The workbench with scattered cranes and the brass instruments create tactile specificity. The setting constrains choice (Mara climbs daily, uses the dome for vigil) and the final telescope scene charges closure by literalizing the "stars still burning" motif with cost—she must share this sanctuary.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (recovery from grief through craft and mentorship) is signaled early and tightens once when Senna arrives unable to create. The brooch assignment creates meaningful pressure, and Senna's success deepens Mara's own healing by forcing her to trust transmission. The paper crane system introduces a visible cost at closure (sharing coordinates means relinquishing private refuge), though the escalation is gentle rather than urgent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme of mourning-as-transformation emerges through concrete craft work and the "genuinely artificial" motif. However, multiple passages edge into direct thematic statement: "We're making permission to feel," "teach withering to bloom again," and the final paragraph's "quiet return to possibility" summarizes rather than images. The curtains-of-intention metaphor feels imposed rather than discovered, and the stars-as-hope closes on abstraction ("divine hope") instead of a resonant particular.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with consistent psychic distance. Mara's perceptual signature (blackened fingers, craft terms, astronomical framing) is distinct. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, with Senna's hesitation and Mara's gentle redirection carrying subtext. However, therapeutic diction intrudes at peak moments ("subdued ardor," "species of brokenness"), and some exposition explains rather than trusts dramatization ("something harder to name").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with varied rhythm and good sensory grounding (copper dome, brass instruments, blackened fingers). However, several paraphrase loops appear: the opening's "existed outside time" is restated in the penultimate paragraph; "genuinely artificial" recurs three times without reweighting. Metaphoric density in the final third (curtains/windows/shadows, stars/fires/pinpricks) blurs without taught pattern. The closing line's "withering back to bloom" repeats the earlier "teach withering to bloom" almost verbatim.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The mourning-jewelry-maker premise offers specificity, and the observatory setting provides fresh spatial texture. However, the mentor-finds-healing-by-teaching-apprentice structure follows a familiar template, and the emotional arc (isolation → mentorship → shared vigil) proceeds predictably. The "genuinely artificial" concept and curtains-of-intention metaphor feel conceptually interesting but remain abstract rather than transformed through irreplaceable particulars. Risk-averse emotional resolution avoids confronting the daughter's death directly.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mara as mourning jewelry maker is present throughout and her craft knowledge enables the mentorship that drives the middle and ending. She makes key choices (taking Senna as apprentice, assigning the stencil task, deciding to leave cranes citywide). However, the craft itself remains somewhat generic—we see little of the actual jewelry-making process that would make her occupation irreplaceable versus any other art form.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The tattoo stencil on vellum appears in one extended beat (Senna's assignment and creation). It enables a key choice (Senna decides what to reveal/conceal) and the resulting brooch validates the closure theme. However, the vellum material itself is never handled or described in tactile detail, and the stencil could be replaced with any template/pattern medium without structural loss. Missing setup signal and no closure reprise.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Curtains of intention" is explained explicitly in dialogue and shapes the stencil assignment, but functions primarily as metaphor rather than constraint on action. Senna's brooch literalizes the concept (curtains with windows), yet the phrase itself feels imposed—it's told rather than discovered through scene pressure. The concept doesn't narrow options or create visible cost; it remains thematic decoration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Genuinely artificial" appears three times as descriptive label (jewelry, stars, keepsakes) but never constrains or enables a specific action with cost. The paradox is stated rather than dramatized—we don't see Mara making a tradeoff between authenticity and craft, or Senna wrestling with the tension. It functions as thematic flavor rather than actionable attribute.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Illuminate" appears in Mara's instruction to Senna ("Not perform—illuminate") and governs the stencil assignment. The final paragraph returns to illumination ("enough light to work by," "illuminate the path"). However, the action itself is metaphoric rather than literal—no one actually lights anything on the page. The usage shapes one key turn (the assignment) but remains abstract rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Leaving origami cranes with coordinates appears early (scattered across Mara's desk, explained to Senna) and returns at closure when Mara folds another crane with the observatory's location. The method is specific and irreplaceable—the mechanics (coordinates inside, breadcrumb trail logic) shape Mara's outward turn and charge the ending by externalizing her private refuge. Signals intent, shapes closure choice, but lacks middle development.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The timeless observatory is established in the opening line and functions throughout as sanctuary that enables recovery ("perfect in its desolation"), ritual site (daily climbs, telescope confessional), and workspace (converted cellar). The setting's temporal paradox (centuries old yet outside time) mirrors the grief work and charges the ending when Mara shares its coordinates. The observatory constrains choices (isolated location enables focus) and the final vigil scene depends on its specific features.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Rock bottom" and "six months since her daughter's death" anchor the timeframe early, establishing Mara's starting point after loss. The "after" governs all choices—she wouldn't have found the observatory or begun teaching without hitting bottom first. Senna's "three weeks straight" work adds concrete duration. However, time doesn't actively tighten decisions; it's background context rather than live pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To teach withering to bloom again" is stated explicitly in dialogue and governs Mara's choice to mentor Senna. The motivation shapes the stencil assignment and validates Mara's own recovery when Senna succeeds. However, it's told rather than shown through conflicted choice—Mara never hesitates or pays visible cost for taking on this mission. The phrase itself is abstract ("withering," "bloom") rather than dramatized through concrete want versus fear.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Subdued ardor" appears explicitly once ("that subdued ardor rising in her chest") and the tone is maintained throughout—quiet intensity, restrained emotion, no melodrama. The final scene modulates appropriately (shared vigil, muted hope). However, the tone is achieved more through word choice than pressure variation, and the explicit naming of the tone breaks the effect. Coherent execution but lacks the modulation that would charge the closure image.</comment>
