<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maris's motivation is specific and embodied—her search for grandmother's memories drives clear on-page choices: descending to the chambers, scattering flowers, cutting into the heart. Interiority stays concrete ("facts of her grandmother...the living moments had been excised") and the final choice to enter the heart carries visible cost: her own deletion from the world above. Minor slip: the diviners' emotional stakes remain abstract, limiting their function as pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page with felt cost: Maris enters the heart and is deleted from the world, "another transformed thing," while recovering her memories. The causal lens holds: whale beaches → gravity fails → Maris traces pattern → discovers memory repository → enters with visible forfeiture. Orientation anchors cleanly (docks, three days post-beaching, dusk rounds). One meaningful tightening: scattered flowers point to the heart, narrowing her path to a single irreversible act.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The salt crystal chambers function as micro-setting that constrains choice: shifting gravity forces Maris to press against walls, the brine pool she must wade through, the heart's physical presence she cuts into. Sensory details are selective and purposeful—"gasoline-slick with dissolved minerals," "gleaming silence"—and filtered through her lantern-lighter's attention to light and texture. The whale's heart anchors the final image and enables the closure act.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (finding deleted memories) is signaled early and tightens through one clear sequence: observation → descent → pattern-reading → entry. The protagonist's agency drives escalation: she chooses to scatter flowers, wade into the pool, cut the heart, enter it. The cost is unmistakable and on-page: she becomes "another deletion" while the lanterns burn above without her. The price—her own erasure from present time—forecloses all return and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme (what happens to deleted things) emerges through concrete images—the whale as repository, memories crystallized as salt, gravity as measure of absence—without abstraction. The diviners' claim "deleted memories had to go somewhere" is tested and answered through Maris's discovery and choice. The ending offers non-literal resolution: she doesn't retrieve memories to the surface but joins them in "recovered time," reweighting the entire search. The final image (lanterns burning steady, gravity holding true) answers the opening instability through her sacrifice without stating a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Perceptual signature is consistent and specific: Maris notices lamp oil, mooring posts, lantern routes, the weight of objects—all filtered through her occupation. POV distance remains stable; narrative certainty matches her knowledge. Diction stays controlled and purposeful: "gasoline-slick with dissolved minerals," "recursive and purposeful," "the spaces where removed things went." The prose rhythm modulates effectively, slowing for the descent, tightening at the cut. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Zero paraphrase loops; information density is high with most sentences advancing multiple elements (setting, state, choice). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully: short declaratives during choice moments ("She pressed her hands against the whale's heart and understood"), longer accumulative sentences during descent. Figurative language is coherent and sparse: "gasoline-slick," "crystallized moments," salt-as-memory. The opening and closing lines bracket the arc cleanly. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence; propulsion is consistent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of beached whale + gravity distortion + deleted memories as physical mass is specific and non-obvious. The premise commits fully: memories don't return to minds but accumulate in deep-dwelling creatures, requiring literal entry to recover. Maris's grandmother being a lantern-lighter creates lived-in specificity (the route, the book, the knife). The transformation test holds: plot and emotional arc depend on these exact particulars. Risk-taking (protagonist choosing self-deletion as resolution) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. The piece avoids the explain-everything ending, leaving Maris inside the memory-crystals in a bold, committed closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Lantern-lighter role is present in opening paragraph, shapes her route and timing (dusk rounds), gives her the grandmother's book and knife, and her choice to descend "after her rounds" links occupation to closure. The role provides her perceptual filter (lamp oil, mooring posts) and her knowledge of maintenance tunnels. Removing this exact occupation would break the inherited-route motif and the lanterns-burning-steady final image that signals her absence.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Pressed wildflowers appear in three beats: carried as comfort (paragraph 3), used to read patterns (scattering across brine), and their meaning reweighted when she finds "crystallized moments" inside the heart (the flowers were her method of divination, the crystals are the answer). The flowers enable her middle turn (pointing toward the heart) and connect to closure through the pattern-reading that leads to entry. Swappable with other divination tokens but the specificity (grandmother's pressed flowers) ties to inheritance motif.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Gravity pockets shape on-page tactics throughout: Maris must judge steps carefully, catch mooring posts, press against walls during descent. The concept drives the inciting mystery (why gravity failed after the whale beached) and is resolved causally (absences have mass). Gravity stabilizing as she removes memory-crystals provides immediate feedback, and "gravity, at last, held true" charges the final line. Removing this element would collapse both the physical stakes and the thematic scaffolding.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Fluctuates mysteriously" is demonstrated on-page with varied constraint: some dock sections hold boots fast, others let her rise dangerously, gravity pulls then pushes then sideways during descent. The trait forces visible choices (catching posts, pressing walls) and its mysterious nature motivates her search for cause. The attribute enables the discovery (strongest near carved whale) and provides the resolution test (stabilizes as she works). Could be more tightly linked to a single pivotal choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>"Exhume" governs the entire arc: Maris must physically enter the whale's heart and extract memory-crystals, the literal exhumation that restructures the story's final third. The action is signaled early ("years searching"), prepared by her study of diviners' methods, and executed with irreversible cost (she is exhumed from present time). The cut into the heart and gathering of crystals are on-page and specific. Swapping for another verb (retrieve, discover) would lose the burial/excavation layer that links to deleted memories going somewhere physical.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Diviners reading coffee grounds are present early (paragraph 4), establish the world's approach to pattern-reading, and Maris explicitly studies their methods before using flowers to find the heart. The method shapes her attempt (scattering flowers to read spirals) which points her to the heart. It appears in three beats but does not constrain a high-pressure choice—the flowers work on first try without complication. Functional and thematically coherent but the mechanics don't create meaningful friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Salt crystal chambers are signaled early ("inland"), become the descent goal, and provide the physical constraints that shape the climax: vast pools, shifting gravity, the whale's heart surrounded by brine she must wade through. The setting supplies the closure resource (the heart in the center chamber) and the final image (walking docks inside memory-crystals occurs within this compressed recovered-time space). "Cathedral of stone and brine" anchors the tone shift. Removing this exact setting would break the salt-as-preservation motif and eliminate the climactic arena.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Three days ago" opens the story and establishes causality (whale beaches → gravity fails). The timeframe tightens Maris's decision: gravity worsens as the whale is carved away, creating urgency for her descent. Her nightly rounds provide the window (after dusk) for the attempt. The frame doesn't impose a ticking clock during the descent itself, but the progressive worsening ("strongest near where the whale's great body had been carved away") implies time pressure. On-page time during the climax is handled well (wading, cutting, gathering) without frozen-time errors.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Motivation is dramatized through on-page choices from the start: carrying the book, watching diviners, suspecting the whale, descending after rounds, scattering flowers, cutting the heart. The desire is embodied in specifics (grandmother's laugh, lamp oil and lavender, hand on child-shoulder) not abstraction. Friction is present: the cost is self-deletion, and she chooses it knowingly ("another deletion, another transformed thing"). The stake drives all major beats and the final forfeiture is scaled to the loss (her present life for recovered memory).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Gleaming silence" appears explicitly in the salt chambers and closure ("gleaming silence of recovered time") and is embodied throughout: the quiet dock rounds, the soundless heart, the noiseless final image. Tone modulates with pressure—contemplative during rounds, tightening during descent, crystallizing at entry—without breaking coherence. The tone charges the final image by fulfilling the opening's fractured gravity with stasis and permanence. The specific phrase recurs purposefully and the mood integrates with the memory-as-crystal motif.</comment>
