<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior life remains coherent throughout, moving from grief-curiosity to understanding through concrete anchors (box, compass, lace). Her choices track logically, but the final "understanding" arrives through exposition rather than embodied contradiction—Takeo articulates what she feels, reducing the cost of her realization. The renunciation or acceptance of inherited silence reads as told insight ("Mira understood") rather than a micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Takeo's slow speech and ritualistic precision are established but never constrain a choice or create friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates images (compass, lace pattern, bonsai) that converge at closure when Mira "understood" her grandmother's instructions. Orientation is clear by paragraph one (Mira, islet, post-rain, carrying box). The closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration—Mira reweights her inheritance from loss to cultivation—but the cost remains abstract: we see her follow the lace pattern and work the bonsai, yet no on-page forfeit or visible trade-off crystallizes. The final paragraph tells us she "understood" rather than showing a choice that forecloses a path, muting the felt cost required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The islet setting grounds the piece with vivid, selective detail: wet sand, twisted pine, driftwood table, post-storm breeze, cerulean horizon. The bonsai tools and lace constrain Mira's actions in the tutorial sequence, and the compass sits between them as a charged object. The setting's "rhythmically placid" quality reinforces tone and supports the closure image of patient tending. The environment does not force a tactical choice but charges the final image, qualifying for solid integration without reaching indispensability.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding her grandmother's unspoken legacy—is signaled early and drives the tutorial sequence. Pressure tightens as Takeo decodes the lace and Mira follows its instructions, but the escalation remains didactic rather than agonistic: Mira faces no live constraint, competing option, or visible forfeit. The ending reconfigures her stance (cultivation over recovery) but the cost is conceptual and told ("understood") rather than dramatized through a choice that narrows options. The accumulative lens permits quiet deepening, but the absence of a legible trade-off or foreclosed path caps the score.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—tending what remains, apologies woven into care—emerges organically from the bonsai lesson and lace pattern without overt moralizing. The closing image (sun painting "shades of apology and forgiveness," Mira learning "the precise blue of healing") offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the unspoken-apology question. However, the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary ("instructions after all… for cultivating what remained") and the phrase "the color of unspoken apologies" recurs as a motif without constraining a choice, reading more as lyric echo than lived cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and filters detail through Mira's grief-tinged lens. Takeo's dialogue ("each word arriving like a wave lapping against stone") sustains his slow-spoken attribute with purposeful rhythm. The prose modulates well between action and reflection, and dialogue advances understanding without exposition dumps. Minor slips: "rhythmically placid" applied to both setting and Takeo's voice feels like authorial echo rather than Mira's perception, and the final paragraph's diction ("holding space for all the words") leans slightly abstract for the established voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and figurative language is generally controlled, but the piece carries pervasive overwriting in peak beats. "Tides of remembrance," "meditation made audible," "color of unspoken apologies—that particular shade of blue that exists only between sky and sea, between truth and forgiveness" stack metaphors that blur rather than sharpen. The final paragraph compounds this: "shades of apology and forgiveness," "the precise blue of healing," "holding space for all the words" read as overlapping vehicles without clear tenor. Template cadence appears in Takeo's instruction beats ("This knot means… This space means… This crossing means"), and filter verbs ("felt something shift," "could feel") dull immediacy. Applying overwriting density (−0.5), mixed metaphor drift (−0.4), and template cadence (−0.4) totals approximately −1.3 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The bonsai-as-healing frame is familiar, and the lace-pattern-as-instruction offers a modest twist. The piece commits to its premise and executes the tutorial sequence with care, but the emotional arc (grief → understanding through patient craft) follows a well-worn template. The "compass that points to what was lost" and "color of apology" motifs feel ornamental rather than causally integral—they could be replaced with near-synonyms without altering the structure. No bold structural risk or non-obvious synthesis elevates the material beyond competent execution of a recognizable prompt.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Master Takeo appears early, frames the tutorial, and his slow speech and ritualistic tools ground the middle sequence. His exposition ("She was teaching, even in silence," "Your family's severance began long before you were born") advances Mira's understanding and his demonstration (working his own tree) enables her learning. However, his choices do not create a key turn—he observes and instructs but does not face a decision that alters tactics or cost. Present across setup, middle, and closure beats, he qualifies for mid-6s as essential scaffolding without agency-driven pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The compass appears in the opening box, Takeo handles it mid-story ("This always points to what was lost"), and it sits between them at closure. Its engraved script and The Persephone name seed the grandmother-as-sailor revelation, and the needle "trembling toward something neither could see" charges the tutorial scene. However, its final presence is passive—it does not enable or constrain Mira's bonsai work, nor does it return with reweighted meaning. The compass shapes one beat (the revelation) and appears in two others, but remains replaceable with any inherited artifact that holds mystery.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Tides of remembrance" appears once as a phrase when Takeo notes "the way memory returns, again and again, like tides." The concept colors theme—cyclical return, patience—but does not shape on-page stakes or alter Mira's tactics. It reads as thematic gloss rather than a constraint or resource. The story's accumulative pressure relies on the lace-pattern instructions and bonsai lesson, not the tidal metaphor. Present as label, absent as causal force.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Rhythmically placid" describes both Takeo's voice ("his voice rhythmically placid, like meditation made audible") and the islet at closure ("The islet breathed around them, rhythmically placid"). The attribute establishes tone but does not constrain or enable an action with cost—Takeo's slowness is mentioned, never tested. No on-page moment shows the trait creating a trade-off or shaping a tactic. Label-only presence without dramatized consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Diffuse" appears when Takeo explains the lace pattern allows "each revelation to diffuse through Mira's consciousness like ink in water." The verb captures the tutorial's pacing but does not drive a turn—the instruction sequence would work identically with "settle" or "unfold." The action is referenced once, metaphorically, and does not redefine options or recur at closure. Functional but easily swappable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The lace pattern is introduced early (paragraph four), Takeo decodes its sequences mid-story ("These loops indicate patience… These gaps, the space for growth"), and Mira follows its guidance at closure ("followed the lace pattern's guidance, learning its language of loops and absences"). The method shapes the middle beat (tutorial) and the ending image (Mira tending the bonsai). However, the mechanics remain abstract—we are told she follows the pattern but not shown a specific instruction constraining or complicating her cuts. Present across setup, middle, and closure with causal role in two beats, but its specificity could be sharper.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The islet setting is established early (paragraph one: wet sand, salt smell, twisted pine, post-rain breeze) and recurs at closure ("the islet breathed around them"). The driftwood table supplies a workspace for the tutorial, and the cerulean horizon provides a visual anchor for the "color of unspoken apologies" motif. The setting does not pressure a tactical choice—Mira could receive the same lesson indoors—but it charges the final image with post-storm renewal and open space, qualifying as micro-setting that supports rather than drives closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"After the severance" frames the story's temporal pressure—the family has "finally, irrevocably split" and Mira arrives carrying retrieved possessions. This past rupture motivates her quest but does not tighten present decisions; no live clock or deadline shapes her tutorial session. The timeframe is a one-time setup constraint rather than an evolving pressure. Present in motivation and referenced at closure ("the severance began long before you were born") but static, not escalating.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The desire to find "the color of unspoken apologies" is articulated by Takeo in paragraph nine and reprised at closure ("the precise blue of healing"). The motivation drives Mira's engagement with the tutorial and frames her final understanding, but it remains abstract—she never faces a choice where this want conflicts with a competing cost or fear. The phrasing is poetic but told rather than dramatized as friction. Present across middle and ending, shapes theme, but lacks on-page trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Cerulean regret" manifests in the ocean ("the ocean stretched endless and cerulean, holding its own quiet regret"), the horizon at closure, and the sun painting "shades of apology and forgiveness." The tone is coherent, modulates from grief-curiosity to measured acceptance, and charges the final image with color and mood. The regret remains atmospheric rather than verb-driven, but the cerulean motif threads setup to closure and supports the ending's emotional weight without becoming static.</comment>
