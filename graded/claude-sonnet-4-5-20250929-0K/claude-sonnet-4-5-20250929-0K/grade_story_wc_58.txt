<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is vividly realized through concrete objects (the crimson thread) and her professional lens shapes perception consistently. The Duchess's grief is embodied in the unmarked palms and her projection language, though the arc from total absence to "slow work of...returning" feels compressed given no on-page reversal forces the shift. Internal contradiction appears (the Duchess weeps, releases "something long held") but the choice to "stop explaining" arrives via Maren's suggestion rather than dramatized pressure that changes the Duchess's stance through her own agency. The final gesture (hand squeeze) reads as a micro-turn, not a fully earned transformation scaled to seven years of absence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly: Maren in the garden, the Duchess in the eastern wing, post-ship departure. The dominant stake—mapping the Duchess's return to embodied life—is signaled early and tightens through the thread object and the conversation. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the hand squeeze and Maren's framing ("intermission...between the person one was and...might still become") crystallize a before/after with felt cost (the Duchess's tears, years of absence). The lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through layered images (garden, carpet, thread, tears) and the final cadence shift reweights the stake. One meaningful deepening occurs when the thread connects past and present, though the Duchess's shift feels more invited than forced by prior causality.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The shadowed garden and eastern-wing chamber are established early with sensory specificity (rust/gold leaves, bitter chrysanthemum perfume, skeletal roses). The crimson thread functions as micro-setting, anchoring past (the carpet's pre-war map) to present and charging the final image as "a route home." The garden's role in the Duchess's mourning constrains her choices (she tends by projection, not presence) and the setting's autumn decay mirrors the stake. Spatial choreography is clean across garden and chamber.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether the Duchess can return to embodied presence—is clear from the letter and Maren's profession. Pressure accumulates through the conversation and the thread object, which narrows options by making absence concrete. The tightening occurs when Maren asks "what if you stopped explaining?" and the Duchess weeps, though this feels more like permission than a hard choice with visible cost. The hand squeeze and Maren's obituary-writing signal a shift, but no on-page reversal forces the Duchess to forfeit a live option or pay a legible price; the cost (seven years, unmarked palms) is retrospective rather than dramatized in this beat. Agency tilts toward Maren's facilitation rather than the Duchess's own decision under fire.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—grief as geographical exile, the work of returning to one's own life—emerges organically from concrete particulars (the thread, the untended roses, the projection metaphor). The crimson thread shifts meaning from historical map to "route home," and the final image ("intermission...between the person one was and...might still become") reweights prior material without a stated moral. The obituary-for-the-living conceit integrates cleanly with the Duchess's prolonged absence. Minor slip: "small sounds of grief" and "lonesome splendor" edge toward poetic assertion rather than earning resonance solely through scene pressure, but the thread's return and the writing act ground the theme in action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV through Maren is stable and well-controlled; her professional lens (obituaries, anchors, intimacy rituals) filters all perception. Narrative distance modulates purposefully from the opening's lyric remove to close interiority in the chamber. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven: the Duchess's "I project my presence there" and Maren's "what if you stopped explaining?" carry subtext and advance plot. The prose texture is distinct ("geographical exile," "erosion of years") with vocabulary apt to Maren's sensibility. One micro-slip: "lonesome splendor" as a descriptor of the Duchess's face reads slightly elevated for the otherwise grounded voice, though it remains within Maren's idiom.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high (the thread anchors three beats: discovery, conversation, closure). Clarity is strong with no loops or scaffolding. Minor overwriting in the opening: "its lanterns fading into the fog like dying stars" and "a landscape of lonesome splendor" cluster figurative language in quick succession without pattern-teaching. The phrase "a kind of geographical exile from her own life" and "the slow work of a soul finding its way back to the body it had abandoned" edge toward elevated abstraction that slightly tensions the otherwise concrete voice. No artifacts touch closure, so deductions remain modest.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The obituary-for-the-living profession is a fresh inflection on grief narrative, and the crimson thread as "small bridge across an unmapped distance" synthesizes the map/geography motif with the personal stake in a non-obvious way. The Duchess's projection metaphor (tending roses by imagining, showing unmarked palms) is specific and vivid. The piece avoids template grief beats and the final framing ("intermission...between seasons") reweights closure with earned particularity. Minor hedging: the garden-as-healing-geography and the tactile-object-as-anchor feel like recognizable writerly moves, though executed with care.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maren (traveler who writes obituaries for the living) is present from the opening and her professional lens shapes all perception. She makes two key choices: offering the thread and asking "what if you stopped explaining?" Both choices create turns in the Duchess's stance (weeping, hand squeeze, implied return). However, Maren's role tilts toward facilitation rather than a protagonist arc with her own stakes and cost; she observes and guides but does not undergo a transformation or forfeit a path. The element is essential to the story's structure but slightly ornamental to a personal conflict for Maren herself.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The crimson thread appears in three beats: discovery in the first paragraph, presentation in the conversation, and the closure image ("glinting like a route home"). Its specific property—weft from the pre-war map carpet—tightens the geography/exile motif and enables Maren's key question. Removing it would weaken the closure's charge. It functions as both object and micro-setting, constraining the conversation and reweighting prior material. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Explained absences (the Duchess's court absences "not as illness or madness, but as...geographical exile"; her projection metaphor) frame the entire stake and drive the conversation. The concept is present from the letter and shapes Maren's question ("what if you stopped explaining?"). It alters the Duchess's options (weeping, beginning to return) rather than remaining thematic background. Solid setup and payoff, though the middle development could press harder on the cost of explaining versus simply being absent.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Vividly descriptive" appears in Maren's method ("vividly descriptive" breath catches, pauses, trembling hands) and colors the narration (lanterns as dying stars, garden in rust/gold, lonesome splendor). The trait enables Maren's intimacy practice and constrains her to "sit close enough to hear the small sounds." It charges several images but does not create a visible tradeoff or cost on the page; the descriptive mode is consistently present rather than tested under pressure. Functional across beats but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Intimacy (Maren's profession requires it; she enters without knocking, takes the Duchess's hand, sits close) drives two key beats: the conversation turn and the hand-squeeze closure. The action is signaled early ("intimacy, a willingness to sit close") and shapes Maren's tactics. Removing it would flatten the professional frame and weaken the ending's charge. Solid causal role, though slightly swappable with "presence" or "attention" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Projecting presence (the Duchess: "I project my presence elsewhere"; "I imagine my hands in the soil") is explained in dialogue and defines her absence mechanism. It appears in setup and the conversation but does not constrain a middle choice or enable the closure turn; Maren's question is about stopping explanation, not about the projection method itself. The method is thematically consistent but functionally replaceable with any metaphor of disembodied grief.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The shadowed garden in autumn frames the opening, supplies the roses (which the Duchess planted before her daughter's death and now tends by projection), and the flagstones where leaves scatter "in patterns that looked almost like writing." It pressures the Duchess's choices (she cannot reach the blooms) and charges the closure via the outdoor/indoor contrast. Setup, middle reference, and a light payoff (wind, leaves) are present. The garden is purposeful but slightly swappable with another site of loss without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The timeframe (after the last ship sailed three hours ago) anchors the opening with specificity but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics after the first paragraph. No live clock pressures the conversation or the closure; the ship departure functions as mood-setting rather than a constraint on options. Present in setup only, ornamental to escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Understanding the geography of healing (Maren's stated reason for walking the garden) is dramatized in her use of the thread and her question to the Duchess. The motivation is signaled early and drives two beats (garden walk, conversation turn). It shapes Maren's tactics (offering the thread, framing the obituary as "mapping your own returning") and is tied to the closure. Friction between professional method and personal cost is implied but not tested on the page. Solid integration with visible choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lonesome splendor (applied explicitly to the Duchess's face; implicit in the garden, the fading lanterns, the eastern wing's single lit window) coheres across setup and charged moments. The tone modulates from the lyric opening to intimate dialogue to the quiet ending, supporting pressure without flattening. The final image (crimson thread glinting, Maren writing in deepening night) sustains the tone and charges closure. The phrase "lonesome splendor" as a direct descriptor edges toward self-annotation, but the tonal effect is otherwise consistent and purposeful.</comment>
