<comment>Mara's internal progression from viewing night-blooming flowers as defiant to understanding them as moon-rooted is rendered through concrete choices—arranging postcards, studying windows, gathering them with new purpose. The grandmother's handwriting provides a micro-turn that tilts Mara's stance, and the final mural concept represents a foreclosed path with visible cost (abandoning her prior artistic approach). Father Benedict functions adequately to apply pressure through dialogue, though his perceptual signature remains generic. Interiority avoids therapy-speak and grounds emotion in physical action (touching postcards, standing, gathering), earning the mid-7s despite minimal embodied contradiction.</comment>

<comment>Closure lands on-page as a Resonant Reconfiguration: Mara's new understanding reweights her artistic approach with a visible shift in her conceptual frame ("not flowers defying darkness, but flowers drinking in their element"). The piece operates under an Accumulative lens—density builds through layered images (amber pavilion, postcards, cathedral windows) that converge in the final paragraph's moon-as-rightful-sun insight. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph without penalty. One meaningful deepening occurs when the grandmother's postcard message shifts Mara's tactics, and the cost (rejecting her prior defiance framing) is conceptually legible if not viscerally felt.</comment>

<comment>The amber pavilion constrains action spatially (hexagonal table, spreading postcards, emptying of visitors creates dawning hush) and the glass panels provide a recurring sensory anchor that modulates with time of day ("deepened to copper, then bronze"). The cathedral windows function as micro-setting through Father Benedict's explanation, which directly charges the closure image by teaching Mara how to see layered transparency. Sensory hierarchy reflects Mara's artist priorities (luminous faded ink, backlit outline, spidery handwriting). However, the autumn-versus-winter timeline creates a small inconsistency (opening says "melting of winter's last snow" suggesting spring, ending says "autumn evening"), preventing entry to the 8-band.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake—understanding why certain flowers bloom at night—is signaled in paragraph one and tightens through the postcard examination and Father Benedict's lens metaphor. One meaningful deepening occurs when the grandmother's note reframes the question from defiance to identity, narrowing Mara's conceptual options and enabling the final mural vision. The tightening forecloses her prior artistic approach with on-page conceptual cost (she must abandon months of stalled work). Agency is decision-based (gathering postcards "with new purpose"), though the protagonist's alteration feels more received-wisdom than hard-won struggle, capping the score below 8.0.</comment>

<comment>Theme—beauty reveals itself in layers; darkness is relative to the perceiver—emerges organically from the cathedral-window metaphor and postcard particulars without explicit moralizing. The grandmother's handwritten "moon-rooted, darling" line anchors the thematic turn in concrete image and voice rather than abstraction. The final image of night-blooming flowers as "small cups raised to receive a gentler star" offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Minor deduction for the priest's "umbral tenderness" phrase, which borders on authorial elegance slightly outside his established voice, and for the closing paragraph's slight drift toward poetic summary rather than remaining anchored in scene particulars.</comment>

<comment>Third-person limited holds stable POV through Mara's perceptual signature (artist's eye notices "captured fire," "luminous even in faded ink," "dawning hush"). Dialogue carries subtext and advances understanding without exposition dumps; Father Benedict's lines pursue a goal (reframe Mara's question) through metaphor rather than direct instruction. Diction remains consistent within Mara's artistic register. However, "umbral tenderness" in the priest's speech feels elevated beyond his established plain-spoken voice, and the phrase "across the melting of winter's last snow" in the opening reads as narrator overlay rather than Mara's immediate perception, creating minor distance inconsistency.</comment>

<comment>Rhythm varies appropriately; sentences compress under emotional pressure ("She finally knew what to paint") and expand during reflective beats. Information density is strong—most lines serve dual function (postcards are both object and thematic vehicle; amber glass both setting and metaphor). Two minor loops reduce clarity: "through the hidden layers of etched glass in a cathedral window" appears twice with identical phrasing (paragraphs 6 and 7), and the autumn/spring timeline contradiction (opening "winter's last snow" versus closing "autumn evening") creates a scaffold artifact. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence; propulsion remains clean through the closure beat.</comment>

<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The synthesis of night-blooming flowers with cathedral-window layering offers a fresh angle on artistic-block narratives, avoiding stock epiphany structures. The grandmother's postcard voice ("moon-rooted, darling. That's not sadness—that's knowing your own sky") provides specific, non-generic wisdom. However, the mentor-figure-offers-metaphorical-key beats are familiar from writing workshop templates, and the emotional arc (stalled artist → catalyzing conversation → renewed purpose) follows a well-worn path without significant subversion. The piece executes its premise cleanly but does not take bold structural or perspectival risks that would elevate originality into the 8+ range.</comment>

<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Mara's profession as mural artist shapes her perceptual signature throughout (noticing "captured fire," "luminous," "vivid depictions") and directly enables the closure—her final vision of the new mural. She makes key choices: spreading postcards, arranging them in a new pattern, gathering them "with new purpose," and stepping into the evening with the mural forming in her mind. The artist trait is signaled early, constrains her lens across beats, and participates in closure. However, her decision-making feels received rather than hard-won—Father Benedict's metaphor does most causal work, limiting her agency slightly. Three-gate participation with moderate causal pressure places the score in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The postcards appear in at least four distinct beats: initial spread across the table, examination of their "luminous even in faded ink" quality, rearrangement "in a new pattern" after the priest's metaphor, and the grandmother's handwritten note discovery. Their yellowed-with-age state and the grandmother's message directly constrain Mara's understanding and enable the final turn. The object returns with reweighted meaning—from obsessive puzzle pieces to moon-rooted identity markers. Signaled early, handles on-page multiple times, charges the closure through the grandmother's note, and its specific properties (faded ink, soft corners, spidery handwriting) matter to the effect, placing it solidly in the 7–8 range.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>The phrase "dawning hush" appears once explicitly ("that particular silence when the world pauses between states of being") during the pavilion scene, establishing the transitional atmosphere. The concept implicitly shapes the piece's tonal progression from afternoon to dusk and thematically supports the flowers' transition. However, it does not constrain tactics or alter options on the page—it functions primarily as atmospheric label and thematic echo rather than as active pressure. Present in setup, developed atmospherically, and resonates with the closure's transition understanding, but lacks causal force, placing it in the mid-5s.</comment>

<grade>4.2</grade>
<comment>The attribute "quietly driven" is applied to Father Benedict in one paragraph ("quietly driven in his own way... hours examining the hidden layers") as summary characterization. It does not constrain or enable any on-page action with visible cost—his scene contribution is dialogue exposition, which could be delivered by any mentor figure. The trait is label-only without visible tradeoff or sacrifice that shapes his choices. Late signal (second half), ornamental use, and no cost connection keep it in the functional-but-replaceable band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>"Reckon" appears once explicitly ("I'm trying to reckon with something") and the action of reckoning—examining, arranging, listening, gathering—structures the middle section and enables the final turn. Mara's reckoning with the postcards, the priest's metaphor, and the grandmother's note drives the conceptual shift. However, the action could be swapped for "understand," "work through," or "come to terms with" without structural change—the specificity of "reckon" does not add irreplaceable causal mechanics. Present in setup, shapes the middle attempt, and contributes to closure, but replaceable vocabulary limits it to mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The cathedral-window metaphor is signaled early through Father Benedict's role and detailed in the central beat: layered transparencies (clear, amber, pearl) reveal different images by time of day, teaching Mara how to see night-blooming flowers as opening to "their proper sun." The mechanics matter—the layering concept directly enables Mara's artistic breakthrough. However, the method appears primarily in one extended explanation rather than being discovered through multiple attempts. Signaled, detailed with functional mechanics, and causally active at closure, placing it in the 7–8 entry band.</comment>

<comment>The amber pavilion anchors all on-page action: Mara spreads postcards on its hexagonal table, watches light change through its glass panels ("captured fire," "deepened to copper, then bronze"), and the emptying visitors create the "dawning hush" atmosphere. The glass panels function as both setting and thematic vehicle (transparency, layered light) that directly informs her artistic breakthrough. Father Benedict's arrival is spatially anchored ("backlit by the amber glass"). The setting is signaled early, constrains spatial choreography, supplies the light-transformation resource that parallels the closure insight, and participates in the final tonal shift, earning solid mid-to-high 6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>The timeframe "across the melting of winter's last snow" appears in the opening paragraph, establishing duration and seasonal transition that thematically parallels Mara's artistic thaw. However, the closing "autumn evening" creates a timeline contradiction (melting snow suggests spring, not autumn), and the time span does not tighten decisions or create urgency—Mara has been visiting daily without a forcing clock. The timeframe provides thematic resonance but does not constrain tactics or escalate pressure. Present in setup with thematic tie but functionally ornamental and internally inconsistent, placing it in the mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Mara's desire to understand why flowers bloom at night is signaled immediately ("the question that haunted her"), dramatized through on-page actions (spreading postcards, touching them, studying, arranging in new patterns), and carries friction (her work has stalled, she "couldn't paint her way through"). The grandmother's note and Father Benedict's metaphor directly address and resolve the motivating question. The cost is legible—abandoning her prior "defiant creatures" frame with months of stalled work forfeited. Three-gate participation with dramatized conflict and visible cost at closure places it solidly in the 7+ range.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>The phrase "umbral tenderness" appears once explicitly in Father Benedict's characterization and the tone is sustained through imagery: "soft and indistinct" outline, "quietly driven," "gentle" speech, "dawning hush," flowers as "small cups raised to receive a gentler star." The tone modulates appropriately—measured and contemplative throughout, intensifying slightly at the grandmother's note and the final vision. However, "umbral tenderness" in Benedict's dialogue moment feels slightly elevated beyond the established plain register, and the tone remains relatively static rather than modulating sharply with pressure. Present, coherent, charges the final image, but single-register throughout, placing it in mid-6s.</comment>
