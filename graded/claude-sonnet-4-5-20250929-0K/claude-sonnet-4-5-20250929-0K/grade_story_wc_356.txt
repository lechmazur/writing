<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is well-developed with embodied contradictions—her ambition versus acceptance, her sensitivity as both gift and curse. The journey from driven herbalist to someone who understands endurance shows credible internal conflict. However, the transformation feels somewhat summary-driven in the final third; the key epiphany ("serenity within motion did not mean eliminating discomfort") arrives through reflection rather than a dramatized choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The grandmother's doodles and journal work consistently, but the final wisdom-sharing moment lacks the micro-choice tension that would elevate the change.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes clear orientation early (treetop workshop, herbalist, three-year search) and follows a coherent Accumulative lens: planting → weeks of endurance → bloom → village sharing. The closure offers Resonant Reconfiguration through Mira's transformed stance, and the conceptual cost (enduring what cannot be controlled) is legible. One meaningful deepening occurs when her racing thoughts quiet in the flower's presence. The "tide of thought" phrase bookends effectively, but the village gathering at the end feels slightly convenient—villagers arrive "drawn by curiosity and by reports" without prior dramatization of that pressure building.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Veyla's treetop village is established with purposeful detail: canopy bridges, suspended pots, constant sway, lavender sachets tied to beams. The setting meaningfully constrains Mira's herbalism—the "never standing on solid ground" creates the psychological need her work addresses. The corpse flower's suspended pot that "would sway with the trees but protect the delicate root system" demonstrates setting-integrated problem-solving. The windows opening at the bloom charges the final image with spatial consequence.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake is clear: cultivate the corpse flower to help villagers achieve "peace without stillness." Pressure accumulates through the weeks of enduring worsening stench, with Mira's own discomfort serving as test. The piece delivers one meaningful tightening when she must choose between abandoning the flower or continuing despite her sensitivity. The cost is felt but somewhat abstract—her "usually racing thoughts slowed"—and the resolution (villagers coming, sharing tinctures and journals) arrives without a visible tradeoff or foreclosed path that would sharpen the stakes further.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The theme emerges organically through the corpse flower's paradox: beauty through decay, serenity through discomfort. "Wisdom asks us to endure what we cannot control" crystallizes from concrete experience rather than arriving as platitude. The framed doodled wrapping paper and seven-year journal anchor the theme in particulars. However, the final paragraph edges toward direct thematic statement ("in that endurance, find not stillness, but grace") where a purely image-based resonance would have been stronger. The undercurrent metaphor works through the journaling practice and the flower's teaching.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Voice is consistent and carries a distinct lyric-herbalist texture: "wildflower hush," "petals falling through leaves," "architecturally strange." POV remains stable in close third with appropriate knowledge boundaries. Psychic distance modulates purposefully during reflection without head-hopping. The grandmother's voice in the doodled paper and whispered encouragement differentiates briefly but effectively. One minor slip: "the turning of the tide's thought" phrase appears in both Mira's journal and the narrative frame without clear attribution, creating momentary distance wobble.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with good information density and varied rhythm. Figurative language serves mood without overwhelming ("botanical air," "undercurrent of wisdom"). However, several minor artifacts accumulate: "blessing and curse" is stock; "the whisper of rot before it showed" and "the exact moment a bloom reached its healing peak" form a slight template pattern of superlative sensitivity. The phrase "at the turning of the tide's thought" receives explanation ("the old Veyla phrase for moments of transformation") that stalls momentum. "Ambitious" appears in both the opening description and the later "her ambitious plans," creating mild redundancy. Propulsion remains solid throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The corpse flower as teaching tool for "serenity within motion" offers a specific synthesis of the treetop-village premise and the character's arc. The seven-year wait compressed to weeks of testing endurance provides structural ingenuity. The grandmother's doodles serve as recurring motif that transforms from gift-wrapping to framed wisdom-artifact. However, the core emotional arc—ambitious professional learns to accept discomfort—follows a recognizable template. The treetop-village setting and olfactory-sensitivity angle provide freshness, but the resolution (sharing knowledge with gathered villagers) is fairly conventional for mentor-herbalist narratives.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's ambition drives the three-year seed search and the planting decision. Her choice to open all windows at the bloom and share her journals represents a meaningful reversal from isolated perfectionism. The trait appears in setup (searching, trading), middle (enduring the stench, noticing her thoughts quiet), and closure (teaching others). However, the final turn feels more like acceptance than a decision that forecloses options—she succeeds rather than choosing between competing goods.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The seed is handled across multiple beats: unwrapping and studying it, planting with "hours" of preparation, sprouting and growing over weeks, finally blooming to yield pollen for tinctures. Its properties (pollen that calms turbulent minds) are established early and paid off at closure. The wrapping paper with doodles receives secondary attention (framed on the wall at the end), adding a lyric reprise. The flower's unique stench-as-teaching mechanism is irreplaceable and drives the middle endurance test.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "undercurrent of wisdom" phrase appears early in Mira's journal practice ("wisdom moved like an undercurrent beneath daily life") and is referenced in her final teaching ("Wisdom asks us to endure"). It shapes her methodology (meticulous journaling to perceive patterns) and the flower's teaching arrives as an undercurrent she was "too driven to notice." The concept charges the thematic closure but does not materially constrain a middle choice—Mira's tactics (endure, journal, wait) don't shift based on perceiving the undercurrent itself.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Olfactory sensitivity is established as both gift (detecting "subtlest shift," "whisper of rot") and curse (windows open in winter, lavender sachets everywhere). It drives the central conflict: her nose makes the corpse flower's challenge uniquely difficult for her. Middle beats show her tying cloth across her face and burning incense—visible adaptations with cost. The trait enables her professional skill and forces the endurance test that yields insight, making it causally essential.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Journalizing appears in setup (leather-bound book with seven years of observations, the planting entry), middle ("meticulous journal entries" where she notices her thoughts slowing), and closure (sharing her journals with villagers). It represents her methodology and embodies the "undercurrent of wisdom" concept. However, the specific act of writing does not drive a key turn—the flower teaches her regardless, and the journals function more as record than as tool that alters her tactics under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The doodled wrapping paper appears at the seed's arrival ("vines and smiling suns, a family custom meant to turn every gift into a story") and returns at closure (framed on her wall, shown to villagers). It signals the grandmother's teaching tradition and adds lyric resonance. However, the custom itself—doodling on wrapping—does not mechanically shape any attempt or constrain a choice. It functions as motif rather than method that alters Mira's approach to the flower or her work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Veyla's treetop village is established early with specific constraints: canopy bridges, suspended living, "constant sway," "never standing on solid ground," "psychological toll" of perpetual motion. The setting generates the need Mira addresses (serenity within motion) and shapes her solution (suspended pot design). The village's physical properties are irreplaceable to the stakes. However, after setup, the setting recedes during the middle endurance test—Mira's workshop becomes the focus, and the broader village returns only at closure when villagers arrive.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The phrase "at the turning of the tide's thought" appears in Mira's planting journal entry and is described as "the old Veyla phrase for moments of transformation." It returns implicitly at closure: "The tide of thought had turned indeed." The timeframe functions more as thematic marker than live pressure—no ticking clock shapes Mira's middle tactics. The seven-year bloom cycle is mentioned but the weeks of growth are summarized without temporal urgency that alters decisions.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The desire to "cultivate serenity within motion" is established as Mira's goal (helping villagers find "peace without stillness, balance within the perpetual dance") and is tested through her own need to endure the flower's discomfort while continuing her work. The motivation shapes her planting decision and her choice to persist despite the stench. At closure, she achieves it by accepting rather than eliminating discomfort. However, the motivation is largely told and reflected upon; we don't see Mira wrestling between abandoning the goal versus another path with visible friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The "wildflower hush" tone appears explicitly when describing her quieted thoughts and implicitly in the lyric, patient narration ("soft as petals falling through leaves"). The prose maintains a contemplative, botanical register throughout—no jarring tonal breaks. The tone modulates subtly: ambitious energy at the planting, endurance during the middle, serene teaching at closure. However, "wildflower hush" as a specific tonal signature could be more consistently embodied in syntax and rhythm; the final paragraph's direct wisdom-statements shift toward declarative instruction rather than sustaining the hush.</comment>
