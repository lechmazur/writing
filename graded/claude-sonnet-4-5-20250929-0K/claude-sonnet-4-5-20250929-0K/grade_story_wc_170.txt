<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vesper's doubled heartbeat trait is established but her choices feel predetermined by the commission structure rather than emerging from contradictory impulses. The interiority leans abstract ("two lives beating as one," "perceptively calm") without embodied contradiction acting in scene. Her final recognition that she's given the city what her sister's death gave her reads as authored insight rather than earned through on-page friction. The motivation is consistent but lacks micro-choices that reveal competing values under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the mirage-painting accumulates through brushstrokes, song dispersal, and multiplying reflections until the final question-mirror and children's chorus reweight the city's relationship to possibility. Orientation anchors early (terrace, Vesper, spring morning). Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of children singing the code and mirrors learning to dream reconfigures the premise with conceptual cost (the city's fixed reflection-habit must yield to trained imagination). Cost is legible but oblique—Vesper departs having seeded change, her doubled heartbeat "singing its perpetual duet with possibility" charges the image without on-page forfeiture or visible trade-off in her tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The prism parapet functions as micro-setting: it catches and multiplies mirages, scatters reflections into puddles, and the wet stone terrace provides tactile grounding (footsteps, shallow puddles, breaking light). The bell timeframe tightens decisions (Vesper paints faster as the window closes). Sensory hierarchy is consistent—visual detail dominates but is filtered through Vesper's mirage-painter priorities. The environment constrains the work window and the parapet's refractive properties enable the dispersal, charging the closure when children's voices rise from balconies below.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: persuade mirrors to show possibilities before full morning arrives. Pressure accumulates through the bell timeframe and the spreading lullaby, with one meaningful tightening when the first bell tolls and Vesper paints faster. Agency is present in her method (coded song, mirage brushstrokes) but the escalation is environmental (bells tolling, daylight approaching) rather than driven by protagonist choice that narrows live options. The resolution—mirages disperse, children sing—lands with conceptual cost (the city's imagination must now shift) but no visible personal price or trade-off that Vesper enacts on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: mirrors showing fixed reality versus possibilities, the doubled heartbeat as lens for alternate truths, and the mirage painter's work rewriting perception through song. The final question-mirror ("What else could you be?") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The piece resists tidy resolution—the city's transformation is seeded, not completed. Minor slip: the line "the gift of seeing beyond the single, fixed reflection, into the infinite mirror-maze of what might yet be" edges toward thesis statement, though it's embedded in Vesper's felt recognition rather than authorial intrusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited with stable distance and a distinct lyric register ("dusky harmony," "liminal moment," "mirror-maze of what might yet be"). Perceptual signature is consistent—Vesper notices refracted light, alternate truths, patterns invisible to others. Register occasionally drifts elevated ("calcify the entire culture," "portals to potential") beyond what the close POV earns, though it remains legible. Free indirect style is clean. No dialogue to evaluate. The rhythmic control supports the accumulative mode but some phrases ("perceptively calm," "borrowed heartbeat") repeat their conceptual work without fresh embodiment.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("prism parapet," "dusky harmony," "mirror-maze of what might yet be," "coded lullabies") without always advancing concrete pressure—multiple beats layer metaphor where sharper action would tighten momentum. Paraphrase loop: "elusive mirage painter" in the opening and "Vesper gathered her brushes and left the echoing terrace, her grace undiminished" in the closing recycle the grace motif without new cost. Sentence openings vary and rhythm modulates with the bell crescendo, but information density dips when abstractions ("spiritual drought," "failure of imagination") summarize stakes already shown. No major loops or scaffold, but the figurative load in peak beats (bell tolling, final stroke) competes with propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The mirage-painter premise and coded-lullaby method offer a non-obvious synthesis. The borrowed heartbeat as perceptual lens is specific and ties to the closure's doubled-possibility theme. Risk: the accumulative, near-lyric structure commits fully without retreat. Frictions: the Council commission frame and "persuade mirrors" language echo workshop-prompt idiom; the "two lives beating as one" and "infinite mirror-maze" metaphors, while vivid, trend toward familiar symbolic territory (duality, reflection, potential). Transformation is present in execution—painted air, dawn mist pigments, children as carriers—but the emotional arc (solitary artist completes commission, departs fulfilled) follows a recognizable template without a sharp counter-pressure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Vesper is present throughout and her choices (painting mirages, embedding the lullaby, adding the final question-mirror) drive all major beats. She is seeded early, shapes the middle work, and her departure frames closure. However, her decisions feel procedural—executing the commission as designed—rather than reversals that test commitment. The final recognition (giving the city what her sister's death gave her) reweights thematically but does not alter her tactics or foreclose a live path with on-page cost. Causal role is strong; cost visibility is weaker.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The prism parapet appears in the opening image, is used functionally in the middle (catches and multiplies mirages, scatters reflections), and its refractive work enables the dispersal that charges closure. It is handled across at least two beats and returns with evolved meaning—from ornate stonework to active multiplier of impossible reflections. Specificity is high (prismatic properties matter) and it constrains Vesper's method (she must work on this terrace at this time). Minor gap: it does not impose a visible cost or complication that Vesper must work around.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The borrowed heartbeat is seeded early and returns in the final paragraph ("doubled pulse in her chest grow stronger"), framing Vesper's perceptual gift. It informs her "perceptively calm" trait and the "dusky harmony" rhythm she weaves into the lullaby. However, it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics on the page—it functions as backstory explanation and thematic parallel (two heartbeats = seeing dual possibilities) rather than a live stake or cost. The concept is present and thematically resonant but not causally active in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Perceptively calm" is mentioned once as an abstract trait ("made her perceptively calm in situations that unraveled others") without dramatization. No on-page moment shows Vesper remaining calm under pressure in a way that enables or constrains a choice with visible cost. Her work proceeds smoothly; the bell timeframe tightens urgency but does not test her composure. The trait is present as label-only exposition and does not shape tactics or the final image.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Grace" appears in the opening ("moved with grace across the wet stone") and closing ("her grace undiminished") as a framing attribute. It does not drive a turn or constrain a choice—it characterizes Vesper's bearing but is easily swappable with poise, fluidity, or composure. The reprise at closure reaffirms continuity but does not reweight prior material or articulate cost. Lyric symmetry is present but causal work is minimal.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Coded lullabies are seeded early (Council's commission requires embedding instructions in children's songs), shape the middle work (Vesper hums and weaves melody through brushstrokes, repeating the tune), and appear at closure (children sing her lullaby, voices carrying the code). The method is specific (song spreads organically, rewires engagement with reflection) and is used across three beats. Minor gap: the mechanics are told rather than tested—no complication arises from the method, and the song's success is asserted (children already echo it) rather than earned through friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The echoing terrace is anchored early (high place, wet stone, prism parapet) and its spatial properties matter—height allows sound to reach balconies below, the terrace provides the stage for mirage-painting. Spring is signaled (last raindrops, warming breath, breaking light) and the season's renewal echoes the theme of possibility. The setting enables the work and the acoustic "echoing" quality charges the children's voices rising in response. It does not impose a visible constraint or complicate Vesper's tactics, but it participates in closure through the sound dispersal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The timeframe is seeded early ("hush before bells ring," "when the city below held its breath between sleeping and waking") and tightens tactics throughout. Vesper works knowing her window is closing; the first bell tolling prompts her to paint faster; the cathedral bells' crescendo declares the day begun and the mirages must be complete. The clock is live, tracked, and alters moves on the page. It shapes two beats (mid-work urgency, final stroke before crescendo) and participates in closure (mirages disperse as day begins). Cost is implicit—daylight logic would dismiss the work—but the pressure is undeniable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The motivation (persuade mirrors to show possibilities) is stated early, frames the commission, and drives Vesper's method (coded lullabies, mirage-painting). It shapes the middle work and is present at closure (mirrors learning to dream, the question-mirror). However, it is told via the Council's belief and Vesper's understanding rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or costs. Vesper experiences no friction between the commission and a personal desire; her goal aligns smoothly with her gift. The motivation is functional and causal but not tested by on-page trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Dusky harmony" appears once as a descriptor for the doubled heartbeat's rhythm. Tone throughout is lyric, reflective, and hopeful—spring warmth, breaking light, children's voices, possibility over fixed reality. The tone is coherent and modulates subtly (quiet opening, building urgency as bells toll, expansive closure). It charges the final image (perpetual duet with possibility) but "dusky" as a modifier is not sustained or recurrent; the harmony motif returns implicitly in the lullaby and doubled pulse but the exact phrase does not anchor the tonal arc. Thematic resonance is present; the specific tone element is under-integrated.</comment>
