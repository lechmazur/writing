<comment>Marina's interiority is concrete and her arc from anger through understanding to a choice that honors complexity is earned through the statue's layered revelations. The emotional progression is credible—she moves through reeling shock, trembling anger, and finally to a stance that welcomes nuance—with embodied markers (trembling hand, watching bubbles spiral) grounding each shift. The statue's consciousness is distinct and its "incisively kind" pressure shapes Marina's micro-choices throughout. Minor: the architect's horror and Marina's epiphany about "threading understanding" occasionally drift toward thesis-statement clarity rather than fully dramatized contradiction.</comment>

<comment>Lens is Accumulative/Textural: the statue's cascading memories deepen Marina's understanding in waves, culminating in her decision to "thread it through their certainties" with the ampoule as evidence—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where options are crystallized and cost is felt. Orientation anchors early (Marina floats before the statue, oxygen gauge ticking toward red, underwater garden). The closure lands on the page with conceptual cost: Marina accepts the weight of carrying moral complexity upward, and the statue's final stillness marks the trade. One slip: the architect's backstory arrives as a large reflective block, but it anchors to the present discovery of the ampoule and tilts Marina's stance, satisfying BRR.</comment>

<comment>The underwater garden is vividly particular (animate stone fish, foxglove-stained ampoule, marble children as sentinels, anemone-dressed scales) and filtered through Marina's professional diver lens. The ampoule—a micro-setting object—constrains her choice by serving as material evidence and charging the final ascent image. Spatial choreography is clean: Marina floats, the statue is on a pedestal, bubbles spiral upward toward the salvage ship. The setting's transformation from tragedy-site to moral reckoning-site charges the closure without overt symbolism.</comment>

<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake is clear early: Marina's need to understand the catastrophe's true nature, escalating from "comfortable lie" shock to the moral weight of what to tell the surface. The statue's revelations tighten options by forcing Marina to choose between simple narrative and cascading complexity; her decision to "tell them everything" and "thread it through their certainties" is protagonist-driven and forecloses the easier path of declaring victims or villains. The oxygen gauge ticking toward red adds situational pressure. Cost is legible: Marina accepts the burden of nuance and the statue's three-hundred-year vigil ends, a visible price paid on the page.</comment>

<grade>8.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—moral complexity resists simple narratives; justice and beauty may drown together—emerges entirely from the architect's choice, the garden's colonized monuments, and Marina's final stance. The foxglove ampoule and "threading" recur with shifting weight, and the statue's question "Monster or hero? Neither or both?" is answered not with a thesis but with Marina's embodied choice to carry paradox upward. The ending offers a resonant non-literal answer: "I can finally stop breathing" reweights the architect's condemned witness and Marina's inheritance of testimonial duty. No overt moralizing; subtext in "tragedy requires innocence" and "structural weaknesses" operates through image and implication.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Single POV, third-person limited, with tight focalization through Marina's perceptions (oxygen gauge, trembling hand, "new eyes"). Psychic distance is controlled; the statue's telepathy is clearly cued and italicized, distinct from Marina's internal voice. Diction is elevated but consistent with an educated diver processing philosophical weight ("cascading revelations," "incisively kind," "structural weaknesses in her certainty"). Minor: phrases like "incisively kind" and "thread understanding through time" occasionally feel slightly abstracted for peak pressure, though they remain voice-plausible. The statue's italicized consciousness carries distinct syntax and warmth; no head-hopping.</comment>

<comment>Prose is dense and propulsive with high information load per sentence; figurative language (brine through hairline cracks, coral colonizing monuments, bubbles spiraling) is purposeful and vivid. Rhythm modulates well between the statue's layered memories and Marina's present-tense choices. Minor loop: "incisively kind" appears twice in close proximity as a descriptor for the statue's consciousness, and "cascading revelations" / "thread" recur frequently without always adding new pressure. The "threading" motif borders on over-reliance but remains functional. No clarity loss or scaffold detected; sentence openings vary and paragraphs breathe appropriately.</comment>

<comment>The combination of living telepathic statue, digitalis-poisoned mortar, and underwater moral archaeology is specific and non-obvious; the architect's choice to drown beauty for justice transforms the "sunken city" trope. The statue as condemned witness who can "finally stop breathing" at closure is a memorable inflection. Marina's profession (diver, documentarian) and the ampoule as forensic evidence integrate organically. The piece commits fully to its premise without hedging moral ambiguity. Minor: the "welcoming nuance into certainty" frame occasionally reads as a thesis delivered rather than discovered, nudging the originality slightly toward prompt-responsiveness.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>8.7</grade>
<comment>The living statue with telepathy is indispensable: it reveals the architect's intent through layered memories, poses the central moral question ("Monster or hero?"), observes Marina's readiness for nuance, and its final choice to stop breathing provides the closure beat. Present in setup (stirred when Marina finds the ampoule), development (threads revelations and questions), and payoff (wraps consciousness around Marina one last time, then stills). The statue's consciousness drives at least three beats and the ending's charge. Its telepathy is the mechanism for "cascading revelations" and its marble lungs pulling brine anchor the animate-lifeless tone. Highly specific; no substitute would preserve the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The foxglove-stained glass ampoule is signaled early (Marina finds it wedged between pedestal stones an hour ago), triggers the statue's awakening, serves as forensic evidence of the architect's poison plot, and reappears at closure ("the ampoule secure") as Marina ascends with proof. It shapes two beats: discovery that prompts revelation, and the decision to carry it as evidence upward. Its purple-tinged contents and digitalis link ground the poison method. It could be swapped for another poison artifact with minor edits, preventing a higher score, but its glass preservation and color specificity add charge.</comment>

<grade>8.4</grade>
<comment>Cascading revelations structure the entire piece: the statue's telepathic memories arrive in layers (garden before flood, architect's face, poison in mortar, deliberate sinking, workers' escape, aristocrats' tea), each reweighting Marina's certainty and narrowing her options. The concept drives escalation (from anger to nuance) and tactics (Marina must choose what story to tell). It appears in setup ("telepathic cascade it had unleashed"), development (the architect's motivations unfold in waves), and payoff (Marina vows to "thread it through their certainties"). The method—telepathy through structural cracks—ties directly to this concept. Essential to the story's causal engine.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>"Incisively kind" is attributed to the statue's consciousness twice and governs its approach: precise yet compassionate pressure that guides Marina through anger to understanding without forcing conclusions. It enables the statue's choice to wait three centuries for "someone ready to welcome nuance" and constrains it from offering simple answers. The trait shapes at least two beats (observing Marina's anger, wrapping her in benediction) and charges the final exchange. Label appears twice, but the trait is demonstrated through the statue's patient questioning and gentle refusal to simplify ("Neither or both?"). Visible in action, though slightly abstract.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>"Thread" recurs as the key action: the statue threads revelations through Marina's certainty, the architect threaded telepathy through the statue, Marina vows to thread complexity through historians' certainties. It defines tactics (how truth is delivered) and shapes the closure image (Marina ascending to thread understanding upward). Present in development (statue's method) and payoff (Marina's vow). The verb's connotation—weaving through structural gaps—ties to the "structural weakness" method. Strongly integrated, though slightly overused as a verbal motif. Major turns trace to this action; swapping it would require reimagining the delivery mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>"Through structural weakness" governs both plot mechanics (digitalis weakening mortar, causing incremental flooding) and thematic method (threading truth through certainty's cracks, the statue breathing brine through hairline fissures). Signaled early (marble lungs pull brine through cracks) and developed in the architect's poison plot, then reprised thematically at closure. It shapes the architect's tactic and Marina's metaphor for delivering nuance. Present in setup and payoff, but middle development is more thematic echo than distinct beat. The mechanics matter—controlled flooding gave workers time to escape—but the method could be simplified without breaking the closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>The forgotten underwater city garden is essential: its coral-colonized monuments provide the forensic site, the pedestal hides the ampoule, the marble children and animate stone fish mark elite exclusion, and the garden's transformation from beauty to reckoning charges Marina's "new eyes" moment. Present in setup (described early), development (Marina reinterprets the space), and payoff (she ascends from it carrying revelations). The setting supplies the ampoule, constrains Marina's time (oxygen gauge), and its history as reserved-for-elites space drives the architect's moral calculus. Spatial details (fountains, pedestal, bubbles spiraling upward) guide staging. Integral to both plot and theme.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The timeframe "after revealing the secret" anchors the piece: the statue has already unleashed its cascade when the story opens, and Marina processes the aftermath. It tightens decisions (oxygen gauge ticking toward red creates urgency) and structures the single-scene window. The "three centuries" the statue has waited and "an hour ago" ampoule discovery provide temporal depth. However, the timeframe is more framing premise than active pressure; the oxygen gauge does light work but isn't decisive. Present in setup and closure, but doesn't drive a middle beat. Functional but somewhat replaceable with another post-revelation frame.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>Marina's motivation "to welcome nuance into a certainty" is the protagonist's arc: she arrives believing in "comfortable lie" tragedy and leaves committed to threading complexity through historians' certainties. The desire is dramatized through her trembling hand near the ampoule, her processing of the architect's choices, and her final vow to tell everything. It's conflicted (anger versus understanding) and shapes her closure choice with cost (accepting the burden of testimonial duty). Present in setup (mind reeling), development (watching with "new eyes"), and payoff (the vow). The friction between Marina's initial certainty and earned nuance drives escalation. Essential and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.7</grade>
<comment>"Animate lifeless" tone is coherent throughout: the statue breathes but is marble, the garden is colonized yet frozen, the architect's consciousness lives in stone, the fish are animate yet mid-leap forever. The tone modulates with pressure (Marina's trembling, the statue's gentle insistence, the final stillness) and charges the closure image (the statue stops breathing, Marina ascends with "cascading revelations"). The oxymoron governs description (marble lungs, granite eyes watching) and theme (justice drowning beauty, monuments as living testimony). Present in setup, development, and payoff. Tone is purposeful and enhances the ending's weight, though it occasionally risks becoming decorative rather than pressuring choice.</comment>
