<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The carver's interiority is consistent and her motivation (understanding collective grief) drives the scene, but the transformation feels more told than earned through contradictory impulses. Marcus as spectral guide provides pressure, yet the protagonist's shift from treating grief as "isolated markers" to "collective memory" arrives through his exposition rather than her own struggle with competing needs. The embodied detail is solid (tracing letters, unrolling ribbon) but the peak choice—adding her own poem—feels like acceptance of instruction rather than a decision that forecloses a visible path with cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (carver, greenhouse, monarchs, Marcus dead seven months). The accumulative lens holds: the ribbon's verses build pressure, Marcus's teaching reweights her approach, and the final act (writing her own poem) constitutes a Resonant Reconfiguration that shifts her stance from isolated carving to collective architecture. Cost is felt but oblique—she releases Marcus and accepts the mentorship role—yet the closure image ("We are the carvers of each other's remembering") reconfigures the premise with conceptual weight. One meaningful deepening is present; the taught pattern (family poems as grief preparation) pays off at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The greenhouse functions as micro-setting: cracked planters, amber/green glass, overgrown herbs anchor the scene and constrain the encounter to a liminal space. The monarchs' migration provides a recurring image (opening, dusk pools of light, final departure) that charges the ending by mirroring collective grief patterns. Spatial choreography is clear (potting bench, glass panels, Marcus materializing between herbs) and the dusk timeframe tightens the tutorial window, forcing closure when "the last butterfly departed weeks later" and Marcus fades.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (discovering collective grief's shape) is signaled early and pursued throughout. Pressure accumulates through Marcus's teaching and the ribbon's reweighting, but the escalation is passive—she receives instruction rather than wrestling with competing choices. The final act (writing her poem) narrows options by accepting the mentorship mantle, and the cost (Marcus fades, she moves forward alone) is legible but understated. One meaningful deepening occurs when she "understood then" her isolated approach was wrong, yet this realization arrives through Marcus's exposition rather than protagonist-driven reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (grief as continuous thread vs. isolated tragedy) emerges organically from the ribbon, monarchs, and Marcus's mentorship without overt moralizing until the final poem line. The greenhouse-as-studio and butterflies-as-collective-motion motifs recur with purpose, constraining her thinking and charging the closure. The ending offers a resonant answer ("carvers of each other's remembering") that reweights prior material, though the line skirts thematic echo by articulating the thesis directly. Subtext operates in Marcus's spectral form and the ribbon's multi-generational verses; emotional honesty avoids sentimentality in the fading and her solitary continuation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filter verbs ("felt," "understood") serve voice without dulling immediacy. The carver's perceptual signature (noticing limestone's detail-holding, tracing inscribed letters, seeing monuments as waypoints) is character-specific. Dialogue between carver and Marcus feels natural and advances plot ("You're carrying more than mine"), though both voices share elevated diction that risks convergence. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. The final line's register ("We are the carvers of each other's remembering") reads slightly elevated for the POV but fits the established tone.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high; sentences often do multiple jobs (e.g., "His epitaph came from a Neruda poem he'd recited the last dinner they'd shared, before the cancer silenced his voice" anchors backstory, motivation, and loss in one line). Minor scaffold appears: "She understood then" and "But she understood now" are paraphrase loops that restate arrival at insight. The phrase "thundering calm" (monarchs' wings) is vivid but borders on oxymoron without clear grounding. Figurative language is controlled and voice-appropriate; no major template cadence or filter-verb stacks that dull peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The spectral-mentor frame and family-poem custom offer fresh angles on grief narrative, avoiding pure haunt-story or pure memorial tropes. The greenhouse-as-studio and monarch migration as metaphor feel organic rather than ornamental. However, the central turn—moving from isolated to collective carving—is somewhat predictable once the ribbon and Marcus's teaching are introduced, and the resolution (she adds her poem, accepts the mantle) follows an expected arc. The "carvers of each other's remembering" line synthesizes well but skirts proximity to workshop-epiphany phrasing. Transformation test: swapping names and setting would not fundamentally alter the emotional journey.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The carver's choices create key turns: she unrolls the ribbon (setup), "really reads" the verses under Marcus's prompting (middle), and writes her own poem (closure). Her occupation (gravestone carving) anchors her stakes and the shift from "too carefully, too separately" to collective architecture. Present in all three beats with causal pressure, though the middle turn is prompted by Marcus rather than her own contradiction.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ribbon appears in setup (carried in, unrolled across potting bench), middle (Marcus gestures, she traces letters, realizes the verses are "map of anticipated grief"), and closure (she rolls it up, selects pen, begins to write). Its woven verses constrain her understanding and enable the final act. The object's reweighting (from "beauty" to "practice for loss") drives the revelation and charges the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Spectral mentorship shapes stakes throughout: Marcus summons her, teaches her to see monuments differently, guides her hands through new techniques, and his fading forces closure timing. The concept is not merely thematic—it alters her tactics (approaching stones as waypoints, creating gardens of collective memory) and his departure triggers her final choice to add her poem and continue the work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Fiercely meditative" is suggested in her careful limestone choice, the way she traces letters with fingertips, and the greenhouse becoming a contemplative studio. However, the attribute is never labeled or tested against a competing impulse—she meditates without fierce resistance or cost. The trait is consistent but does not constrain a choice where the fierce/meditative tension would alter outcome.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Retrace" appears explicitly: Marcus says "You're retracing old paths," she traces letters on the ribbon, and the monarchs' "ancient routes" mirror her tracing of grief lines. The action enables the middle revelation (poems as preparation) and the ending (adding her verse to continue the thread). While central, the action could be replaced with "revisit" or "follow" without breaking logic; it's apt but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The family poem custom is seeded early (grandmother gave ribbon "three migrations ago," verses "traded across generations of family dinners"), developed in the middle beat (she recites each contributor's poem, realizes "trading poems at dinner" was "practice" for holding loss), and shapes closure (Marcus's Lorca is already on the ribbon; she adds her own). The method's mechanics matter: each verse is "inked in a different hand," anticipating future epitaphs.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ancient greenhouse at dusk is established immediately (monarchs on glass, tomato vines, cracked planters, copper light) and constrains the encounter—Marcus materializes here because it's liminal, abandoned, outside normal time. Dusk timing pressures the tutorial window and the glass panels' amber/green filtering creates the atmosphere of "thundering calm." The setting becomes their studio and its emptying (last butterfly departs) triggers Marcus's fade.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The butterfly migration brackets the entire story: monarchs arrive in the opening line, settle at dusk, prepare for night, lift again, and "the last butterfly departed weeks later" when Marcus fades. The timeframe is signaled and tracked, tightening the window for Marcus's teaching and forcing closure timing. However, the "weeks later" compression elides the tutorial work, summarizing rather than showing time's pressure on individual beats.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation is stated explicitly ("to discover the shape of collective grief") and dramatized through her actions: unrolling the ribbon, reading verses, asking "Why some griefs echo louder," and Marcus correcting her search location. Friction appears between her prior approach (isolated carving) and the cost of adopting collective architecture (letting Marcus go, accepting mentorship burden). The desire drives all three beats and the final choice to write her poem.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Thundering calm" is embodied in the monarchs' "thousands of wings beating in disciplined silence" and pervades the atmosphere: spectral Marcus is "translucent as morning mist," the greenhouse is "settling darkness," and the ending is quiet dissolution rather than dramatic confrontation. The tone modulates appropriately—contemplative in the ribbon reading, instructional during Marcus's teaching, elegiac at his fade—and charges the final image of solitary continuation.</comment>
