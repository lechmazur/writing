<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to preserve old temporal understanding is clear and consistent, though her choices remain largely observational rather than decisively tested. Internal contradiction appears briefly in "mysteries anticipated are different from mysteries lived," showing some complexity. The visitor and group members function adequately but apply minimal pressure. Emotional embodiment is present in moments like tracing the gold lettering, but the final gathering lacks a defining choice that forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the urn fragment arrives, Mira decodes it, posts the listing, the group gathers, and she explains the old temporal order. One meaningful deepening occurs when she articulates "mysteries anticipated are different from mysteries lived," reweighting the premise. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of visitors carrying "a fragment of fixed time in their suddenly timeless hearts" crystallizes the stakes and reconfigures meaning, though the felt cost is more atmospheric than decisively foregrounded on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The emerald silo is vividly anchored early and its transparent panels frame the ending star-gaze, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective: "green glass panels catching light," "gold lettering," "emerald tower." The micro-setting of Mira's collection arranged in "careful sequences" subtly guides the ritual scene. Spatial choreography is clear throughout the gathering. The silo's symbolic and physical presence constrains Mira's solitary work and shapes the group's convergence, meeting the 9+ threshold for setting as crucible.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving and transmitting pre-Shift temporal understanding—is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure remains steady rather than escalating sharply; the visitor's request, the coded listing, and the group's arrival form a sequence but not a tightening that narrows options. The piece deepens through Mira's articulation at the end, yet no on-page reversal forces a trade-off or forecloses a live alternative. Cost is more conceptual than viscerally felt: the visitors depart "carrying a fragment," but we don't see what they relinquish or risk in exchange.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—what was traded for timelessness—emerges through concrete particulars: the urn dates, the frozen watches, the ritual explanation. The line "mysteries anticipated are different from mysteries lived" reweights the premise without stating a moral. Subtext operates in Mira's method (coded listings to evade zealots) and the group's silent holding of the fragment. The ending offers a resonant image that reconfigures prior material, though the phrase "suddenly timeless hearts" edges toward overt poeticism. No explicit thematic statement mars the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable and clean throughout. Distance is controlled: Mira's perceptual signature filters setting and objects through temporal nostalgia ("time was a river"). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; the visitor's "I can't understand the numbers anymore" and the young man's "I want to rediscover what we lost" carry subtext and advance plot. Register is consistent, though "suddenly timeless" appears in both the visitor's experience and the final line, creating minor convergence. No head-hopping or filter-verb excess; psychic distance modulates appropriately.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual flow. Clarity and concision are strong in most beats: "After the Shift, when numbers changed meaning and calendars became decorative relics" compresses world-building efficiently. Minor scaffold appears in "After the visitor left, Mira added the urn fragment to her collection, a damaged time capsule of sorts—not buried intentionally but shattered by the world's transformation," where the appositive slightly paraphrases the preceding image. The phrase "suddenly timeless" recurs three times (visitor's grandmother, Mira's final statement, closing line), edging toward pattern without clear escalation. No major loops or figurative muddle touch the closure beat.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise—timekeeper after temporal logic collapses—offers a fresh angle on post-conceptual-shift narratives. The coded garage-sale listings and emerald silo are specific, non-generic anchors. The urn fragment functions as both relic and teaching tool, integrating world and character. The story resists stock tropes: no villainous Fluid Timers appear on the page; conflict arises from preservation versus loss rather than action sequences. Risk-taking is moderate: the accumulative structure and quiet ending cohere without gimmickry, though the final phrase "suddenly timeless hearts" leans toward poetic convenience. Transformation is present but incremental.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira appears in all major beats: she receives the urn, decodes it, posts the listing, hosts the group, and explains the old temporal order. Her choices—adding the fragment to her collection, writing the coded listing, conducting the ritual—drive the narrative arc. The final articulation "mysteries anticipated are different from mysteries lived" is a key turn that reweights the premise. However, the peak choice (gathering the group) feels more methodical than conflicted; no on-page moment forces a visible trade-off or forecloses an alternative path. Early signal is strong, beat involvement spans the story, and closure linkage is solid, but causal pressure and irreplaceability are moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The urn fragment is introduced early, handled physically ("traced the gold lettering"), explained to the visitor, featured in the coded listing ("1947 grams heavy with what 72 used to mean"), and passed around the circle in the climactic scene. It shifts meaning from personal relic to teaching tool to communal touchstone. Setup, development, and payoff gates are all met. The fragment's specificity (dates "1947-2019") matters: it embodies fixed temporal span in a world where numbers are subjective. Closure linkage is strong: "held the urn shard up to the light" in the penultimate paragraph charges the final image. Cost connection is implied but not sharply dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "damaged time capsule" concept frames Mira's collection ("a damaged time capsule of sorts—not buried intentionally but shattered by the world's transformation") and her curatorial work. It shapes her motivation and the story's central metaphor. However, the concept functions more as thematic backdrop than tactical constraint; it does not narrow on-page options or impose a visible cost. The phrase appears once, mid-story, and is not revisited at closure. Setup is present, but middle development and closure participation are weak. The concept could be replaced with a simpler "relic collection" framing without altering the narrative arc.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Suddenly timeless" describes the visitor's grandmother's experience, Mira's interpretive frame, and the visitors' hearts in the final line. It anchors the world-rule (the Shift) and recurs to charge the ending. However, it functions as atmospheric label rather than constraint: no on-page action turns on the characters' experience of timelessness versus measured time. Setup is early, payoff is present in the closing phrase, but middle development is absent. The attribute is thematically resonant but does not enable or constrain a specific choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Rediscover" is voiced explicitly by the young visitor ("I want to rediscover what we lost") and enacted in Mira's ritual explanation of pre-Shift time. The action drives the climactic gathering and defines the group's shared goal. Setup occurs late (final third), limiting early signal credit. Development is the ritual itself: Mira's explanation and the passing of the fragment. Closure linkage is moderate: the action completes but does not sharply reweight prior material. The action could be swapped for "remember" or "learn" with minor edits, reducing irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The coded garage-sale listings are introduced mid-story, explained with an example ("Reliable heating, reminds you of 2-3 minute intervals"), demonstrated in Mira's new posting, and trigger the group's arrival. The method's mechanics matter: price/pickup times encode coordinates, item descriptions carry temporal cues. Setup is clear, development shows the method in action (posting and response), and payoff is the group's arrival. Early signal is weak (appears after the 40% mark), capping the score. Beat involvement is solid (two distinct uses), and specificity is high. The method is plot-essential: without it, the group cannot safely gather.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The emerald silo is anchored in the opening line, houses Mira's collection "in careful sequences," provides the transparent roof for the star-gaze, and frames the final image ("Inside her emerald tower"). It constrains Mira's solitary work (she lives "inside the silo's hollow core") and enables the group's clandestine meeting (coordinates hidden in listings). Setup is immediate, development shows spatial use across beats (arrival, collection viewing, ritual), and payoff charges the closure. The silo's specificity (green glass, hollow core, emerald light) is irreplaceable. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The post-Shift timeframe is established early ("After the Shift, when numbers changed meaning") and pervades every scene: the visitor's confusion over urn dates, Mira's explanation of elastic time, the obsolescence of clocks and calendars. The frame shapes stakes (preserving old temporal logic) and world-rules (arithmetic is subjective). However, it functions as static backdrop rather than tightening constraint; no on-page clock or deadline narrows options. Setup is strong, thematic presence is pervasive, but tactical pressure is absent. The timeframe enables the premise but does not force a peak choice or alter the ending's cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Mira's desire "to understand the texture of time passing" is voiced mid-story ("These fragments help me understand the weight of what we traded") and enacted through her curatorial work and ritual teaching. The motivation drives her nightly gatherings and coded outreach. However, it is more told than dramatized in conflicted choice: no on-page moment shows Mira torn between competing wants or paying a visible cost to pursue understanding. Setup is present, development spans multiple beats (collecting, posting, explaining), and closure linkage is moderate (she maintains "the rhythm of befores and afters"). Friction between want and cost is implied (risk from Fluid Timers) but not foregrounded.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The tone of "anticipated mysteries" is established early ("mysteries anticipated are different from mysteries lived") and sustained through Mira's curatorial reverence, the coded listings, and the ritual gathering. The tone modulates subtly: opening curiosity, mid-story caution (Fluid Timer threat), final reverence. Coherence is strong; the tone charges the final image ("carrying a fragment of fixed time in their suddenly timeless hearts"). However, the tone remains somewhat static—consistently contemplative without sharp shifts under pressure. Setup is early, development is consistent, and payoff is solid. The tone supports rather than transforms the ending.</comment>
