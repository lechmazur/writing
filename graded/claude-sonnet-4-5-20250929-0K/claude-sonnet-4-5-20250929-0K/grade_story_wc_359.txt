<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's synesthetic perception is vividly embodied ("tasted sound as copper," "words tasting of ash"), but her motivation to save the bells feels asserted rather than dramatized through prior stakes. The descent into the cavern tracks a single goal without meaningful internal conflict or contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Her final choice—striking the ice column—resolves the Council conflict via proof rather than earned renunciation or personal cost that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The closure unit—Mira's recordings convince the Council—lands on the page as a Decisive Change with visible proof, but the cost (her risk, the Council's shift) is told rather than shown in the final beats. The amber sheet and sculpted hush unfold through aurora-light imagery, yet the causal linkage between striking the ice column and obtaining Council-convincing data feels asserted rather than dramatized with visible friction or price paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The ice cavern is vividly rendered with organ-pipe columns and aurora refraction through impossible angles, creating a distinct sensory signature. The amber music sheet and ice column constrain Mira's approach: she must position the sheet to channel light and touch the column with her bell-ringer's hammer. The sculpted hush as "negative space" and "geometric voids" is conceptually ambitious but remains abstract; the physical environment shapes one key turn (the column-striking) and charges the final image of bells scattering aurora-colored notes.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving beauty serves survival—is signaled early and drives Mira's descent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the cavern responds at the moment creation begins above, narrowing options to that exact synchronicity. However, the escalation lacks on-page friction: no failed attempt, no visible cost beyond the physical descent. The Council's unanimous vote resolves too smoothly; luck (the sculptor's chisel timing) complicates but arguably resolves, undercutting protagonist agency at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The theme—wonder as survival necessity—emerges through the sculpted hush and prism-song bells rather than direct statement. The final image of bells as "chisel strikes against the marble of forgetting" offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the ending paragraph's explicit moralizing ("she hadn't saved the bells... had saved them all") states the theme rather than trusting the image, and "certify wonder as essential" reads as prompt-like language. The sculpted hush as "silence so rich it contained every possible song" is evocative but borders on abstract philosophizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third, filtered through Mira's synesthetic perception. Diction is purposefully elevated ("pregnant pause between heartbeats," "oscillating repose") and consistent with the lyric-accumulative mode. Register occasionally drifts into abstract philosophizing ("wonder regulated heartbeat, that awe oxygenated blood") that feels more authorial than character-grounded. The final paragraph's meta-commentary ("she hadn't saved the bells... had saved them all") reads as helpful-narrator syndrome, over-explaining what the image already conveyed.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("throat of stars," "flower constructed of mirrors," "oscillating repose") without pattern-teaching or payoff, creating register drift in peak beats. The opening and cavern-description paragraphs maintain strong propulsion and information density. However, synonym churn ("unfetter," "liberation," "revealed," "unfolded") and conceptual redundancy (the hush as multiple metaphors across adjacent lines) dull momentum. The phrase "sculpted hush" recurs without evolving use. Zero orientation debt; spatial choreography is clear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The synesthetic bell-ringer premise and sculpted hush concept offer a fresh synthesis. However, the core conflict—artist versus utilitarian Council—is a template plot executed without transformation. The synchronized chisel-strike timing and the aurora-channeling music sheet feel like ornamental additions rather than causally inevitable elements. The final turn (Council convinced by data) resolves via proof rather than a non-obvious moral calculus or lived cost, and the ending's explicit thematic statement undercuts risk-taking.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's role as prism-song bell ringer frames her expertise and provides the hammer she uses to strike the ice column. The trait appears in the opening, shapes her sensory perception throughout, and motivates her descent to prove the bells' value. However, her decision to descend and her final action (striking the column) feel more about demonstrating wonder than making a choice that alters tactics under pressure. Two beats: the opening frame and the column-striking. Present in closure: the bells ring at the end.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The amber music sheet is introduced in the opening paragraph, handled when Mira holds it up to channel aurora light in the cavern, and mentioned again as "resonant fossil memory" when the tone emerges. Three beats, but its specific mechanics (how colors through its inscriptions unlock the hush) remain abstract. It enables the key action but could be replaced with another light-refracting artifact. Not causally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The sculpted hush is the cavern's central phenomenon and drives the middle sequence: Mira seeks it, it manifests as geometric voids, and she unfetters it by striking the ice. However, its mechanics are abstract ("negative space," "silence so rich it contained every possible song"), and it resolves the Council conflict off-page through recorded data. Present in setup, middle, and closure (thematically), but the concept functions more as atmosphere than as a constraint that narrows Mira's options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Synesthesia is label-present throughout: Mira tastes sound as copper, sees whispers as violet, and the Council Chief's words taste of ash. It shapes her sensory experience and her ability to perceive the aurora's chromatic language. However, it does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with visible cost; it remains a perceptual filter rather than a tactical choice-driver. No tradeoff or price tied to this trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Unfetter" is named explicitly ("to unfetter meant to release what had been bound") when the hush unfolds. The action—channeling aurora colors through the amber sheet to unlock the hush—occurs in the middle beat but is described rather than dramatized with friction. The major turn (Council convinced) traces to the recordings Mira obtains, not to the unfettering itself. Swappable with "unlock" or "awaken" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Aurora colors are signaled early (Mira translates "the aurora's chromatic language" as town bell ringer) and return in the cavern when green, crimson, and violet light pours through the amber sheet's inscriptions to unfetter the hush. The mechanics—light bending through the sheet—are gestured at but remain abstract. Present in setup and middle; shapes one key attempt. Not indispensable: another light source could substitute.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The ice cavern is vivid and present throughout the middle sequence: organ-pipe columns, aurora refraction, and the sculpted hush as geometric voids. It supplies the ice column Mira strikes and the environment for the unfettering. However, it functions more as stage than constraint; no blocked path or resource scarcity alters her tactics. Present in setup, middle, and closure (bells scatter notes "across the snow" above). Two beats with causal involvement.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The sculptor's chisel strike is mentioned once in the middle: "the exact instant when somewhere far above... a sculptor's chisel first struck marble... the cavern responded." It provides the synchronicity that triggers the hush's manifestation but does not tighten Mira's decisions or create a live clock. Introduced past the opening, used once, absent from closure. Ornamental timing device.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Mira's desire to "certify wonder as essential" and "prove to the Council of Practical Minds that beauty served survival" is declared in the opening and drives her descent into the cavern. The motivation is told rather than dramatized through prior conflict or friction between wants and costs. The recordings she brings back resolve the stake, but the final choice (striking the column) carries no visible personal price. Present in setup and closure; shapes two beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Oscillating repose" is named explicitly in the middle ("the oscillating repose that characterized all profound truths—the way certainty and mystery could dance together"). The prose attempts a lyric, contemplative tone with elevated diction and slow rhythm, but the tone does not modulate meaningfully with pressure: the opening and cavern beats maintain similar pacing and register. Static mood rather than one that charges the final image.</comment>
