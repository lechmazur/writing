<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and action-driven—her mathematical metaphor for honesty shapes her choices consistently. The father's reaction to exposure is embodied ("pale as the corpse") and his tears earn their place. The relationship pressure is clean: confrontation forces stance crystallization with visible cost (his freedom traded for rehabilitation). Minor slip: Vincent's "you're breaking the family tradition" risks stock phrasing, though it's brief and tied to his con-artist worldview.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Vincent's breakdown in the prep room crystallizes the antes (con versus rehabilitation) with felt cost—his daughter has documented everything and offered a treatment center. The causal lens holds: Mara's patience and observation enable the breach, her prep-room conversation with Jacobson an hour prior sets the trap. Orientation anchors quickly (funeral home, Mara at table, Vincent upstairs). One meaningful tightening when Vincent discovers she's already told Jacobson, narrowing his options to the treatment offer.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The prep room's "deathly vitality" and formaldehyde-and-flowers scent ground the confrontation in a space that enforces honesty—"everything false gets removed until only what's real remains." The ink pot's mother-of-pearl inlay and chrome instruments provide tactile anchors. Spatial choreography is clear (embalming table, second table with covered body, doorway). The setting charges the closure by making Vincent's breakdown occur in a room defined by final truth. Does not fully constrain a mid-scene choice, preventing higher band entry.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Mara's refusal to profit from lies versus her father's active con. The breach tightens pressure when she reveals her hour-old confession to Jacobson, foreclosing Vincent's escape. Agency is clear—Mara's documentation and timing force the trade (his freedom for treatment). Visible cost: Vincent loses his con, Mrs. Kowalski's money is implicitly returned, and Mara risks their relationship. One strong reversal (the ink pot discovery leading to preemptive exposure) drives the climax.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of honesty as "pure equation" and fair trade emerges through Mara's mathematics metaphor and the prep room's stripping-away function. The ending offers a non-literal answer—resurrection earned through vulnerability in a space of death—without moralizing. Minor drift: "you get yourself back" edges toward therapeutic abstraction. The ink pot's shift from fraud tool to "relic of authentic service" charges the closure image, though the connection could be tighter.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable in tight third over Mara; perceptual signature is mathematical and precise ("steady as a heart monitor's flat line"). Dialogue carries subtext—Vincent's "you don't understand the world" versus Mara's equation logic—and the lines pursue goals (persuasion, defense). Psychic distance modulates purposefully at Vincent's breakdown. Minor slip: "liquefied rigid thinking" in the asylum-paperwork description feels slightly elevated for Mara's present-tense observation, though it echoes her analytical lens.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well; sentence openings shift. Information density is high: "Mara had found the ink pot in his briefcase, recognized it from the estate sale of a genuine immigration attorney who'd died last month, and understood exactly what her father planned" compresses setup efficiently. No paraphrase loops. Minor template cadence in the opening exposition ("she was sixteen," "he'd say," "today's con") but it breaks before becoming intrusive. The closure beat is clean. "Deathly vitality" recurs purposefully to charge the ending.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The funeral-home prep room as confrontation site is a fresh, non-obvious synthesis—death's honesty pressuring a con artist's reckoning. The "mathematics of a fair trade" lens personalizes the moral calculus beyond generic redemption. Mara's preemptive documentation and her framing of treatment (not punishment) offer specific transformation of the "honest child versus con-artist parent" trope. Risk: the setup leans on familiar beats (forged documents, bereaved widow, estate-sale props). The ending's resurrection-in-a-death-room image is earned but not startling.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara (con artist's honest child) drives the key turn: her decision to tell Jacobson an hour prior forecloses Vincent's options and forces the treatment trade. Her choices (waiting in the prep room, documenting cons, framing the confrontation as救 salvation) are causally active and alter the ending. Present early, pressures the middle (holding the ink pot), and shapes closure (offering rehabilitation). High irreplaceability—the story pivots on her refusal to inherit the con.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The vintage ink pot appears in three beats: opening description, Mara holding it when Vincent descends, and the final paragraph where it "gleamed between them, a relic of authentic service now conscripted for fraud." It signals Vincent's plan, triggers the confrontation, and is reweighted at closure. However, it does not constrain a mid-scene choice—Mara's breach was enacted an hour prior. The reprise charges the ending but the object remains more symbolic than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Political asylum shapes the con's stakes (Mrs. Kowalski's sister and two children) and Mara's moral calculus ("until her sister dies waiting for papers that will never clear immigration"). The concept pressures Mara's decision to breach and informs the "fair trade" mathematics. Present early, drives one key choice (the exposure), and is invoked at closure to justify the intervention. Swappable with another high-stakes fraud (e.g., medical treatment) without fundamental restructure, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Liquefies rigid thinking" is attributed to Vincent's con technique ("the story that liquefied rigid thinking and made desperate people see what they wanted to see"). It explains his method but does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost. The trait is told, not dramatized—we do not see Vincent actively deploying it in scene. Present by the first third, but remains label-only without mechanical payoff or tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Breach" is the story's hinge: Mara's confession to Jacobson an hour prior redefines all options when Vincent learns of it. The action is signaled early (her waiting in the prep room, "I've been actively waiting"), drives the confrontation, and forecloses Vincent's escape at closure. The breach is irreplaceable—without it, no trap, no forced treatment offer. High causal pressure and closure linkage. Present in setup, middle revelation, and ending consequence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Waiting actively" is signaled early ("I've been actively waiting, Dad, watching your patterns, documenting the cons") and its mechanics matter: patience as strategy enabled her documentation and the hour-prior confession. The method shapes her final stance (offering treatment rather than punishment). However, the active waiting itself is mostly backstory—the present-tense scene shows the payoff, not the method in action. Present in two beats (exposition, confrontation line) but not deeply embedded in tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The funeral home prep room anchors all action, provides the "deathly vitality" tone, and pressures Vincent's breakdown ("this place strips away pretense"). Its function—where endings are prepared, false removed—directly charges Mara's argument for treatment. The room supplies chrome instruments and the covered body as witnesses, reinforcing honesty. Micro-setting (embalming table, ink pot placement) alters the confrontation's emotional weight. Present throughout, but does not constrain a middle tactical choice, preventing highest band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mara's desire "to find the mathematics of a fair trade" is dramatized through her refusal to lie for profit, her documentation of cons, and her treatment offer ("you give up the con, you get yourself back"). Friction between her want (save her father) and the cost (betray him to Jacobson, risk their relationship) drives the confrontation. Present early, shapes the breach decision, and articulates the closure trade. The mathematical metaphor is consistent and charges her final stance, though the phrasing occasionally trends abstract.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Deathly vitality" (formaldehyde and flowers, chrome instruments, "that strange deathly vitality that made everything feel suspended between states") is established early and modulates through the confrontation. The tone charges Vincent's breakdown in a room "where death made way for remembrance, where endings enabled new mathematics." Coherent through pressure and present in the final image ("the deathly vitality of that prep room"). Does not dynamically shift cadence under peak stress—remains steady rather than accelerating—preventing higher score.</comment>
