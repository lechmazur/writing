<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The astronomer's frugality and devotion are established early and persist, but interiority remains largely assertion-driven rather than embodied contradiction. Her discovery unfolds without genuine internal conflict—no moment where she questions the cost of following the ancient map or doubts her own worthiness to complete this covenant. The final weeping feels declared rather than earned through on-page struggle, and the phrase "sealed her covenant" in the penultimate paragraph tilts toward thematic summary instead of dramatized choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive promptly (astronomer, palace ruins, dusk) and the causal chain holds: tile discovery → decoding → coordinates → excavation → treatise. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (bridge between past and future stargazers) with felt emotional cost, but the escalation relies heavily on coincidence—the alignment "just happens" to occur in three days, and the buried treatise awaits exactly where predicted without complication. The drive lens reads as Causal with situational undertones; the ending reconfigures meaning but lacks a tactical price that the protagonist pays on the page during the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The palace observatory, dusky lighting, and desert coordinates are vivid and purposeful. Shadow-angle revelation of hidden symbols is a strong micro-setting constraint that drives the middle turn. The final excavation sequence grounds the closure in tactile action (digging with hands, resonating ground). Sensory hierarchy reflects the astronomer's professional focus throughout, and the "dusky harmony" motif recurs with reweighted meaning at the ending.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—honoring the ancient astronomer's message—is clear and consistent. One meaningful tightening occurs when shadows reveal terrestrial coordinates, forcing a new tactical choice. However, the alignment and buried treatise arrive without opposition or cost; no resource is visibly spent, no alternate path foreclosed. The protagonist's agency is observational rather than decisional at closure: she witnesses the resonance and digs, but no on-page trade-off or renunciation charges the final image with felt price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme of devotion across time emerges organically from the tile puzzle, coordinate chase, and final discovery without overt statement. The "encrypted devotion" and "covenant with the unknown" motifs recur purposefully, and the irony of ancient naked-eye astronomy predicting modern findings is sharp and embodied. The final image—packing clay tablets, planning translation—offers a resonant answer to the thematic question. Minor slip: "sealed her covenant" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic summary, though the surrounding action rescues it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single third-person POV with stable focalization throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (astronomical lens, frugal detail-noticing). Diction remains within the astronomer's plausible register, though phrases like "encrypted devotion" and "dusky harmony" recur with enough frequency to verge on authorial motif rather than character-particular perception. No dialogue present. Psychic distance is controlled, and the prose rhythm modulates with scene pressure, quickening during the shadow revelation and slowing during reflection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Clarity and momentum are generally strong, with information-dense sentences that advance plot and atmosphere. Two loops weaken the mid-section: "encrypted devotion" appears four times in similar phrasing, and "dusky harmony" is repeated verbatim without adding pressure. Template cadence surfaces in the excavation sequence ("She began to dig... uncovering not treasure but something more precious..."). The phrase "through schematic representations" in paragraph four reads as prompt-echo rather than organic diction. High figurative density in the final two paragraphs (bridge, covenant, harmony, surrender) borders on overwriting but remains legible.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The core premise—ancient star map hidden in a magic square—offers a fresh synthesis of archaeology and astronomy. The shadow-angle mechanic is inventive and well-integrated. However, the framing (lone scholar finds ancient wisdom that modern science missed) follows a familiar template without sufficient transformation through lived detail or moral complexity. The astronomer's frugality and borrowed tools gesture toward personal cost but never constrain a pivotal choice. The alignment occurring "in three days" and the treatise buried exactly where predicted lean on coincidence rather than earned narrative pressure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Frugal astronomer is signaled early (patched trousers, worn satchel, cheap camera, secondhand instruments) and her frugality shapes mid-story tactics (spending last savings, borrowed observatory time). However, frugality does not constrain the peak choice or closure; the excavation succeeds without resource scarcity creating friction. The trait is present across beats but replaceable—"determined" or "obsessive" astronomer would function nearly identically in this plot.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Magic square tile is introduced early, handled in at least three beats (initial examination, shadow revelation, resonance with celestial alignment), and directly enables the escalation by revealing coordinates. Its cuneiform numbers and shadow-dependent symbols are specific and irreplaceable. The tile's resonance with the buried second tile at closure charges the final image. Slight dock: the second tile's existence is convenient rather than set up earlier, and the magic square's mathematical properties (summing to a mystical total) are mentioned but not causally exploited.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Encrypted devotion is named repeatedly and frames the thematic arc, but it operates primarily as a label rather than a constraint on tactics. The astronomer recognizes the ancient astronomer's "love letter to the cosmos" and reciprocates by following the map, but the concept does not create on-page friction or a decision point where devotion conflicts with another want. It shapes theme more than stakes.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Empirically ironic is embodied in one strong beat: the realization that ancient naked-eye astronomy predicted an alignment modern telescopes only recently confirmed. This moment reweights the protagonist's frugal methods with thematic resonance. However, the irony does not constrain a subsequent choice or alter tactics; it enriches texture without causal pressure. The trait is swappable—"unexpectedly validated" or "humbling" would serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Uncloak appears twice: translating the tile's star coordinates and, metaphorically, planning to "uncloak" the treatise's complete message at the end. The first use drives the middle escalation by revealing the alignment and terrestrial coordinates. The second use is summary/future intention rather than on-page action. The action is purpose-driven but not indispensable—"decode" or "reveal" would function identically with minimal edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Through schematic representations is signaled early (hand-drawn star charts, months of research) and used functionally in the decoding beat, cross-referencing charts with the tile. The method matters to the escalation but is not irreplaceable—"through calculation" or "using star maps" would work similarly. The phrase itself reads somewhat forced, closer to prompt-echo than organic diction. The method does not constrain a later choice or charge the closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Ancient Babylonian palace reimagined as a museum is anchored early and provides micro-setting pressure: guards' rounds create urgency, twilight shadow-angle is key to the revelation, and the reconstructed observatory chamber frames the discovery. The "between regimes" funding scarcity is mentioned but does not constrain action. The palace participates in two beats (tile examination, shadow revelation) but is absent from the desert excavation closure, limiting its final charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Between regimes is mentioned once in the opening (transitional government, scarce funding) but does not create tactical pressure. No clock tightens decisions, and the political instability never threatens the protagonist's access or safety. The "three days" until alignment could serve as a timeframe constraint but is not tracked or felt as urgent. The element is present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>To seal a covenant with the unknown is stated explicitly in paragraph three and recurs at closure ("sealed her covenant by finding this bridge"). The motivation drives the protagonist's journey and frames the thematic arc. However, it is more often declared than dramatized through conflicting wants; no on-page moment tests the covenant against a competing desire (safety, recognition, doubt). The motivation shapes the arc but lacks friction that would elevate it into high integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dusky harmony is introduced early as the protagonist's preferred observation hour and recurs at the final excavation ("dusky harmony of that evening—stars emerging as day surrendered to night"). The tone modulates subtly with scene pressure (quickening during discovery, slowing during reflection) and the twilight motif charges both the shadow revelation and the closure image. Slight dock for verbatim repetition without reweighting in the middle section, and the phrase itself borders on ornamental lyricism rather than constraint-driven necessity.</comment>
