<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's shifting personalities create credible internal contradiction—September's "angular" clarity versus August's weeping silence. The molting trait shapes micro-choices: retrieving the tin, reading impromptu poetry, each filtered through the month's lens. The closure choice to plant "everywhere they tried to kill beauty" feels earned by the accumulation of selves and prior volunteer work, though the cost of October's forgetting is asserted more than dramatized on the page. Kai's arc from inmate to returned volunteer is cleanly motivated, and the relationship pressure is present but light.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Orientation anchors (vagrant poet, rusted library, full moon, Kai) arrive within the first ~100 words. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): planting seeds "everywhere they tried to kill beauty" crystallizes the blooming-resistance stakes and reconfigures the library's ruin into purposeful fertility. Cost is visible in September's acknowledgment that October will forget this specific joy, and the act forecloses passivity. One meaningful deepening occurs when the hidden seeds shift the evening from sorting books to seeding insurgent beauty, but the escalation is gentle rather than sharp.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The rusted library with its "corrugated metal roof peeled back like a sardine can" functions as micro-setting that charges the closure: the broken roof admits moonlight for planting, the warped table becomes a seed-staging area, dust drifts supply soil. Sensory detail is selective—moon "bright and merciless," "liquid silver" light—and filtered through September's sharpness. The prison complex's geography (north fence, cell block D, warden's office) remains coherent across references. The setting constrains tactics (dust must be deep enough for roots) and the final image of blooming ruins under stars directly depends on the fractured roof.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: "to forge beauty from anarchy" through planting in ruins. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mara proposes planting "everywhere they tried to kill beauty," escalating from library-only to distributed insurgency. Agency is present: the decision to plant and the impromptu penny poem are on-page choices that narrow options (committing seeds tonight rather than hoarding them). The cost is legible—October will forget, and the distributed planting risks discovery—but the pressure remains atmospheric rather than urgent. No antagonist appears to test the choice in real time.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: shifting selves enable different modes of seeing beauty's possibility, the library's fracture becomes a portal rather than a wound, and blooming where "bones are buried" reweights ruin as fertile ground. The improvised penny poem ("ruins bloom brightest when tended by broken hands") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Motifs earn their keep: molting, moonlight, seeds, and rusted metal recur with shifting valence and constrain the final choice. Subtext operates in Kai's "You're different again" and Mara's borrowed smile. The ending avoids tidy resolution—October's forgetting is accepted as "part of the work."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with close filter through Mara's September self; perceptual signature is character-specific ("angular in thought," "sharp edges"). Voice modulates purposefully: "smiling felt borrowed from whoever she'd been in August" versus the impromptu poetry's loose doggerel. Dialogue carries subtext (Kai's "That's terrible poetry" / "I know" exchange conveys affection and shared history). Psychic distance tightens during the planting sequence. One minor slip: "forge beauty from anarchy" reads slightly elevated for the vagrant poet's established idiom, though it could be September's precision. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high: most lines advance character, plot, or atmosphere without padding. The simile "like a sardine can" and metaphor "liquid silver" are vivid and coherent. Minor loop: "beauty" appears five times in the final third, risking echo fatigue, though each use serves a distinct beat (beauty from anarchy, beauty killed, beauty possible). "Luminous fracture of everything" borders on purple but stays within the lyric-toned voice. Proofreading is clean; no grammar slips. The improvised poem's line breaks and rhythm fit the "penny poem" frame. One paraphrase slip: "forget the specific joy" and "forgetting was part of the work" restate adjacently without added pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The vagrant-poet-with-shifting-selves premise offers a fresh angle on identity instability, and the prison-library-turned-guerrilla-garden setting is specific. The molting trait transforms the familiar "fractured self" trope by making it cyclical and generative rather than pathological. Emotional truth in Kai's return and Mara's acceptance of forgetting feels earned. However, the blooming-resistance frame (wildflowers overtaking razor wire) echoes widely circulated resilience metaphors without a sharp twist. The combination is coherent and memorable but stops short of synthesis that feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking is present in the non-linear identity structure but doesn't destabilize reader footing.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Setup: "vagrant penny poet" named in the opening sentence. Development: her shifting selves enable the discovery (rummaging the warden's office as an earlier self) and the impromptu poetry reading ("read me something"). Payoff: the decision to plant "everywhere" is hers, and she recites the penny poem that charges the closure. Beat involvement: discovery of seeds, proposal to expand planting, impromptu poem. Causal pressure: the molting allows different eyes to "see possibility in ruins." Closure linkage: the final image hinges on her recitation and Kai's laughter. Swappability is low; the poet identity is tied to the penny-poem conceit. Cost: October will forget. Gates met, multiple beats, closure-active. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, cost +0.4.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: coffee tin retrieved from her pack in paragraph four. Development: she twists the false bottom to reveal seed packets, which become the pivot for the planting plan. Payoff: the seeds are planted in the closure sequence, and their future blooming is the story's endpoint. Two beats: discovery/reveal and planting. Causal pressure: the hidden seeds enable the escalation from book-sorting to insurgent gardening. Closure linkage: planting the seeds is the final action. Specificity: the false bottom and wax-paper wrapping are unique, irreplaceable details. Cost: committing the seeds tonight forecloses hoarding. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.6, cost +0.4. Minor friction: the tin itself is static after the reveal; the seeds do the work.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: "blooming resistance" named explicitly midway ("The blooming resistance had begun accidentally") but the concept is seeded earlier via the wildflower anecdote. Development: the prior wildflower cascade on the north fence supplies precedent and stakes (authorities cut it down, seeds spread anyway). Payoff: the decision to plant "everywhere they tried to kill beauty" enacts the concept. The concept shapes stakes (beauty vs. erasure) and tactics (distributed planting to evade control). Closure linkage: the final image of future blooming under stars depends on this frame. Swappability: moderate—"guerrilla gardening" or "defiant beauty" could substitute with edits. Cost: distributed planting risks discovery. Setup delayed to midpoint −0.3, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, swappability −0.5, cost +0.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Setup: "molting had started years ago, personalities shedding like snake skin on a monthly cycle" in paragraph three. Development: the trait explains why she keeps returning ("Each month brought new eyes") and enables the seed discovery (an earlier self found them). Payoff: September's clarity drives tonight's choice; October's forgetting is accepted as cost. The trait constrains on-page action (September's "angular" perception differs from August's weeping) and supplies visible cost (memory loss). Two beats: arrival as September, acceptance of October's forgetting. Causal pressure: the molting enables the "different eyes" insight. Closure linkage: the final acceptance of forgetting depends on this trait. Specificity: high—monthly cycle tied to full moon. Cost: October will forget this joy. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.0, specificity +0.7, cost +0.5. Friction: label-only in some moments ("September's clarity") −0.3.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: "rebuild" introduced in paragraph two (Kai "rebuilding" the poetry section) and echoed in Kai's self-description ("he'd rebuilt himself page by page"). Development: the proposal to plant reframes rebuilding from books to ecosystem. Payoff: the closing lines commit to "rebuilding the rusted library into something that would bloom." The action appears in three beats (Kai's book-sorting, the seed proposal, the final planting/rebuilding synthesis). Major turn: the shift from passive sorting to active insurgent planting. Causal pressure: the rebuild frame licenses the escalation. Closure linkage: the final sentence hinges on this verb. Irreplaceability: moderate—"restore" or "reclaim" could substitute. Cost: the rebuilding commits time and seeds with no guarantee of success. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +1.5, swappability −0.5, cost +0.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Setup: "the habit of Tuesday nights among the stacks had followed him outside the walls" in paragraph two. Development: the flashback to June reciting poems "for cigarettes in the visitors' yard" and Kai laughing at her rhymes establishes the bond. Payoff: tonight's planting and improvised poem replay the pattern (Kai asks her to read, she performs, he laughs). The method shapes multiple beats: the Tuesday-night ritual frames the entire scene, the shared book-sorting history motivates trust, and the final poem-and-laughter exchange charges the closure. Causal pressure: the friendship enables tonight's collaboration and Mara's return despite her shifting selves. Closure linkage: the "same sound from years ago" callback and Kai's laughter close the loop. Irreplaceability: high—the prison-library origin is load-bearing. Cost: the bond persists across Mara's memory gaps. Early signal +0.8, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, specificity +0.7, cost +0.5.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Setup: "rusted library under stars, its corrugated metal roof peeled back like a sardine can" in the opening paragraph. Development: the warden's office supplies the hidden seeds; the warped table becomes the staging area; dust drifts provide soil. Payoff: the fractured roof admits moonlight for planting, and the final image depends on "holes we didn't choose to open." The setting constrains tactics (depth of dust, available space) and charges the closure ("ruins bloom brightest"). Four beats: arrival, seed discovery in warden's office, table staging, planting in dust. Causal pressure: the broken roof enables the planting and supplies the central metaphor. Closure linkage: the final image ("stars that shine through holes") reweights the ruin. Irreplaceability: very high—the peeled-back roof is the story's hinge. Cost: the exposure to elements and authorities. Early signal +0.8, four beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.5, closure linkage +1.8, specificity +0.8, cost +0.5.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setup: "every full moon" ritual mentioned early; "as the moon cleared the skyline" in paragraph seven. Development: the moon's climb ("the moon climbed higher") tracks the planting sequence. Payoff: moonlight spills through the roof "like liquid silver" during the final planting. The timeframe tightens the window (one night, moon-rise to overhead) and modulates tone (lunar pressure). Two beats: moon clearing skyline, moon overhead. The clock is live but gentle; no urgent deadline forces choices. Closure linkage: the moonlight charges the final image. Swappability: moderate—"dusk" or "midnight" could substitute. Cost: implicit—they must finish before dawn or lose the symbolic frame. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +0.6, closure linkage +1.0, swappability −0.4, cost +0.2.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setup: "to forge beauty from anarchy" stated in paragraph five. Development: the desire is dramatized through the seed discovery, the proposal to expand planting, and the acceptance of forgetting as "part of the work." Payoff: the final planting enacts the motivation, and the improvised poem restates it obliquely ("ruins bloom brightest when tended by broken hands"). The motivation shapes three beats and conflicts with the cost (October's forgetting). Causal pressure: the desire drives the escalation from sorting to planting. Closure linkage: the final image of future blooming depends on this motive. Friction: the phrase "forge beauty from anarchy" reads slightly thesis-like, bordering on telling. Cost: acceptance of impermanence. Setup mid-story −0.2, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, friction (thesis-like) −0.4, cost +0.5.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: "luminous fracture" appears explicitly in paragraph eight but is seeded earlier through "rusted," "peeled back," "scattered," and moon imagery. Development: the tone charges the broken-roof image and the molting metaphor; fracture is reframed as aperture. Payoff: the final lines synthesize fracture and luminosity ("stars that shine through holes we didn't choose to open, planting futures we won't recognize"). The tone modulates with pressure: the opening is elegiac, the planting sequence brightens, the closure holds both break and glow. Coherence across turns: high. The tone charges the final image directly. Irreplaceability: high—"luminous fracture" names the exact aesthetic. Cost: the fracture is accepted rather than repaired. Early seeding +0.7, pattern across beats +1.3, closure linkage +1.7, modulation +0.8, specificity +0.7, cost +0.4.</comment>
