<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's conflict between desire for the vial and duty to Chen is embodied through "fingers lingered on the crystal" and her concrete choice to pocket it. Chen's oxygen-deprivation progression tracks cleanly and his three-day obsession dramatizes the trap rather than merely declaring it. Interior states are grounded in physical details (weathered face, trembling palm, color returning). Minor flaw: Chen's leap from "I can't leave it" to passive compliance happens quickly, though shock and hypoxia provide partial motivation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mara chooses to lock away the vial with visible cost ("some mysteries should stay mysteries" forecloses study of preserved consciousness). Causal lens holds: distress signal → descent → discovery of Chen and vial → emergency protocol → ascent → decision to contain. The piece teaches spatial anchors early (ocean floor, temple, submersible) and the oxygen timer creates legible pressure. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mara forces disconnection from the vial's pull to haul Chen out.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The temple's limestone pillars, kelp shrouds, and altar ground the rescue choreography. The vial's physical properties (thumb-sized, shifting surface, warm against thigh) recur and constrain Mara's attention. Sensory hierarchy fits urgency: flashing oxygen gauge and comm link dominate crisis beats, while the gathered hush returns in the reflective exit moment. The submersible's emergency oxygen supply functions as a concrete resource that enables the ascent. Minor: no occupation-specific diving detail beyond oxygen gauge, but at this length the choice reads economical rather than thin.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Chen's survival vs. vial's allure) is signaled early and tightens when Mara must override her own desire to save him. The oxygen alarm provides a live countdown. One clear reversal: Mara pockets the vial and breaks its pull, forcing Chen toward the submersible. Cost is visible in the final decision to lock it away, foreclosing study. Pressure coherence holds under the causal lens. Slight gap: Chen's resistance dissolves quickly once Mara asserts duty, reducing the friction at the pivotal turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme (the danger of harnessing what should remain mystery) emerges from concrete action: Chen's near-death, Mara's temptation, the decision to contain rather than destroy or study. The vial's "lonesome splendor" and "gathered hush" function as recurring images that charge the ending without overt thesis. "Not forget... just acknowledge that some mysteries should stay mysteries" walks close to a thematic statement but roots in Mara's specific choice with cost. The final image of the temple dissolving back into the ocean offers a resonant, non-literal answer. No diagnostic label-speak in peak beats.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable on Mara; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is clean: she notices the oxygen gauge, assesses vitals, feels the vial's warmth. Dialogue serves goal pursuit (Chen's plea, Mara's directive) and carries subtext (Chen's "I found it" reveals obsession before stating it). Diction fits an experienced rescuer without corporate drift. Minor density issue: "understanding dawning" is a stock phrase that slightly flattens Chen's realization beat. Free indirect distance is controlled; no filter-verb stacks in high-pressure moments.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence lengths modulate with pressure (short bursts during the oxygen crisis, longer syntactic builds in the reflective exit). Information density is high: most lines advance situation, character, or atmosphere. Two minor loops: "lonesome in their splendor" (paragraph re memories) echoes "lonesome splendor" (exit paragraph) without reweighting; "gathered hush" appears twice as atmosphere rather than causal element. Stock phrases "relief flooding," "understanding dawning," and "color returning" are functional but generic. No scaffold or simultaneous-action errors. Clarity and concision hold throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The crystal vial as consciousness-preserving artifact offers a specific twist on "dangerous ancient relic" templates, and the choice to lock it away rather than destroy/keep subverts the binary. The underwater temple rescue frame is familiar but executed with disciplined pacing and grounded sensory detail. Emotional specificity (Mara's fingers lingering, Chen's trembling palm) avoids generic templates. Transformation test: the premise (rescue of obsessed researcher from irresistible artifact) would survive name/place swaps, suggesting the synthesis leans more on execution than conceptual novelty. No close echoes of famous lines, but the moral calculus (duty over desire, mystery over mastery) follows well-trodden paths without bold reinterpretation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dr. Chen (distress signal sender) drives two key beats: his refusal to leave the vial creates the rescue conflict, and his final question ("Will you destroy it?") prompts Mara's closure stance. Setup: distress signal in opening line. Development: grips Mara's wrist, presses vial into her hands, resists departure. Payoff: asks the question that crystallizes Mara's decision to lock it away. His choices (sending signal, staying, resistance) narrow Mara's options and his oxygen crisis imposes the time constraint. Small gap: his shift from "I can't leave it" to passive acceptance happens quickly, slightly reducing causal grip. Early signal +0.6, two distinct beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.0, cost connection +0.4; late compliance −0.3. Rounds to 7.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The crystal perfume vial appears in at least four beats: Chen's reveal/pressing into Mara's hands, Mara's experience of memories, pocketing during evacuation, warm pulse during ascent, and the final decision to lock it away. Setup: introduced ~25% in. Development: touching it fills Mara's mind with ancient emotions (constrains her attention), and she must force herself to pocket it to proceed with rescue. Payoff: "pulsed once more in her pocket" and the decision to lock it away both hinge on its preserved presence. Specificity: shifting surface, impossible angles, ancient symbols, warmth, memory-touch mechanics are irreplaceable. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.5, specificity +0.7, cost connection +0.5; introduced ~25% −0.2. Rounds to 8.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Gathered hush" appears twice as atmospheric descriptor (opening: "gathered hush of the deep," exit: "gathered hush of centuries") without constraining a choice or altering tactics. It sets tone but does not shape stakes on the page. Setup: opening paragraph. Development: absent from middle pressure. Payoff: mentioned in exit paragraph but as ambiance, not causal element. The phrase enriches setting texture but remains swappable with "profound silence" or similar. Early signal +0.4, closure presence (cameo) +0.3; ornamental use −0.8, swappability −0.6. Rounds to 4.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Touches memories" (the vial's attribute) constrains Mara's attention and agency in one extended beat: "immediately her mind filled with sensations not her own... Every fiber of her being wanted to keep touching the vial." This drives her conflict and the on-page action of forcing herself to pocket it. Setup: introduced with the vial ~25%. Development: the memory-touch effect traps Chen (told) and tempts Mara (shown), forcing her to override desire. Payoff: the vial "still pulsing with those captured moments" in the final paragraph recalls the attribute, though it does not actively constrain the lock-away decision. Early signal +0.5, one beat (Mara's temptation) +0.4, causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +0.4, cost connection +0.5; introduced ~25% −0.2, swappability (could be "reveals visions" with minor edits) −0.5. Rounds to 6.3.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Unsnarl" (as action) appears once in dialogue: "I had minutes to unsnarl this crisis." The dramatized equivalent is Mara's sequence: assess vitals → emergency protocol → override vial temptation → haul Chen → connect oxygen. This sequence drives the major turn from crisis to ascent. Setup: crisis is clear from oxygen alarm early. Development: the unsnarling actions (forcing disconnection, hauling, connecting oxygen) occupy the climax beat and narrow options under time pressure. Payoff: ascent and Chen's stabilization result directly from these actions. The word itself is spoken but the mechanics are shown. One beat (rescue sequence) +0.4, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +0.9, cost connection +0.4; summary-only mention of "unsnarl" label −0.3, swappability (could be "resolve" or "fix") −0.4. Rounds to 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"By overriding instinct" is stated late in dialogue: "By overriding instinct... That's how we survive this. By choosing duty over desire." The method is dramatized when Mara "forcing herself to pocket the vial and disconnect from its intoxicating pull." Setup: Mara's temptation is shown ~60% in. Development: the override action (pocketing, hauling) occurs in the climax beat and enables survival. Payoff: Mara's final stance ("acknowledge that some mysteries should stay mysteries") extends the override into her decision to lock the vial away. The method shapes the peak choice and the ending ethos. One beat (rescue override) +0.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +0.8, cost connection +0.5; introduced second half −0.4, label articulation rather than early signal −0.3. Rounds to 6.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The "forgotten underwater temple" supplies the distress signal location, Chen's entrapment site, the vial's origin, and the spatial choreography for the rescue (altar, pillars, crumbling entrance). Setup: second paragraph. Development: the main chamber altar positions Chen; the entrance frames the exit with a "last look" that charges Mara's reflection. Payoff: the closing image of the temple "slowly dissolving back into the patient ocean, its secrets safe" directly supports the theme and Mara's choice to preserve mystery. The temple's inaccessibility (ocean floor, three-day beacon) constrains rescue timing. Early signal +0.7, two beats (discovery, exit) +0.9, causal pressure +0.8, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.6. Rounds to 7.8.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"As time runs short" is embodied in Chen's oxygen gauge (flashing red, twenty minutes left, alarm screaming) and Mara's assessment ("minutes to unsnarl this crisis"). The countdown tightens every beat from discovery to ascent. Setup: oxygen gauge introduced in discovery paragraph. Development: the dwindling air narrows Mara's options, forcing her to override the vial's pull rather than linger. Payoff: Chen's breathing steadies after emergency oxygen connection; the ascent succeeds because Mara acted within the time window. The live clock is tracked and alters moves throughout. Early signal +0.7, three beats (discovery, alarm, connection) +1.4, causal pressure +1.5, closure linkage +0.9, cost connection +0.5. Rounds to 8.3.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To harness the ephemeral" is Chen's stated goal ("trying to harness the ephemeral—to capture what can't be held") and Mara's recognition in the final line ("some ephemeral things... were never meant to be harnessed at all"). Setup: introduced in Chen's first speech. Development: Chen's obsession (staying three days, ignoring survival) dramatizes the desire; Mara's temptation upon touching the vial shows the allure. Payoff: Mara's decision to lock the vial away directly answers whether the ephemeral should be harnessed, with cost (foreclosing study of preserved consciousness). The motivation drives Chen's entrapment and frames Mara's thematic choice. Early signal +0.6, two beats (Chen's obsession, Mara's decision) +0.9, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +1.3, cost connection +0.5; partial reliance on told backstory (Chen's three days) −0.4. Rounds to 7.4.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" appears three times: describing the temple ("beautiful and desolate in equal measure"), the memories ("lonesome in their splendor"), and the exit view ("lonesome splendor seemed to intensify"). The tone coheres through all turns: awe mixed with isolation and melancholy. Setup: opening paragraph establishes tone. Development: the phrase modulates to describe the memories' emotional weight, linking tone to stakes. Payoff: the exit paragraph uses "lonesome splendor" to charge the final image of the dissolving temple and the vial's trapped hearts. The tone shapes the thematic register (mystery, beauty, danger) and supports Mara's reflective closure stance. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.6; some repetition without reweighting −0.3. Rounds to 7.7.</comment>
