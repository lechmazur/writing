<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's "quiet" characterization is asserted more than embodied through contradictory impulses in scene. Her plan and execution read competent without visible struggle or foreclosed paths—she succeeds linearly. The magician arrives on cue, the silk works, the trees respond; no meaningful mistake or cost emerges from her meekness or determination. The final choice to continue feels like continuation rather than a decision that forecloses an alternative with visible price.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Causal with some Accumulative layering (the silk's memory, the crystallized sap). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure—trees budding, Mira planning next phases—lands as a Decisive Change (planet begins recovery) but the cost is abstract: "memories spent" doesn't translate to a felt or visible price that reconfigures Mira's options. The barter with the magician resolves too smoothly; no on-page friction or trade-off sharpens the final image. One meaningful tightening occurs (discovery → forging → threading → budding) but the escalation lacks a turn that narrows options with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The floating arches, mine shafts, and crystallized sap veins create vivid setting anchors that recur and constrain Mira's plan. The lantern illuminating amber veins is a strong sensory moment. Spatial choreography is clear (workshop above, mines below, surface orchards). The forge and mine function as micro-settings that enable tactics, meeting the 9+ gate requirement, though the final image (arches "no longer casting shadows but framing hope") leans toward overt symbolism rather than charging through constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—save the planet—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: Mira needs the silk's memories to forge conduits. But the magician's arrival and cooperation feel convenient rather than hard-won; no live option is foreclosed. The resolution (trees budding) arrives without visible cost to Mira's later tactics or a price that alters her stance. The work ahead is declared, not dramatized as a trade-off. Escalation under the Causal lens requires a narrowing or complication; here the plan succeeds in a straight line.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme of coaxing resilience from rubble, remembering survival, and quiet perseverance emerges from concrete particulars (crystallized sap, the silk's stored patterns, Mira's forge work). The final image—arches framing hope—states rather than embodies the thematic shift. "Quietly determined" and "overlooked" are asserted but not tested by friction; no counter-reading complicates the triumph. The resonance is present but tilts toward overt moral rather than non-literal reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Single-POV third limited with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature tied to Mira's forge-craft vocabulary ("each strike measured and deliberate," "coax resilience from rubble"). Dialogue with the magician feels natural and carries subtext ("You're not meek at all" / "I'm quiet. That's different"). Minor filter-verb presence ("understood," "knew") doesn't dull immediacy. Diction remains consistent; no head-hopping or register drift. The prose reflects Mira's methodical focus without compression under peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Line-level clarity is strong; no loops or scaffold. Sentence rhythm varies purposefully. Minor overwriting in the opening ("each strike measured and deliberate, though her hands trembled") front-loads exposition. "Azure defiance" and "framing hope" in the final lines elevate register slightly beyond earned image. Information density is good; most lines advance setting, character, or stakes. No text artifacts touch the closure beat. Propulsion is steady but not urgent; the success trajectory doesn't compress syntax under stress.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—blacksmith saves dying planet via crystallized-sap conduits threaded through mines—offers a fresh synthesis of SFF tropes. The "bartered awakenings" concept and memory-silk add specificity. However, the emotional arc (overlooked artisan proves herself through ingenuity) follows a familiar template without transformation. The success-without-complication trajectory and the "hope" resolution feel median-safe rather than bold. No proximity to famous lines, but the orchestration reads competent rather than inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mira is present across all beats and makes the key decision to barter the silk and forge conduits. Her "meekness" is told but not dramatically tested—no on-page moment where meekness constrains or costs her. She is described as overlooked but never faces on-page resistance or doubt that her quiet nature must overcome. Present in closure (planning next phase) but the trait doesn't shape the final image's cost. Setup and development present; payoff weak. Swappable with "determined engineer" with minor edits. Late-penalty waived (introduced paragraph one). Causal pressure minimal; no visible cost tied to meekness. Score: 3.0 base + 0.3 early + 0.4 one beat (forging decision) + 0.9 two beats (mines, ending planning) + 0.2 weak causal = 4.8, capped at 4.6 for missing strong middle development of the meekness trait.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Silk appears in beat one (Mira wipes brow, backstory), beat two (barter offer to magician), beat three (magician coaxes memories), and ending (faded, spent). Three gates met. It enables the tactic (memory retrieval) and is handled across beats. However, its mechanics—how memories transfer to forge-pattern—remain vague. The final mention ("memories spent, pattern transferred") tells rather than shows cost. Causal role clear but the ending reprise doesn't visibly reweight; it's consumed off-page. Score: 3.0 + 0.3 early + 0.9 two beats + 0.5 causal (enables tactic) + 0.7 closure linkage (present, spent) + 0.3 specificity (memory storage unique) + 1.0 third beat = 6.7. Not indispensable (a map or tech could replace with edits) but strongly integrated across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Bartered awakenings" is named and explained (magician's grandmother traded realization for dream) and the magician performs one (coaxing silk memories). Setup in dialogue, development via magician's work, payoff implicit (planet awakens). However, the barter itself—what Mira gives versus receives—lacks on-page friction or visible cost. The silk is handed over willingly; no competing desire or loss dramatized. The concept frames the method but doesn't constrain a hard choice. Score: 3.0 + 0.5 early signal + 0.4 one beat (magician scene) + 0.3 weak causal (enables tactic without cost). Capped at ~5.5 for lack of visible cost and swappability (any memory-transfer magic would serve).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Quietly determined" appears as label ("quiet," "deliberate," "quietly determined precision") across multiple beats. It constrains perception (she's overlooked) but doesn't force an on-page trade-off or mistake. The magician's line "You're not meek at all" / "I'm quiet. That's different" asserts the trait but doesn't test it under pressure. Present in closure framing ("slow, quiet, and deliberate—exactly suited") but as retrospective summary, not a choice where quietness forecloses an alternative. Score: 3.0 + 0.3 early + 0.4 one beat + 0.3 weak cost. Trait is consistent but ornamental to escalation; label-only −0.3. Rounds to 5.9, capped at ~6.0 for lack of visible cost tied to the trait at a decision point.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Deliberate" as action/method recurs in hammer strikes, forge work, threading conduits, and the ending declaration. It shapes Mira's approach across all major beats and defines the closure cadence. However, it's a manner rather than a discrete action that turns the plot—swappable with "methodical" or "precise" without structural change. Present in closure image strongly ("slow, quiet, and deliberate"). Score: 3.0 + 0.8 early signal (paragraph one) + 0.9 two beats + 1.4 three beats (opening forge, threading, ending) + 0.5 causal (method enables success) + 0.7 closure linkage + 0.5 specificity (forge-craft context) = 7.8. Not indispensable (the plan itself matters more than the manner) but tightly integrated across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mine shafts introduced early ("months exploring the abandoned mine shafts"), used as the location for discovery (crystallized sap veins) and the method for threading conduits, and referenced in closure ("miles of mine shafts"). Three gates met. The shafts supply the resource (sap veins) and the infrastructure (channels to surface). However, their mechanics—how conduits are threaded, why the guild abandoned them—remain summary. The ending references them but doesn't show their ongoing cost or constraint. Score: 3.0 + 0.5 early + 0.9 two beats (discovery, threading) + 0.5 causal (enables tactic) + 0.3 closure mention + 0.3 specificity (honeycomb planet crust unique) + 0.9 strong middle development = 6.4. Raised to 7.4 for essential infrastructure role, though some swappability remains (any underground resource network could serve with edits).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Orchard planet with floating arches present in opening, recurring visually (shadows, drifting through azure), and in closure ("no longer casting shadows but framing hope"). The arches supply atmosphere and symbolic weight but don't constrain a choice—Mira's plan doesn't depend on them. The orchards are the stake (dying trees) but their mechanics (why roots can't grip) are asserted, not shown affecting tactics. Mine shafts do the causal work; the arches frame. Score: 3.0 + 0.8 early + 0.4 one beat + 0.7 closure linkage (reweighted image) + 0.3 specificity (floating rocks unique) + 1.4 three beats (opening, shadows growing, ending) = 6.6. Raised to 6.9 for strong lyric reprise that reweights the opening image, though causal pressure is minimal. Not indispensable to plot logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Between understanding and confusion" is named once mid-story ("She worked in the timeframe between understanding and confusion") as a descriptor of Mira's state. It doesn't track on the page as a ticking clock or decision constraint. The narrative spans "months" of exploration, "weeks" of threading, and one night of work with the magician, but elapsed time doesn't tighten choices. The phrase is thematic rather than tactical. Score: 3.0 (present, ornamental) + 0.4 mentioned once −0.3 label-only −0.3 summary use. Capped at 3.8 for missing setup (appears mid-story), no development (doesn't alter a choice), and no closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To coax resilience from rubble" is Mira's framing goal, stated explicitly and embodied in her plan (reconnect surface to deep reserves, awaken what remains). It drives the barter with the magician, the forge work, and the ending's continuation. Present in closure as ongoing motivation ("already planning the next phase"). However, the desire isn't conflicted—no friction between what Mira wants and what it costs her personally. Score: 3.0 + 0.5 early signal (plan explained) + 0.9 two beats (magician barter, forging) + 0.5 causal (drives tactics) + 0.7 closure linkage + 1.0 third beat (ending planning) + 1.0 strong development (shapes all major moves) = 7.6. Not capped; motivation is clear and consistent, though lack of internal conflict between competing wants limits score below 8+.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Azure defiance" as tone: azure recurs (sky, magician's eyes at the end, final image "azure skies"). Defiance is asserted ("that defiant azure spark") but the emotional texture is more steady determination than defiant resistance. Tone is coherent and modulates slightly (exhaustion, quiet intensity, hope) but doesn't charge under peak pressure—the success is smooth. The final image invokes azure but pairs it with "hope" rather than defiance. Score: 3.0 + 0.3 early signal (azure sky paragraph one) + 0.4 one beat + 0.9 two beats (magician's eyes, ending sky) + 0.3 weak causal (tone supports but doesn't constrain) + 0.7 closure linkage (azure in final line) + 0.5 modest modulation = 6.1. Tone is present and purposeful but static; defiance is more label than felt pressure. Capped near 6.3 for lyric reprise strength without cost connection.</comment>
