<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to harmonize values is clearly established, and her micro-choices (measuring, sketching modifications, leaving the envelope unsealed) reveal character under pressure. However, interiority often tilts toward thesis-statement thinking rather than embodied contradiction—"encrypted compassion, Mira thought—desperation disguised as technical inquiry" reads as label-speak rather than lived tension. The grandfather's aphorism and the final reflections on "encrypted compassion finally decoded into action" feel like thematic placeholders rather than earned realizations from scene pressure. Agency is present but the emotional progression smooths toward wisdom rather than wrestling with genuine ambivalence.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly within the opening paragraph. The closure unit—Mira's decision to leave the report unsealed and harmonize both groups—lands on the page with conceptual cost (forcing collaboration, accepting political uncertainty). However, the causal linkage from adhesive analysis to the redesign feels more asserted than dramatized; the adhesive discovery tells us multiple groups tampered with the letter, but we never see how that knowledge directly constrains or enables her engineering solution. The lens reads as Causal-Hybrid, but the middle escalation (measuring, sketching) proceeds more through summary than pressure-driven reversals. Cost is legible but muted—"dappled resolve" and "hope and doubt" soften the stakes rather than sharpening them.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The amphitheater and volcano setting are vivid and purposeful: the "breathing" stones, basalt ribs, geothermal channels, and frescoes all ground the scene and supply the physical constraint that Mira must solve. The surveyor's chain functions as micro-setting (body/tool) and is handled across multiple beats, warm from her body heat, stretching across grooves, gleaming at her hip. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mira's professional lens—pressure channels, mineral deposits, temperature gradients. The frescoes' gestures of community subtly mirror the thematic question. The environment constrains her choice and charges the final image when the amphitheater "breathes with her" and the mountain "had been waiting for someone to harmonize its contradictions."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—save villages or preserve irreplaceable frescoes—is signaled early and clear. Mira's agency drives the resolution: she redesigns the system to harmonize both. However, the escalation reads more as procedural summary than pressure-driven tightening. The letter's tampering adds backstory context but does not create an on-page reversal or force a trade-off; Mira arrives with the answer already forming. The cost of her solution (requiring collaboration, political uncertainty) is conceptual and told rather than felt on the page—no moment where she must forfeit a concrete option or face immediate resistance. One meaningful deepening occurs when she sees the redesign possibility, but it lacks the friction or visible price that would lift stakes into higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—harmonizing conflicting values, measuring what truly mattered—emerges organically from Mira's engineering problem and her grandfather's teaching. The frescoes depicting community and joined hands subtly reinforce the thematic question without heavy symbolism. However, the final paragraphs drift into explicit thesis: "encrypted compassion finally decoded into action," "the most ingenious mechanism wasn't made of metal and water, but of encrypted compassion," and "as if the mountain itself had been waiting for someone to harmonize its contradictions" all state the theme rather than letting the final image resonate. The dappled resolve and "trembling future" offer ambiguity, but the closing moralizing flattens what could have been a more resonant ending. The piece invites reflection but over-articulates its own meaning.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV distance is stable third-limited with clear focalization through Mira's professional and emotional lens. Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices adhesive fibers, pH, pressure channels, mineral deposits—details filtered through her machinist's training. Diction occasionally slips into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-bound: "encrypted compassion," "dappled resolve," "sly genius of it" read as imposed rather than emergent from Mira's voice. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. The prose modulates appropriately with emotional intensity, and free indirect style is clean. Psychic distance remains controlled, though the final reflections tilt toward narrator wisdom rather than Mira's uncertain thought process. Overall voice is distinctive but occasionally ventures into lyric abstraction that dilutes the character's particular way of seeing.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and paragraph structure creates visual breathing room. Information density is generally high, with lines doing double duty (setting detail that also reveals character priorities). However, multiple prose artifacts cluster in key beats: "encrypted compassion" appears three times, each time as a thematic label rather than a concrete image; "dappled resolve" is repeated; "breathed/breathes/breathing" recurs six times in near-identical constructions; the final two paragraphs loop through "trembling," "encrypted compassion," "harmonize," and "breathing" in paraphrase cycles. Template cadence appears in several passages: "She uncoiled… She began… She photographed… She sealed…" Mid-story clarity is strong, but the closure beat is dulled by abstraction and repetition. No filter-verb stacks or major grammar issues, but the figurative language around "encrypted compassion" and "breathing" becomes rhetorical rather than concrete.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The premise—engineer must choose between villages and irreplaceable art—is a familiar trolley-problem setup, and the synthesis (redesign to save both through forced collaboration) is earnest but not surprising. The adhesive-analysis detail and the amphitheater-inside-volcano setting add specificity, yet the emotional arc and resolution follow a predictable "ingenuity overcomes false dilemma" template. The frescoes, grandfather's teaching, and surveyor's chain provide texture but do not transform the core structure. The piece commits fully to its premise and executes competently, but lacks the fresh inflection or non-obvious moral calculus that would elevate originality. The transformation test applies: swap names and setting details, and the arc remains unchanged—clever professional solves ethical puzzle through technical redesign and collaboration. No close echoes of famous work, but the synthesis feels more assembled than inevitable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout and makes the key decisions: analyzing the adhesive, measuring the channels, sketching the redesign, leaving the report unsealed. Her machinist expertise enables the solution and her choices create the story's turns. Setup is immediate, development spans multiple beats, and closure depends on her final act of leaving the envelope unsealed. However, her professional competence proceeds without meaningful friction or miscalculation—she arrives, surveys, solves. The element is essential but her ingenuity feels more asserted than tested; no moment where her floodgate expertise fails or forces a painful trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The surveyor's chain appears in three distinct beats: coiled over her shoulder in the opening, uncoiling and stretching across grooves during measurement, and gleaming at her hip in the final image with the line "its brass links holding the weight of both precision and mercy, calculation and care." The grandfather's teaching about moral measurement is tied to it. Setup is early, development includes tactile handling, and closure reprises it with reweighted meaning. However, the chain does not meaningfully constrain a choice or enable a tactic—Mira could measure with any tool. Its function is more symbolic than causal, and the final reprise asserts thematic weight rather than earning it through on-page cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Encrypted compassion" is explicitly named three times and explained as the letter's tampering by multiple groups, each adding their plea before resealing. It frames the backstory motivation but does not shape Mira's on-page tactics or choices. The concept operates as theme rather than stake: Mira's solution involves collaboration, which echoes the idea, but the connection is conceptual rather than mechanical. Setup occurs in the letter analysis, but development and closure treat it as a thematic label ("encrypted compassion finally decoded into action") rather than a live constraint. The element is present and logically consistent but largely ornamental to the plot mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Slyly heartfelt" does not appear as a phrase. "Sly genius" appears once to describe Mira's redesign requiring collaboration. "Dappled resolve" (uncertain yet determined) better fits the attribute and is explicitly named and demonstrated in her final act of leaving the report unsealed despite political risk. The trait constrains her closure choice—she acts despite uncertainty—but the cost is conceptual (political risk) rather than visceral. Setup is late (final third), and the attribute is more told than shown through earlier contradictory impulses. The element trends toward label-only execution with modest closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Tremble" and its variants appear four times: the letter's realization "trembled through her like voltage," her hands "trembled as she sketched," the instruction to "let them tremble at the possibility of cooperation," and the "trembling future" in the final line. Early signal ties it to realization under pressure, mid-story use embodies physical stress during the key design moment, and closure reprises it to charge the uncertain outcome. The action is purposefully recurrent and its presence in the sketching beat (the story's decisive moment) makes it causally relevant. However, "tremble" is not strictly indispensable—excitement, nervousness, or tension could substitute with minor edits. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff, but not fully irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Adhesive analysis is described in the second paragraph: Mira spent an evening with a jeweler's loupe revealing microscopic fibers and peculiar pH, discovering the letter had been tampered with by multiple hands. The method is signaled early and its mechanics are specific. However, it functions purely as backstory exposition—it tells Mira (and the reader) that both groups care, but does not constrain her engineering choices or alter her on-page tactics. Setup is present, but development and closure do not revisit or depend on the adhesive work. The method is more a narrative device to convey premise than a live tool shaping attempts. Functional but largely replaceable with any discovery method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The amphitheater inside the dormant volcano is present from the opening line and provides the story's central constraint: the floodgate system carved into volcanic rock with channels, mineral deposits, and geothermal pressure. Mira's entire task—measuring, redesigning—depends on this setting. The frescoes supply the ethical stakes (irreplaceable records vs. villages), and the "breathing" stones create atmospheric coherence and charge the final image when the building "breathed with her" and the mountain "acknowledged her offering." Setup is immediate, development involves tactile engagement (descending steps, measuring grooves, photographing frescoes), and closure directly invokes the setting's response. The setting pressures choices and supplies resources; it is indispensable to both plot and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"As the building breathes" functions as atmospheric refrain rather than a literal timeframe. The stones "exhaled," "breathed with her," and "settled with soft groans" across the story, and the volcano "exhaled once more" near the end. However, this does not create temporal pressure or tighten decisions—there is no countdown, no urgency tied to the breathing rhythm. The phrase is present and purposeful for tone, but does not constrain tactics or alter the pacing of Mira's work. Setup is early, the motif recurs, and closure reprises it, but the element remains ornamental to the timeline rather than functional as a live clock. Lyric presence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to harmonize conflicting values is established through the grandfather's teaching ("every calculation is a moral choice about what we decide to protect"), dramatized in her recognition of the false binary (village vs. frescoes), and drives her redesign solution requiring both groups to collaborate. The motivation is signaled early, shapes the middle beats (measuring and sketching to find a synthesis), and directly produces the closure choice (leaving the report unsealed to force cooperation). Friction appears in her "dappled resolve"—confidence in engineering, uncertainty about politics—and the cost is conceptual (political risk, requiring collaboration neither side wants). The motivation is essential and causally active, though the internal conflict could be more embodied and less thesis-driven.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Dappled resolve" is explicitly named in the final third and demonstrated in Mira's closure choice: "confident in the engineering, uncertain about the politics, but determined that neither certainty nor doubt would stop her from trying." The tone of mixing confidence and uncertainty modulates through the piece—early voltage and realization, mid-story trembling hands, final ambivalence about cooperation—and charges the ending's open question ("trembling future," "hope and doubt"). However, the tone is more asserted through labels ("dappled," "trembling," "hope and doubt") than embodied through sentence rhythm or perceptual shifts under pressure. Setup is late, but the tone is present in the closure image and coherent across turns. Functional but not fully integrated into the prose texture.</comment>
