<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Carta's motivation to learn edge geometry is clear and drives her descent into the benthic city, but her internal conflict remains largely told rather than shown through contradictory impulses in scene. The chain link functions as a concrete anchor for her past, yet her emotional progression feels smooth and declarative—"understanding flickering at the periphery of her comprehension"—rather than embodied through sensory degradation or micro-choices under pressure. The final moment of tracing constellations reads as convergence rather than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. Current-Through-Stones remains functional but secondary, applying pressure through pedagogy rather than opposing stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who, where, and when within the first paragraph and maintains a stable accumulative lens: Carta's understanding deepens through instruction and observation, culminating in a resonant reconfiguration where she traces edge geometry alongside her alien guide. The closure offers Charged Poise—a crystallized moment where two species "expand the space" to navigate together—with conceptual cost legible in her abandonment of the maritime academy and descent into "pressure and cold." One meaningful deepening occurs when the chain link glows and Carta begins to see starlight through impossible depths, reweighting her old navigational certainties. Minor causality smoothness: the aliens' revelation and Carta's acceptance happen off-page, and the transition from instruction to shared action feels summarized rather than earned beat-by-beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The benthic city's pressure, luminescence, and architectural boundaries are vividly rendered and purposeful: "architecture gave way to raw geology" charges the teaching moment where impossible starlight becomes visible. The chain link constrains the final image by anchoring Carta's past navigation methods against the new edge geometry, and sensory hierarchy—bioluminescence versus starlight-memory—guides her perceptual shift. Spatial choreography remains clear as Carta moves from pressure locks to teaching chamber to city's edge. Micro-setting detail (the metal glowing, holding shape against pressure) directly informs the thematic lesson and charges the closure beat, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Carta's need to comprehend alien navigation and expand her perceptual limits—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful deepening occurs when Current-Through-Stones demonstrates edge geometry through the chain link, narrowing Carta's epistemic options and forcing her to see "constellations she recognized and pathways she had never imagined." The resolution shows her tracing the first constellation in shared practice, but the choice reads more as culmination of pedagogy than a decision that forecloses a live alternative with felt tradeoff. Agency is present in her descent and receptivity, yet the final beat lacks a visible price beyond the earlier abandonment of her academy position, which is summary-told.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically through the navigation metaphor: the shift from "flat charts between known points" to edge geometry that reads "boundaries between possible and impossible" charges the piece without overt statement. The chain link recurs with reweighted meaning—first as "simpler geometries," then glowing with alien light to teach the boundary principle, finally "warm in her palm" as a tactile anchor in the closure image. The final constellation-tracing offers a resonant, non-literal answer to how understanding expands across species without moralizing. Subtext operates in Current-Through-Stones' "approval and sorrow" and Carta's silent observation, though the phrase "unfolded horizons" risks prompt-echo when repeated in the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and filtered through Carta's professional lens—her perceptual signature reads light and geometry with navigational specificity. Psychic distance modulates effectively when she watches the chain link pulse: "understanding flickering at the periphery of her comprehension" captures both closeness and epistemic struggle. Dialogue between Carta and Current-Through-Stones is functional and advances the teaching beat, though the alien's exposition ("The light remembers its origin. We follow the remembering.") trends toward convenient clarity rather than productive opacity. Minor register drift: "balancedly curious observation" and "somber marvel" read slightly elevated for the narrative voice under pressure, and the phrase "unfolded horizons" recurs without syntactic variation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high—"She traced the first constellation with her finger, following its edge geometry through the deep water" integrates action, metaphor, and stakes efficiently. The opening grounds voice and setting quickly; the final image recharges the chain link motif. Figurative language ("geological processes compressed into seconds," "water-memories") is vivid and voice-consistent. Two scaffold patterns reduce momentum: the phrase "unfolded horizons" appears three times without syntactic transformation, and the construction "She had [past action]" recurs across paragraphs ("She had come," "She had abandoned") in a way that stalls present pressure. No loops obscure causality, but these repetitions dull line-level propulsion in non-closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The premise—aliens navigating by starlight in crushing ocean depths through "edge geometry"—offers a fresh synthesis of first-contact and navigation-as-epistemology, avoiding stock alien-encounter templates. Specific details (bioluminescent architecture, pressure locks, the chain link holding shape) ground the concept in sensory particulars. The transformation test passes: the emotional arc depends on this exact premise and setting. However, the resolution follows a familiar teaching-and-acceptance trajectory without a bold risk or turn; Carta's receptivity and the aliens' pedagogical generosity converge smoothly into mutual expansion. The piece executes its premise with clarity and thematic coherence but does not take structural or perspectival risks that would elevate originality into the high band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Carta (navigation instructor) is present from the opening and drives the story's epistemic arc, making the choice to descend, to bring the chain link, and to ask "Show me." Her professional identity shapes her perceptual filter and stakes. She appears in setup, middle instruction, and closure tracing. However, her choices are primarily receptive—accepting instruction rather than forcing a turn with visible tradeoff. The role is essential to tone and lens but does not create a high-stakes decision that narrows options at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The chain link appears in the opening paragraph (setup), is handed to Current-Through-Stones and glows to teach edge geometry (middle), and returns warm in Carta's palm during the final constellation-tracing (closure). Its meaning evolves from "simpler geometries" to pedagogical tool to tactile anchor, directly shaping the thematic lesson and charging the final image. It constrains nothing tactically but its recurrence with reweighted significance meets lyric-resonance criteria and participates causally in the teaching beat. Removing it would weaken thematic coherence and the closure's specificity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Unfolded horizons" is seeded early ("Those horizons had unfolded into something far stranger"), recurs at closure ("unfolded horizons of a universe larger"), and frames the epistemic stakes: expanding perception beyond known limits. It shapes Carta's motivation and the story's thematic question. However, it functions more as a thematic label than a tactical constraint; no beat turns on the concept itself, and its repetition risks ornamental echo. It charges the final image conceptually but does not alter on-page tactics or force a visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Balancedly curious" appears once in summary—"weeks of balancedly curious observation, never pushing too hard, always receptive"—to describe Carta's past behavior and justify her access. It does not constrain or enable an on-page action with visible cost; the trait is told rather than dramatized through a choice that shows tradeoff (e.g., withholding a question that might offend versus demanding clarity). Its presence clarifies backstory but remains label-only without beat involvement or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Expand" is signaled early in Carta's goal ("expand the small circle of what she knew"), demonstrated in the teaching beat when she begins to see new pathways, and anchors the closure: "Together they expanded the space where two species might learn to navigate." The verb recurs with escalating meaning and drives the thematic resolution. However, it does not create a tactical turn or force a visible tradeoff; the expansion is conceptual and cooperative rather than contested. Removing it would flatten thematic coherence but not break plot logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Edge geometry" is introduced in the second paragraph, explained through the chain link demonstration ("The boundary between what-it-was and what-it-could-become creates a space for navigation"), and practiced in the closure when Carta traces constellations "following its edge geometry through the deep water." It shapes the teaching beat and is indispensable to the premise. However, its mechanics remain abstract; the method does not constrain tactics or fail under pressure to test Carta's grasp. It appears in setup, middle, and closure but functions more as thematic language than a causal lever.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The benthic city anchors the story's physical and conceptual pressure—two miles beneath the Pacific, luminescent architecture, pressure locks—and provides the teaching chamber and city's edge where impossible starlight becomes visible. It is present in setup, middle, and closure, and its extreme environment justifies the alien revelation and Carta's epistemic humility. However, the setting supplies context rather than altering tactics or forcing a choice; Carta does not navigate obstacles or resource constraints within the city. It charges atmosphere and stakes but does not function as a causal lever at closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Three months had passed since humanity discovered the aliens" establishes recency and frames the timeframe in setup, but elapsed time does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page. The story unfolds in a single instructional visit with no countdown or temporal constraint that forces urgency. The aliens' recent revelation adds context and explains humanity's fragmented response, but the timeframe remains static backdrop rather than a pressure mechanism. It is present but functionally replaceable with any similar window.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Carta's desire "to navigate by starlight in places where stars should not exist" is stated early, drives her descent and instruction-seeking, and is fulfilled in the closure when she traces constellations through impossible light. The motivation shapes multiple beats and integrates tightly with theme and action. However, it is declared more than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible friction; Carta's curiosity faces no meaningful obstacle or cost beyond the earlier summary of abandoning her academy position. The motivation is essential to setup, middle instruction, and closure participation but lacks on-page tradeoff at the peak beat.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Somber marvel" is coherent across the piece: Carta's "obsession," Current-Through-Stones' "approval and sorrow," and the final image of navigating "the profound dark" all sustain restrained wonder. Tone modulates slightly as understanding grows—from pressure and cold to warmth in her palm—without breaking into triumph or elegy. It shapes narrative stance and charges the closure image with quiet elevation. The phrase "somber marvel" appears explicitly once in summary ("drawn into somber marvel at existence's unexpected depths"), which risks label-only assertion, but the tonal texture pervades syntax and image choice throughout.</comment>
