<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior motivation is clearly rooted in grief and the desire to preserve lost names, but her emotional arc relies heavily on summary reflection ("she had forgiven herself only yesterday") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The casting work itself is embodied and specific, yet the final choice feels preordained rather than forced by competing pressures. Her renunciation of silence is emotionally coherent but lacks visible tradeoff or struggle at the closure beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered imagery (rope, punched card, bronze, voices) that converges at the closure when the bells ring. Orientation anchors quickly (caster, icebound sanctum, post-forgiveness). The closure delivers a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the final image of bells speaking forgotten names reweights the opening silence with felt emotional cost, and the pattern of transcription through braiding is paid off on the page. One meaningful deepening is present when the rope illuminates and voices emerge, altering the stakes from internal to embodied preservation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum, aurora, and ceremonial rope constrain Mira's choices: she must use the rope's history and the punched card's holes to encode memory, and the setting's isolation frames the stakes. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("breath forming crystals," "green fire," "hissed and sang"), filtered through her caster's attention to material and form. The micro-setting (rope, tools, mold) charges the final image when the bells are hung where monks prayed, creating a spatial echo that amplifies the closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving forgotten names—is signaled early and tightens when Mira weaves the punched card into the rope, then narrows further when the rope illuminates and voices emerge. The escalation is primarily textural (density increase, pattern convergence) rather than decision-driven conflict, but the final act of casting bells and hanging them forecloses the prior silence with visible cost. Agency is present in the act of braiding and pouring bronze, though the path feels more inexorable than fraught.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the interplay of loss, memory, and preservation through craft. The rope and bells function as non-literal vessels for the central question (how to hold what time erases) without overt moralizing. The final image of bells ringing forgotten names offers a resonant answer rooted in particulars—the punched card, the braids, the bronze—that reweights the opening silence. "Technically gentle" recurs as a thematic anchor without becoming a label, and the snowmelt-ardor tone charges the ending with emotional warmth rather than sentimental resolution.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and distance is controlled, with Mira's caster's attention shaping what is noticed (braids, tools, investment). Voice carries a distinct lyric texture ("snowmelt ardor," "grey-chorus") that modulates with emotional intensity. However, phrases like "technically gentle" repeat across beats without varied embodiment, and the narrative occasionally drifts toward explanatory summary ("The transcribed memory technique was technically gentle—it didn't force or command") that flattens immediacy. Perceptual signature is present but not as selective under pressure as the high band requires.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in key beats (braiding, pouring bronze), but template cadence appears in adjacent lines: "She had cast thousands... she had never preserved... she had forgiven herself." The phrase "technically gentle" recurs three times without syntactic variation, creating a loop. Figurative language is dense ("snowmelt ardor," "green fire," "ice walls seemed to lean") and mostly coherent, though "presence" as a descriptor for the rope's shimmer is abstract. Overwriting is present but does not obscure the closure image; apply a −0.6 deduction for loops and template stems.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of lost-wax casting, transcribed memory, and ceremonial rope braiding is specific and non-obvious, transforming the familiar trope of preserving the past through craft. The mechanics of weaving the punched card into the rope and casting bells from the braids feel inevitable in hindsight, rooted in Mira's caster identity. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows the implications without retreat. Risk is present in the lyric accumulation and the reliance on image over dialogue, though the emotional arc is somewhat conventional (grief to preservation).</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira's choices (weaving the punched card, braiding the rope, casting the bells) drive the key turns. She is introduced immediately and her actions shape the middle beat (illumination) and closure (hanging the bells). Early signal, multi-beat involvement, and closure linkage are all present. However, her decisions feel more procedural than conflicted; the path from braiding to bells is linear without visible cost or tradeoff tied to her character. Strong integration but lacks irreplaceability or high causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The punched card appears early ("scrap of punched card from a street organ") and is woven into the rope's heart in the middle beat, returning at closure when the bells ring voices. Two-beat involvement and closure linkage are present. However, the card's function is primarily symbolic; its holes align with braids but do not constrain Mira's choices or create visible cost. The object is present and purposeful but replaceable with another memory-bearing artifact.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Transcribed memory is introduced early ("The transcribed memory technique was technically gentle") and shapes the central tactic: coaxing echoes from objects. It drives the middle beat (rope illumination, voices emerging) and the closure (bells holding voices in bronze). The concept constrains Mira's method and alters the stakes from internal remembering to physical encoding. Two-beat involvement, causal pressure, and closure linkage are all present, earning eligibility for ≥6.1 and higher.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Technically gentle" is introduced early and recurs across beats, but its function is primarily descriptive. It labels Mira's method (coaxing rather than commanding) without visibly constraining or enabling an on-page action with cost. The trait is present and thematically coherent but does not alter tactics or create tradeoff. Missing middle development; cap at 3.4 applies. Slight lift for early signal and closure mention, but usage remains label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Illuminate" drives the major turn when the rope begins to shimmer and voices emerge, redefining the stakes from silent memory to embodied sound. It appears in the middle beat ("the rope illuminated") and charges the closure when the bells speak. The action is irreplaceable; removing it would collapse the story's logic. Early signal (implicit in the weaving), strong causal pressure, and closure linkage all present. Specific cost tied to the element: Mira's tears and the act of lifting the illuminated rope to cast.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Reconfiguring the braids is signaled early ("ceremonial rope, its braids thick as her wrist"), shapes the middle beat ("She began to reconfigure the braids... pulling one crimson strand through the indigo"), and is directly present at closure (the braids are fed into the bronze pour). The method is irreplaceable: the rope's centuries-old pattern and her caster's knowledge of which strands to loosen drive the transcription. Three-beat involvement, high causal pressure, and closure linkage. Visible cost: the physical act of braiding and the risk of failure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The icebound sanctum is introduced immediately and provides resources (the rope, the space for bells) that affect the outcome. The setting's isolation and the aurora's presence charge the closure image. However, the sanctum does not constrain Mira's choices; she could perform the ritual elsewhere. Two-beat involvement (opening, closure) and closure linkage present. Lyric reprise reweights the stake (monks' prayer → Mira's bells), but the setting is more atmospheric than tactically essential.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After forgiving yourself" is signaled early ("She had forgiven herself only yesterday") and frames the emotional starting point, but it does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page. The timeframe is static; no clock or deadline pressures Mira's work. The element is present and thematically coherent but does not alter options or create cost. Missing middle development and closure participation; the ending does not return to or reweight the forgiveness. Cap at 3.4 applies; slight lift for early signal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Preserving forgotten names is introduced immediately ("she had never preserved what truly mattered. The names.") and drives every beat: braiding the rope, casting the bells, hanging them to ring. The motivation is dramatized through action (humming the names, weaving them into the work) and faces friction (the weight of loss, the risk of failure). Three-beat involvement, strong causal pressure, and closure linkage. Visible cost: Mira's tears and the act of leaving the bells behind. High integration; irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Snowmelt ardor" is introduced early ("Forgiveness came as snowmelt ardor: not violent, but inexorable") and modulates across beats, from reflective warmth (opening) to focused intensity (braiding) to resonant charge (bells ringing). The tone is coherent and supports the closure image. However, it does not constrain choices or create visible cost; it is more atmospheric than causal. Two-beat involvement (opening, closure) and lyric reprise reweight the stake, but the tone is not tactically essential. Eligible for ~6.0 via reprise.</comment>
