<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and driven by contradictory impulses—hunting impossible phenomena while mourning tangible loss. Her micro-choices (modifying sensors, adjusting thrusters) reveal a hierarchy of values rooted in trauma. The geode functions as an embodied anchor for her obsession. However, the final beat lacks a visible cost that forecloses a path; she continues searching with bleak exhilaration intact, which reads as Charged Poise but doesn't quite earn the renunciation or alteration the prior causality suggests.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph: Mira aboard a floating observatory, present tense, hunting atmospheric anomalies. The drive lens is Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered reflection, sensor data, and the geode motif until the final image of "possibilities wait, neither dead nor alive" reweights the dominant stake. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the hunt crystallizes into method and stance, though the cost remains more conceptual than visceral on the page. One meaningful deepening occurs when she detects the unusual standing wave and adjusts thrusters, narrowing her search.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The floating observatory pressures choice: Mira adjusts thrusters in response to magnetosphere data, and the frost-rimed window anchors her perception. The geode on her workstation recurs with shifting meaning (millennia in darkness → unrealized potential → light refraction). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "circuit breakers clicked and hissed, cooling," "auroras writhe like wedding veils catching fire." The micro-setting (workstation, instruments, desk lamp) charges the final image when she rotates the geode and continues searching.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: finding where unused potential pools after her cousin's death. Pressure accumulates through perturbation theory, sensor modification, and the unusual standing wave detection. The tightening occurs when Mira adjusts thrusters to pursue coordinates, a choice driven by her agency. However, the ending doesn't foreclose a live option or impose a visible price; she continues the hunt with the same tools and stance, making the escalation more textural than transformative. Under the Accumulative lens this is acceptable but lacks the trade-off that would elevate it.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—where unrealized potential goes—emerges through the geode's transformation, perturbation equations, and the hunt itself, not through direct statement. "Unfiltered awakening" and "intangibly tangible" resonate without becoming thematic echoes. The final image ("neither dead nor alive, for their perturbations to arrive") reweights prior material with quantum ambiguity, offering a non-literal answer. Subtext operates in Vahedi's "ghost hunt" and Mira's reply, and in the parallel between geode beauty and cousin's unlived futures. One minor slip: "The hunt had become her awakening" edges toward theme summary rather than letting the particulars speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with tight focalization through Mira's perceptual signature: she notices circuit breakers, auroras as wedding veils, probability clouds. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("bleak exhilaration scientists get," "intangibly tangible weight"). Dialogue is minimal but natural and goal-driven; Vahedi's "ghost hunt?" and Mira's reply advance plot and carry subtext. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority to atmospheric observation. No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in high-pressure beats, and the prose reflects her analytical yet grief-driven mind.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or the hunt. The opening ("floating observatory drifted through polar stratosphere, its hull creaking as circuit breakers clicked and hissed") anchors voice and stakes. Minor scaffold appears in adjacent lines: "The geode crystal sat on her workstation" followed immediately by "Dr. Vahedi had given it to her after the incident, after the hospitals and the silent flights home"—the second "after" feels like synonym churn. One paraphrase loop: "Potential energy, locked in stone" near the start echoes "unrealized possibilities still vibrated" a few paragraphs later without added pressure. No figurative muddle, but these small slips prevent entry to the high band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of drone strike survivor, perturbation theory, and geode metaphor feels specific and non-obvious; the emotional truth of hunting impossible data to process grief avoids generic templates. The floating observatory and quantum foam setting transform the "searching for closure" trope through grounded scientific detail. Risk-taking is present in the accumulative structure and the refusal to dramatize a tidy resolution. However, the "unused potential pools in reality's margins" concept edges toward a writing-prompt frame, and the transformation, while skillful, doesn't quite reach the hairline originality of the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira's survivor status frames her motivation and drives her sensor modifications and thruster adjustment. Present by the second paragraph (setup), shapes the middle choice to pursue coordinates (development), and the final image explicitly references "her cousin's laugh still echoed through futures that almost were" (payoff). Two-gate minimum met; all three present. Causal pressure is moderate: the trauma enables the hunt but doesn't narrow options in the final beat. Closure linkage is indirect—mentioned but not causally active in the last image.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The geode appears in three distinct beats: Vahedi's gift and explanation (setup), Mira's contemplation of slow transformation and molecular potential (development), and rotation under the desk lamp while adjusting instruments (payoff). It constrains her metaphor for reality ("treating reality itself like a geode") and charges the final paragraph with "light inside unopened stones." Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Specific irreplaceability: amethyst chambers and refracted light matter. Cost connection is conceptual but legible.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Unfiltered awakening is dramatized in the blast aftermath ("understood, with perfect clarity stripped of all comforting delusions, how fragile the membrane between existence and void really was") and shapes her modification of sensors to hunt invisible phenomena. Present by the first third (setup), enables the middle choice (development via sensor work), and the phrase "her awakening" appears near the end (payoff). However, it trends toward theme claim rather than stake constraint; removing the exact phrase would not break story logic. Functional but somewhat replaceable with "trauma-driven clarity" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Intangibly tangible is used twice: once for "the exact moment potential crystallizes into loss" and again for "the intangibly tangible weight of all the world's unused potential." It shapes her sensor design (hunting "signatures of unused potential") and charges the final image ("neither dead nor alive"). Setup by the second paragraph, development through sensor work, payoff in the ending. Causal pressure is moderate—it's a perceptual lens that enables the hunt but doesn't impose a visible trade-off. Specificity is high; irreplaceability moderate.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The hunt drives every major beat: sensor modification, data tracking, unusual wave detection, thruster adjustment, and the final image of "continued searching." Present from the opening (setup), shapes the middle turn when she detects coordinates (development), and provides the story's closure unit (payoff). Strong causal pressure: the hunt narrows her focus and forecloses ordinary grieving. Closure linkage is total—the story is the hunt. Cost is conceptual (isolation, obsession) but legible. Irreplaceability is high; swapping "hunt" for "search" would weaken the predatory urgency.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Perturbation theory is signaled early ("learning to track how minor disturbances... cascaded into hurricanes"), shapes her sensor modifications and algorithm design (development), and provides the conceptual frame for the ending ("for their perturbations to arrive"). Setup and payoff are strong; middle development is functional but somewhat told. Causal pressure is moderate: it's the method that enables the hunt but doesn't impose a tactical cost on the page. Specificity is high (temperature shifts, pressure variations, quantum fluctuations). Irreplaceability is moderate; chaos theory or quantum mechanics could substitute with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The floating observatory supplies the instruments, aurora visibility, and thruster control that enable Mira's hunt. Present in the opening (setup), provides the unusual magnetosphere data and thruster adjustment (development), and the deck shift and circuit breaker cycle frame the ending (payoff). Causal pressure is strong: the observatory's mobility lets her pursue coordinates, and the instruments are essential to detecting the standing wave. Closure linkage is direct—she adjusts thrusters and continues searching. Irreplaceability is high; no other setting would allow polar drift and ionosphere access.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Circuit breakers cooling appears in the opening, midpoint ("electromagnetic relays settling into temporary equilibrium"), and ending ("cooling complete, ready for another surge"). However, the timeframe doesn't tighten decisions or impose a visible clock. Mira adjusts instruments and thrusters without time pressure; the cooling cycle is atmospheric rather than tactical. Setup and payoff are present but development is missing—no middle choice is constrained by the cooling window. Functional but replaceable with any atmospheric cycle. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's desire to find where unused potential pools drives sensor modification, algorithm design, coordinate pursuit, and the final image. Present by the second paragraph (setup), shapes the thruster adjustment when she detects unusual patterns (development), and provides the story's last line (payoff). Strong causal pressure: the desire narrows her focus and forecloses ordinary grieving or social connection. Closure linkage is total. Cost is visible—isolation, obsession, and the renunciation of moving on. Specificity is high; irreplaceability near-total.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Bleak exhilaration appears explicitly ("Dr. Vahedi had given it to her after the incident... that bleak exhilaration scientists get") and permeates the prose: "auroras writhe like wedding veils catching fire," "fierce joy of annihilation and creation." The tone modulates with pressure—reflective in backstory beats, charged when she detects the standing wave. Setup by the first third, coherent through the middle, and charges the final image ("neither dead nor alive"). Strong closure linkage. However, the tone is somewhat static; it doesn't shift decisively at the ending, remaining consistently bleak-exhilarated throughout.</comment>
