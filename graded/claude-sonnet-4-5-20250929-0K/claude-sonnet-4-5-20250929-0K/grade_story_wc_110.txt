<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is specific and concrete—the lens work, the collected doodles—but the emotional progression feels rushed at the closure. The move from "I don't know how to tell her" (Dmitri's fear) to Mira's decisive action lacks contradiction under pressure; she processes the overheard confession and acts without visible internal conflict. The final exchange "I think we're done hiding behind unclear meanings" reads as a stated realization rather than an embodied one with cost. Minor label-speak ("burden of unwanted knowledge," "resonant hush of shared understanding") reduces immediacy in peak beats.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through layered images (doodles, lens, eavesdropping, crystals) and reweights them at closure. Orientation anchors arrive early (Mira, forecourt, night desk). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Mira's gesture with the ticket and the hand-reach moment crystallize mutual understanding with felt emotional cost. However, the cost remains largely implied; the final image ("language beyond sound") asserts resolution rather than showing a visible price or foreclosed path on the page. One meaningful deepening is present but the cost proof is softer than required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The crystal forecourt is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (rain-slicked crystals, prismatic shadows, acoustic whispers) and constrains action—Mira stops listening, the eavesdropping is involuntary due to the forecourt's acoustics. The lens as micro-setting object returns with reweighted meaning at closure. Spatial choreography (desk, archives, projection booth) is clear. The environment charges the final image and enables the pivotal eavesdropping beat, meeting the 9+ gate test for constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>One dominant stake: Mira's emotional isolation and longing for connection. The eavesdropping reversal narrows her options (passive observer → active participant) and the final gesture with the ticket tightens pressure. However, the escalation feels compressed—Dmitri's door opens immediately, and the resolution arrives without visible trade-off or cost on the page. The piece deepens understanding but does not force a choice between competing goods or show a price paid. Agency is present but the cost clarity required for high bands is absent.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (communication, transparency vs. encryption, stepping into life) emerges from concrete particulars: doodles, lens manipulation, eavesdropping. The final image—hands reaching across the space where words would have been—offers a non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The parenthetical heart equation and the cage-unlocking bird carry subtext. Minor weakness: "stepped into it instead" in the final line edges toward summary. The theme is coherent and resonant but not fully indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with Mira's perceptual signature (registrar's eye for detail, the lens as tool). Dialogue is sparse and purposeful. However, Dmitri's eavesdropped confession ("I don't know how to tell her") and Samir's response feel slightly expository—designed for Mira (and reader) rather than natural peer conversation. The final exchange ("I think we're done hiding...") shifts into a more articulate register than the prior beats establish. Voice is controlled but converges at closure without clear purpose.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with purposeful rhythm and varied syntax. Strong images: "ambiguously clear patterns—neither sharp nor blurred," "keys for wings," "language beyond sound." However, several lines carry template cadence and near-paraphrase: "resonant hush" appears twice in similar constructions; "The quiet night registrar had finally stopped eavesdropping on her own life and stepped into it instead" summarizes rather than trusts the dramatized closure. Minor filter-verb stacks ("she saw," "she heard") in mid-pressure beats reduce immediacy. Information density is high but final-paragraph summary dilutes propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of acoustic setting + projector lens + cryptic doodles is specific and internally coherent. The "eavesdropping on her own life" angle offers a fresh inflection on connection stories. However, the core arc (shy colleague communicates through symbols, mutual recognition, hands reach) follows a familiar template without transformation through unexpected moral calculus or lived-in complication. The doodles-as-cipher device feels convenient rather than inevitable. Risk-taking is present in the acoustic conceit but does not elevate stakes materially at closure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout, processes the eavesdropping reversal, draws the counter-ticket, and delivers it to Dmitri. Her choices create two key turns (archives discovery, booth delivery) and shape the closure. Early setup, middle development via archives scene, and closure participation via the hand-reach all present. Causal pressure is moderate; her decision feels enabled by overhearing rather than constrained by prior cost. Strong beat involvement but cost linkage is softer.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The lens appears in beat one (Mira examines it), returns in the archives scene (magnifies doodles to reveal meaning), and is offered at closure ("I kept the lens for you"). Three distinct touches across setup, development, and payoff. The lens enables the doodles' reinterpretation (causal pressure) and is present at closure. However, Dmitri sets it aside immediately; it does not charge the final image or constrain the hand-reach moment. Strong irreplaceability in the magnification beat but closure linkage is ornamental rather than load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Freed by honesty" shapes stakes (Dmitri's fear of direct words, Mira's realization) and the final exchange ("done hiding behind unclear meanings"). The concept is signaled early via Dmitri's overheard confession and thaw/transparency diction, pressures the middle choice (Mira's ticket response), and is restated at closure. However, the concept remains more thematic echo than on-page constraint—no visible cost or trade-off is tied to honesty itself. Setup and closure gates met; causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Ambiguously clear" is vividly described in the lens scene ("neither sharp nor blurred, but something in between") and echoed in "unclear meanings" at closure. However, the attribute functions as motif rather than constraint—it does not enable or prevent an on-page action with cost. The doodles' ambiguity is resolved off-stage (archives magnification) rather than forcing a choice under pressure. Setup and closure reprise present but no middle development; swappable with "cryptic" or "elusive" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Eavesdropping is the inciting reversal: Mira overhears Dmitri's confession, which reweights the doodles and drives the archives beat and final gesture. The action is signaled early (forecourt acoustics, "a voice reached her anyway"), redefines her options (passive registrar → active participant), and the story's causal spine traces directly to it. Early setup, middle pressure (Samir's reply intensifies stakes), and closure linkage (the ticket response is her counter-communication). High irreplaceability; swapping eavesdropping for direct conversation would flatten the acoustic conceit and doodle mystery.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Through cryptic doodles on concert tickets" is seeded early (ticket stubs, "cryptic doodles"), drives the archives discovery beat where Mira deciphers them with the lens, and her counter-doodle (two figures, hands reaching) precipitates closure. The method is signaled, used twice on-page, and shapes tactics. However, the mechanics remain somewhat convenient—the lens magnification and overlap creating "new images" reads as narrative shorthand rather than demonstrated process. Setup, development, and payoff present; causal pressure moderate; specificity high but swappable with "coded notes" or "hidden messages" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The crystal whispering forecourt is established in the opening image (shimmering shards, prismatic shadows, acoustic phenomenon) and directly enables the eavesdropping beat—Mira hears Dmitri's confession because "conversations carry in unexpected directions." The setting constrains her prior habit ("learned to stop listening") and supplies the resource (involuntary overhearing) that triggers the plot. Setup, development (acoustics matter), and closure (rain begins again, crystals sing) all present. The forecourt pressures the central choice and charges the final image with reprise. High causal necessity and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"After words become unnecessary" is invoked at the ending ("that timeframe—after words become unnecessary") and echoed in the final line ("language beyond sound"). The timeframe functions as thematic marker rather than pressure device—no live clock tightens decisions or alters tactics on the page. Closure participation present but setup and middle development absent; time is untracked and vague throughout. The phrase could be removed without breaking scene logic. Ornamental use; cap 4.6 for missing setup and development gates.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"To thaw mistrust with transparency" is dramatized through Dmitri's eavesdropped confession ("I don't know how to tell her") and thaw/transparency diction appears early. The desire drives his doodle behavior (months of indirect communication) and Mira's counter-gesture (the drawn ticket). However, the motivation is largely told via Samir's line ("cowardice dressed up as mystery") rather than shown through conflicting choices under pressure. Setup and closure present; middle friction (fear vs. desire) is stated but not embodied with visible cost. Functional but mid-band for lack of on-page trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Resonant hush" is established early ("hollow hours," "quiet registrar") and recurs coherently across beats: the forecourt's acoustic whispers, the "held-breath moment before understanding," the "resonant hush of shared understanding" at closure. Tone modulates with pressure—shifts from lonely quiet to charged silence—and the final image ("crystals sang their secrets... but inside the booth") contrasts exterior and interior resonance. Tone charges the ending and is tightly woven through diction and rhythm. High coherence and closure linkage; the exact phrase "resonant hush" appears twice in similar constructions (minor repetition) but the tonal effect is indispensable.</comment>
