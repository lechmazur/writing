<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marina's interior is established through her role and gift for reading disorientation, but her dual allegiance remains largely told rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene. The foundation stone chip provides a concrete anchor for her past, yet her decision to reorganize through graffiti feels more like a summary of offstage action than a choice unfolding under pressure. The final encounter with the newcomer shows her teaching intention, but the cost of her resistance—what she's foreclosing—reads as conceptual rather than viscerally embodied in the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph. The piece follows an accumulative lens: Marina's memory of displacement → developers' encroachment → her graffiti campaign → community revival → final encounter. Closure reads as Charged Poise: Marina stands ready to teach resistance, the carnival's survival crystallized in motion, the foundation stone a felt weight of prior loss. Cost is present but oblique—"hopeful desperation," constant adaptation required—rather than a single forfeited path made visible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The raft city is rendered through calliope music, fried dough, painted faces, interconnected platforms that bob and sway—sensory detail filtered through Marina's familiarity. The foundation stone chip constrains her final stance, a tangible reminder of what happens when motion stops. Spatial choreography is clear (platforms, edges, speedboats cutting wakes), and the carnival's physicality pressures the gentrification conflict throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—survival of the carnival against privatization—is signaled early and persists. Marina's graffiti campaign tightens community resistance, but the escalation occurs largely in summary ("Within weeks, the community began to shift"). The final beat reweights her teaching role under threat, yet the pressure reads as thematic reconfiguration rather than a narrowed tactical choice with visible cost in the moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the carnival-as-resistance premise: culture as living practice versus sanitized commodity, motion versus fixity. The foundation stone chip and graffiti codes operate as motifs that accumulate meaning without overt statement. The ending offers a resonant answer—"let me show you how to really see it"—that reframes Marina's role from absorber to recruiter, with the carnival's "endless, defiant dance" charging the final image without moralizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV maintains consistent access to Marina's perceptions and memories. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("culture shock absorber," "hopeful desperation"), though some passages drift toward elevated register ("orderly intuitive nature," "weave themselves into the community's fabric") that feels slightly authorial. The brief dialogue at the end serves purpose but arrives too late to test voice distinction. No head-hopping or tense slips.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several phrases loop conceptually: "perpetual carnival," "raft city," and variations on "carnival logic/language" recur without adding pressure. The phrase "hopeful desperation" followed immediately by "hope that the carnival could survive, desperation because..." is a paraphrase loop (−0.2). Metaphorical choices are coherent, though "barnacles" for gentrification and "swallowed" for the city read as stock. Sentence openings vary adequately, no major propulsion stalls.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The carnival-as-floating-resistance premise offers a fresh spatial twist on gentrification narratives, and the graffiti-as-encoded-resistance adds tactical specificity. However, the emotional arc—welcoming newcomer discovers need to teach resistance—follows a familiar transformation-of-role template. The synthesis feels purposeful but not entirely non-obvious; the carnival setting provides vivid particulars, yet the thematic resolution (culture requires constant motion) lands near an expected moral territory for displacement stories.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Marina as "culture shock absorber" frames her opening role, her decision to use graffiti codes in the middle third, and her shift to teaching resistance in the final encounter. Present in setup, middle choice (graffiti campaign), and ending (teaching the newcomer). Causal role across beats, though her choices are more summarized than dramatized in peak moments.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The foundation stone chip is introduced in paragraph two (within first third), returns in Marina's pocket at the raft's edge ("weighed heavy"), and is invoked again as "a reminder of what happened when you let them make you solid." Three touches across setup, middle reflection, and near-ending. Reweighted meaning (from past loss to present warning) is clear, though it remains a thought object rather than handled or used in action.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Dual allegiance" is dramatized early ("gift for easing transitions had become a curse of dual allegiance") and shapes Marina's tactics: she understands yearning for stability even as it terrifies her, then resolves the tension by reorganizing to deepen original purpose rather than compromise. The concept drives her middle decision (graffiti campaign) and reframes her final teaching stance. Core conflict hinges on this element.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Orderly intuitive" is mentioned in the opening paragraph as making her "perfect for the role" of absorber, enabling her to "sense when someone was drowning in disorientation" and "know exactly which threads...to pull." The trait is asserted but not shown constraining or enabling a specific on-page action with visible cost. It could be swapped for "perceptive" or "empathetic" without structural change. Label-only use, no middle or closure beat tied to this exact trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Reorganize" is signaled in paragraph four ("That's when Marina decided to reorganize everything"), drives the graffiti campaign and community shift in paragraph five, and culminates in her teaching the newcomer "how to really see it" at the end. The action redefines her role from absorber to active organizer and recruiter, altering the community's trajectory. Essential across beats and closure; removing it would collapse the middle and ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Graffiti art is introduced in paragraph four as Marina's chosen method, detailed in paragraph five (juggler's pin, color codes, carousel horses as directional signals), and the newcomer is told "let me show you how to really see it" in the ending while gesturing at "painted walls that held their secrets." Present in setup, middle execution, and closure promise. The encoding mechanic matters—old-timers understand, newcomers and developers do not—and it enables the community's resistance tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The "perpetual carnival afloat on a raft city" anchors every beat: platforms that bob and sway, calliope music, painted faces, interconnected platforms, speedboats cutting wakes, fortune-tellers' spots replaced by boutiques. The carnival's motion and noise become tactical weapons (spontaneous parades block boats, amplified music disrupts boutiques). Marina's position at the raft's edge and the physicality of teaching someone with "soaked" shoes ground the ending. Setting drives conflict and closure image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Before privatization" is stated in paragraph two ("before privatization swept through like a hurricane") and contextualizes urgency throughout. The developers are "already" circling, gentrification is "creeping," and Marina's campaign occurs "within weeks." Time is present and relevant to stakes but not tracked with enough precision to alter tactics beat-by-beat. No live clock that forces immediate choices; the timeframe supplies context rather than tightening pressure on the page.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Marina's motivation—navigating gentrification by preserving the carnival's autonomy—is dramatized through her memory of displacement, her terror at others' yearning for stability, and her decision to organize resistance rather than accommodate. The friction between welcoming newcomers and teaching them to resist (not just assimilate) creates internal conflict. Her final act (teaching the newcomer to read graffiti) embodies the navigation. Choice-driven and present across the arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Hopeful desperation" is named explicitly ("the hopeful desperation that had become her constant companion") and modulates through the piece: terror mixed with memory in paragraph two, resolve in paragraphs four-five, and the pairing of "practiced smile" with teaching resistance in the ending. The tone charges the final image—"endless, defiant dance"—but the explicit labeling of the tone mid-story weakens its integration. Present and coherent, though the direct statement pulls it toward theme rather than purely tonal resonance.</comment>
