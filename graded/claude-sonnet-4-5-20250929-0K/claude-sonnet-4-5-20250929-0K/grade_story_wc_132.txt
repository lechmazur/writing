<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's interiority is concrete and her shift from control to surrender is traced through specific micro-choices (leaving weeds, stopping scheduled pruning, keeping the moss). The metamorphosis is embodied through her evolving relationship with the plants, and her grandmother's voice provides productive friction. However, the final act—letting the leaf go—feels more symbolic gesture than a choice with visible cost that forecloses a path; the piece tells us she's changed more than it dramatizes a painful trade-off in the closing beat. The blend of research identity and folk wisdom is character-particular, but the epiphany ("finally understood") leans toward summary at a key turn.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (Maya, nursery, post-rain, trellis). The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: density increases through storm imagery, moss microclimates, and the linden's volunteer growth, culminating in the leaf-release that reweights her stance from control to co-growth. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis hybrid)—she renounces her old researcher identity and commits to observation-based practice, with the cost implied in "dissolution of her old identity" and the leaf's release marking acceptance. The cost is somewhat diffuse (told more than shown in a single image), and causality is looser than Causal mode would demand, but the accumulative design holds and the final image recharges prior material.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The mossy trellis functions as micro-setting: it holds moisture, creates microclimates, and becomes her thinking space, directly shaping her decision to leave the moss and observe rather than control. The linden leaf is handled multiple times with texture ("delicate structure against her heart"), and storm season provides recurring environmental pressure that tests her structures and beliefs. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Maya's evolving POV (moss, dripping water, rainwater-heavy leaves), and the setting transitions from threat to conversation by the end, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to control or surrender in plant care—is clear and tested through storm season's repeated pressure. Escalation reads as deepening rather than multiple reversals: each storm and each small act of releasing control (leaving weeds, keeping moss, stopping scheduled pruning) narrows her options until the final leaf-release forecloses her old identity. The cost is present but somewhat abstract ("dissolution of her old identity," "losing herself"), and the piece would benefit from a sharper on-page trade-off in the closing beat—what specific research path or academic credential does she give up by staying?</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of control versus surrender emerges through concrete particulars: moss microclimates, volunteer linden, storm conversations. The linden leaf's return with shifted meaning (from specimen to living partner) charges the ending, and the final release offers a resonant answer to the central question without stating a moral. However, phrases like "metamorphosis wasn't complete; she suspected it never would be" and "mysterious forces she'd spent years trying to control" veer toward thematic summary in the final paragraph, and "circuitously sincere in her inability to admit she was becoming attached" reads as authorial commentary rather than earned insight. The piece resists easy binaries and embraces ambiguity in Maya's ongoing journey.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is character-specific: Maya notices veins, soil compositions, irrigation calibrations early, then shifts to noticing which plants "lean toward each other." Diction matches her dual identity (academic/folk), and free indirect style is clean ("exhaustion made her postpone the task"). One register slip: "circuitously sincere in her inability to admit she was becoming attached" reads more like narrator commentary than Maya's own thought pattern under her current state. Rhythm modulates with emotional intensity, and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is clear and rhythmically varied, with strong sensory anchors (dripping trellis, trembling leaf, scent of approaching rain). Information density is high in the middle third. However, the piece carries some scaffold: "she began collecting its leaves, pressing them" recounts rather than shows a key attachment moment; "This was study too, she realized—perhaps truer than any she'd conducted" tells the epiphany rather than trusting the image. The final paragraph's "mysterious forces she'd spent years trying to control" and "finally felt like she was growing alongside her plants" loop back over ground already established, adding abstract summary where a sharper image would serve. No major loops or template cadence, but the closure beat could tighten.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The researcher-becomes-gardener arc is familiar, but the piece individualizes it through the volunteer linden, moss microclimates, and storm season as teacher rather than obstacle. The emotional truth of releasing professional identity feels earned. However, the core transformation (data-driven scientist learns to let go) follows a well-worn template without a bold structural or conceptual twist, and the final image—releasing a pressed leaf to rest among moss—is symbolically apt but predictable. The specificity of plant behaviors and the mossy trellis elevate the execution, yet the piece does not take a risk that redefines expectations.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maya's choices drive all major turns: she postpones pulling the linden, begins leaving weeds, stops scheduled pruning, keeps the moss, and finally releases the leaf. Each decision narrows options and alters her nursery practice, culminating in the closure choice to document "stories of individual plants" rather than hypotheses. Present in setup, middle development (multiple micro-choices), and closure (leaf release, new journal method). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; the story would collapse without her agency.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The linden leaf appears in beat one (studying veins), is collected and pressed mid-story, tucked in her pocket, held up to light, and released in the final image. Its return reweights meaning from specimen to partner, charging the closure. Present in setup, development (pressed between research journals, carried in pocket), and payoff (released to moss). However, the leaf's role in middle beats is more carried object than active constraint on choice; the release is symbolic rather than a choice with sharp tactical cost, limiting the score below 7.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Reluctant metamorphosis shapes the entire arc: Maya resists, fights "the dissolution of her old identity," and each act of releasing control "felt like losing herself." The reluctance is dramatized through her initial impulse to pull the linden, her engineering attempts, and her discomfort with surrendering measurement. The concept constrains her tactics (she tries scientific control first, fails, then slowly yields) and defines the stakes. Present throughout and paid off at closure, though the final paragraph's "metamorphosis wasn't complete" states the concept rather than trusting the image alone.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Circuitously sincere in her inability to admit she was becoming attached" appears once, mid-story, describing her leaf-collecting habit. It colors her internal evasion but does not constrain an on-page choice with visible cost; she collects the leaves regardless. The phrase reads more as narratorial characterization than a trait that enables or prevents a specific action. Present in development but not setup or closure; label-only usage without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Reconstruct" appears explicitly: "Her attempts to reconstruct the nursery according to scientific principles had nearly destroyed it." The action drives the inciting problem—her engineering and calibration create the failure that forces the shift to observation. However, the reconstruction itself happens in backstory summary; we see its aftermath (struggling plants) rather than witnessing the act on the page in a beat with cost. Present in development as causal backstory, shapes the problem, but not directly dramatized or present at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Releasing control is the method signaled early ("leaving the moss had been her first real lesson") and mechanics matter: she leaves weeds, stops pruning on schedule, keeps moss, and each release enables plant thriving while costing her sense of mastery. The method shapes multiple attempts (small acts of surrender) and defines the final leaf-release. Present in setup (moss decision), development (weeds, pruning), and closure (leaf spiraling down). Strong causal pressure; the story's logic depends on this exact method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The mossy trellis is her favorite thinking space, divides the nursery into "sections of shadow and dappled light," holds moisture during dry spells creating fern microclimates, and frames the opening and closing images. It pressures her choice to keep the moss (a key micro-decision) and provides the spatial anchor for her reflection and final act. Present in setup (opening image), development (moss microclimates), and closure (final paragraph's "under the mossy trellis"). The trellis constrains layout and her awareness, but "after rain" is more atmospheric than a live tactical constraint; the rain has already stopped.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Storm season provides recurring pressure: the first storm "terrified her," the third arrives in the story's present, and she reframes storms as "conversations" by the end. The timeframe tightens decisions (repeated tests of her structures) and shapes her evolving stance. Present throughout and paid off at closure ("with storm season transforming her carefully ordered world"). However, the storms complicate rather than impose a strict ticking clock that alters moment-to-moment tactics; the piece could function in "rainy spring" without major structural loss, suggesting the timeframe is more thematic container than hard constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Her desire to understand "why some plants thrived while others withered" frames the opening and motivates her three-year effort. The friction between data-driven study and grandmother's folk wisdom creates internal conflict, and her shift from "hypotheses and variables" to "stories of individual plants" at closure pays off the motivation. Present in setup, tested in development (her control attempts fail), and transformed at closure (new journal method). However, the motivation is more premise than live source of scene-by-scene choice friction; we are told she studied behaviors, but few on-page beats show her actively experimenting under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Tone is coherent and modulates purposefully: contemplative in the opening, darker during "dissolution of her old identity," then warming through "smiled, remembering" to the gentle closure. The tone sustains transformation by avoiding false triumph or neat resolution ("metamorphosis wasn't complete") and charges the final image with quiet acceptance rather than declarative victory. The mossy trellis, dripping water, and storm imagery anchor the sustaining quality. Tone coheres across all beats and supports rather than tensions the concept, fitting the "sustaining transformation" requirement without ironic distance.</comment>
