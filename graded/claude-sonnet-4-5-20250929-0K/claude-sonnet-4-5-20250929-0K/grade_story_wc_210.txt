<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Miranda's interior landscape shows purposeful work: she rejects guild illusions, then builds methodology through memory rather than force. Her agency drives the revival through conceptual labor. However, the final passage ("people who rejected easy consolations") tells rather than dramatizes the gathering, and her internal contradictions remain understated—the choice to keep the bottle sealed lacks visible cost or conflicted impulse in the moment of decision.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (alchemist, Lantern Cove, post-wish exhaustion). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Miranda's nightly work with the bottle densifies until others arrive and the town revives. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—she refuses to open the bottle, and that refusal becomes the foundation for honest rebuilding. Cost is conceptual (rejection of extractive magic) but legible in the final image. One tightening point: the bottle's warmth signals catalysis, and spring's arrival marks the turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cove's skeleton—paper lanterns, rusted hooks, wish-house echoes, dock grooves—supplies Miranda's raw material for reconstruction. Sensory detail (torn rice paper "like the breathing of something long dead") is vivid and filtered through her alchemical lens. The bottle's amber surface and swirling patterns anchor repeated beats. However, spatial choreography during the revival phase is vague; we see no tactile interaction with rebuilt structures or lanterns being lit on the page, only summary.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: reimagining the ghost town without extractive magic. Pressure accumulates through nightly work with the bottle, each session revealing more. The turn arrives when Miranda realizes the bottle is a mirror, not a container to force open—this reweights her methodology and enables spring's arrival. Agency is clear (she conceives, others follow). Cost is present but understated: no live option is dramatized and foreclosed; we infer she's rejected easier paths (opening the bottle, using guild potions) but don't see a moment of temptation tested on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—honest transformation versus extractive comfort—emerges organically from Miranda's rejection of guild illusions and the bottle's closed state. The final image (bottle still sealed, liquid dreaming) offers a resonant non-literal answer: some vessels contain possibility precisely by remaining closed. Subtext operates in the bottle's response to imagination and the lanterns lit "not by magic but by human hands." The piece resists moralizing and allows counter-readings (is refusal to open the bottle wisdom or avoidance?). Minor slip: "the hardest alchemy was transforming death into honest life" edges toward thesis statement in the penultimate paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds cleanly to Miranda's focalization; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and elevated ("crucible," "catalyzing," "dreaming the dreams that only closed vessels can contain") but remains consistent with an alchemist's lexicon. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during bottle examination, wider during the summary of others' arrival). One register slip: "the stubborn refusal to accept comfortable endings" reads as authorial commentary rather than Miranda's perception. No dialogue, so those bullets are N/A.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies; opening and closing images are strong. Information density is high in the bottle-examination and nightly-work passages. Minor loop: "She remembered..." x3 in one paragraph uses identical stems without escalation between iterations. Figurative language is controlled except for one mixed metaphor: "wishes were parasites" feeding on "possibility until nothing remained but the empty husk"—the vehicle shifts from biological parasite to plant remains. "Architecture of hope" and "mind's crucible" are stock metaphor strings. No clarity-breaking artifacts, but these small slips accumulate to −0.5 to −0.7 from an 8.0 baseline.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—alchemist revives ghost town by refusing to open a mysterious bottle—offers a fresh inversion of the "open the MacGuffin" trope. The bottle-as-mirror rather than vessel-to-pour is a non-obvious synthesis. However, the ghost-town-revival and rejected-guild setups are familiar templates, and the story does not transform them with highly specific lived detail or unexpected moral calculus. The ending's resonance (closed bottle enables open future) is clever but feels more conceptual than viscerally earned through on-page struggle. Mid-to-upper band for ingenuity, not exceptional.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Miranda (deserted alchemist) is present throughout, makes the key choice to treat the bottle as mirror rather than opening it, and her nightly work drives the revival. She appears in the inciting beat (finding the bottle), middle development (conceiving methodology), and closure (keeping it sealed as others arrive). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; her specific training ("all transformation began in the mind's crucible") enables the solution. Small deduction: the decision to never open the bottle is recounted, not dramatized as a tempted moment.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The amber bottle appears in at least four beats: discovery at tideline, first night examination (blueprints inside), nightly returns (contents reveal more, bottle warms), and final image (still sealed on workbench). It constrains Miranda's approach (she realizes it's a mirror, not to be opened) and charges the closure image ("dreaming the dreams that only closed vessels can contain"). High irreplaceability: removing it would collapse the story's logic. Scored down slightly from 8.5+ because the bottle's refusal to open is told rather than tested—no on-page temptation scene where she tries or resists trying.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Ghost town revival is the dominant external stake. The concept shapes Miranda's tactics (she works through memory, conceives new structures from old patterns) and the ending (spring arrival, lanterns relit, others gathering). It drives the middle work and resolves in the closure unit. Strong Development and Payoff gates. Setup is implicit (the town is dead when she arrives) but not framed as her goal until she "began to conceive of something unprecedented." Cost is conceptual (honest rebuilding vs. extractive magic) and legible in the final image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Rejects false comfort" is dramatized in the opening (Miranda abandoned her guild for choosing illusion over truth, rejected potions that numbed) and constrains her bottle methodology (she understands it's not meant to be forced open). It returns implicitly at closure ("people who rejected easy consolations"). Visible cost: she's wandering alone, deserted. However, the trait is more backstory-established than tested in present action—no on-page moment where she's tempted by an easy solution and chooses the harder path. Two-gate integration (Setup, Payoff) with causal constraint; eligible to mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Conceive" is the core action: Miranda conceives an unprecedented methodology, conceives new structures from old patterns, conceives the bottle as mirror. It drives the middle development (nightly conceptual work) and enables the revival. The word and its synonyms appear in at least three functional beats. Removing "conceive" and replacing it with generic "build" or "plan" would diminish the alchemical flavor and the mind-as-crucible premise. Strong causal pressure and specificity. Small deduction: the act of conceiving is recounted more than enacted; we see results (others arrive) but not the struggle or cost of the mental labor on the page.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Through working memory" is named once: "She worked through memory, because memory was the only tool she had left." The method is signaled and its mechanics matter (she reconstructs the town from impressions, not records). It constrains her approach and ties to the alchemist training ("all transformation began in the mind's crucible"). However, it's introduced in one paragraph and then the story shifts to "each night she returned to the bottle"—the bottle, not memory work, becomes the visible method in subsequent beats. Two-gate (Setup, Development); the method enables but doesn't dominate. Cap around 6.0 for moderate causal role.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lantern Cove is named and described (paper lanterns on rusted hooks, wish-house, dock, tideline). The lanterns supply a key insight: their spacing marked gathering points, guiding Miranda's market conception. The cove's bones (grooves, echoes) feed her reconstruction. It returns at closure (lanterns glow again, lit by human hands). Three-gate integration with causal participation in the middle. Deduction: the setting is more conceptual resource than physical constraint—it doesn't pressure a choice or supply a tool that alters outcome on the page; it's raw material for her mental work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"After the last wish was granted" anchors the Setup (the town is dead, magic exhausted). It establishes a post-collapse frame that justifies Miranda's arrival and the revival stakes. However, the timeframe doesn't tighten decisions or tactics after the opening. No clock or deadline pressures Miranda's work; "each night" and "by the time spring arrived" are vague durations. The element is present and logically consistent but replaceable with any post-disaster marker. Two-gate (Setup, weak Payoff echo in "spring arrived"); functional but mid-low for lack of ongoing pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Miranda's motivation—to reimagine an entire civilization—is present by implication in "began to conceive of something unprecedented" and explicit in "reimagined from memory, necessity, and the stubborn refusal." It drives the middle work (conceiving new structures, markets, homes) and resolves at closure (the revival succeeds). The scale (civilization, not just repair) justifies the bottle's symbolic weight. Small deduction: the motivation is recounted and affirmed more than dramatized under friction. We see no moment where the scope overwhelms her or forces a tradeoff. Three-gate integration with strong Payoff; cost is conceptual (honest vs. extractive) but the desire itself isn't tested.</comment>
