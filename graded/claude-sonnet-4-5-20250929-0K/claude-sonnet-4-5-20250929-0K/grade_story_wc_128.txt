<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marianne's shrewdness is asserted through her professional reputation but never tested on the page—she makes no difficult choices between competing goods. The friendship with Chen unfolds without friction or contradictory impulses; both women move in harmony toward a shared goal with no visible internal conflict. Chen's daughter backstory anchors emotion, but Marianne's arc from broker to documentarian happens off-page across "following weeks," summarized rather than dramatized. The lighthouse keeper's near-tears reads as convenient validation rather than earned resistance overcome.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—the piece builds through the photo reveal, the shared recognition, and the display project to arrive at a thematic reconfiguration. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing: the final "cycles of compassion" image and Chen's line about wrong addresses reweight the opening mistake into purposeful design. Cost remains abstract—no visible forfeiture or path foreclosed on the page; the "shift in her chest" is asserted, not dramatized through a choice with price. Orientation is clean; the pattern coheres, but the ending lacks the felt consequence required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The observatory library under stars is vivid and purposeful: the glass dome, breeze through vents, salt-sweet harbor scent anchor the scene early and consistently. The reading table "where starlight pooled like spilled milk" charges the space, and the display entrance under the dome returns at closure, making setting an active frame. The locket photo is handled across beats (opening exchange, Chen touching it, worn daily at the end), shifting from envelope to embodied presence, which lifts object integration and extends setting's role as witness.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—uplifting silent contributors—is signaled by midpoint and pursued without opposition or cost. The project unfolds through summary ("Over the following weeks") rather than on-page reversals; no resistance from the workers, no logistical friction, no competing demand tests Marianne's commitment. The lighthouse keeper's gratitude arrives as affirmation, not complication. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful deepening would suffice, but the "shift in her chest" is declared, not earned by a choice that forecloses an option or pays a visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Cycles of compassion" emerges through the photo notes, the display project, and the final image of "waves from a harbor," but Chen's explicit label ("Cycles of compassion") in dialogue borders on thematic echo, particularly when paired with the closing meta-commentary about "shores neither woman could yet imagine." The lighthouse keeper's whisper ("People think the lighthouse just runs itself") offers concrete thematic texture. The ending reweights the mistaken envelope into purposeful arrival, but the final paragraph's elevated register ("ancient patterns, witnesses to this new cycle") leans toward summary rather than letting the image resonate without gloss.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited through Marianne; her perceptual signature (shrewdness, "cautious exuberance") colors observation. Dialogue feels natural and advances goals: Chen's invitation to "stay a moment," Marianne's recognition of "silent contributors," and the closing exchange carry subtext of shared values. Minor filter-verb reliance ("she'd learned," "she'd come," "she'd built") slightly dulls immediacy, but the voice remains coherent and the psychic distance modulates purposefully. The brief direct dialogue between the two women distinguishes their tones without convergence.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in early beats ("the only place in town open this late," "cargo broker...shrewdness"). The line "something softer than ledgers and manifests" and later "currency of gratitude" rely on predictable business-versus-emotion diction. The closing paragraph leans into elevated register ("ancient patterns, witnesses to this new cycle") that feels slightly algorithmic rather than voice-particular. Minimal loops; one paraphrase near the end ("thank you"/"thank you") is conversational rather than scaffolding. Clarity and propulsion are strong; no artifact obscures causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The mistaken-envelope meet-cute and subsequent recognition project follow a familiar template: chance encounter → shared epiphany → montage of good works → meta-reflection on ripples. The core premise—honoring invisible labor—resonates emotionally but lacks a non-obvious complication or cost that would transform the template. The lighthouse keeper detail and Chen's daughter organizing the symphony offer specific texture, yet the story could swap occupations and settings with minimal structural change. Risk-aversion shows in the frictionless arc and the explain-everything closing image.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Marianne's shrewdness is asserted in the opening ("built her reputation on shrewdness—knowing which captains would deliver") and again when she recognizes "silent contributors," but no on-page choice tests or demonstrates this trait under pressure. Her decision to return the envelope and later document workers happens off-page or summarized. Present by paragraph one; mentioned in two beats; but decisions do not narrow options or create visible cost. Swappable with a generic "thoughtful professional."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The locket photo appears in the envelope reveal (beat one), Chen touches it gently while explaining her daughter (beat two), and it returns worn daily at closure ("the locket she now wore daily," beat three). The object shifts from hidden tribute to embodied presence, charging the ending when paired with Chen's gratitude. However, the locket does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—it validates rather than complicates. Strong lyric reprise and beat involvement, but no causal pressure or cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Cycles of compassion" is named explicitly by Chen in dialogue mid-story, shaping the display project and the ending image of "ripple outward like waves." The concept organizes the thematic arc but does not constrain Marianne's tactics or force a choice with cost—she pursues the project without friction. Present by midpoint, linked to closure image, but the work is conceptual rather than dramatized through on-page pressure. Fits the lyric-resonance allowance but lacks causal teeth.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Whimsically attentive" describes Chen shelving books "as if the books were children being tucked into bed" in paragraph three. The trait colors one image but does not constrain an action, enable a tactic, or return with reweighted meaning. Label-only use without cost or choice linkage. Present early but ornamental; swappable with any warm character descriptor.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Initiate" drives the story: Marianne and Chen "initiated something neither had planned—a friendship built on their shared desire." This action launches the display project and the documentary work that fill the middle. However, the initiation is told in summary ("Over the following weeks") rather than dramatized through a specific on-page moment with friction or cost. Present in the second half; referenced at closure; but the mechanics remain abstract. Functional, causal role in one turn, but easily swappable with "began" or "started."</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mistaken-address envelope is the inciting object: Marianne brings it to Chen (beat one), Chen opens it to reveal the locket and notes (beat two), and Chen's closing line reweights it ("the best things arrive at the wrong address, exactly when we need them most," beat three). The method shapes causality—no envelope, no meeting, no friendship—and returns charged at closure. Early signal, two beats, closure payoff. The element is specific (not just "a meeting") and irreplaceable within the story's hinge.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "breezy library under stars" is anchored early with vivid detail (glass dome, vents, harbor scent, starlight pooled). The space frames the opening dialogue and the display work, and the dome returns at closure ("Through the dome above, stars wheeled"). However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics—it witnesses rather than pressures. Micro-setting (the reading table, the entrance display) is functional but not causal. Strong atmosphere and lyric reprise; lacks tactical bite.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>"After the symphony ends" anchors the opening moment and explains why the library is open late. Time then collapses into "following weeks" without tracking days, deadlines, or a ticking constraint. The timeframe sets the scene but does not tighten decisions or alter tactics. Present in paragraph one; absent from escalation and closure. Ornamental rather than functional.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation to "uplift silent contributors" is dramatized through Marianne's recognition speech ("The silent contributors...Without them, nothing moves") and her documentary work (rope-makers, clerks, cooks, lighthouse keeper). Chen's display and Marianne's "shift in her chest" extend the motive to closure. However, the desire is never conflicted—no cost, competing want, or friction tests commitment. Present by midpoint; drives two beats (display, photography); linked to ending. Lacks want-versus-fear tension or visible price.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.0</grade><comment>"Cautious exuberance" is named explicitly ("that cautious exuberance she'd learned to trust in business") when Marianne decides to stay. The tone colors her openness to the unexpected and modulates gently as she photographs the keeper and feels "something shift in her chest." The mood remains stable rather than charged under pressure—no tonal break or intensification at closure. Present early; coherent through turns; but does not sharpen the final image with escalating pressure. Functional label more than lived texture.</comment>
