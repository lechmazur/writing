<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and consistent—she seeks to express what words cannot through tuned bells. Her sensory engagement with the bells is embodied ("chest tighten," feeling vibration through fingertips), and the decision to share her discovery by teaching others represents earned growth. However, interiority leans toward poetic summary rather than contradictory impulses in scene; the pilgrim interaction and final resolve feel more like thematic confirmation than friction-driven choice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (who, where, what she carries). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through the ice's transformation of bell tones, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Mira understands her purpose and commits to teaching others. The closure lands with conceptual cost (accepting imperfection over technical mastery) that reweights the opening premise. One tightening—ice melts, tones shift, revelation follows—is sufficient for this length under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The bluff, clouds, and kinetic sculpture are vividly established with purposeful sensory detail (morning sun, glistening ice, wind-driven choreography). The ice fragment functions as micro-setting, constraining the sculpture's voice and charging the final image when "now half its original size" it continues to gleam. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. Setting details reflect Mira's professional priorities (calibration, tuning, pivot mechanisms) without excess.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: achieving "symphonies of truth" that transcend words. The melting ice introduces imperfection, creating one meaningful deepening—Mira abandons technical perfection for honest beauty, a tightening that narrows her artistic path. The pilgrim arrival and Mira's decision to teach others provide visible cost (sharing rather than hoarding the discovery). Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; the resolution is protagonist-driven.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—truth through imperfect resonance rather than verbal precision—emerges from the ice's effect on bronze without thematic statements until the very end. The closing line "heard everything humanity had lost and everything it had found in the letting go" skirts moralizing but remains anchored in the bell's vibration. Subtext operates in gesture (pilgrim's throat-touch, Mira's "wordless smile") and the contrast between her perfect tunings and the richer, human tones. The final image reweights the opening quest with quiet resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains stable throughout with no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent—technical musical terms, attention to calibration and atmospheric shifts—and diction stays within Mira's professional idiom. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (tightens during the chest-tightening moment, opens for the pilgrim scene). No dialogue to judge. The prose rhythm supports emotional beats without filter-verb stacks or register drift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally and information density is high (most lines advance character, atmosphere, or concept). Minor scaffold appears in "It wasn't the clear tone...It was richer" and the phrase "honest beauty" recurs without added pressure. The closing paragraph uses "symphony/symphonies" three times across five sentences, creating mild template cadence. No loops that obscure causality, but figurative density in the final third ("color of wonder," "symphonies of truth") slightly elevates register during peak beats without breaking voice.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—post-verbal society communicating through tuned bells—is conceptually fresh, and the iceberg fragment carrying trapped conversations offers a specific, non-obvious synthesis. The emotional turn (imperfection yields honesty) feels earned in hindsight. However, the frame risks proximity to familiar "lost art rediscovered" templates, and the resolution (teaching spreads the truth) follows expected contours. Mira's seasonal muteness constrains her world but does not visibly complicate her choices on the page. Specificity in bell mechanics and the melting ice elevates the execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira retrieves the ice (setup), places it at the sculpture's center and adjusts mechanisms throughout the day (development), and commits to teaching others after hearing the transformed bells (closure). Her decisions—unpacking the ice, adjusting the sculpture, choosing to share—create key turns. The choice to teach rather than keep the discovery private forecloses a path with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The iceberg fragment is introduced in the opening, handled in multiple beats (unpacking, placement, coating each bell, melting to half size), and its presence at the sculpture's heart charges the final image. Its ancient trapped frequencies enable the tonal shift that drives Mira's revelation. Removing it would break the story's causal and thematic logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Symphonies of truth frame Mira's goal from the start, shape her dissatisfaction with perfect tunings, and are achieved when the ice-coated bells produce layered, human tones. The concept drives tactics (adjusting mechanisms, allowing ice to coat each bell) and the pilgrim scene demonstrates its effect. It could be reworded as "honest expression" without major structural change, limiting irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Seasonal muteness is mentioned in paragraph two but does not constrain an on-page action. Mira communicates through bells year-round and uses sign language with the pilgrim; the trait enriches backstory but remains ornamental. No visible cost or tactical tradeoff tied to her muteness appears in the present scene.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The glistening ice creates the moisture film that transforms the bell's voice, triggering Mira's chest-tightening recognition and all subsequent adjustments. The action appears early, recurs as the ice melts throughout the day, and directly enables the closure revelation. Swapping "glisten" for "melt" would reduce the sensory charge but not break causality; strong integration overall.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The kinetic sculpture is established in the opening, its mechanics detailed (articulated arms, wind-driven choreography, pivot design), and it is the instrument through which the ice's effect is realized. Mira adjusts its mechanisms in response to the tonal shift, and it continues singing at closure. The sculpture's kinetic nature—motion into sound—is essential; a static bell array would not produce the same cascading, wind-responsive symphonies.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Whispering Bluff is anchored early with vivid sensory detail (clouds beneath boots, highest point, stars above clouds at dusk). The setting enables the sculpture's wind-driven function and draws pilgrims by sound. However, the bluff does not constrain a tactical choice or supply a resource that alters outcome; it functions as apt backdrop rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The post-verbal era is signaled in the opening ("before the Great Silence") and recurs in the pilgrim scene ("after the speaking age"). It motivates Mira's quest and shapes the world's communication norms (sign language, bell tuning). The timeframe does not tighten a decision or create urgency; it establishes context and thematic stakes but does not function as a live clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Preserving wonder is stated explicitly near the end but is dramatized earlier through Mira's dissatisfaction with perfect tones and her chest-tightening response to the ice-coated bell's richness. The motivation drives her retrieval of the ice, her all-day adjustments, and her decision to teach others. Friction between technical mastery and honest beauty creates visible cost (abandoning perfection). The late explicit statement slightly reduces subtlety.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Muted vigor is coherent throughout: Mira's silent, focused work; the pilgrims' wordless listening; passions "unexpressed but not extinguished." Tone modulates with pressure (tightens at the chest-tightening beat, opens for the pilgrim arrival, quiets at the wordless smile). The final image—bells singing on, Mira smiling wordlessly—charges the tone with earned closure. No tonal ruptures or static mood.</comment>
