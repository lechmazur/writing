<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and embodied through her work with plants, and her final micro-choice (offering tea, the cutting) alters the relationship with visible cost—she stops watching him decide, accepting his autonomy. Kael's blade-sheathing as embodied emotion is effective. The backstory about the mother is purposeful and anchored in present stimuli (the plant he touches). Minor: "senselessly perceptive" is labeled rather than fully dramatized through contradictory impulses in scene.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Situational (coherent pressure forces stance crystallization). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kael's blade stays sheathed, he accepts tea, and the final image of clean light breaking through dust reweights the opening's "sky rained dust" with felt cost—both characters forfeit their prior stances. The lie about the magistrate and Mira's refusal to leave create meaningful pressure that converges at the tea invitation. Cost is visible in the blade-sheathing and Kael's acceptance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The glass dome, ballast scraps, compass fragments, and the roses themselves constrain Mira's method and charge the closure (the "eastern panels" callback). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "cordite and exhaustion," "sand-scratched glass." Spatial choreography is clean (eastern quarter, western beds, eastern airlock, eastern panels). The micro-setting (soil, canvas, seedlings) directly shapes Mira's choices and the final image of light through glass.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether Mira will abandon the farm (and her mother's legacy) under Kael's pressure. The tightening occurs when Mira calls out his lie, forcing him to drop the pretense; her tea offer is a renunciation that forecloses reconciliation on his terms. Agency is clear (her refusal, his blade-sheathing). The cost is mutual: Kael must accept her terms, Mira risks his departure. One meaningful escalation under the Situational lens; no requirement for multiple reversals at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—cultivation as counter to fear and violence—emerges through the ballast scraps teaching balance, Mira's whispered method, and the blade-sheathing. "Weaving continuity through chaos" is character-voiced, not prompt echo. The final image (clean light through thinning dust) offers a resonant, non-literal answer: persistence and patience yield clarity. No moralizing. The roses as both literal medicine and metaphor for resilience avoid overt symbolism. Minor: "engraved quiet" in one line edges toward abstract phrasing but is redeemed by the concrete action that follows.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mira; perceptual signature is consistent (she notices sand, scent, blade movements). Dialogue carries subtext: Kael's "culling" versus Mira's "patience," the lie about the magistrate. Voice is distinct: "cathedral-high," "tranquil blaze of sand," "kept weapons ready even in the only place that might be called home." Psychic distance modulates purposefully (tight on Mira's hands, pulling back for the final image). Minor: "senselessly perceptive" is a brief narrator intrusion that slightly loosens distance, but the line recovers quickly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., the ballast scraps anchor setting, method, and theme). Rhythm varies; sentence openings and lengths modulate with pressure. Minor loop: "kept weapons ready even in the only place that might be called home" and "in the only place that might be called home" repeat the anchor phrase; the second iteration adds no new pressure. "Tranquil blaze" is a purposeful oxymoron but edges toward strained diction. No catastrophic artifacts, but the loop and one or two elevated phrases ("engraved quiet") slightly dull momentum in non-closure beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise (teaching plants values through objects) is fresh and grounded in Mira's grief and resistance. The inversion—bounty hunter's daughter hunts continuity, not fugitives—feels earned. The ballast-scraps-as-teaching-tool and the blade-sheathing as closure image are specific and non-obvious. Risk: the quiet ending and situational lens require trust in image over plot mechanics, which the piece executes well. Minor: the post-collapse glass dome is a familiar trope, but the rose farm's medicinal role and Mira's method transform it sufficiently.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira is present throughout, frames the stakes early (refusing to meet Kael, preferring soil over iron), makes the key decision to invite him to tea on her terms, and her refusal forecloses reunion on his terms. She shapes all major beats and the closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The ballast scrap is introduced early (first third), used in two distinct beats (transplanting the desert rose, then "another seedling"), and its function (teaching balance) directly shapes Mira's method and the thematic answer. It charges the closure by association (the plants she's tending with ballast will outlast towers).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Engraved quiet" appears once as a phrase mid-story, describing the moment after Mira's declaration. It aptly captures the tone and the weight of the exchange, but it does not constrain a choice or reappear at closure. It inflects theme more than it drives tactics. Present, purposeful, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Senselessly perceptive" is labeled once and demonstrated in Mira catching Kael's blade-draw and knowing he lied. It enables her final choice (calling out the lie, offering tea), but the trait could be replaced with "observant" or "attuned" without structural loss. Functional, but not unique enough to be indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>The sheathing action appears twice (the reflexive draw Mira notices, the final decisive sheathing that stays) and is the hinge of the closure. It signals Kael's internal shift and his acceptance of Mira's terms. Removing it would break the ending's emotional and tactical logic. The blade is introduced early (second paragraph) and charged at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Inculcating plants with objects (ballast, compass fragments) is introduced early, demonstrated in two beats, and is the method that defines Mira's resistance and her offer to Kael (the cutting from mother's plant to carry with him). It is causally necessary: without this method, the farm is just a farm, not a counter-practice to Kael's violence. The method shapes the thematic answer and the final image.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The glass dome is present from paragraph two, anchors all action, supplies the eastern panels for the closure image, and the spatial layout (eastern quarter, western beds, airlock) structures the choreography. The dome's history (pre-collapse architects' ambition, now "quieter purpose") charges the thematic contrast. The setting pressures the conflict (magistrate wanting the space) and enables the closure (light through glass).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Three seasons ago" anchors the timeframe early and the dust/debris context persists throughout, shaping the world's scarcity and the farm's value. The "hour before dawn" landing and the final "first clean light in months" bracket the scene and charge the closure image. Time does not create immediate urgency (no countdown), but it contextualizes stakes and the before/after of the ending. Solid causal presence, moderate pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Weaving continuity through chaos" is spoken by Mira and dramatized in her planting, whispering, and refusal to leave. It is the motive that structures her choices (staying, teaching plants, offering the cutting) and the thematic question. The phrase returns implicitly in the final image (clean light, persistence). The motivation is tested (Kael's pressure) and reaffirmed with cost (she risks his departure).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Tranquil blaze" appears once explicitly ("tranquil blaze of sand against glass") and is embodied throughout: the quiet, persistent pressure of Mira's work, the "not violent, but constant" wind, the final "clean light." The tone modulates subtly (cordite and exhaustion, the blade's threat, the softest sound of sheathing) and charges the closure. Coherent and purposeful, though the oxymoron is slightly strained in isolation.</comment>
