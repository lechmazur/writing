<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and purposeful—her "luminous regret" anchored to her sister's death gives weight to her choices. The micro-choice to speak Celestine's name three times and the decision to walk through rain to deliver the coin both feel earned by prior causality. Internal contradiction appears in the tension between her reputation for balance and tonight's solitary, grief-driven work. The magistrate's final acceptance forecloses the path of suspended hope with visible cost, meeting the endurance/renunciation standard.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the coin's discovery, the kintsugi repair, and the magistrate's candlelit memorial accumulate to reweight "missing" into "present through absence." Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the magistrate's shift from vigil to memorial) with felt cost visible in his seventeen-year wait ending. The tightening is meaningful—Mara's alchemical work deepens the stake from search to acceptance—and the lens holds without contradiction through the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The foundry's steam, firelight, rain, and tin roof create tactile atmosphere. The zodiac coin itself functions as micro-setting, constraining Mara's choice (she must use gold, heat, precision) and charging the final handoff. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from workbench to crucible to magistrate's door. The candlelit window in the final beat serves as environmental reconfiguration that mirrors the internal shift, meeting the 9+ gate test for environment shaping the closure image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—understanding and redeeming the weight of names—is signaled early and tightens through the kintsugi act. The turn occurs when Mara moves from solitary work to delivery, foreclosing her own grief-as-vigil and forcing the magistrate to accept loss. Cost is legible: seventeen years of suspended hope end, and Mara's sister's death casts a shadow over the act. Agency is clear in Mara's decision to speak the name and walk through rain. The pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens without requiring multiple reversals.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the kintsugi metaphor: brokenness honored rather than hidden, absence made present. The final image—candle burning in memorial rather than vigil—offers a resonant answer to the weight-of-names question without moralizing. The gold seam becomes both craft detail and thematic carrier, and Mara's sister functions as earned specificity rather than convenient backstory. "Breaking isn't ending" could edge toward thesis-speak, but it's grounded in the coin's physicality and Mara's action, meeting the non-literal answer standard.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited maintains stable distance; Mara's perceptual signature (alchemical precision, grief-tinged observation) is consistent. Dialogue is minimal but functional: the magistrate's "It's broken" and Mara's reply carry subtext (acceptance vs. transformation). The phrase "factually mystical" in narration risks register drift but reads as Mara's professional idiom. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at closure. No head-hopping; focalization is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing lines anchor voice and image. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, or theme. Minor issues: "luminous regret" recurs without reweighting (line-level echo), and "terrible gravity" + "terrible, suspended hope" repeats the modifier within close range. "The weight of a name that had never stopped meaning something to someone" edges toward abstraction. No loops or scaffold; propulsion is clear. Artifacts are non-closure and minor, capping deduction at −0.4.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kintsugi as metaphor for grief work is familiar but executed with specificity (mercury, gold dust, precise ratios, three-times naming). The synthesis of alchemy + repair + zodiac coin + search party aftermath feels purposeful rather than checklist-driven. The magistrate's shift from vigil to memorial is emotionally earned but not structurally surprising. The piece commits fully to its premise and avoids hedging, meeting conceptual integrity. Risk-taking is moderate; the frame is confident but does not radically subvert expectations.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's choices create the key turn: she decides to repair the coin with kintsugi, speak Celestine's name three times, and deliver it to the magistrate. These decisions alter tactics (solitary work to delivery) and shape the closure (the magistrate's acceptance). Setup early, developed in the crucible scene, and causally active at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The zodiac coin appears in discovery, repair (heated, gold-filled crack), and handoff. Its properties (Aries sign, crack, seventeen-year age) matter causally. The golden seam transforms it from evidence of death to memorial object, reweighting its meaning at closure. Essential across three beats and indispensable to the ending's charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Kintsugi intentions shape Mara's tactics on the page: she chooses gold to illuminate fracture rather than hide it, aligning method with theme. The concept narrows options (she must honor the wound) and the magistrate's acceptance hinges on this visible transformation. Present early, drives the middle repair scene, and charges the final exchange. Visible cost in the magistrate's tears and the end of hope.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Factually mystical" is narrated as Mara's professional understanding and enables the three-times naming ritual. It constrains her method (names anchor souls) and adds weight to the repair act. However, it functions more as world logic than a trait that visibly trades off; the cost is thematic rather than tactical. Present and functional but not indispensable—story logic could survive without this exact phrase.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Redeem" appears explicitly in Mara's intention ("This was about redeeming what had been lost") and drives her choice to create a memorial object rather than merely restore. The action redefines the magistrate's relationship to loss. Present in setup and closure, but the word itself could be swapped for "honor" or "acknowledge" with minor edits; the underlying act (transforming absence into presence) is what matters causally.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Exploring limits" is signaled early ("exploring the limits of what transmutation could achieve") and its mechanics matter: Mara uses precise ratios, tests what repair can accomplish, and discovers the echo of absence through the process. The method shapes her middle attempt and informs the final gift. However, the phrase itself is somewhat abstract; the concrete alchemical work does the causal lifting.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The foundry provides the crucible, bellows, tongs, and heat necessary for the repair—Mara cannot perform kintsugi without this exact setting. Rain bookends the scene (opening and the walk to the magistrate), and the tin roof's patter creates atmosphere. The setting supplies resources that affect outcome and the foundry's fires serve as lighthouse image at closure. Essential across beats and tied to closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The timeframe anchors the story: the search party disbanded at dusk, Mara works "through the night," and she delivers the coin in rain-washed streets (implying dawn or early morning). The seventeen-year gap between disappearance and discovery tightens the magistrate's stake. Time pressure is implicit (the magistrate is aging, hope is eroding) and the night's solitary work heightens urgency. Functional and present in closure, but not a live ticking clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation—"to understand the weight of names"—is dramatized through the discovery, the three-times naming, and the reflection on her sister. The desire conflicts with the cost (grief reopened, walking through rain to deliver hard truth). The motivation drives her choices and is tested at closure when she must speak the truth to the magistrate. Visible friction between want (understanding) and cost (luminous regret).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Luminous regret" permeates the narrative: Mara's stomach clenches at the discovery, her voice is "gentle with that luminous regret," and the tone modulates from solitary concentration to compassionate delivery. The candlelit window at closure shifts the tone from regret-as-vigil to regret-as-acceptance, charging the final image. Coherent through turns, modulates with pressure, and integral to the ending's emotional register.</comment>
