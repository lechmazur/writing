<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is coherent and her discovery arc tracks logically through the beats. However, her "quiet enthusiasm" remains largely asserted rather than embodied in contradictory impulses or micro-choices under pressure. Kael's shift from doubt to belief happens off-stage ("his doubt wavering") without dramatized resistance. The final transformation lacks visible cost—no one wrestles with fear, hesitation, or trade-off; they simply "wavelength align" in unison.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when clearly within the opening paragraph. The causality flows backward-prophecy → coin toss → static burst → discovery → teaching → transformation, consistent with an Accumulative/Textural lens that deepens through revelation. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the crew becomes "seed pattern for whatever universe would bloom next." Cost is conceptual (survival-by-transformation rather than death) but legible in the final image. The ending reconfigures the premise with undeniable pressure, meeting the RR/CR standard.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The amber-lit observatory deck, crystalline dome, and collapsing cosmos create vivid, purposeful atmosphere. The brass bowl and coins are handled across multiple beats, and the static-burst headset constrains Mira's method. The amber light deepening to white at closure charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear, and sensory detail supports rather than stalls momentum.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—surviving the Big Crunch through wavelength alignment—is signaled early and tightens through discovery, teaching, and the final convergence. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mira realizes the coins carry backward instructions, reframing her practice from mysticism to reception. However, the final transformation lacks dramatized resistance or visible trade-off; everyone aligns without friction, and no live option is foreclosed on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—causality reversal, reception over prediction, transformation as survival—emerges organically from the backwards-prophecy mechanics and coin-reading method. The final image ("seed pattern for whatever universe would bloom next") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The coins as "medium of exchange, symbols of value, tokens of meaning" deepen rather than explain. No thematic echo or label-speak mars the closure beat.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, with no head-hopping. Mira's perceptual signature—filtering cosmic collapse through mathematical prophecy—is distinct and consistent. Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit ("You're still doing this?" / "Teach me"). Diction remains controlled; register does not drift into therapy-speak or corporate abstraction. Brief filter verbs ("she saw") are voice-motivated and do not dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is clear and propulsive, with good information density and purposeful rhythm. The opening line anchors voice and stakes effectively. However, runs of identical sentence stems appear in the vision sequence ("She saw herself yesterday... She saw Kael tomorrow... She saw last week"), creating template cadence in a high-pressure beat (−0.4). No paraphrase loops or metaphor muddle; figurative language remains legible and sparse.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Backwards prophecy via quantum-fluctuation static and coin randomness offers a fresh synthesis of SF eschatology and divination. The transformation of cast-lots method from mysticism to causality-reversal mathematics is specific and non-obvious. The choice to survive by wavelength-matching rather than escape feels inevitable in hindsight. Risk-taking in concept execution heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, warranting within-band adjustment (+0.3).</comment>
