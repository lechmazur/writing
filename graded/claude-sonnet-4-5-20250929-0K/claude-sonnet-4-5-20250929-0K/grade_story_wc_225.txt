<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Petrov's motivation is clear and his internal progression from shame to self-forgiveness is traced through concrete actions (decoding the tapestry). The embodied fidgeting establishes character particularity early. However, the final epiphany—"how to forgive the player behind the pieces"—slides into abstraction without a dramatized micro-choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The duchess memory functions more as explanatory backstory than a present-tense contradiction that complicates his stance at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The story establishes a clear accumulative lens: Petrov decodes threads, thunder marks time's resumption, and the final image reweights his exile as "another opening gambit." Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (he forgives himself and smiles), but the cost is implied rather than felt on the page—no action is foreclosed, no tactical choice altered. The causal link between decoding "FORGIVE" and his internal shift feels asserted rather than earned through a visible tradeoff or renunciation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The time-frozen village, suspended rain, and tapestry are vivid and purposeful. The frayed border becomes a constraint that shapes Petrov's method and the closure image (imperfection as wisdom). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through his chess-tutor lens. The platinum labyrinth beneath remains abstract; it never constrains a choice or supplies a resource, serving more as thematic backdrop than setting pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Petrov seeking escape from shame—is signaled early and tightens when he decodes "FORGIVE" and realizes he was invited to understand. However, the escalation is conceptual rather than tactical; no live option is foreclosed, no price paid on the page. The duchess memory provides context but does not create a present-tense reversal or choice under pressure. The ending reconfigures meaning but lacks a visible cost that alters his options moving forward.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the frayed tapestry border: imperfection as meaning, mistakes as readable text. The final image—"how to see that exile was just another opening gambit"—reweights prior material without moralizing. The woven-hush concept and chess metaphors interweave cleanly. The insight that "what breaks can be understood" is earned through his months of decoding work, though the leap to forgiving the duchess feels slightly asserted rather than tested by a present complication.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with a distinct perceptual signature: chess variations, invisible strategy boards, counting broken warps. Distance is consistent. The prose rhythm modulates appropriately—shorter clauses during the decoding, longer reflective passages as realization dawns. One minor slip: "fierce repose" as a phrase in the final paragraph feels slightly authorial rather than character-filtered, nudging the prose toward prompt-echo.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentences are clear and varied; no major loops or template cadence. Information density is high in the decoding sequence. Two frictions lower the score: "fierce repose" in paragraph nine reads as elevated diction imported from the prompt rather than earned through the POV's lexicon, and the final paragraph ("how to forgive the player behind the pieces") stacks abstract phrasing where a concrete image would sharpen closure. No artifacts touch causality, so penalties remain modest.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The combination of time-freeze, tapestry decoding, and chess guilt offers a fresh synthesis. The frayed border as deliberate encoding rather than damage is a strong turn. However, the core emotional arc—exiled teacher finds redemption through coded wisdom—follows a familiar template. The platinum labyrinth as community meditation is inventive but underdeveloped. The ending insight, while specific to chess, resolves predictably without a non-obvious complication or cost.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Petrov is present throughout and his decoding choices drive the middle beat. His realization at closure (the tapestry teaches forgiveness) is causally linked to his months of work. However, his final choice—to leave the labyrinth unexplored and smile—does not foreclose a path with visible cost; it affirms rather than complicates. He appears in setup, middle, and payoff, but his agency at closure is acceptance rather than a decision that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The platinum labyrinth is mentioned in the tapestry image, decoded in the cipher (P-L-A-T-I-N-U-M, B-E-N-E-A-T-H), and thematically reinterpreted at closure ("protecting the village's capacity to forgive itself"). It appears in setup and payoff but is never handled, explored, or used to constrain a choice. The reweighting is conceptual rather than causal. Swappable with any hidden-wisdom motif; its specific material (platinum) does not matter to the stakes.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Woven hush" is named and explained in paragraph four, shapes Petrov's decoding method, and thematically recurs at closure ("the woven hush of frayed threads"). However, it functions more as atmospheric label than a stake-altering constraint. The concept does not narrow options or impose a cost; Petrov's task (decode threads) would proceed identically if the term were absent. Present in setup and closure but ornamental rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Fidgets productively" appears in paragraph one ("turning anxiety into invisible strategy boards") and returns briefly in the penultimate paragraph ("stilling his productive fidgeting for once"). The trait establishes character texture but does not constrain or enable an on-page action with cost. The final stilling is noted rather than dramatized as a tradeoff. Label-only use without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Winnowing (separating meaningful knots from random damage) is Petrov's method throughout and directly enables the decoding turn. It appears in setup, drives the middle beat, and the closure insight hinges on his months of winnowing work. However, the action itself is described rather than dramatized in real-time choices; we see the result (the decoded words) but not a moment where winnowing forces a tactical tradeoff or error with cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Decoding frayed threads is introduced early, occupies the central beat (counting breaks and twists to yield letters), and the realization that frayed borders are deliberate anchors the closure. The method is specific and irreplaceable: removing it would collapse the causal chain. However, the mechanics are told in summary rather than shown through a real-time choice where a decode error or ambiguity imposes cost. Present across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The time-frozen village frames the entire piece, supplies the suspended rain as sensory anchor, and its resumption (thunder, first raindrop) marks the closure beat. The setting's conceptual function—"a meditation, a fierce repose"—charges the ending. However, the freeze itself does not constrain Petrov's choices; he decodes at leisure without pressure from the environment. Strong setup and payoff, but the village does not alter tactics in the middle.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>Thunder recurs in three beats: distant, closer, then directly overhead as time resumes. It provides a temporal frame and charges the atmosphere. However, the lull does not impose a live clock that alters Petrov's decoding tactics or forces a rushed choice. Time is atmospheric rather than a constraint with cost. The element appears across the arc but remains ornamental to escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Petrov's desire to forgive himself is seeded in the duchess backstory, drives his months of decoding work, and the closure delivers the forgiveness realization. The motivation is dramatized through action (decoding) rather than told-only. One friction: the final shift from shame to smile lacks a present-tense complication or tradeoff; the duchess memory provides context but does not create friction between want and cost at closure. Strong across setup, middle, and ending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Fierce repose" is named once in paragraph nine and implicitly sustained through the contemplative pacing and the village's meditative freeze. The tone modulates subtly as Petrov's decoding deepens, culminating in the quiet smile. However, the phrase itself arrives late and reads slightly imported; the tone is more consistently "contemplative stillness" than fierce. The final image is charged but the fierceness is asserted rather than felt through syntax or stakes.</comment>
