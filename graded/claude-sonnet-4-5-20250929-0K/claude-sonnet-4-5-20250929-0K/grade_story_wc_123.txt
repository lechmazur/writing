<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marianne's choices are driven by consistent, character-specific motives—her meticulous nature and isolation-nurtured integrity. The interiority is concrete ("her pulse quickened, though her expression remained calm") and the trait of curiosity constrains her actions with visible cost (she accepts the satchel despite risks). Minor slip: the woman's rapid trust feels slightly convenient, but the final choice to map coordinates in solitude is fully earned by prior pattern-recognition obsession.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (who, where, when within opening lines). Closure is a clear Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Marianne commits to the underground record-keeping network, foreclosing public recognition with felt cost ("the integrity of the record itself"). The causal lens holds—observation patterns drive her acceptance of the invitation. One meaningful tightening when the woman reveals the network and Marianne immediately begins mapping.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The courtyard setting constrains choice (quiet sanctuary enables the clandestine meeting) and the evening sky's shimmer charges the final image when Marianne sees the zone distortion anew. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (fountain as "data, as rhythm, as pattern"). The message tube is handled twice with evolving significance. Minor: occupational systems (atmospheric science) remain abstract rather than tactile in the mapping moment.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (truth-recording vs. professional erasure) is signaled early and tightens when the woman offers the satchel, forcing Marianne to choose between solitude and collective resistance. Agency is clear: her decision to map the coordinates forecloses safer inaction with visible cost (she joins a network the government has "pushed out"). Coincidence (the woman's arrival) complicates but does not resolve; Marianne's choice to act closes the arc.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: integrity under institutional erasure, the layered nature of peace and hidden patterns. The final image ("the integrity of the record itself") reweights prior material without moralizing—truth-keeping becomes both refuge and resistance. Subtext operates in the woman's choice of antiquated communication and Marianne's recognition that "tranquility had always been layered." No thematic echo or late symbolism; the fountain's return as data rather than ambiance earns its charge.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with controlled distance and a distinct perceptual signature (Marianne notices patterns, measures rhythms). Dialogue is sparse, goal-driven, and carries subtext ("You nurture integrity in solitude" reveals recruitment motive). Minor slips: "credibly curious by nature" and "layered tranquility" edge toward expository labeling in narration rather than fully embodied observation. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority to wider observational beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is clear and propulsive with varied rhythm and strong information density. Opening and closing lines anchor stakes effectively. Minor pattern detected: several sentences open with prepositional phrases or participial constructions in sequence ("Inside the tube," "In the margins"), creating subtle template cadence in the middle third. One paraphrase loop: the "layered tranquility" concept is restated twice without added pressure. No figurative muddle; clarity remains high throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of storm-pattern recognition, underground record-keeping via pre-quarantine pigeon infrastructure, and governmental atmospheric erasure feels specific and non-obvious. The premise transforms the "secret society" trope through occupational detail (meteorology, barometric patterns) and the antiquated communication method. Risk-taking in the quiet, refusal-based ending heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor: the atmospheric anomaly backstory edges toward familiar conspiracy territory before the pressure-pattern specificity sharpens it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marianne's meticulous recording trait drives setup (fifteen years of journals), middle choice (cross-referencing data to discover lateral vortices), and closure (mapping coordinates "with practiced fingers"). Her observation becomes decision when she accepts the satchel and begins the new map, altering her tactics from solitary to networked resistance. Cost is visible: joining the network forecloses safe anonymity.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The brass tube appears in three beats: discovery under the doormat (setup, with authentication detail), opened to reveal the message (middle pressure that draws the woman), and visual echo when the satchel full of tubes is revealed (closure participation that charges the new mapping mission). Evolving use: from singular mystery to network symbol. Irreplaceable: pre-quarantine pigeon infrastructure is specific and causally tied to avoiding digital trace.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The rogue zone shapes stakes throughout: it's the anomaly Marianne discovered three months ago (setup), the woman explains zones contain atmospheric events and are multiplying (middle escalation), and the shimmer in the evening sky charges the final image as Marianne commits to mapping them. The concept changes options: her discovery risk becomes shared resistance. Specificity: lateral pressure patterns differentiate it from generic quarantine zones.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Curiosity is signaled early ("credibly curious by nature") and shown when Marianne asks "Why contact me?" and chooses to engage despite being followed. The trait enables her acceptance of the antiquated message method and constrains her away from dismissing the contact. Modest cost: curiosity leads her into a surveilled network. Deduction: slightly label-heavy in narration ("Questions didn't feel like intrusions") rather than fully dramatized through conflicting impulses.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Intuition drives the story's key turn: Marianne intuits the zone's rhythm matches storm pressure patterns (past discovery), recognizes the woman's intent (present beat), and maps connections "that official channels claimed were random" (closure action). The woman recruits her explicitly for this ability ("You intuit patterns"). Removing intuition would break the causal chain from observation to recruitment to final commitment. High irreplaceability and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Progressing laterally" is signaled in setup (Marianne's storm journals filled by "progressing...through her old data"), specified as the anomaly's defining trait (zones spread laterally "across ground level" contra vertical storm progression), and enacted at closure when she sketches coordinates to map lateral connections between zones. The method shapes her tactical approach (cross-referencing, mapping geometry) and differentiates the anomaly. Causal pressure throughout.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The courtyard provides tactical advantage (quiet sanctuary enabling clandestine meeting after being followed) and sensory anchors (fountain, dusk light). It charges the final image when the fountain's "peaceful song" is reheard as "data, as rhythm, as pattern," and the sky shimmer becomes visible evidence. The setting's tranquility contrasts with and then absorbs the hidden conflict. Solid micro-setting work; deduction for not constraining a middle choice as directly as other elements.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Timeframe is present: Marianne notices being followed "three blocks from the library," arrives at the courtyard "at dusk," and the woman appears "as if summoned." The sequence tightens the meeting's clandestine pressure. Modest deduction: elapsed time doesn't create a live clock that alters tactics in the conversation itself; the pressure is atmospheric rather than temporal. The "after" component sets up the meeting but doesn't drive escalation beats.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>This motivation is dramatized in Marianne's fifteen-year solitary practice, her choice not to publish findings, and the woman's direct appeal ("you nurture integrity in solitude"). It creates friction: accepting the network risks her isolation but serves the larger integrity goal. The final beat makes the cost visible—she joins collective action while remaining apart ("in the gathering darkness"). High irreplaceability; the woman recruits her specifically for this trait and it shapes the closure choice.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Tone is established early (fountain's "gentle murmur," lavender-and-gold dusk) and modulates under pressure: Marianne's "racing thoughts" beneath calm exterior, the woman's matter-of-fact revelations, and the closing recognition that "tranquility had always been layered." The final image charges tone by reframing the courtyard's peace as data-gathering stillness. Coherent through turns; the quiet ending fits and reweights rather than breaks. Strong closure linkage.</comment>
