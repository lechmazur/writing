<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Nelle's interiority is concrete and her micro-choices under pressure feel earned—she closes her fingers around the fob, pulls out the recorder, walks away carrying "her father's silence like armor." Internal contradiction appears when she says she came "to capture the sound of trust breaking" but her real goal is blackmail-truce, a gap that enriches rather than confuses. Crenshaw remains functional but slightly thin; his repositioning and quiet capitulation feel more structural than psychologically embodied. The final renunciation forecloses the path of vendetta with visible cost (she walks away from full revenge), meeting the cost gate without strain.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph; the pirate-market frame is clear. Drive lens reads Causal: Nelle's choice to play the recording forces Crenshaw's capitulation, narrowing both parties' options to mutual silence. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (truce as Earned Stasis): she walks away with copies as insurance, foreclosing revenge but securing her father's name—cost is legible in "we're strangers" and her solitary exit. One small seam: "curious steadfast despite the flutter" feels like authorial assertion rather than dramatized contradiction, but it doesn't break causality at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rotting pier, market's nocturnal commerce, lantern-light through gaps, and water lapping create vivid sensory grounding filtered through Nelle's urgency. The fob's brass gleam and the recorder as "new technology, barely legal" anchor micro-setting in her hand. Spatial choreography is clean: Crenshaw emerges from crates, his people reposition in shadows, Nelle walks back through the market and climbs toward morning. The setting pressures choice—"everyone was watching" constrains both parties—and the dawn timeframe tightens the window, meeting the 9+ environment-constraint gate with modest strength.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—clearing her father's name and securing her own safety—is signaled early and tightens when she reveals the recording and the three-copy insurance. The reversal (she came not to trade but to blackmail into truce) narrows Crenshaw's options with agency and visible cost: mutual silence or exposure. Pressure coheres under the Causal lens; the tightening choice forecloses revenge and forces a brittle peace, with cost felt in "we're strangers" and her solitary walk. No requirement for multiple turns at this length; one meaningful pressure point suffices and is delivered here.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme—trust as volatile currency, the cost of silence, inheritance of a runner's discipline—emerges from particulars: the fob as three-generation token, the market's economy of secrets, the truce held "because it had to." The final image (carrying her father's silence like armor, climbing toward morning) reweights prior material without stating a moral, meeting the resonance gate. One slip: "trust a currency more volatile than any barrel" and "comforting unease" edge toward stock phrasing, lowering thematic sharpness slightly. No overt sermonizing; complexity is preserved in the uneasy peace.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds cleanly; Nelle's perceptual signature (time measured in moonshine runs, silence as survival) is voice-particular and consistent. Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit: Crenshaw's "Your daddy was a good man who made bad choices" / Nelle's correction "He made one good choice at the end" advances conflict economically. One register wobble: "curiously steadfast despite the flutter" and "comforting unease" feel slightly authorial rather than fully filtered through Nelle's idiom under stress. Psychic distance and tense remain stable; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings shift cleanly. Information density is high: most lines do double work (setting + pressure, interiority + world). Two friction points lower the score: "curiously steadfast" and "comforting unease" are stock modifiers that blur specificity at peak moments, and "the truce of hush" receives three mentions without sufficient causal reweighting to justify the repetition—it edges toward motif-for-motif's-sake. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; proofreading is clean. Propulsion is strong, but the figurative slips in high-pressure beats prevent entry to the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis—moonshine-runner legacy meeting modern recording tech in a pirate-market blackmail—feels specific and non-obvious. The transformation of the watch fob from heirloom to insurance token to truce-seal is earned. One derivative note: the hidden-market frame and the "your father was a good man" exchange echo noir/crime templates without fully personalizing the moral calculus; Crenshaw's capitulation feels structurally necessary rather than inevitable from his interior. Risk-taking is modest but coherent; the piece commits to its noir-tinged premise without retreat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Nelle drives every key turn: she arranges the meeting, reveals the recording, delivers the truce terms, and walks away. Her choices—closing fingers around the fob, pulling the recorder, pocketing both—alter tactics and outcome. Present across all three gates (setup, development, closure) with strong causal pressure and cost tied to her renunciation of full revenge.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The watch fob appears in setup (pressed against her palm, three-generation token), at the reversal (she opens her palm to show it), and in closure (she pockets it alongside the recorder). It signals inheritance and insurance but does not constrain a mid-scene choice or reweight meaning sharply at the end—it's carried through rather than transformed. Two beats with moderate specificity; closure linkage is present but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Truce of hush" is named early, shapes the entire negotiation (no names spoken, no accusations aired, mutual silence enforced by blackmail), and defines the closure: "The truce would hold because it had to." It structures stakes and tactics across all three gates with high specificity—removing it would collapse the story's central mechanism. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; one friction is the phrase's slight archaic ornamentation, but the concept itself is indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Curiously steadfast" is a label applied once in narration ("curiously steadfast despite the flutter in her chest") without dramatized constraint or cost. It does not enable or prevent an on-page action; Nelle's resolve is shown through her choices (revealing the recorder, delivering terms) rather than this adjective. Ornamental use; swappable with "resolute" or similar.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Thwart" structures the reversal: Nelle came to thwart Crenshaw's belief that her father stole from him, but the actual thwarting occurs when she plays the recording and delivers the blackmail terms, forcing his capitulation. Present in setup (stated goal) and closure (achieved via truce); the action redefines options and drives the major turn. One small friction: the word "thwart" is slightly generic; the specific verb could be "expose" or "trap" with similar effect, but the action itself is essential.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"False starts and near-misses, messages passed through intermediaries" are mentioned in setup to establish difficulty, but the mechanics do not shape on-page attempts—the meeting proceeds smoothly once Nelle arrives. The method is told rather than dramatized; it primes stakes (the truce is fragile) but does not constrain mid-scene tactics. Setup and weak development; no closure participation. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The pirate market is anchored early with vivid detail (rotting pier, unmarked crates, lantern-light, nocturnal commerce) and constrains choice: "No one watched them directly, but everyone was watching" enforces discretion and makes exposure a credible threat. The setting supplies the social pressure that holds the truce and shapes Nelle's exit route (climbing toward morning). Present across setup, development, and closure with moderate causal pressure; micro-setting (the market's surveillance culture) alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Until sunrise" is stated early, mentioned at midpoint ("Sunrise felt very far away"), and returns at closure ("we're strangers" by dawn). The timeframe tightens urgency but does not visibly alter tactics—no clock-based countdown pressure. Two gates (setup and closure) with moderate thematic charge; the dawn image reweights the truce as a boundary but the clock itself is more symbolic than mechanical. Lyric reprise with modest causal work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"To capture the sound of trust breaking" is stated as Nelle's goal and dramatized when she plays the recording of Crenshaw's betrayal. It drives the reversal and shapes the closure truce. One friction: the phrasing is slightly poetic/abstract for a moonshine runner's daughter under stress—"record his admission" would feel more rooted. Present in setup (stated), development (recording played), and closure (trust reweighted as mutual blackmail). Causal role with moderate specificity.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Comforting unease" is established early (Crenshaw's voice "carried that comforting unease she remembered from childhood") and modulates through the confrontation: the market's watchful silence, the "truce would hold because it had to," the water lapping as she climbs toward morning. Tone is coherent and charges the final image with brittle peace. One slip: the phrase itself is a stock oxymoron that slightly flattens specificity. Present across beats with purposeful modulation; closure participation is clear.</comment>
