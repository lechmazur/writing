<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's progression from fever-broken clarity through diagnosis to redesign is consistently motivated by her grief over Reeves and her professional guilt. Her interior reflection about fault-tolerance and nightshade illustration reads as character-particular and anchors her final choice in prior causality. Chen functions primarily as sounding board but his grief is noted and his collaboration at closure is credible. Minor deduction: the peak emotional beat ("auroral sorrow") borders on over-articulation; the phrase reads slightly imposed rather than fully embodied.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with causal backbone. Orientation anchors are clear by line 3 (mountain station, Mira waking, Chen present). The closure—Mira rewriting the oracle to express uncertainty and the system's first honest advisory—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the new interface reweights the premise (fault-tolerance vs. acknowledgment of limits) with conceptual cost legible in "what couldn't be undone" and "humbler wisdom." One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira discovers the marginalized data, narrowing options toward the redesign. Cost proof: "auroral sorrow of what couldn't be undone" and "dangerous illusion that fault-tolerance meant infallibility" make the conceptual price unmistakable on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The mountain weather station provides spatial coherence (observation deck, console, windows with frost patterns) and pressures the premise: the oracle's function depends on this isolated setting where prediction failures are lethal. The botanical illustration returns at closure as a charged object (nightshade's beauty vs. poison = knowledge requiring context) that reweights the premise. Sensory detail is selective (frost patterns, sunrise shades, clouds gathering) and filtered through Mira's post-fever perception. No occupational systems beyond the oracle interface are shown, which is acceptable at this length since the conflict hinges on the redesign itself rather than procedural depth.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: Mira needs to understand why the oracle failed and prevent future loss. The discovery of marginalized data is a meaningful tightening that narrows options toward redesign. The escalation is driven by Mira's agency (her choice to rewrite the weighting algorithms) under the accumulative lens; the cost is conceptual and relational (acceptance of fallibility, Reeves's death as irreversible). One point of friction: the redesign proceeds smoothly without encountering resistance from the system's architecture or Chen's skepticism, which would have added visible trade-offs during the revision process itself.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—the difference between fault-tolerance and wisdom, certainty versus acknowledgment of limits—emerges organically from the oracle's failure and Mira's fever-driven insight. The botanical illustration (beauty and precision cannot convey poison) operates as earned metaphor rather than decoration, reappearing to charge the final insight. Subtext operates in Chen's quiet "Reeves trusted it completely" and Mira's response "We all did," carrying shared guilt without moralizing. The ending offers a resonant answer (the oracle's first advisory "conditions uncertain, recommend caution" reweights the premise) without stating a moral. Minor slip: "dangerous illusion that fault-tolerance meant infallibility" edges toward thematic summary in the penultimate paragraph, though it stays character-rooted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited focalization through Mira is stable and apt; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (post-fever crystalline clarity, technical focus on data and algorithms, maternal memory of nightshade). Dialogue is sparse, natural, and goal-driven; Chen's lines ("You were talking in your sleep," "Will it prevent another accident?") advance plot and carry subtext about shared loss. Narrative distance modulates appropriately from intimate interior reflection to diagnostic console work. One minor register slip: "auroral sorrow" in the penultimate paragraph reads slightly elevated for the established voice, though it remains within Mira's lexicon given her precise, image-driven perception throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences do multiple jobs (e.g., "The oracle hadn't been wrong, exactly—it had been uncertain, and its fault-tolerance had interpreted uncertainty as something to suppress rather than elevate" advances both diagnosis and theme). Rhythm varies purposefully, with longer reflective sentences during Mira's insight and shorter action beats during the redesign. No loops or scaffold; paragraph structure supports momentum. Two friction points: "auroral sorrow" appears twice in the final third, risking ornamental repetition, and "swallowed the truth of its own doubt" / "the truth it had swallowed before" recycles the "swallowed" vehicle without clear pattern-teaching. These register as minor texture issues rather than clarity breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise—AI weather prediction that suppresses uncertainty leading to preventable death—is fresh and specific. The synthesis of fault-tolerance (technical concept) with margin-dwelling insight (fever-driven perceptual shift) and botanical illustration (precision without context) feels earned rather than assembled. The piece commits to its implications without retreat (Mira redesigns the system, accepts fallibility). One limitation: the core arc (technologist realizes their creation's flaw and fixes it) follows a recognizable template; transformation occurs through the specific link between fever-state perception and marginalized data rather than a wholly non-obvious synthesis. Risk-taking in the quiet, reflection-heavy design is purposeful but not radically unconventional.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The oracle is present in setup (failure framing the conflict), development (marginalized data discovery), and payoff (redesigned interface producing the first honest advisory). It drives two key beats: the initial diagnosis and the final output. Mira's choices (investigating logs, rewriting algorithms) are causally tied to the oracle's behavior. The element's specificity (fault-tolerant predictive AI, not generic computer) matters to the premise. Cost is legible: the oracle's new uncertainty acknowledges Reeves's death as irreversible and demands humbler use going forward. Strong integration across all three gates with causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The botanical illustration appears in setup (Mira's memory of her mother's framed nightshade drawing) and payoff (final reflection linking precision without poison-context to knowledge without certainty-context). It does not constrain a middle choice; its role is lyric reprise. The return reweights the dominant stake (knowledge requires acknowledging limits) and charges the theme, but the element itself is not handled or used on the page—it remains a remembered image. Lyric-resonance allowance applies, placing it in the mid-6s for purposeful early seed → final callback with thematic cost, but without mid-scene causal work it cannot reach higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Swaying certainties" shapes stakes and tactics directly: the oracle's certainty swayed toward suppressing doubt (causing Reeves's death), and Mira's fever-state certainties sway, granting her peripheral insight. The concept drives the diagnosis beat (marginalized data weighted as insignificant) and the redesign (creating space for uncertainty to occupy margins). It appears in setup (fever dreams making "edges of reality permeable"), development (discovering how fault-tolerance "swallowed" doubt), and payoff (the new oracle expressing provisional certainty). The exact concept—not mere "uncertainty" but the *sway* between certainty and doubt—proves indispensable to the story's logic and closure image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Peripherally aware" is signaled in setup (fever making Mira aware of "something she'd missed," "margins of consciousness"), constrains the diagnosis choice (she studies "marginal notes, the data the system had flagged as uncertain and pushed to the periphery"), and charges the payoff ("peripheral awareness" becomes the design goal, "truth lives" in margins). The attribute drives two beats: the fever insight and the algorithm rewrite. It carries visible cost: accepting peripheral awareness as valid means acknowledging the oracle's—and Mira's—prior blindness to it, which allowed Reeves's death. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Smudge" appears literally in development ("smudged among the standard atmospheric readings") to describe the marginalized pressure signatures the oracle noted but dismissed. The action—smudging/suppressing uncertain data—is the diagnosed fault that drives Mira's redesign. It also returns in the final image logic: "no longer pretending that certainty was the same as safety" implies un-smudging doubt. The action is causally active in two beats (diagnosis, redesign rationale) and shapes the closure by defining what must change. Not easily swappable; the specificity of "smudge" (blur, suppress, push to periphery) matters to the margin-versus-center logic.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Occupying margins" is signaled in setup ("margins of consciousness," peripheral awareness during fever), guides the method in development (Mira studies "marginal notes" and data "pushed to the periphery"), and shapes the payoff (rewriting algorithms to "give weight to its peripheral awareness" and "creating space for uncertainty to occupy the margins of prediction"). The method is mechanically specific: the redesign shifts weighting so margin-data influences output rather than being suppressed. It drives the diagnosis and redesign beats and charges the final image ("humbler wisdom, occupying the margins where truth lives"). The method is indispensable to the story's solution logic and thematic closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The mountain weather station is present throughout: setup (Mira wakes there, Chen at observation deck), development (console work), and payoff (station "stood ready" with new oracle). It supplies the resource (oracle console) and pressures choices (isolated location where prediction failures are lethal, as Reeves's death proves). The setting is not merely postcard; the avalanche and observation deck matter to the premise. However, the setting does not constrain a choice *during* the redesign—Mira's work proceeds without spatial obstacles or the station's environment altering her tactics. Solid presence and thematic coherence, but micro-setting pressure (body, tool, or space limiting options in the moment) is absent in the central beat.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"After fever breaks" anchors the timeframe in setup (opening line: "The fever broke on the third day") and sets the clarity that enables the story. The post-fever window provides the perceptual shift (crystalline clarity, memory of margin-awareness) that drives Mira's insight. However, time does not tighten decisions during the redesign; the work proceeds "through the morning" and "by afternoon" without a live clock pressuring choices or adding cost. The timeframe is functional (signals readiness, contrasts with prior fever state) but does not escalate or constrain tactics. It shapes one beat (the clarity enabling diagnosis) and participates in setup, but is absent from closure and does not add visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"To find the weight of a swallowed truth" is dramatized from the start: Mira investigates what the oracle "knew but didn't say" and discovers it "swallowed the truth of its own doubt." The desire drives two beats (log investigation, algorithm redesign) and is conflicted—finding the truth means accepting her own culpability ("I programmed it to be confident... I taught it to ignore its own doubts"). The motivation shapes the payoff: the new oracle's advisory gives weight to previously swallowed uncertainty. Cost is visible: Mira's acceptance that "fault-tolerance isn't the same as wisdom" carries professional and emotional price. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; the exact phrasing (weight, swallowed truth) is woven into the diagnosis and final image.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Auroral sorrow" is signaled in development ("her voice carrying an auroral sorrow, like light breaking through after darkness") and modulates with pressure: quiet grief during diagnosis, determination during redesign, layered acceptance in the final image ("auroral sorrow of what couldn't be undone, and the quiet determination of what might yet be prevented"). The tone charges the ending by holding grief and hope simultaneously without resolving into false comfort. However, the phrase "auroral sorrow" appears twice in the final third, risking label-reliance rather than embodied modulation. The tone is coherent and purposeful but edges toward over-articulation in peak beats, preventing full high-band eligibility.</comment>
