<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority leans heavily on abstract philosophical concepts ("furiously tranquil," "temporal mass," "texture of borrowed time") rather than embodied emotion under pressure. The grandmother's vortex inheritance provides motivation, but the critical choice to step into the spiral arrives without visible internal conflict or competing impulses acting simultaneously. Emotional progression reads as smooth acceptance rather than contradictory desires wrestling in scene. The final planting gesture feels more symbolic than a choice that forecloses a live path with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on the page: Mara releases the vortex inheritance, the seeds regain potential, and the future becomes uncertain again—a clear Resonant Reconfiguration with conceptual cost (the inherited years are spent). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers abstractions (borrowed time, entropy reversal, probability hatchling) and achieves closure through a cadence shift that reweights the dominant stake. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive early enough. Minor causality question: the egg's "probability" hatchling circles overhead at the end but its causal role in the solution remains ornamental rather than integral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The icebound atrium under starlight is vividly anchored early and the ice's retreat tracks causally across the arc. The acorn cap functions as micro-setting: it measures seeds, presses against ice, and plants the final seed, constraining Mara's ritual and charging the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (glass dome distorting stars, frost retreating, wet earth). The vault and its seeds supply concrete resources that affect outcome. One small gap: the probability hatchling "with wings and purpose" arrives as description rather than a dramatized constraint on choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—restore the seeds' potential by reversing entropy decrease—is signaled early. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mara steps into the spiral and releases borrowed time, narrowing her options (she spends the inheritance, foreclosing its future use). The cost is conceptual and stated rather than felt in bodily terms: "borrowed time must always be returned." Under the Accumulative lens, pressure accumulates through layered abstractions and the final act reweights the stake. Minor issue: the solution (using grandmother's vortex) is explained to the reader rather than discovered through trial or tactical adjustment under duress.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete images: ice as stasis, entropy as necessary chaos, borrowed time as a substance with texture. The final image—a seed in uncertain soil—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of preservation versus stasis without moralizing. "The future was finally, blessedly uncertain again" walks the line between insight and thesis statement but remains rooted in the planting action. The acorn cap's return with reweighted meaning (measure, press, plant) elevates thematic coherence. One small slip: "growth and decay are the same motion viewed from different angles" tilts slightly toward overt philosophizing mid-crisis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Mara with controlled psychic distance. Diction carries a consistent poetic register ("shimmer in the air that tasted like metal and memory," "furiously tranquil"). Perceptual signature is present but leans abstract rather than character-specific: the vocabulary of entropy, temporal mass, and vortex inheritance reads more conceptual than idiomatically Mara's. No head-hopping. Minor filter-verb stack in the spiral sequence ("feeling it unwind... feeling them remembering") slightly dulls immediacy at a key beat. No dialogue to evaluate.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive, with vivid images (ice thick enough to distort stars, frost retreating like glass tears). Minor overwriting: "furiously tranquil" recurs as an abstract label without fresh embodiment; "wild serenity" and "rough as burlap... slick as oil" pile metaphor at the spiral entry without grounding in Mara's physical sensation. Template cadence in one sequence: "They contained... They contained..." (two adjacent sentences). Information density is high but some figurative language (the probability hatchling "solidifying with each pass into something with wings and purpose") adds texture without causal clarity. No paraphrase loops or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—vortex inheritance as unlived years with physical texture, entropy reversal to restore seed potential—offers a fresh synthesis of speculative biology and metaphysics. The acorn cap as ritual tool and the atrium's ice dome as temporal prison feel specific to this world. Risk-taking in structure (accumulative/lyric mode with abstract stakes) succeeds in maintaining coherence. One limit: the "borrowed time must be returned" resolution echoes familiar debt-repayment arcs without a non-obvious moral calculus; the ending's emotional truth (uncertainty as blessing) is earned but not startling. No close echoes of famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Present from the opening line and named early. Mara's occupation frames her knowledge of seeds and her access to the vault. Her choice to step into the spiral and release the vortex inheritance is the story's pivotal turn, altering tactics (from hoarding to spending) and enabling the atrium's reopening. The role shapes at least two beats (holding the acorn cap, walking the spiral outward) and the closure (planting the first seed). The character is essential but not indispensable in the strictest sense: the role could theoretically be reassigned to another custodian without breaking logic, though specificity (last heirloom seed saver, family vault) raises integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Appears in three distinct beats: Mara holds it and recalls grandmother's use (setup), presses it against ice to begin the thaw (middle turn), and uses it to plant the first seed (closure). The object evolves from memory anchor to ritual tool to planting instrument, its function reweighted at each appearance. However, swappability remains: another small measuring tool (thimble, spoon) could perform the same actions with minor edits. The acorn cap's specificity (oak, acorn, grandmother's thimble) adds texture but doesn't impose unique constraints that only this object could provide. Still, it participates in closure and recurs with purpose.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Introduced early ("vortex inheritance had changed everything") and anchors the story's stakes and tactics. The concept defines what Mara inherits (unlived years with texture), why the seeds are dying (entropy flowing into the vortex sink), and how she solves the problem (releasing the spiral to restore chaos). It shapes at least three beats: discovering the texture, stepping into the spiral, unwinding it to scatter entropy. The resolution depends on this exact mechanic; removing vortex inheritance would break the logic. Minor note: the concept is more explained than dramatized in physical sensation, but it clearly constrains choice and enables the closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Appears twice: first as a general description of some borrowed moments ("furiously tranquil, like standing in the eye of a hurricane"), then as "the furiously tranquil center of her grandmother's vortex" that pulses and shatters at closure. The attribute is more atmospheric label than constraint; it names a quality of the vortex without enabling or preventing a specific action. Removing this phrase would not alter plot beats—Mara would still step into the spiral and release it. It charges the final image slightly (the vortex containing "all rage and all peace") but functions more as tone descriptor than causal force. Mid-band: present across the arc, contributes to closure atmosphere, but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Signaled in the title and first paragraph, this action drives the story's dominant stake. The seeds are dying because the atrium is frozen; Mara must reopen it to restore their potential. The method (stepping into the vortex spiral, releasing borrowed time to reverse entropy) is specific to this action and causally tied to at least three beats: pressing the acorn cap against ice (beginning), walking the spiral outward (middle), and planting in newly thawed earth (closure). The action is indispensable: without reopening the atrium, there is no story. Removing this exact verb would require fundamental restructuring. Essential and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Introduced early as the problem's root cause: "entropy... was instead decreasing, pulling heat and chaos backward into some impossible sink." The method shapes Mara's solution—she must reverse the entropy decrease by introducing controlled chaos (the grandmother's unlived years). This mechanic constrains her tactics: she cannot simply melt the ice; she must spend the vortex inheritance to scatter entropy. The method appears in at least two beats (discovery, execution) and is causally active at closure when "heat bloomed" and the seeds "remembered how to randomize." Swappability is low; the thermodynamic framing is specific and integrated. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Present from the first sentence and anchors all action. The atrium's ice constrains Mara's access to the seeds and visualizes the entropy problem (frozen = too ordered). The glass dome distorts starlight, reinforcing the world's wrongness; its clearing at the end signals restored normalcy. The wet earth circle at the atrium's heart becomes the planting site. The setting supplies the problem (ice), the obstacle (frozen soil), and the resolution site (thawed earth). It shapes at least three beats and charges the final image ("stars looked different through clear glass"). Removing the icebound atrium would require a different container for the seeds and a new visualization of entropy reversal. Essential to the story's logic and atmosphere.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The egg hatches two days before the story opens, providing a recent event that triggers Mara's action. The "probability" hatchling circles overhead during the climax and "solidifies with each pass," suggesting real-time progression. However, the timeframe doesn't tighten decisions or create urgency; Mara's choice to step into the spiral is not driven by a ticking clock. The "by dawn" marker at closure provides temporal closure but doesn't constrain tactics. The element is present and creates a before/after (post-hatching), but it's more a fixed marker than a live pressure. Mid-band: setup and closure participation without middle development as a constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Stated early: Mara "needed to understand this texture" and later "stepped into the spiral" to experience the grandmother's unlived years. The motivation drives her key choice (entering the vortex despite fear) and is dramatized through her physical reaction ("The texture overwhelmed her immediately—silk and sandpaper, honey and broken glass"). Friction is present: she's "afraid to touch it, afraid of what those borrowed years might feel like." The discovery reweights her understanding and enables the solution. The motivation shapes at least two beats (hesitation, immersion) and contributes to closure (she plants "feeling the texture of the present moment"). Strong causal role and cost connection; the desire is tested on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The phrase appears three times: "furiously tranquil" (mid-story), "wild serenity" (in the spiral), and "wild bergamot" (grandmother's seeds). Tone modulates from frozen stasis (opening) to textured chaos (spiral sequence) to serene resolution (planting). The oxymoronic phrasing ("furiously tranquil," "wild serenity") is consistent and thematic, charging the vortex's dual nature. However, tone is more asserted through labels than embodied through rhythm or sensory cadence. The final image ("blessedly uncertain") aligns with the tone but doesn't require this exact phrasing. Mid-band: coherent through turns, modulates with pressure, contributes atmosphere, but the tone could be conveyed through other means without breaking the story.</comment>
