<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marissa's central belief that "listening heals" is stated rather than tested through contradictory impulses. Her discovery of the locket and decision to investigate proceed smoothly without internal friction or visible cost. The courtyard gathering functions as backdrop rather than crucible—no relationship under pressure forces a choice that alters its state. Thomas and the neighbors remain functional placeholders who deliver information rather than apply immediate pressure through competing needs.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story follows a causal chain: locket → key → mailbox → documents → community mobilization. Orientation anchors arrive by the second paragraph (Marissa, courtyard, Saturday morning). Closure reads as Charged Poise—the community gathers with "absolute certainty," options crystallized but cost deferred off-page. The final image ("sandstorm would pass") asserts resilience without showing what path has been foreclosed or what immediate price the gathering will pay. Cost is conceptual (solidarity) but not felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The courtyard with "amber and gold," "tangled bougainvillea," and "worn brick arches" establishes locale and tone. The mailroom and Mrs. Chen's mailbox provide functional micro-setting that enables the discovery. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or charge the final image—it remains vivid backdrop rather than tactical element. Spatial choreography is clear throughout the gathering and movement to the mailroom.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is preserving the community against eviction/buyout. The discovery tightens options by providing documentary evidence, but this unfolds as revelation rather than escalation driven by protagonist agency—Marissa follows clues Mrs. Chen left, and the documents arrive as convenient ammunition. No visible price is paid on the page; the story ends at the moment of mobilization before any trade-off or foreclosed path. One meaningful deepening (pattern of sealed mailboxes) but cost remains abstract.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme of community preservation through listening emerges from the courtyard ritual and Mrs. Chen's archival foresight. The locket-as-connective-tissue and "things carry meaning" motif support the premise. However, the final paragraph ("sandstorm would pass") borders on stated moral rather than image-driven resonance. "Listening heals" is asserted in the opening and closing without complication. The piece invites reflection on solidarity but stops short of a non-literal answer that reweights prior material with ambiguity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable on Marissa with clean focalization. Perceptual signature shows through her curatorial lens ("every donated object carried a voice"). Dialogue advances plot and feels natural with subtext in Mrs. Chen's waiting and Thomas's "I hear things." Register is consistent and voice-motivated. However, peak moments lean on declarative interiority ("She'd created this space believing that listening heals") rather than embodied pressure, and the collective voice at the end ("we've always protected each other") reads more earnest than distinct.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is clean with varied rhythm and strong opening anchor ("courtyard woke in shades of amber"). Information density is high; beats advance character and plot without padding. Minor template cadence in the courtyard-gathering sequence ("Then Mrs. Abernathy spoke… Then Jorge described") and one paraphrase near the end ("listening heals… giving voice to stories" restates within two lines). No loops or artifacts touch the closure beat, and clarity remains high throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The setup—gentrification threat + hidden evidence in locked mailbox—follows a familiar template of community-preservation narratives. The locket-as-key and Mrs. Chen's archival foresight offer a modest twist, but the emotional arc (discovery → collective action → assurance of survival) proceeds along expected lines. Specific details (scrollwork locket, 1970s special locks, accordion folder) add texture without transforming the premise. No bold risk or non-obvious synthesis; the resolution anticipates legal and communal victory without complication or counter-pressure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marissa's curatorial discernment drives two beats: recognizing the locket's significance among "thousands of objects" and interpreting Mrs. Chen's intent. Her observation initiates the investigation and her framing ("listening heals") anchors the courtyard resolution. However, her choices do not visibly narrow options or incur cost—she follows clues rather than making a trade-off. Present in setup, middle decision, and closure framing.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The locket appears in three beats: discovery at the thrift shop, revelation of the key and address, and as the light-catching symbol in the final courtyard moment. It enables the mailbox discovery and charges the ending image ("held up the locket, catching light"). Removing it would require a different mechanism for the key and Mrs. Chen's message. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; specificity (scrollwork, tarnished silver) matters to the narrative.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The locked-mailbox mystery structures the entire plot: sealed boxes signal the conflict, the locket's key solves the mystery, and the documentary evidence inside redefines options. It shapes tactics (community investigation, Thomas's knowledge of special locks) and drives the middle turn. The concept is indispensable—without it, no mechanism exists for Mrs. Chen's legacy or the community's mobilization. Present across setup, development, and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>Marissa's "following" (pursuing the locket's clues, inviting neighbors to share) is present but not dramatized as a constraining trait. The attribute could describe her curatorial method, but it does not create visible friction or cost—she leads by assembling voices without a moment where following (versus directing) alters tactics. Mentioned thematically ("following where it leads") but not leveraged as a choice-shaping limit.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Hear" operates throughout: Marissa's belief that listening heals, Thomas "hears things," the courtyard ritual centers on neighbors "being truly heard," and the climax depends on collective storytelling that reveals the pattern. The action is integral to method and theme. However, it blends with "listening" and "giving voice" without a single irreplaceable beat where hearing (versus seeing, deducing) changes the outcome. Functional and thematic but somewhat diffuse.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Neighborhood storytelling is signaled early (Saturday gathering "since the noise of the world had grown too loud"), executed in the courtyard scene where "each person's fragment connected to another's," and delivers the key insight (pattern of sealed rent-controlled mailboxes). The method shapes the middle turn and validates Marissa's premise at closure. Removing it would break the discovery mechanism and thematic resolution. Mechanics matter and are dramatized on the page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The courtyard appears in setup (dawn preparation), hosts the central gathering, and frames the ending image. It provides social space and tonal anchor ("amber and gold," "vibrant courtyard") but does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters outcome—the mailroom, not the courtyard, enables discovery. Vivid and thematically consonant but functions more as backdrop than tactical micro-setting. Present in all three gates but without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "when the outside world intrudes" is established through the development company's announcement, lawyers' letters, and the immediate threat of eviction. It motivates the stakes but does not tighten decisions on the page—the three-day window since the locket's arrival and the Saturday-morning gathering are noted but not used as a live clock. Time shapes context rather than altering moves; no countdown or deadline pressure in the final act.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Marissa's belief that "listening heals" drives her creation of the Saturday gathering and her framing of the community response. It is stated in the opening, tested through the courtyard storytelling that reveals the mailbox pattern, and reasserted at closure ("we've always protected each other"). However, the motivation is told more than dramatized—no on-page friction between listening and a competing impulse (e.g., acting alone, legal aggression). Desire is clear and consistent but lacks contradictory cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Sandstorm calm" appears in the opening ("sandstorm calm through the preparations") and the closing image ("sandstorm would pass"). The tone of methodical composure under external chaos is sustained through Marissa's measured investigation and the courtyard's collective clarity. It modulates slightly with the tension of discovery but remains stable rather than charged. The metaphor recurs purposefully and fits the stakes, but does not deepen or shift meaning at the final image—it reasserts rather than reweights.</comment>
