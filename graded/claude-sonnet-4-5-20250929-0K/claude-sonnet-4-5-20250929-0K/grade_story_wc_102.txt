<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mei's interior is lushly rendered but rarely contradictory; her quest unfolds as contemplative observation rather than压迫ed choice. The pilgrim remains a catalyst without internal friction. The final act—leaving the jade tear—reads as graceful release rather than a decision that forecloses a live path with visible cost. Therapy-speak intrudes: "unresolved attachment" and "the vast reservoir of unuttered devotion" flatten what could be embodied grief.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (who, where, twilight viaduct). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: imagery and reflection layer toward a final reconfiguration. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (understanding transfiguration of love), but the cost remains conceptual and oblique—Mei gains insight without forfeiting a live option on the page. The pilgrim's appearance and departure feel more like staged epiphany than causal pressure, and the final image reweights prior material yet the felt price is muted.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The viaduct and wisteria are vividly particular, and the camera obscura's inverted image charges the reveal. Sensory detail is rich and purposeful (perfume, phosphorescent sparks, refracted blooms). The jade tear functions as micro-setting, constraining Mei's mission and charging the closure when she leaves it on the vine, altering her relationship to the past-life memory.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding where unused love is stored—is signaled early but pursued through meditation and vision rather than narrowing tactical choices. One meaningful deepening occurs (seeing golden threads in the camera obscura), yet it arrives as revelation rather than a turn earned by prior friction. The pilgrim's spark-show and Mei's decision to release the tear lack a legible trade-off that forecloses a live path; she departs enriched, not changed by sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme (transfiguration of unuttered love into beauty) emerges organically from image and action. The camera obscura's inversion and the wisteria blooms operate as purposeful motifs that reweight at closure. However, the final paragraph leans toward thesis statement ("her art had always been about this," "the vast reservoir of unuttered devotion"), and "We're all pilgrims…museums of transformed feeling" risks sounding like prompt echo rather than earned insight.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mei; psychic distance modulates appropriately. Diction often elevates into lyric register ("prayers made visible," "foggy lucidity") that fits the contemplative tone but occasionally drifts toward ornamental abstraction ("the vast reservoir of unuttered devotion"). Dialogue is minimal and functional. The pilgrim's speech carries faint archetype quality; his lines sound interchangeable with wise-figure stock.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Prose is lush and image-rich, but density suffers from paraphrase loops and scaffold. "The unused love hadn't gone nowhere—it had gone everywhere, transformed into the beauty…" restates the thesis mid-passage. "Vast reservoir of unuttered devotion" and "museums of transformed feeling" repeat the concept without advancing pressure. Template cadence: multiple paragraphs open with "She [verb]" or "Mei [verb]," flattening rhythm. Overwriting in peak beats (stacked metaphors: "rivers of it pouring," "golden threads spiraling," "a thousand purple worlds") blurs rather than sharpens the moment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The camera obscura inversion and the pilgrim of sparks offer fresh visual texture, yet the core arc—spiritual seeker receives epiphany from wise stranger—follows a well-worn template. The transformation of unused love into ambient beauty is poetic but abstract, lacking the specific lived detail or non-obvious moral calculus that would make it irreplaceable. The ending reframes the quest but does so through metaphor rather than grounded consequence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Mei frames the story and her art practice anchors several beats (setting up the camera, using it to see golden threads). However, her role as camera obscura artist is more atmospheric than causal—the inversion reveals the threads, but she could observe the same revelation through meditation or direct vision. She makes one key choice (leaving the tear), yet that choice does not hinge on her specific craft; another spiritual seeker could execute the same arc. Present across beats but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kwan Yin's tear appears early (signaled in past-life memory, produced mid-scene, left at closure). It carries symbolic weight (compassion crystallized, clutched while drowning) and the pilgrim asks for it, establishing importance. Its final use—hung on wisteria as offering—reconfigures Mei's relationship to grief. However, the tear does not constrain a middle choice or narrow options; it functions more as talisman than active tool. Present in all three gates with lyric reprise, but causal pressure is limited.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The pilgrim of sparks shapes the encounter structurally: his impossible balance, lightning-struck history, and electromagnetic healing push the scene toward revelation. His presence enables the vision of golden threads and the emotional unknotting. Yet he arrives as mystical guide rather than co-agent with competing stakes; he could be replaced by another supernatural catalyst (oracle, spirit, ritual) without breaking story logic. Functional across two beats but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Spiritually curious since childhood" frames Mei's receptivity to the pilgrim's instructions and her willingness to trust past-life memory. It enables her to set up the camera obscura and follow breathing exercises without skepticism. However, the trait is mentioned once in exposition and does not visibly constrain a choice or impose cost—she never debates belief versus doubt, and curiosity does not compete with another value. Label-only, though it primes plausibility.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Heal" anchors the dominant stake (healing the old drowning grief) and the climax (the pilgrim's electromagnetic touch unknots her chest). The story's closure turns on understanding rather than cure—Mei learns transfiguration rather than erasing pain. The action is present and causal, yet the healing feels more like revelation delivered than a choice-driven struggle. Swappable with "understand" or "release" without major structural loss, though it charges the theme.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Revealing through breathing changes" is signaled when the pilgrim instructs Mei to show her breathing, and her stuttered breath triggers the vision of golden threads. The method appears in one key beat and enables the reveal. However, mechanics remain vague—breathing could be replaced by another meditative cue (gaze, pulse, touch) without altering story logic. Present and functional but not developed enough to be indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The twilight viaduct in bloom provides vivid atmosphere and the wisteria serves as final anchor (Mei leaves the tear on a vine). The blooms refract through Kwan Yin's tear, charging the closure image. Setting supplies beauty that dramatizes the theme (unused love transformed) and the viaduct's ancient stone and rail balance contribute to the pilgrim's entrance. However, the location does not constrain tactics or force a middle choice; another liminal natural site (garden, grove, shore) could host the same arc. Present across beats with closure participation, but causal pressure is limited.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The timeframe (three months post-memory surfacing) frames Mei's search and arrival at the viaduct. It establishes why she is ready for the pilgrim's teaching. However, the three-month span does not tighten decisions or create urgency—Mei could have arrived at the viaduct one month or one year later without altering on-page pressure. The memory surfaces in backstory and returns at closure, but time itself does not constrain tactics. Present but does not function as clock.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Mei's desire to find where unused love is stored drives the quest and is dramatized through her past-life memory, her camera obscura practice, and her final insight. The motivation shapes her receptivity to the pilgrim and her willingness to release the tear. However, the want does not visibly conflict with a competing need or impose a trade-off—she seeks and she finds, with no cost or foreclosed path on the page. The motivation anchors the arc but lacks friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Foggy lucidity" is named once and evoked through the camera obscura's inverted image, the half-light, and Mei's meditative state. Tone modulates subtly (twilight → sparks → full night) and fits the contemplative premise. The final image (leaving the tear, packing the camera) sustains the dreamy register. However, tone remains static rather than shifting under pressure; peak beats (vision of threads, emotional unknotting) do not tighten or sharpen the fog. Coherent but does not charge closure distinctly.</comment>
