<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and character-specific—her obsessive measurement of the crack, her inability to accept the city's complacency. Her "quiet drive" manifests in consistent action (documenting spirals, measuring daily, blowing the whistle) rather than label-only assertion. The final choice to "crack their certainty with patient evidence" feels earned by her three-year accumulation of knowledge, though the renunciation of her isolation lacks a visible interpersonal cost that would elevate the stakes. Minor slip: "dread pooled in her chest like shadow-water" edges toward stock embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation is swift (cartographer, outermost shell, three years post-gate). The piece follows an Accumulative lens: spirals → whistle → crack → realization that movement is survival, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where Maren grasps her purpose and the turtle responds. Cost is felt—she must challenge the Council's certainty and risk panic—but the price remains prospective rather than paid on the page. The closure crystallizes options (stay = death, move = survival) with undeniable pressure, qualifying as RR even though the turtle's shift is only beginning.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The turtle-shell micro-setting is indispensable: the crack constrains Maren's timeline, the spirals supply the language she decodes, and the outermost shell positions her to see the watchers. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("sunwashed air," "bleached turtle bone," "relentless brightness"). The environment charges the final image—the turtle's shift is both setting-event and closure beat. The "sunwashed dread" atmosphere intentionally tensions the visual clarity with existential threat, avoiding postcard description.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: the crack threatens catastrophic collapse. Maren's agency—measuring, whistling, deciding to confront the Council—drives the tightening. The piece achieves one meaningful deepening when she realizes the whistle is navigation, not music, and that the gate trapped the turtles. The cost is legible (thousands will drown if she's wrong; the Council will resist), but the climactic turtle-shift occurs as response rather than as a choice Maren makes under competing pressure. Escalation is adequate for the length but lacks a visible tradeoff that would raise it into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from concrete particulars: certainty (the Council's dismissal, the "terrible clarity" of sunlight) versus pattern-driven humility (Maren's spirals, the turtle's ancient routes). The central question—whether stasis or movement ensures survival—is answered non-literally by the turtle's shift and Maren's resolve. The "sunwashed dread" motif charges the ending without stating a moral. The whistle and crack function as image-arguments rather than symbols, and the watchers as guides (not threats) reweights the premise. No thematic echo or sermonizing mars the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with controlled distance; no head-hopping. Diction is character-particular ("patient geometry," "shadow-water," "crack their certainty") and maintains a slightly elevated register appropriate to a scholar-cartographer. Perceptual signature is consistent: Maren notices spirals, measurements, patterns. One minor register slip: "the city had accepted its imprisonment with disturbing ease" reads slightly authorial rather than Maren's lived idiom. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during whistle-blowing, wider during expository reflection on the expedition). No dialogue present to judge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "She had been quietly driven to this edge for three years" establishes duration, motive, and spatial position). No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Minor overwriting: "The note carried across the empty shell-plaza where few citizens ventured anymore" adds "anymore" after "empty" already signals abandonment. The phrase "something like grief" and "shadow-water" are slightly stock. Figurative language is controlled and does not cluster in high-pressure beats. Propulsion is steady; no momentum sinks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The turtle-city premise is fresh and the spiral-pattern language is a specific, non-obvious synthesis. The transformation of "watchers = threat" into "watchers = guides" is earned in hindsight via the whistle mechanic. The piece commits fully to its logic (turtles must migrate; the gate trapped them). Risk: using an invented cartography system and a high-concept setting without over-explaining. One friction: the "lost expedition" and "rusted gate" elements feel lightly sketched, relying on familiar "forbidden knowledge" scaffolding. The emotional arc (obsessive scholar vindicated) is archetypal but executed with sufficient specificity to avoid template feel.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren's choices drive every major beat: she measures the crack, blows the whistle (twice), and resolves to confront the Council. Her role as cartographer enables her unique knowledge of the spiral language. Removing her occupation would collapse the plot. She appears early, acts in the middle (whistle → turtle shift), and her final resolve shapes the ending.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The reed whistle is handled in two distinct beats (soft blow, hard blow) and its function evolves from relic to navigation tool. It triggers the turtle's response and delivers the climactic revelation. The whistle's return "caught in fishing nets" seeds its importance early, and its final use reweights it from grief-object to functional key. Specificity (reed, single note, salvaged) makes it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The lost expedition provides backstory for the whistle and primes Maren's hypothesis that the watchers are guides. It shapes her interpretation of the whistle's purpose ("not instruments of music but of navigation"). However, the expedition itself is recounted, not dramatized, and could be replaced with another research discovery. It participates in closure by framing Maren's understanding but does not constrain her present choices with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Quietly driven" manifests on the page: Maren's solitary three-year obsession, her refusal to accept the Council's dismissal, her patient measurement. The trait enables her discovery (obsessive attention reveals the crack) and constrains her approach (she will use "patient evidence" rather than alarm). The cost is her isolation and the Council's resistance. The attribute is visible in action rather than asserted as a label.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The crack is the central threat: it establishes the ticking-clock stakes, drives Maren's urgency, and validates her need to act. She measures it daily, reports it to the Council, and understands that if it reaches the center the shell will shatter. The crack is seeded early, referenced in the middle, and its progression shapes the ending's pressure. Removing it would eliminate the concrete danger and Maren's justification for confronting the Council.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Pattern languages" (spiral decoding) is Maren's unique method, signaled early ("these patterns formed a language") and demonstrated repeatedly (she reads currents, star-positions, turtle thoughts; she traces the crack's path along the spiral). The method matters: it reveals the disruption at the gate, connects the whistle to turtle navigation, and explains why the turtles must move. Her resolve to use "patient evidence, pattern by pattern" ties the method to closure. It could not be swapped for generic "research" without losing specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The turtle-city setting is indispensable. The shell's crack is the primary threat; the spirals are Maren's data source; the outermost shell positions her to see the watchers; the seven-turtle configuration determines the city's balance ("one turtle lost would unbalance the entire city's weight"). The turtles' need to migrate drives the entire plot. The setting is not backdrop but actor: the turtle shifts in response to the whistle, shaping the closure beat. Removing the setting collapses all logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the gate rusts shut" establishes the three-year stasis and creates the central problem (the city is trapped; the turtles cannot move). It explains why the crack is widening and why Maren's discovery is urgent. The gate's closure is referenced early, mid-story ("since the iron gate rusted shut"), and Maren's realization that "the gate had trapped them in place" ties it to closure. However, the timeframe is more premise than active pressure; it sets conditions but does not tighten decisions beat-by-beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Maren's desire to understand the watchers is dramatized through action: she cannot stop seeing them, she blows the whistle toward them, and she concludes they are guides calling the turtles home. The motivation is conflicted—her drive isolates her and pits her against the Council—and it shapes her final resolve. However, "questioning" is somewhat passive; the stronger motive on the page is proving the crack's danger and saving the city. The watchers function more as interpretive key than direct goal.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Sunwashed dread" is established early ("relentless brightness," "everything looked bleached and certain, yet dread pooled") and sustained through paradox: the light "revealed nothing," making danger invisible. The tone modulates with pressure—initial unease, urgency at the crack, resolve at the ending—while maintaining the core contradiction (clarity that blinds). The final image ("sunwashed dread of this dying city") reprises the tone and charges Maren's purpose. The tone is coherent, specific, and integral to the thematic argument about false certainty.</comment>
