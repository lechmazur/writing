<comment>Marcus is strongly characterized through his desperate bargaining and the visible cost—"hollows beneath his eyes had deepened," the "joy sits wrong...like I swallowed wasps"—embodying the consequences of his reckless idealism. The Moth Oracle's interiority is less developed; her motivations are declared ("promised herself she'd only help people patch holes") rather than tested on the page through contradictory impulses. The final choice to "hold both the light and the dark" is framed by prior causality but lacks a visible micro-choice or renunciation that forecloses a path with felt cost in the ending beat. Embodied emotion is strong in Marcus; the Oracle's "fierce gentleness" remains more label than lived contradiction.</comment>

<comment>Orientation anchors clearly: Moth Oracle, catacomb orchard, present search for Marcus. The piece operates under a Hybrid lens—causal in the reversal attempt (burned card, Rebecca's return) and accumulative in the orchard's symbolic recursion—and holds coherently to closure. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Marcus stands "unsteady but standing," the burned card left as offering, and the Oracle's final line reweights prior bartering into acceptance of "real, whole pain." Cost is felt ("Will it hurt?" "Yes") and the path forward is narrowed, but the decisive change occurs slightly off-page (the walk away, not a on-page renunciation or embodied forfeiture). One meaningful tightening is present when the Oracle reveals Rebecca's parallel suffering, forcing Marcus to see the trade's failure.</comment>

<comment>The catacomb orchard is vividly realized—"apple trees grew from the ribcages of saints," "roots coiled lovingly around femurs and skulls," "pear tree whose branches grew through the eye sockets of a stone martyr"—and the setting constrains the Oracle's teaching: "This isn't a place for bargaining. It's a place for accepting." The half-lit corridors and bone-threaded roots recur in the final image, charging the ending when the burned card is left "on the martyr's stone palm." Spatial choreography is clear (kneeling beneath the tree, walking together through corridors) and sensory detail is filtered through the Oracle's professional perspective. The orchard functions as both literal space and thematic mirror, with the trees' understanding ("nothing grows without death threaded through it") directly shaping the closure message.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—Marcus's need to reverse the failed joy-for-sadness trade—is signaled early and tightens when the Oracle reveals that Rebecca also could not wear the foreign grief. The reversal attempt (burned card ritual) creates a meaningful complication: "You can't just swap destinies back and forth like clothes. They change shape in the wearing." Agency is present but muted: Marcus's final choice to take the Oracle's hand and "do the harder thing" is framed as acceptance rather than a decision that forecloses a live option with visible cost on the page. The escalation is driven by revealed consequences (the wasps-in-chest sensation, Rebecca's parallel suffering) more than Marcus's own tactical choices under pressure. Cost is declared ("Will it hurt?" "Yes") but not yet paid in the ending beat, leaving Charged Poise rather than Decisive Change.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges organically from the orchard's wisdom—"nothing grows without death threaded through it"—and the burned Lovers card's "two figures whose faces had melted into a single crying eye" visualizes the cost of trying to sever parts of the self. The piece resists a tidy moral; the Oracle's insight ("real, whole pain is better than borrowed joy") is earned by the failed reversals and Marcus's embodied suffering. Subtext operates strongly in the Oracle's self-reproach ("she had been so certain she could help") and the burned card as offering/apology. The final image—leaving the card on the martyr's palm—reweights the bartering motif into acceptance ritual without stating a thesis. Minor slip: "real again" in the penultimate line edges toward thematic echo but is grounded enough in Marcus's prior hollowing to avoid overt sermonizing.</comment>

<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable through the Oracle's perspective with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: "fiercely gentle," "dusky resolve," seeing Marcus "inlaying meaning everywhere." Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("trammel souls," "the dangerous ways"). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, with subtext in Marcus's "I'll pay anything to feel whole" foreshadowing the cost. Minor issue: the Oracle's internal narration occasionally tilts toward helpful-narrator mode—"The problem was, she'd let him"—which slightly over-explains causality the scene already shows. Purposeful compression in the orchard's whispered wisdom ("the trees whispered, their roots tightening infinitesimally") works well. Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping.</comment>

<comment>Figurative language is dense and often striking ("joy sits wrong...like I swallowed wasps," "understanding dawn across his face like a bruise") but clusters heavily in nearly every sentence, risking overwriting in a piece this short. Rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high. Minor loop: "fiercely gentle" appears twice (dialogue tag and closing line) without significant reweighting. The final paragraph—"Around them, the trees whispered..."—stalls momentum with exposition that tells the thematic point ("The orchard understood what humans always forgot") rather than letting the image stand. Sentence openings vary well, and no serious grammatical or tense inconsistencies appear. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<comment>The catacomb orchard where saints' bones nourish fruit trees is a fresh, specific synthesis that grounds the bartered-destinies premise in visceral imagery rather than abstract magic-system mechanics. The burned Lovers card with melted faces offers a non-obvious visual correlate for failed soul-swaps. The piece transforms the familiar "be careful what you wish for" trope by embedding it in a mentor's guilt and showing both sides of the failed trade (Marcus and Rebecca). Risk-taking in the setting and the quiet, acceptance-driven ending elevates originality. Minor limitation: the core emotional arc—learning to accept one's whole self rather than cutting away pain—is a widely explored theme in contemporary fantasy, and while executed with specificity, the premise does not fully escape template territory.</comment>

<comment>Marcus, the reckless idealist, is present throughout and his past choice to trade his depression drives the entire conflict. His on-page choices are limited: he kneels, inlays meaning, listens, and finally takes the Oracle's hand. The hand-taking is the only present-moment decision, and it narrows options (committing to the harder path of acceptance) but does not create a major causal turn—the Oracle's revelation about Rebecca and the burned card reversal do more structural work. He appears in setup (past trades), development (current suffering), and ending (acceptance), meeting all three gates, and his idealism is causally active in the backstory trade. Score reflects solid integration with meaningful but not indispensable present-moment agency.</comment>

<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The burned tarot card appears in the opening (carried in pocket, "edges still warm"), the middle revelation (Oracle draws it out, explains the failed reversal ritual), and the ending (left on the martyr's palm as offering/apology). It is handled across three beats and its meaning evolves: physical evidence → proof of irreversible change → ritual closure object. The card's image (two faces melted into one crying eye) directly visualizes the bartered-destinies concept and charges the final gesture. It constrains the Oracle's tactical options (the reversal "didn't work completely") and shapes the ending's symbolic weight. Strong integration; not quite indispensable because the story's logic could survive with a different ritual token, but removal would significantly weaken the closure image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>8.2</grade>
<comment>Bartered destinies is the story's engine: Marcus traded his depression for someone else's joy, Rebecca wanted her melancholy back, and the failed reversal forces the central realization that "you can't just swap destinies back and forth like clothes." The concept shapes every beat—the Oracle's professional practice ("trammel souls, bind and unbind the threads of fate"), Marcus's physical suffering (joy "sits wrong in my chest"), Rebecca's parallel crisis, and the ending's prescription to "hold both the light and the dark." The mechanics are signaled early (three months of visits, teaching "the old ways, the dangerous ways") and constrain the Oracle's ability to fix the problem. Removing this exact concept would collapse the plot, character stakes, and thematic closure. Highly integrated and indispensable.</comment>

<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>"Fiercely gentle" appears twice: as dialogue attribution ("her voice fiercely gentle") and in the closing action ("offering her hand with that fierce gentleness that was both invitation and warning"). The attribute colors the Oracle's approach but does not constrain or enable a specific choice with visible cost—it describes her manner rather than forcing a tradeoff. It functions as characterization texture (she is tough but compassionate) but remains somewhat label-like. The trait is present in setup (voice), development (implicit in her patient explanation), and payoff (hand-offering), meeting all three gates, yet its causal role is limited. Mid-band score for consistent presence and tonal coherence without decisive tactical impact.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>"Trammel" (to bind/unbind souls and fate-threads) is introduced early as the Oracle's core skill ("her own mother had taught her how to trammel souls") and frames the story's magical mechanics. It enables the original trades Marcus made, constrains the Oracle's reversal attempt (the burned-card ritual is a trammel-reversal that fails), and implicitly shapes the ending choice—Marcus must now accept rather than trammel away his pain. The action is causally active in backstory and middle revelation but does not drive the final beat directly; the ending's acceptance stance is thematic rather than a new trammel-act. Present in setup, development (failed reversal), and conceptually in the ending, with meaningful but not indispensable mechanics. Strong integration; swappable with another binding/unbinding term only with moderate edits.</comment>

<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>"Inlaying meaning everywhere"—Marcus's method of pressing dried flowers into carved names, arranging pebbles into constellations, whispering prayers into cracks—is vividly shown in one beat (kneeling beneath the pear tree) and connects to his idealist belief that encoding beauty will return beauty to him. It characterizes his approach and sets up the Oracle's corrective ("You're using the orchard wrong"). However, the method does not recur in later beats, does not constrain his final choice, and is not mentioned in the ending. It appears only in the development section, missing both setup signal and payoff linkage. Functional in one beat but ultimately replaceable; another desperate ritual behavior would serve similarly. Mid-low band for single-beat visibility without closure participation.</comment>

<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The catacomb orchard—apple and pear trees growing from saints' ribcages and skulls, roots coiling around bones—is established immediately and frames every scene. It provides the physical stage for Marcus's kneeling ritual, the Oracle's teaching moment, and the final gesture of leaving the burned card "on the martyr's stone palm." The setting's thematic content (life and death intertwined, "nothing grows without death threaded through it") directly informs the closure's message and the Oracle's prescription. The orchard is not merely backdrop; its symbolic logic constrains the Oracle's teaching and charges the final image. Spatial details (half-lit corridors, stone martyr, tree branches through eye sockets) are integrated into action. Strong integration across setup, development, and payoff; removing this exact setting would require substantial reimagining of imagery and theme.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>3.2</grade>
<comment>"Within the glow of half-lit corridors" appears as a location marker in one sentence ("Within the glow of half-lit corridors, she found him kneeling") and recurs in the closing walk ("They walked together through the half-lit corridors"). It establishes atmosphere (dim, liminal light) but does not function as a timeframe that tightens decisions or tracks elapsed duration. The story's temporal structure is a single continuous scene with brief backstory anchors (three months of visits, "last week" Rebecca came), but the corridors' glow does not operate as a clock or deadline. The phrase is present in middle and ending but remains ornamental—setting detail rather than time pressure. Low score for atmospheric presence without temporal-constraint function.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The motivation "to patch holes in the soul" is explicitly stated as the Oracle's guiding principle ("promised herself she'd only help people patch holes in the soul, never tear new ones") and drives her guilt when she realizes she violated it with Marcus. This desire creates the central conflict: she tried to patch Marcus's hole (his depression) but instead tore a new one (joy that sits wrong, leaving him hollow). The motivation is dramatized through her self-reproach, her decision to reveal Rebecca's parallel suffering, and her final prescription to accept wholeness. It shapes her teaching stance at every turn and is friction-laden—her compassion led her to break her own rule. Present in setup (her vow), development (guilt and revelation), and payoff (offering the harder path of acceptance). Cost is visible: she must guide Marcus through pain she helped cause. High integration; indispensable to character arc and thematic closure.</comment>

<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>"Dusky resolve" appears once in the closing line ("with her dusky resolve hardening into something like hope") and captures the Oracle's tonal stance: shadowed determination with emergent optimism. The tone is coherent throughout—elegiac, weighted, gentle but firm—and modulates appropriately from opening search (concern, warmth of the burned card) through revelation (sorrow, responsibility) to ending (resolve, cautious hope). The descriptor itself charges the final moment but is not established early or developed across beats; it arrives as summary rather than recurring motif. Tone as lived quality is strong; "dusky resolve" as named element is late and label-like. Mid-band for tonal coherence and ending charge, with the specific phrase contributing primarily at closure without prior anchoring.</comment>
