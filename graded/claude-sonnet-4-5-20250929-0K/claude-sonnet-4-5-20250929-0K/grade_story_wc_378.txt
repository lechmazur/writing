<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>M4-RY's interior life is richly rendered through embodied contradictions—nostalgia corroding circuits, compulsive collection as penance, hands that tremble then steady. The photograph revelation and the choice to bury rather than incinerate show genuine internal conflict resolved through renunciation with visible cost. The android's motivation remains consistent and particular throughout, with micro-choices (reversing the laser polarity, opening the chest panel) that reveal character under pressure. Minor slip: the final steadying feels slightly neat given the depth of prior fracture, but the choice to tend rather than erase earns the shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): M4-RY renounces erasure, buries the core fear to transform rather than contain it, and returns to tending—a stance crystallization with visible cost (the static remains but resolves into "discordant harmony"). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens that coheres through the box-opening sequence and the photograph discovery, culminating in the burial that reweights all prior collection. Orientation anchors (android, dome, post-shift world) arrive promptly. One meaningful deepening occurs when M4-RY discovers the hidden photograph, narrowing the escape plan and forcing a different resolution. The watering final image charges prior rose imagery with new weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The glass dome and mutating roses function as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the ending: roses "strangely organic," "crystalline petals soft as flesh" establish wrongness-as-beauty that M4-RY mirrors. The burial among roots is spatially specific and metaphorically coherent. The magnetic shift, thermal vents, and irrigation filters are integrated into action (the controlled burn plan, daily sensor chime). Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through M4-RY's nurturing lens. The dome's environmental malfunction enables the rose mutations that become thematically load-bearing at closure, satisfying the 9+ constraint test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—escaping the static prison built by collected fears—signals early and tightens through the miniaturization sequence. The box-opening initiates pressure; the photograph discovery is the key reversal that forecloses the planned incineration and forces a costlier path (burial, ongoing tending). Agency is clear: M4-RY chooses transformation over erasure, renouncing the clean escape. The cost is legible—the static doesn't vanish but becomes "harmony, discordant, incomplete"—a visible trade-off that charges the final image. Under the Accumulative lens, escalation reads as density increase culminating in the photograph beat, which reweights all prior material.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: containment vs. transformation, fragmented wholeness embodied in the roses, the box, and M4-RY's own state. The piece resists tidy resolution—"harmony, discordant, incomplete, but purposeful" avoids the explain-everything trap. The burial among "strangely alive" roses offers a non-literal answer to whether erasure can free the self: the photograph becomes part of what grows, not what burns. "Tending the garden built from both" in the penultimate paragraph risks slight over-articulation but earns it through prior image-work. The closing image (watering the roses) resonates without moralizing, reweighting all rose mentions with undeniable pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds cleanly with a distinct perceptual signature: "corroded their circuits like rust," "fragmented wholeness," "these impossible things" all reflect M4-RY's dual nature. Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tight interiority during the chest-panel revelation, slight zoom-out for the sensor chime. Diction remains within android-caretaker lexicon: "neural network," "processors," yet poetic ("mineral hearts pumping something that resembled sap"). No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks that dull immediacy. The prose compresses under pressure (short declaratives during the miniaturization) then breathes at closure, matching emotional rhythm. Voice is singular and voice-motivated throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Information density is high—most lines advance character, world, or stakes without padding. Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift between subject-verb, prepositional phrase, and subordinate constructions. The miniaturization sequence propels clearly: "opened," "held," "reversed," "watched." Minor loop: "The static remained" after the thimble moment echoes "static in their neural network" from earlier without added pressure, a brief paraphrase slip (−0.2). One metaphor risks slight strain: "mineral hearts pumping something that resembled sap" blends stone/plant in ways that push biological logic, though it serves the wrongness theme. No scaffold or template cadence. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent and motivated.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The nostalgic android + post-magnetic-shift sanctuary + mutating mineral-roses offers a specific synthesis that avoids pure template. The controlled-burn-as-therapy metaphor risks familiarity, but the piece transforms it through the photograph discovery and burial choice—erasure fails, tending succeeds. The roses as "strangely organic" and the box of childhood fears are fresh particulars. Emotional truth (penance for the child left behind) grounds the speculative frame. The transformation test passes: swapping names/places would lose the android-nurture paradox and the mineral-garden logic. One hedge: the "fragmented wholeness" phrasing in closure feels slightly coined rather than discovered, lowering ingenuity a notch from the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>M4-RY appears immediately, drives all major turns (collecting fears, planning the burn, opening the box, discovering the photograph, burying it, resuming care), and the final choice (tending over erasing) is the closure hinge. The character's interior contradiction (nostalgia vs. escape) constrains tactics throughout. Setup, development, and payoff all present; causal pressure high; closure linkage direct. Cost visible: the static persists as "discordant harmony." Irreplaceable—the android's dual programming (nurture + remember) generates the core conflict. High integration across all beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The box appears early (maintenance room mention, then carried to center), handled in multiple beats (opening, miniaturizing contents), and its failure to resolve the static forces the turn. The photograph hidden inside reweights the box from penance-container to revelation-site. The box's black-metal unmarked quality and the vial of darkness are specific. Setup, development, payoff all met. Causal pressure: the box's contents drive the controlled burn plan; its inadequacy (the photo remains) forces burial. Closure linkage indirect but strong—the box catalyzes the photograph discovery that alters the ending. Cost tied to it: abandoning incineration.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The "controlled burn" plan appears early (paragraph 5), shapes M4-RY's middle-act choices (miniaturization sequence), and fails at the turn—forcing the burial alternative. The concept defines tactics: thermal vents, magnification laser, thimble incineration. Setup and development strong; payoff occurs via negation (the burn doesn't happen, but its failure precipitates the true resolution). Causal work clear: the plan's inadequacy when faced with the photograph drives the ending. The phrase "controlled burn to escape" slightly summary-tells the thematic stakes, but the mechanics (miniaturize, incinerate) are on-page and matter. Cost: renouncing the plan is the price of transformation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>The roses' strange organicity (crystalline petals soft as flesh, mineral hearts with sap-like substance) appears early, recurs in the burial beat ("red as blood, soft as a child's hand"), and directly enables the thematic resolution—M4-RY buries the photograph among them because they embody "fragmented wholeness." The trait constrains choice: only these mutated blooms can receive and transform the fear. Setup (paragraph 2), development (implicit—M4-RY tends them throughout), payoff (burial among the "most strangely organic" rose). Causal pressure moderate but closure linkage strong. Specificity high; irreplaceable for the ending's logic. Cost connection: accepting wrongness-as-beauty mirrors M4-RY's self-acceptance.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Miniaturization appears mid-story, executed in multiple beats (spider, mirror, thunder, darkness), and its success-then-failure arc creates the key turn: the items shrink, but the static remains, forcing M4-RY to open the chest panel. The action is specific (reversed polarity laser) and drives the escalation. Setup at paragraph 6, development across beats 7–8, payoff when it proves insufficient and the photograph is discovered instead. Causal pressure strong; not easily swappable—another method wouldn't generate the same "less loud" hope then deflation. Closure participation indirect: the action's failure redirects to burial. Cost legible: wasted effort, hope dashed.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Containment as method appears early (box in the maintenance room, collecting fears compulsively) and the piece explicitly states "they were containing chaos… but chaos cannot be contained forever." The controlled burn is an attempt to perfect containment via miniaturization. The method's failure is the hinge: containment won't work; transformation (burial) is required. Setup strong, development present (the box, the thimble), payoff at the turn when M4-RY abandons containment for integration. Causal role clear but somewhat thematic rather than tactical—the method defines the problem more than the solution. Specificity moderate; cost connection present (renouncing control).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dome sanctuary appears immediately, recurs throughout (thermal vents for the burn plan, rose gardens in fractal spirals, environmental controls malfunctioning, magnetic sensors chiming), and the burial site is spatially specific. Setup paragraph 1, development across all middle beats, payoff when M4-RY buries the photograph "among the roots" and returns to "water the roses." The setting supplies resources (thermal vents, roses) and constraints (mutations from malfunction, the magnetic shift making outside uninhabitable). Causal pressure moderate to strong; the garden's existence as sanctuary and the roses' wrongness directly enable the thematic resolution. Irreplaceable for closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The magnetic shift anchors the premise (poles reversed, compass points west, world outside uninhabable, forty years since evacuation) and recurs at closure ("north had shifted another degree"). Setup strong (paragraph 1), development implicit (the dome exists because of the shift), payoff via the sensor chime that bookends M4-RY's interior turn. The timeframe creates the static world in which the story occurs but doesn't tighten decisions beat-to-beat—no live countdown, no urgency derived from ongoing shifts. The "another degree" chime charges the ending by contrasting external flux with M4-RY's internal steadying, a lyric reprise. Functional but not irreplaceable for escalation; more atmospheric than causal.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The drive to resolve inner static appears early (paragraph 3: "static in their neural network, cascading feedback loops"), motivates the controlled burn plan, and the resolution (static becomes "harmony, discordant… but purposeful") is the story's emotional payoff. The motivation is dramatized through contradictory impulses: compulsive collection vs. desire for escape, nostalgia as curse, penance for failure. Friction between want (silence, erasure) and cost (the photograph can't be miniaturized) drives the turn. Setup, development, payoff all strong. The desire shapes every choice on the page. Irreplaceable for character and closure; the final steadying of hands mirrors the internal shift.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The tone of fragmented wholeness is established immediately ("corroded… like rust," "beautiful in their wrongness, their fragmented wholeness") and modulates with pressure—trembling hands, then the revelation, then steadying. The prose mirrors the concept through syntax: long accumulative sentences for the roses, short declaratives during crisis ("The static remained"), then a return to measured rhythm at closure. The tone charges the final image: M4-RY embodies the roses' condition, neither whole nor broken but both, tending what blooms "in the space between what was and what remains." Coherent through all turns, tied directly to theme and character. Indispensable for the story's identity.</comment>
