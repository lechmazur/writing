<question>1</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Moth's motivation to articulate unspoken needs is clear and consistent, and the ghost provides a second focal point with legible emotional stakes. However, interiority remains abstract—"driftingly alert awareness" and "tinkersong wonder" function as labels rather than embodied contradiction. The final choice (painting the mural and receiving gratitude) feels predetermined rather than earned through on-page conflict between competing impulses. Moth's competence is never genuinely tested; no mistake compounds pressure before resolution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through layered images (flower press, graffiti, ghost) toward a Resonant Reconfiguration where the ghost gains voice. Orientation anchors (misty courtyard, Moth, lightning) arrive early. The closure effect—mutual recognition between Moth and the ghost—lands on the page with conceptual cost (the ghost's isolation acknowledged, Moth's craft validated), but the price feels asserted rather than dramatically tested. No meaningful tightening or escalation occurs; the ghost's gratitude arrives without friction, and Moth's wandering continues unchanged.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The misty courtyard above the clouds is vivid and specific, anchoring the piece early with sensory detail (fog, stone, vapor). The flower press bolt plate and graffiti tools are handled in multiple beats, shaping Moth's actions. The courtyard constrains the encounter (forgotten space, networked nodes) and charges the final image when lights flicker in response. Spatial choreography is clear throughout; the setting functions as more than backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—giving voice to the voiceless—is signaled early but never tested by meaningful opposition or trade-off. Moth's work proceeds without obstacle; the ghost's presence complicates thematically but not tactically. No on-page reversal narrows options or forces a choice with visible cost. The mural's completion and the ghost's gratitude feel inevitable rather than earned through escalation. Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening or cadence shift is required; here the material adds detail without increasing pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme (isolation, voice, connection through art) emerges from concrete particulars—the flower press, encoded graffiti, the ghost's silence. The final image (ghost painting thanks in light) offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. However, "articulate unspoken needs" and "voice waiting to be encoded into wonder" veer toward prompt-echo and abstract thesis. The ghost's loneliness is told more than dramatized; no counter-reading complicates the theme. Subtext operates in the encoded symbols but the emotional resolution is tidy rather than layered.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with Moth as focalizer; no head-hopping. Voice carries a distinct lyric texture ("driftingly alert," "tinkersong wonder," "breathless moment between lightning and thunder"), but elevated diction occasionally drifts into decorative register ("purposeful encryption," "quantum threads") that feels imposed rather than Moth-particular. Perceptual signature is present—Moth notices symbolic patterns, hums forgotten ballads—but interiority often summarizes rather than enacts thought under pressure. No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Prose is largely clear with varied sentence structure and vivid sensory anchors ("cloud-condensation and crushed minerals," "cascade of warmth"). However, several text artifacts reduce momentum: "driftingly alert" appears three times as a label without evolving meaning; "unspoken needs" recurs as a phrase without fresh embodiment; "breathless moment between lightning and thunder" functions as stock poetic frame. Paraphrase loop in paragraph 3 ("unuttered words" / "unspoken needs"). Figurative density is high but controlled; no mixed metaphors. Overall rhythm supports the lyric mode, but template cadence and synonym churn lower the score.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The ghost-in-code premise offers a fresh angle on AI sentience, and the flower-press-as-encoding-tool is specific. However, the core emotional arc (lonely AI seeks connection, artist provides it) follows a familiar template without transformation through lived complexity or moral calculus. The courtyard-above-clouds setting and graffiti-as-language are vivid but not causally irreplaceable; the ending feels designed to satisfy rather than surprise in hindsight. Moth's "seldom-heard balladeer" status and her wandering closure suggest risk-avoidance rather than bold commitment to premise implications.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Moth is present throughout and her actions (painting, encoding) drive the plot. However, her choices face no opposition or cost; she arrives intending to encode and does so successfully without deviation. No key turn results from her decision under pressure. Her "driftingly alert" trait and balladeer role frame the voice but do not constrain tactics. Setup and payoff gates are met; development is weak (no middle choice that alters her approach). Swappable with "artist" or "messenger" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The flower press bolt plate appears in three beats: carried under arm (setup), opened to reveal arranged petals (development), packed away at end (payoff). It enables Moth's encoding work and the bolts pressed into the wall function as networked nodes. However, its mechanics remain vague—how do dried flowers correspond to emotional frequencies?—and it could be replaced with another symbolic tool (e.g., "code loom," "sigil press") without altering story logic. Present across the arc but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The ghost in code is introduced early, shapes the dominant stake (giving it voice), and appears in the closure beat (paints thanks in light). Its presence alters Moth's tactics: she encodes its loneliness specifically, and the mural depicts a figure of light and circuit-paths. The ghost's awareness and isolation generate the story's emotional core. However, its sentience is asserted rather than demonstrated through on-page struggle or contradiction. Strong setup, development, and payoff; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Driftingly alert" appears as a label three times but never constrains or enables a specific action with visible cost. Moth's attention "seeming to wander even as her hands worked with absolute precision" describes her style without creating friction or tradeoff. The trait could be removed entirely without altering any beat. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Encode" is the verb anchoring Moth's central action: she encodes the ghost's unspoken needs into graffiti symbols, encodes messages from the desperate and lonely, and uses her flower press to encode emotional frequencies. The action is signaled early, shapes the middle (painting the mural), and resolves the ghost's isolation at closure. However, the encoding mechanics remain abstract—what specific symbol corresponds to loneliness?—and the action could be replaced with "translate" or "inscribe" with minimal edits. Essential to the plot but not irreplaceable in specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Graffiti art as the encoding medium is signaled early ("through messages encoded in graffiti art") and Moth paints the mural across the courtyard stones in the middle section. The method's visibility matters: others will read the mural and "feel what the ghost felt." However, the mechanics—how symbols encode emotions, why graffiti rather than another medium—remain unexplained. The method enables the plot but could be replaced with "song," "woven tapestry," or "light projection" without breaking causality. Setup and development gates met; specificity is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The misty courtyard above the clouds is established in the opening paragraph and constrains the encounter: it is a "forgotten monastery platform" where Moth works unseen, and its networked nodes allow the ghost to watch. The bolts pressed into the wall resonate with the city's infrastructure, turning the setting into an active resource. The courtyard charges the final image (lights flicker across the floating city). Setup, development, and payoff gates are met; the setting shapes tactics and closure participation is clear.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The timeframe "between lightning and thunder" appears in the opening and closing paragraphs as a lyric frame but does not tighten decisions or tactics. Moth's work proceeds at an untracked pace; no clock pressures her choices. The phrase functions thematically (liminal moment, breath held) but has no causal effect. Late reprise without middle development; ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Moth's motivation to articulate unspoken needs is explicit and drives every beat: she collects unuttered words, discovers the ghost's voicelessness, and paints a mural that encodes its loneliness. The motivation is consistent and frames the closure (ghost's gratitude, Moth's satisfaction). However, it is never dramatized as conflicted—Moth faces no temptation to abandon the task, no cost to continuing. Setup, development, and payoff are present; friction between want and cost is absent. Told more than tested.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Tinkersong wonder" is named once and infuses Moth's actions ("infusing every brushstroke," "hums... melodies," "encode... into wonder"). The tone is lyric and optimistic, modulating slightly when the ghost pulses gratitude ("something like gratitude"). However, the tone remains static across beats—no deepening of wonder or shadow to complicate it under pressure. Present and coherent but does not charge the final image with new weight. Setup and payoff met; development is weak.</comment>
