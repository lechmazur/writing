<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena's interiority is concrete and specific, particularly her embodied relationship with death since childhood. The final choice to leave the snow globe carries visible cost—abandoning her collection impulse, her pattern of solving mysteries. Internal contradiction operates well: she seeks answers yet realizes finding doesn't equal understanding. Minor slip: the sister's drowning occasionally reads as explanatory scaffolding rather than live pressure on present choices.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Elena's deliberate choice to leave the snow globe forecloses her collection/solution path with visible cost. The piece operates under a Hybrid lens (Causal choices within Accumulative/Textural density), held coherently to closure. Orientation anchors arrive early (Dr. Elena Marsh, SS Persephone library, 300 feet down). One meaningful tightening occurs when she writes in her own notebook, then removes the globe from her bag—narrowing from observer to participant to renunciant. Cost is legible: "some small planes should remain forever in flight."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The sunken library as micro-setting constrains choices throughout: the skeletal librarian, the snow globe on the reading table, the radio room all pressure Elena's collection impulse and force her final renunciation. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (mahogany shelves swaying with current, verdigris blooming like underwater flowers). The snow globe itself functions as setting-scale object that charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear across the wreck's geography.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding the physics of letting go) is signaled early and tightens through one clear escalation: Elena moves from observer to note-writer to final renunciation, each step foreclosing her collection pattern. The choice to leave the snow globe carries visible cost—abandoning both object and the solve-everything impulse established by the Amelia discovery. Agency is renunciation with on-page price. No false reversals; pressure accumulates under the Hybrid lens and resolves through protagonist decision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme (the impossibility of closure through solving mysteries) emerges from concrete particulars: Amelia's corroded fuselage that brought hollow recognition, the ruined journal preserved-and-destroyed, the two waters separated by glass in perfect equilibrium. The final image (snow globe returned, airplane suspended mid-flight) offers a resonant non-literal answer without stating a moral. Subtext operates cleanly in the notebook exchange and the physics metaphor. Minor: "physics of letting go" appears as phrase twice, risking label-speak, but the concept is dramatized through action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable and controlled; Elena's perceptual signature is distinct (methodically working by untangling threads, quietly analytic). Diction fits the technical-introspective register consistently. The whispered dialogue to the skeleton and brief interior voice feel natural. Psychic distance modulates purposefully (zooming from wreck-scale to snow globe interior). One minor slip: "the physics of letting go" as repeated phrase borders on thesis-statement rather than character thought, though it remains within Elena's established intellectual register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Prose is clean with strong propulsion and varied rhythm. Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., the equilibrium passage works as image, metaphor, and choice-moment simultaneously). Opening and closing images are charged. Minor deductions: "quietly analytic as always" is tell-not-show; "the hollow recognition that some disappearances, once solved, left you with less than the mystery had provided" edges toward summary of theme rather than trusting dramatization. Two instances of "physics of letting go" create a slight loop. No other scaffold or template cadence detected.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The combination of sunken-ship exploration with grief-and-closure meditation is executed with specificity (Persephone/1947, Amelia's Electra, the snow globe's internal equilibrium). The final turn—leaving rather than collecting—inverts the expected treasure-hunter arc through earned character logic. Emotional truth (unresolved sibling grief driving professional obsession) avoids generic templates. The piece does not take major structural risks but synthesizes its elements into a coherent, non-obvious whole. Transformation test passes: changing names and settings would lose the Amelia/aviation thread that charges the snow globe.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Elena's "first name basis with death" shapes the opening choice (addressing the skeleton as old friend), the notebook decision (writing about her sister's snow globes), and the final renunciation (accepting some mysteries stay buried). Trait is established early, embodied in specific memories (Lake Michigan search), and drives the closure choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Snow globe appears in three distinct beats: discovery on reading table with equilibrium observation, placement in collection bag, and final removal/return that constitutes closure. Its specific properties (two waters balanced, brass airplane suspended mid-flight) charge the ending image and make the renunciation irreplaceable. Reweighted meaning clear: from collectible artifact to symbol of necessary suspension.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Last transmission" appears in two forms: the passenger's ruined journal (preserved-and-destroyed) and Elena's own notebook left beside it. The concept shapes stakes (seeking answers in final messages) and the closure choice (adding her own transmission, then leaving it behind). Present in setup and payoff; middle development is thematic rather than tactical. Could score higher with tighter causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Quietly analytic" is named once ("quietly analytic as always") and demonstrated in the equilibrium observation and methodical photography. It enables the detailed wreck analysis but doesn't constrain a choice with visible cost—Elena's analytic mode doesn't prevent or complicate her final renunciation. Present and consistent but not load-bearing for closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Elena writes a note in her waterproof notebook about her sister's snow globes, then leaves it beside the passenger's journal. This enables the "last transmission" concept but the major turn (leaving the snow globe) would work without it. The notebook beat is purposeful but not causally indispensable to closure; it's one step in a three-step sequence where the snow globe return dominates.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"By untangling threads of cause and effect" is stated once and demonstrated in the wreck analysis (reef strike, port-side preservation, undelivered gift). The method enables Elena's professional mode but doesn't constrain her final choice—she moves beyond analysis to acceptance. Present in setup and middle; not active in closure where renunciation supersedes solving.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>The sunken ship library provides all key story pressure: the skeletal librarian establishes Elena's death-familiarity, the reading table holds the snow globe, the radio room crystallizes "last transmission," the shattered skylight frames her ascent. Setting constrains choices (collection environment, depth/time limits) and charges the final image (leaving treasure in situ). The library's preservation-within-destruction state mirrors theme and makes the renunciation possible. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The Amelia discovery timeframe ("six months ago") establishes Elena's emotional state (broken relationship with mystery, hollow recognition) that drives the entire dive and closure choice. It appears in setup and is referenced at closure ("some small planes should remain forever in flight"). The temporal anchor shapes motivation throughout but doesn't create a live ticking clock within the dive itself.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"To understand the physics of letting go" is stated twice and dramatized throughout: the equilibrium observation, the choice to write versus photograph, the final snow globe return. The motivation creates internal conflict (seeking versus accepting) and drives the closure choice with visible cost (foregoing collection, abandoning solve-everything pattern). The final lines explicitly resolve this desire through enacted renunciation rather than understanding.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Sophisticated melancholy is sustained through diction ("perpetual twilight," "cathedral of loss"), image selection (verdigris blooming, balanced waters), and the elegiac rhythm of Elena's observations. Tone modulates appropriately: analytical during wreck documentation, vulnerable during sister-memory, resigned at closure. The final ascent toward "distant light" with unresolved grief charges the ending without sentimentality. Coherent across all turns.</comment>
