<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's claustrophobia is embodied early ("tightness creeping into her chest") and her "prudently adventurous" nature is shown through twenty years of calculated risk. However, her interior life remains thin at the closure; the final paragraph offers abstract meditation ("honored the wistful rebellion") rather than contradictory impulses acting in scene. The compass as talisman and the organ's instruction provide some embodied choice-making, but the ending renunciation or commitment feels asserted more than earned through visible cost that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the opening paragraph. The story follows a causal lens: descent → disc discovery → organ-guided revelation → ascent with knowledge. One meaningful tightening occurs when the organ's vibrations unlock the second layer, changing Mara's options. Closure is a Decisive Change (she gains the map and will share it tomorrow), but the cost is oblique—no visible forfeiture or tactical constraint paid on the page. The phrase "something better" and warm compass signal conceptual gain without felt loss, weakening closure under causal scrutiny.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The shadowed nexus, starlight shafts, and bronze disc are vivid and purposeful. The organ's reverberation functions as both atmosphere and constraint, rotating the disc to reveal hidden layers. Spatial choreography is coherent (descent, western passage, chamber, ascent). However, the setting primarily stages discovery rather than forcing a trade-off; Mara photographs freely without environmental resistance. The compass and disc constrain perception but do not narrow her final choice, keeping this strong but shy of the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—claiming the Architect's Key—is signaled immediately. One meaningful tightening: the organ's notes cause the disc to rotate, revealing a second layer and reweighting her understanding. Mara's agency is present (she follows the sound, traces with the compass, photographs), yet the escalation is driven by discovery rather than a forced trade-off with visible cost. The claustrophobia "releases its grip" without complication, and no live option is foreclosed at closure. Pressure coheres but does not compel sacrifice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—freedom of movement versus imposed boundaries—emerges organically from the spatial mutiny backstory and the disc's hidden geometry. The final image of the compass "pointing not north but down" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without overt moralizing. Subtext operates in the organ's "patient instruction" and the dust motes' "wistful beauty." Minor weakness: "the world as it was drawn on official maps" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thesis statement, and "convenient lies" is slightly didactic, but the closure image recovers specificity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Diction is controlled and distinct ("shadowed nexus," "fallow period," "prudently adventurous"), though occasional register drift appears ("spatial mutiny" feels writerly rather than Mara's lived idiom). Perceptual signature is present: she notices "elegant precision" and "wistful beauty," filtering setting through an explorer's lens. The final paragraph's syntax ("Tonight, standing in that shadowed nexus between past and future") slightly elevates beyond her established voice under stress, but the effect is minor and does not obscure clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift, and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. No paraphrase loops or template stems detected. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Minor figurative clustering: "dust motes danced," "clawed at her throat," "teeth," "lighthouse warns of rocks" in close proximity, though each stays legible. The phrase "pointing not north but down, always down, to where truth lay buried beneath convenient lies" stacks modifiers at closure without muddling the image. Zero loops, strong propulsion, clean grammar.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—underground map as key to spatial freedom—offers a fresh angle on rebellion narratives. The organ-as-instructor and vibration-driven disc rotation are specific, non-obvious details. However, the emotional arc (descent into fear → discovery → triumphant ascent) follows a recognizable template, and the "lost artifact unlocks hidden truth" frame is familiar. The story executes competently with some ingenuity (the compass as generational link, the disc's layered geometry) but does not take bold structural or perspectival risks. Transformation is partial; the core beats could transfer to similar treasure-hunt frames with modest edits.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara's claustrophobia shapes early choices (she pauses, forces herself forward "into its teeth") and her decision to follow the organ sound drives the middle beat. Her final choice to share the knowledge tomorrow is signaled but not dramatized with trade-off. Present across setup, middle, and ending; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The compass appears early (setup: "tucked in her vest pocket like a talisman"), is used mid-story ("pulled out her compass point and traced the patterns"), and returns at closure ("felt warm in her palm"). Two distinct beats, but its function is largely symbolic; tracing the disc does not narrow options or impose cost. The "pointing not north but down" closing image reweights meaning but remains metaphorical rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Spatial mutiny" is introduced early (paragraph four: "the underground's refusal to honor borders") and frames the thematic stakes. The disc revelation dramatizes the concept's mechanics (hidden channels, old ways). However, the concept does not force a live tactical choice on the page; Mara's discovery is frictionless. Present across setup, middle, closure; shapes theme more than plot options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Prudently adventurous" is stated in the opening ("twenty years prudently adventurous, choosing expeditions that balanced her terror with meticulous preparation") but not tested with visible cost. Her preparation (blueprint study, months of research) is told; no on-page moment shows her weighing caution against boldness under pressure. Label-only mention without dramatized trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Transfix" appears once at the climax: "Mara knelt, transfixed by the elegant precision of the engraved lines." It marks the discovery beat and shifts her from motion to study, enabling the compass-tracing and photography. However, the action is easily swappable (e.g., "mesmerized," "arrested"); the verb itself does not constrain later choices or charge the ending. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The organ is introduced early (paragraph five: "a single organ note, low and mournful"), shapes Mara's path (she follows the sound through the western passage), and its vibrations mechanically rotate the disc to reveal the second layer. The method is both atmospheric and causal, present across setup, middle, and ending ("the organ fell silent, its duty discharged"). Specific mechanics matter; removing the organ would require structural rewrite.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>The "shadowed nexus" and starlight are introduced in the opening and title the convergence chamber. The starlight shaft marks the disc's location, and the nexus metaphor returns at closure ("standing in that shadowed nexus between past and future"). The setting stages discovery and charges the final image; the domed chamber with five tunnels pressures Mara's navigation. Present across setup, middle, ending; shapes tactics and closure resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Fallow period" appears in the opening ("during this fallow period when the city above lay dormant and unwatched") to justify the timing but does not tighten decisions. No clock pressure; Mara photographs "from every angle" without rush. The timeframe enables the expedition but does not constrain tactics or charge the ending. Functional setup, minimal development or payoff.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The motivation—"claim what generations had sought: the Architect's Key"—is stated early and drives all major choices (descent, following the organ, tracing the disc). The discovery satisfies the want on the page. Minor friction: the desire is told rather than shown through contradictory impulses; no visible cost (renunciation, forfeiture) complicates the fulfillment. Present across all three gates; causal but low-conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Wistful" appears twice (paragraph four: "wistful beauty"; final paragraph: "wistful rebellion") and "rebellion" threads through the spatial mutiny backstory. Tone is coherent and modulates: claustrophobic tension early, awe at the disc, quiet triumph at closure. However, the tone remains somewhat static—melancholic wonder without sharp pressure shifts. The final image recharges the tone but does not transform it under stress.</comment>
