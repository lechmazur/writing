<comment>Maya's interiority is clear and purposeful—her occupation as wreck-diver who "learned long ago that the drowned rarely lied" anchors motivation. However, the peak emotional beat (Katherine's anguish) relies on told effect ("anguish rippled," "frost spreading") rather than embodied contradiction or micro-choice under pressure. The final action (wrapping the globe, preparing to surface) reads as decision but lacks visible cost or foreclosed path on the page; the choice to drive to Halifax tomorrow is stated intent, not enacted sacrifice. Katherine as a ghost-character receives distinct voice and backstory but remains passive—no agency that alters Maya's tactics in scene.</comment>

<comment>The piece anchors who/where/when within the opening paragraph (shrine, glacier, Maya, diving suit, candles) and maintains spatial coherence throughout. Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the ritual assembles meaning through layered backstory (seventeen dreamers, three months, snow globe from wreck) toward a final image of salvage and knowledge that reweights the premise. Closure lands as Conceptual Repricing—"some things survive even drowning"—but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page; Maya wraps the globe and prepares to surface without visible forfeiture or altered tactics. The because/therefore linkage is clean (Maya dives → retrieves globe → summons Katherine → promises delivery), but the final beat lacks the immediate price or narrowed option that would elevate closure impact.</comment>

<comment>The glacier shrine is vividly rendered with purposeful detail: "ancient ice," "candles flickering," "carved over winter months, one careful cut at a time." Spatial choreography is clear (Maya kneels, places globe, ghost drifts toward it) and the shrine functions as a threshold space that enables the summoning. The melted snow globe receives concrete handling across beats (pulled from wreck, placed among offerings, wrapped in cloth) and its warped glass/clouded water charge the final image. The shrine's breathing walls and frost spreading during Katherine's anguish tie environment to pressure, though the effect remains atmospheric rather than constraining a choice.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—to deliver truth and closure to Evelyn—is signaled early and pursued throughout. Pressure accumulates via layered backstory (seventeen dreamers tracked, three months) and the ghost encounter, but there is no on-page reversal or tightening choice that narrows Maya's options. The promise to Evelyn ("Tomorrow, I drive to Halifax") is Maya's stated intent, but the action occurs off-page; no visible cost or trade-off is enacted in scene. Katherine's revelation deepens emotional weight, but Maya's agency at closure is preparation ("wrapped the snow globe," "extinguished the candles") rather than a decision with immediate consequence or foreclosed path.</comment>

<comment>Theme—salvaging love and truth from loss—emerges organically from the snow globe's history, Katherine's pocket memory, and Maya's ritual practice. The final image ("some things survive even drowning") reweights prior material without overt moralizing, and the juxtaposition of "borrowed starlight" returning to "distant stars" offers resonance. However, the thematic answer is delivered via narration in the penultimate paragraph ("She salvaged stories...built windows") rather than fully enacted through the closure beat. The piece avoids banality and sustains complexity (Evelyn's lifelong misbelief, Katherine's guilt), but the ending tilts toward articulation of theme rather than letting the final action alone speak it.</comment>

<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>POV remains stable in close third throughout, and Maya's perceptual signature—wreck-diver attuned to "the drowned," analyst of dreams—colors every observation. Katherine's voice arrives distinctly ("as knowing, settling into Maya's mind like snow"), and the dialogue exchange carries purposeful subtext (Katherine's need to be known, Maya's careful truth-weaving). However, the prose occasionally slips into elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-bound: "borrowed starlight given shape," "pure, cold knowledge," "the familiar ache of such meetings" read as thematic summary rather than Maya's interior idiom under pressure. Free indirect style is mostly clean, but a few lines ("obligately," "cameo appearances") introduce vocabulary that jars against the established voice.</comment>

<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and the prose avoids major loops or scaffold. However, several beats lean toward overwriting: "their whispers rising through the dark water like strings of pearls," "borrowed starlight given shape," "the pure, cold knowledge" stack figurative language without adding clarity or momentum. The phrase "weaves truth as gently as she could" in the dialogue beat mixes metaphor (weaving) with the literal attempt to speak carefully, creating mild incoherence. Information density is generally strong—most lines advance atmosphere or backstory—but the final paragraph's summary ("She salvaged stories from the wreckage, retrieved love from the deep places, built windows") restates theme rather than trusting the enacted moment. No paraphrase loops or template cadence, but the elevated diction in peak beats (ghost's anguish, Maya's reflection) slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>

<comment>The wreck-diver who tracks ghost messages through strangers' dreams offers a fresh synthesis of familiar supernatural tropes, and the glacier shrine as ritual space adds specificity. However, the core emotional arc—discovering a lost mother's love and delivering it to her elderly daughter—follows a well-worn template without transformation. The snow globe as talisman, the ghost's pocket memory, and the nursing-home destination are all predictable moves within the genre. The detail of analyzing seventeen dreamers' "cameo appearances" suggests ingenuity, but the method is told rather than dramatized, and the ritual itself (candles, offerings, summoning) hews closely to stock imagery. The piece executes its premise competently but does not offer a non-obvious turn or emotional calculus that redefines expectations.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Maya appears on every page, drives the ritual, retrieves the globe, summons Katherine, and promises delivery to Evelyn. Her occupation (wreck-diver) and attribute (listening to the drowned, tracking dreamers) frame all choices. She initiates the summoning, conducts the dialogue, and makes the final decision to drive to Halifax. However, the peak choice—promising to deliver the globe and truth—is stated intent rather than an enacted turn with immediate cost or foreclosed option on the page. The final beat is preparation (wrapping, extinguishing candles) rather than a moment where Maya's agency alters tactics or outcome in scene.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The melted snow globe is introduced in the opening paragraph, handled concretely (placed among offerings, ghost reaching toward it), and reappears in the final beat (wrapped in cloth). Its history (Katherine's pocket, lighthouse listing at impossible angle, clouded water) carries symbolic weight and the object enables the ghost's story. Katherine identifies it as the key talisman ("I bought this for her in Halifax") and the promise to deliver it drives Maya's next action. However, the globe itself does not constrain a mid-scene choice or alter Maya's tactics; it functions as narrative anchor and symbolic carrier rather than an object whose physical properties shape outcomes.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>5.2</grade>
<comment>The "windows of connection" concept is stated explicitly ("Here, windows of connection opened between the living and the lost") and the shrine functions as that threshold. The ritual Maya performs is predicated on creating such a window, and Katherine's appearance validates the concept. However, the mechanics are told rather than dramatized—we learn the boundaries thin "here" but never see Maya struggle with maintaining the connection or face a cost tied to opening/closing the window. The concept frames the story but does not constrain choices or generate friction; it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than active stake.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>Maya "weaves truth as gently as she could" when telling Katherine about Evelyn, demonstrating the attribute in action. The dialogue beat where she reveals Evelyn's lifelong misbelief ("She spent her life wondering if you'd abandoned her") shows care in delivery and the trait is signaled earlier ("carved shrines...track dreams...build windows"). However, the careful weaving does not create visible friction or cost in scene—Katherine receives the truth without resistance, and Maya's method is successful without trade-off. The trait colors voice and approach but does not constrain or enable a peak choice with felt consequence.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>6.1</grade>
<comment>"Expose" is stated as tonight's goal in the opening beat ("Tonight, she would expose the truth they'd been trying to tell her") and the ritual enacts it: Maya summons Katherine, learns the truth (pocket memory, love for daughter), and commits to delivering it to Evelyn. The action drives the central turn—moving from mystery (cameo woman in dreams) to revelation (Katherine's identity and message). However, the "expose" itself occurs via dialogue and narration rather than a dramatized confrontation or choice under pressure; Maya succeeds without obstacle, and the truth is given rather than extracted at cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>4.8</grade>
<comment>The method is signaled early ("pieced together from years of listening," "tracked seventeen such dreamers over three months, analyzing the cameo appearances") and establishes Maya's expertise. It provides backstory credibility for why she can identify Katherine. However, the mechanics are entirely told—we never see Maya analyze a dream, confront a dreamer, or wrestle with interpretation. The method is complete before the story opens, functioning as résumé rather than active process. It does not shape the on-page ritual or generate friction; the summoning itself relies on the shrine and offerings, not dream analysis.</comment>

<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>The shrine is introduced immediately and described with concrete detail: "candles flickering against walls of ancient ice," "carved over winter months, one careful cut at a time," "breathing" walls, frost spreading during Katherine's anguish. It provides spatial anchor for the entire scene and functions as the threshold where the ghost appears. The shrine enables the ritual and charges the final image (Maya extinguishing candles, leaving "darkness and ice"). The environment's cold and isolation reinforce tone, and the detail of Maya carving it herself adds character depth. However, the shrine does not constrain Maya's choices or create friction—it functions as enabling space rather than obstacle.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Maya's motivation—"salvaged stories from the wreckage, retrieved love from the deep places"—is stated explicitly and demonstrated through her years-long practice (tracking dreamers, carving shrines, diving to wrecks). The desire to deliver the snow globe and truth to Evelyn frames the central choice. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized in friction: Maya pursues the goal without internal conflict, doubt, or competing desire on the page. The "familiar ache of such meetings" gestures toward cost, but the emotion is summarized rather than embodied. The motivation drives action but lacks the contradictory pull or visible sacrifice that would demonstrate high integration.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>"Borrowed starlight" appears as the descriptor for Katherine's form ("borrowed starlight given shape") and recurs at her dissolution ("dissolving into borrowed light returning to distant stars"). The tone—elegiac, cold, luminous—is consistent throughout: glacier ice, candles, whispers like pearls, frost spreading. It modulates subtly with pressure (Katherine's anguish intensifies the cold imagery) and charges the final image (darkness, ice, "pure, cold knowledge"). However, the phrase itself functions primarily as atmospheric metaphor rather than a constraint or active force; it colors perception but does not alter Maya's choices or tactics in scene.</comment>
