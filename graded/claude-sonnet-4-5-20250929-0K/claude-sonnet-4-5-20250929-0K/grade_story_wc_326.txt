<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and embodied through the heartbeat-counting tic, which modulates with pressure. Her guilt and pursuit of understanding drive clear choices (spilling ink, running pattern recognition). However, the final epiphany—"Her error wasn't the calculation"—arrives too cleanly without the contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in the closure beat; the realization feels more like a gift than a choice with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of fragmentation-to-assembly through corrupted files, spilled ink, and scattered porcelain that coheres at closure. Orientation anchors cleanly by ~100 words (Mira, observatory, post-death-certificate error). One meaningful deepening occurs when the ink patterns unlock Chen's files, revealing his intentional choice and reweighting Mira's guilt. Cost is legible: she accepts brokenness without repair. The Resonant Reconfiguration (reinterpretation replaces repair) lands on the page, though the final paragraph edges toward thematic summary rather than pure image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The observatory under snow provides strong atmosphere and is integrated into action (climbing steps, warmth inside, snow dampening sound to "cathedral silence"). The porcelain shard, inkwell, and desk function as micro-setting that constrains the recovery method. Sensory detail is selective and mood-appropriate. The opalescent dome and dawn light charge the final image. Minor slip: "ancient servers" and "three monitors" lack the specificity that would make the technical environment as vivid as the snowscape.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (understanding Chen's final work and her role in his death) is signaled early and pursued through the night. One meaningful tightening: the ink-pattern method unlocks files and reveals Chen's intentional choice, narrowing Mira's emotional options from guilt to acceptance. Agency is present in the deliberate spilling of ink and the interpretive choice to reframe brokenness. Cost is felt in the renunciation of repair and forgiveness. No requirement for antagonist at this length; pressure accumulates through the night's effort and the revelation's reweighting of prior belief.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Theme (wisdom from scattered fragments, reinterpretation over repair) emerges organically from the ink patterns, corrupted data, and porcelain shard. The final image of the shard "whole in its brokenness" carries thematic weight. However, the last paragraph becomes over-explicit: "Some things don't need repair, they need reinterpretation" and "wisdom gleamed clear" state the theme rather than trust the image to hold it. The piece would score higher if it stopped one sentence earlier, letting the porcelain and dawn carry the resonance without the summary.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and tightly filtered through Mira's perception. Diction is controlled and voice-consistent; the heartbeat-counting tic and Chen's remembered aphorisms anchor her interior texture. No head-hopping. Psychic distance is managed cleanly. One small register slip: "defragmentation algorithm" and "pattern-recognition software" feel slightly elevated for the exhausted, grief-driven mindset at 3 a.m., though they remain plausible given her role as assistant. Compression under stress is handled well (the counting quiets by dawn).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is mostly clean with strong rhythm and clarity. Information density is high; beats do multiple jobs (e.g., "one-two-three" as heartbeat, survival proof, and obsessive marker). However, minor scaffold appears: "The digital ghost had spoken, not through supernatural means, but through the patience of pattern" over-explains what the prior scene already dramatized. The phrase "midnight solace" appears in the final paragraph as thematic summary rather than earned image. Figurative language is controlled except for one mixed moment: "fetching wisdom" and "emerging data" feel slightly ornamental rather than pressure-driven.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of grief-recovery, data-recovery, and chaos-pattern-recognition offers a non-obvious angle. The ink-spill method and porcelain-as-talisman transform familiar elements into something specific. However, the "legally dead for six hours due to software error" premise feels more high-concept than integrated; it frames Mira's counting but doesn't constrain her midnight choices. The emotional arc (guilt → acceptance of brokenness) follows a recognizable template, elevated by the technical and sensory specificity but not fully transformed. Risk-taking is present in the accumulative structure and the quiet ending, which heighten coherence without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira (death certificate error survivor) drives all key choices: climbing to the observatory, choosing the ink method, interpreting the files, and reframing her guilt. The attribute appears early and shapes her internal pressure throughout. Her final stillness (no longer counting) is the closure moment. Scores in the 6.5–7.0 range because while she makes decisions across beats, the final turn is more realization than a choice that forecloses a path with visible tradeoff; the cost is acceptance rather than a sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The porcelain shard appears in beat one (placed on desk), beat two (ink pools around it), and closure (catches lamplight, "whole in its brokenness"). It is handled, used as part of the ink-pattern setup, and returns with reweighted meaning. The shard is irreplaceable: its brokenness from Chen's death night directly charges the theme. Scores high because it participates in the method, recurs with purpose, and anchors the final image. Does not reach 8.5+ because it does not constrain a choice; Mira could have used another object for the ink pattern.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Digital ghost" is present as Chen's corrupted research and shapes the central stake (recovering his final work). It enables the ink-pattern solution and the revelation that reweights Mira's guilt. However, the term itself appears only once as a thematic label rather than as a mechanic that alters tactics; the actual pressure comes from corrupted files and pattern-recognition software. The concept frames the story but is functionally equivalent to "lost data" or "corrupted research." Scores mid-band because it shapes one key turn (the file recovery) but is somewhat replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Counts heartbeats constantly" appears in the opening beat, recurs throughout the night as a persistence marker, and resolves in closure when "her fingers stilled against her ribs." The trait is embodied and constrains her attention under stress. However, it does not enable or prevent a key action; it is a character marker and thematic anchor (proof of life) rather than a tactical constraint. Scores in the 6.0–6.5 range because it is present across beats and charged at closure, but it does not force a tradeoff or narrow options.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Defragment" is mentioned as a failed prior method ("every defragmentation algorithm") but the actual recovery happens through the ink-pattern method, not defragmentation. The term appears once, does not drive the major turn, and is easily swappable with "data recovery" or "file repair." The chaos-theory pattern-recognition is what actually unlocks the files. Scores low-mid because it is present but functionally ornamental; removing "defragmentation" would not change the story's logic or closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Ephemeral patterns in spilled ink" is signaled in beat two, executed across the night (spilling ink repeatedly, photographing, mapping), and shapes the method that unlocks Chen's files. The mechanics matter: organic fractals become a map, ink pooling around the shard creates correlations the software can trace. The method is irreplaceable; swapping it would require restructuring the middle and closure. Scores high because it drives multiple beats, constrains the recovery process, and is causally necessary. Does not reach 8.5+ because the final image (porcelain and dawn) does not directly reprise the ink.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The opal observatory under snow anchors the opening, provides warmth/cold contrast, supplies the servers and software, and charges the final image with "opalescent dawn breaking over snow." The setting constrains choice: the corrupted servers and Chen's software are located there, and the isolation enables Mira's night-long effort. Snow dampens sound to "cathedral silence," heightening the solace. Scores in the 7.0–7.5 range because the setting is essential across beats and charges closure, but the opal/pearl imagery is more atmospheric than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After the radio static clears" appears once as a metaphorical frame (guilt as static, silence as clarity) but does not function as an on-page timeframe. The actual time pressure is "by dawn" and "through the night," which are present and shape the closure moment. The phrase itself is Chen's aphorism about cosmic background radiation, reinterpreted by Mira. Scores low-mid because it is thematically present and tied to closure understanding, but it does not tighten decisions or track elapsed time; it is a conceptual marker rather than a temporal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To fetch wisdom from failure" is stated early, dramatized through Mira's night-long effort to recover Chen's files, and resolved in the realization that reinterpretation replaces repair. The desire drives all middle beats (ink-spilling, pattern-mapping) and the closure acceptance. Friction is present: she will "never forgive herself" but seeks understanding anyway. The motivation is visible in choices and costs (exhaustion, tears, the renunciation of repair). Scores high because it is dramatized across beats with friction and shapes closure, though the final paragraph summarizes the wisdom rather than fully trusting the image.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Midnight solace" is coherent through turns: cold opening, warmth inside, cathedral silence, and peaceful acceptance by dawn. Tone modulates with pressure (urgency when files highlight, tears at the revelation, stillness at closure). The phrase itself appears in the final paragraph, which risks summary, but the tone is established early and charges the final image (opalescent dawn, porcelain catching lamplight). Scores in the 7.0–7.5 range because tone is consistent and purposeful, elevating the quiet ending, though the explicit mention of "midnight solace" in the last paragraph is less effective than the sensory work that precedes it.</comment>
