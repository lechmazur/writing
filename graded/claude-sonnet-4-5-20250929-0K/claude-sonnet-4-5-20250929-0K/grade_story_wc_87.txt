<question>1</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Marina's contradictory impulses—wanting to guide again while fearing further failure—operate simultaneously in the launch scene when she both dismisses Amy and begins calculating the weather window. The progression from counting utility poles (a broken navigator's crude substitute) to "I'll use everything" earns the shift through prior causality. Minor slip: Amy's recognition of Marina's need feels slightly ahead of what the scene dramatizes, though the core motivation remains coherent. The final choice forecloses Marina's three-year retreat with visible cost (accepting vulnerability) scaled appropriately for this length.</comment>

<comment>The piece operates under a Causal lens: Marina's avoidance → Amy's request → Marina's refusal → Amy's shared vulnerability → Marina's weather calculation → the launch decision form a clear because/therefore chain. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Marina adjusts course "five degrees, felt the rightness of it in her bones" while paddling into open water—the final image crystallizes her shift from navigating away from mistakes to through them, with the vanishing utility poles marking the cost of leaving safety systems behind. Orientation anchors cleanly in the opening paragraph. One meaningful tightening (Marina surprising herself with "within the hour") narrows options under pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The coastal setting and compass constrain Marina's key choice: she clips the compass to her vest and checks it on the water, while the utility poles (her safety crutch) vanish as she commits. The dawn colors, swells, and wind angle are filtered through Marina's navigator priorities rather than tourist description. Spatial choreography remains clear across the launch sequence. The kayak launch functions as micro-setting that forces the decision into physical consequence. Strong enough to enter the 7-band but lacks the irreplaceability of environment at closure that would push toward 8+.</comment>

<question>4</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>Dominant stake (Marina regaining trust in her navigation) signals early and tightens when Amy names the Mariner's Quest incident, forcing Marina to choose between continued retreat or vulnerable re-engagement. The weather deadline ("within the hour") and Amy's parallel fear create authentic pressure. One meaningful reversal: Marina's refusal turns to acceptance when she recognizes Amy's need mirrors her own. The final course adjustment carries visible cost—Marina must trust her judgment again with someone's safety at stake. Escalation is protagonist-driven and the price (risking catastrophic failure again) is unmistakable on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>Theme (moving forward through brokenness rather than away from it) emerges from the compass/utility-poles opposition and the shared grief between Marina and Amy without direct statement. The "merrily melancholic" quality and "simultaneously heavy with grief and impossibly light" line earn their complexity through Marina's preparation routines and Amy's dual terror. The final image—adjusting course by bone-deep feeling while the poles vanish—offers a non-literal answer to whether broken systems can be trusted again. Minor slip: "two broken people choosing to trust each other" edges toward summary, though the particulars (compass warm against chest, rightness in bones) anchor it.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>POV remains stable in Marina's focalization with clean psychic distance. Perceptual signature is navigator-specific: she reads weather, counts poles, calculates launch windows. The voice modulates appropriately under pressure—compressed syntax during the refusal beat, expanding into lyric rhythm at the ending. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven: Amy's "I didn't get it. Or maybe I did and deleted it" carries subtext and advances plot efficiently. Free indirect style is clean throughout. The phrase "flickering faith in a universe that made sense" risks slight over-articulation but reads as Marina's professional assessment rather than authorial intrusion.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies purposefully and information density is high—most lines advance character, stakes, or atmosphere. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve effectively. Two minor artifacts lower the score: "backlash of regrets hit Marina like it always did—sudden, breathtaking—phantom guilt" uses a predictable metaphor structure in a peak beat (−0.3), and "merrily plotting their course while joking with the captain, melancholic already" stacks modifiers that slightly blur rather than sharpen (−0.2). Sentence openings vary and no paraphrase loops appear. The "poles seventeen/twenty-three" detail and "weathered wood and sagging wire" show strong specificity without ornament.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>The dual broken-navigator structure (Marina's professional failure, Amy's preventable loss) transforms the redemption-arc template through specific occupational detail and the utility-poles method. The astronomical compass as heirloom rather than pure tool adds a fresh angle. However, the "two damaged people heal by helping each other" frame remains recognizable, and the turn hinges on a somewhat familiar recognition beat. The weather deadline and multi-system navigation ("Stars, currents, poles, gut feeling") provide enough specific transformation to avoid mid-band, but the core emotional arc could transfer to other mentor/protégé contexts with moderate edits. Risk-taking is moderate rather than bold.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Marina appears in setup (opening paragraph), makes the pivotal middle choice (accepting the crossing despite fear), and drives the ending action (course adjustment). Her navigator identity is causally essential—the story fails without her specific professional failure and recovery. Three distinct beats show her agency: initial refusal, weather calculation that surprises her, final course correction. The closure image (adjusting five degrees, feeling rightness) is irreplaceable to her arc.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The compass appears in paragraph one (setup), Amy handles it mid-scene prompting Marina's reflection, and Marina checks it on the water while paddling. Three distinct touches across the arc. It enables Marina's return to navigation ("I'll use everything") and is present in the closure beat ("compass was warm against her chest"). However, its function could be partially fulfilled by another navigational tool; the emotional heirloom weight does most of the work rather than unique mechanical properties.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The backlash/regret concept shapes Marina's initial refusal and her three-year avoidance, creating the dominant stake. It appears in setup ("backlash of regrets hit Marina") and constrains her middle choice (fear of repeating the Mariner's Quest disaster). The ending reconfigures it: she navigates "not away from her mistakes but through them." However, the backlash itself is more context than active pressure in the final beats—the weather and Amy's need provide the immediate forces. Two gates clearly met, participation in closure is thematic rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>5.9</grade>
<comment>"Merrily melancholic" appears twice: once as past-tense label ("merrily plotting... melancholic already") and once describing the launch morning ("merrily melancholic in the way of all beginnings that acknowledge endings"). The attribute colors tone but does not constrain a specific action with visible cost—Marina's choices trace to fear and duty rather than this mood. Setup and payoff present, but middle development as action-constraint is absent. The trait enriches atmosphere without altering tactics.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>5.4</grade>
<comment>"Gravitate" appears once when Amy's kayak gravitates toward Marina's during the paddle. The word choice is apt but the action itself (staying close during a crossing) would occur regardless of verb. Early signal is absent; it appears only in the final third. The physical movement supports closure's trust theme but the turn (Marina accepting the crossing) does not trace to this specific action. Functional within its beat but replaceable with "moved toward" or "matched" with negligible structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>6.3</grade>
<comment>Utility-pole navigation is seeded early ("pole seventeen meant turn back") as Marina's post-trauma crutch, contrasts with her former star-navigation competence (middle development through memory), and vanishes in the final image ("The utility poles grew smaller, then vanished") marking her departure from safe systems. The method itself does not constrain a water-based choice, but the lyric reprise reweights her shift from rigid counting to integrative judgment. Two-gate participation (setup and closure) with thematic rather than tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>The coastal launch site is established in paragraph one (setup), provides the immediate physical arena for the central confrontation with Amy, and is the departure point whose leaving ("shore was falling behind") marks commitment in the ending. The setting supplies the weather pressure that tightens Marina's decision window. However, the launch could be replaced by another coastal embarkation point without major structural change—the setting type matters more than this specific location's unique features. Strong participation across all three gates but moderate irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The three-year timeframe since the Mariner's Quest disaster is established early and creates the credibility gap Marina must overcome. The weather turning "this afternoon" tightens the launch decision to "within the hour," raising immediate stakes. Both past collapse and present deadline shape Marina's calculations. However, the hour-window itself does not visibly compress later choices on the water—the urgency is mostly used to force the initial commitment. Two strong gates (setup, middle pressure) but muted presence in closure tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The motivation to align heart and action is dramatized in Marina's contradictory state: her hands "remembering routines she thought she'd forgotten" and her surprise at her own acceptance show the friction between withdrawal and capability. Amy explicitly names this as her own need ("what if I'm like her?"), creating parallel pressure. The final image—Marina trusting "more than one system" and paddling "through" mistakes rather than away—enacts the alignment with visible cost (leaving the pole-counting safety behind). Three gates met; the closure choice is inseparable from this exact motive.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>Flickering-faith tone appears in Amy's voice quality and in the ending's "didn't know if this would heal anything" uncertainty. The mood modulates from Marina's defeated opening through cautious preparation to the tentative hope of "kept paddling into whatever came next." However, "flickering" as a specific tonal signature is more asserted than embodied—the text shows doubt and fragile commitment but does not make the flicker-pattern itself structurally legible. The tone supports closure without uniquely charging it; a steady melancholy or quiet determination would function similarly. Two gates; moderate payoff.</comment>
