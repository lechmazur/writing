<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's root-bound visionary trait is established early and her scar-linking choice at the climax demonstrates agency, but interiority relies heavily on abstract metaphor ("dreams grew so dense and tangled") rather than embodied contradiction. The pairing with Marcus feels functional but their relationship pressure is told more than dramatized—we're assured they've "been seeking this intersection for years" without on-page friction testing that bond. The "anxious elation" emotion is declared rather than shown through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously, and the closure choice (merging consciousness) arrives without visible cost or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: metaphoric density increases toward a final image of shared growth. Orientation anchors (who, where, when) land clearly within the first paragraph. The closure offers a Resonant Reconfiguration (merged consciousness replacing separate visions), but cost remains abstract—"crumbled" topiary and "dissolved" order feel symbolic rather than felt. The "future arrived three weeks ahead" premise sets a ticking constraint, yet no tactics shift under that pressure; the characters proceed as if time were elastic, weakening escalation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The cobalt glade's spiraling grass and bruised-purple dusk establish vivid atmosphere, and the setting's "responsive pulse" to merged consciousness shows environmental reaction. However, the glade functions primarily as backdrop—no spatial choice is constrained by proximity, access, or terrain. The topiary clipping and mirror shard are handled objects but don't impose physical limits on action. Micro-setting (scars, hands) appears but doesn't alter tactics at the pivotal beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the intersection of their complementary visions—is signaled early. One meaningful turn occurs when they link palms, merging scattered breadth with root-bound depth, but this resolution feels delivered rather than earned through protagonist struggle. The "eclipsed covenant" complication is introduced but never tested; the characters don't attempt and fail under the broken agreement. Coincidence that "the future arrived three weeks ahead" sets the premise but doesn't visibly narrow options or force a trade-off at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Theme of complementary limitation is coherent but arrives through direct statement: "their limitations had always been complementary." The topiary-to-soil transformation and rising shared dream offer symbolic closure, yet the final image leans on abstraction ("single, purposefully curious force") rather than concrete particulars that reweight prior material. "We can write a new agreement" borders on thematic echo, articulating the premise rather than embodying it. No plausible counter-reading or moral ambiguity complicates the tidy union.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV through Mira remains stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is present in the metaphoric diction ("root-bound," "scattered like dandelion seeds"), though register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("recursive patterns," "convergence") that feels more authorial than character-rooted. Marcus's brief dialogue ("Link with me") pursues a goal but lacks subtext or distinct idiom. Free indirect style is clean, and psychic distance narrows appropriately during the climactic merge.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and several images are vivid ("bruised purples," "fertile soil"), but metaphoric density crowds the final beat without clear causal linkage—"cobalt glade pulsed," "grass spiraled tighter," "shared dream, rising" stack symbolic gestures. Minor paraphrase loop: "time to prepare, time to understand, time to find" recycles structure without added detail. No severe template cadence, but "anxious elation" is named twice without embodiment. Information density is moderate; some lines do double work, others ("the emotion felt wrong and right simultaneously") restate rather than advance.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The "root-bound vs. scattered visionary" pairing offers a clear conceptual contrast, but the resolution—merging via scar-linking—feels like a template synthesis (opposites unite through trauma) rather than a transformation grounded in lived detail or non-obvious cost. The "eclipsed covenant" and cobalt glade provide genre-fantasy texture but remain ornamental; the core emotional arc (finding intersection) could function unchanged in a contemporary therapy-office setting. No bold structural risk or close attention to world logic elevates the premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mira (root-bound visionary) is present throughout and her decision to press the topiary clipping to her scar and link with Marcus drives the climactic merge. Setup and closure gates are met. However, the trait "root-bound" functions primarily as metaphor and thematic label; it doesn't constrain a tactic or force a visible trade-off. The story would function nearly unchanged if she were labeled differently. Mid-band functional presence without irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The maze topiary clipping appears in beat one (Mira clutches it) and returns at the climax (pressed between palms, crumbles into soil). Setup and payoff gates met. Its "geometric precision" vs. "fertile soil" transformation supports the theme of order dissolving into growth, but the clipping is not handled in a second distinct beat before the climax, and its specific properties (maze-shaped, from "the old estate") don't alter any choice. Swappable with any ordered/rigid object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The eclipsed covenant (ancient agreement between seers and timeline) is introduced in paragraph three and mentioned again at the climax ("We can write a new agreement"). Setup and closure gates met. However, it functions as thematic backdrop rather than plot driver—no on-page tactic shifts because the covenant broke, and the characters' plan (linking through scars) was evidently theorized "for months," independent of the eclipse. The concept frames atmosphere but doesn't change options.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Purposefully curious" appears twice: once describing Mira's stance in the glade and once in the final line ("a single, purposefully curious force"). Setup and closure gates met, but the attribute is label-only—no choice is enabled or constrained by curiosity, and no cost attaches to it. Removing the phrase would not alter any beat. Ornamental thematic tag.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Heed" appears in Mira's line: "We have to heed what's happening now, not what we saw before." It signals a thematic pivot (attend to present vs. prior visions) and the climactic merge enacts that shift. Setup and closure gates met. However, "heed" could be swapped for "respond to," "face," or "act on" without structural change; the action is generic rather than unique. Functional but replaceable within its thematic role.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Linking through scars" is theorized in dialogue ("trauma held memory…pain could become a navigation system") and enacted at the climax when Mira and Marcus press scarred palms together, triggering the vision merge. Setup, development (the theory is present mid-story), and payoff gates all met. The method is specific and its execution (topiary crushed between palms, "jolt of connection") drives the final turn. A stronger causal constraint (e.g., failed attempts or visible cost) would push higher, but the method is indispensable to the ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The cobalt glade at dusk is anchored in the opening line and returns at closure ("pulsed around them," "grass spiraled tighter"). Setup and payoff gates met. The setting provides vivid atmosphere and "responds" to the merge, but no choice is constrained by spatial layout, proximity, or resource. The glade could be replaced by any evocative, unnatural landscape without altering tactics. Postcard function with thematic resonance but no plot pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.4</grade><comment>"The future arrived three weeks ahead of schedule" opens the story and frames urgency, but no on-page decision or tactic shifts under time pressure. The characters theorize, meet, and merge without a visible clock narrowing options. The timeframe is present in setup but absent in development and closure—it sets mood rather than driving escalation. Functional framing device, swappable with any "too soon" phrasing.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira's desire "to find where her dreams intersected with everyone else's waking world" (and specifically Marcus's visions) is stated early and the climactic palm-link enacts that search. Setup and closure gates met. The motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting micro-choices, and no visible cost (e.g., sacrificed alternative, relational friction) tests the desire on the page. The friction between "root-bound depth" and Marcus's "scattered breadth" is conceptual, not embodied in resisted impulses during the merge.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Anxious elation" is named twice: once when Mira reacts to the broken covenant ("the emotion felt wrong and right simultaneously, terror and joy braided together") and again when Marcus whispers at the climax ("the same anxious elation that thrummed through her veins"). Setup and closure gates met. However, the tone is declared via label rather than embodied through contradictory sensory or syntactic cues, and it remains static—no modulation under pressure. The braided metaphor gestures at complexity but doesn't charge the final image with felt ambivalence.</comment>
