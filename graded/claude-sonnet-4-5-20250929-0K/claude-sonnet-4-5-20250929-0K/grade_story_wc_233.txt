<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The queen's interior journey from disenchantment to self-witness is legible, with embodied emotion in the cold-burn starlight and synchronized breathing. However, key moments lean on label-speak ("disenchanted," "calcified heart," "capable of wonder") rather than fully dramatized contradictions. The final decision to descend carrying starlight "like a wound that might, finally, teach her how to heal" reads as therapeutic summary rather than a choice with visible on-page cost that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the grotto encounter accumulates self-reflection through bleeding starlight, fireflies, and mirrored images, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (the queen's stance shift from commanding disbelief to terrified self-awareness). Orientation anchors (queen, ridge, grotto) land by ~150 words. The closure unit—her carrying the starlight wound downward—reconfigures her prior hardness, though the cost (what she forecloses, what tactics change) remains more asserted than dramatized in a specific choice or renunciation on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt grotto is vividly rendered with bleeding starlight, phosphorescent trails, and the abyss; sensory detail (copper air, cold burn, geological breath) is purposeful and POV-filtered. The grotto constrains the queen's movement (she follows trails, stands at a drop) and charges the final image (she carries starlight down). Spatial choreography is coherent throughout, and the impossible fireflies at altitude anchor the turning point.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—why the dreams claw at her sleep, what the grotto offers—is signaled early and coheres. Pressure accumulates through escalating self-confrontation (father's face, poisoning, calcified heart) until the grotto's pronouncement forces a stance shift. However, the queen's agency at closure is primarily receptive (witnessing, understanding) rather than a decision or renunciation that forecloses a live path with on-page cost; the descent is framed as potential healing, not a trade-off or visible price paid in the moment.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—self-witness as precondition for reclaiming feeling—emerges from concrete images (bleeding starlight, younger reflection, fireflies as reversed stars) without overt thesis statements. The grotto's declaration ("you needed to climb beyond your kingdom... to remember what you have become") teeters near prompt-echo but is integrated as the climactic realization rather than a detached moral. The final image of carrying starlight "like a wound that might... teach her how to heal" offers resonance, though "teach her how to heal" edges toward therapeutic abstraction rather than a non-literal answer grounded in prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Voice is controlled and distinct: elevated diction ("lacy with menace," "mountains dreaming," "geological time") matches the queen's regal remove, and psychic distance tightens appropriately during the grotto encounter. The grotto's anthropomorphized speech ("I am only what you summoned") maintains tonal consistency. Elision of the actual climb and the month of dreams is purposeful, compressing transit to focus on the confrontation. No head-hopping; focalization remains stable.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully (short declaratives at key beats: "Inside, the walls wept light"), and figurative language is vivid ("starlight that dripped... in rivulets," "fireflies... like reversed stars"). However, several phrases lean on stock constructions: "bleeding starlight" recurs without evolving mechanics, "calcified heart" is metaphor-label without embodied specificity, and "lacy with menace" (oracle and grotto both) is repeated without transformation. The final line's "wound that might, finally, teach her how to heal" stacks modifiers and reads as therapeutic wish rather than concrete image, dulling closure propulsion slightly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—queen climbs to confront recurring dreams in a mystical grotto—is familiar fairy-tale terrain. Specific inflections (bleeding starlight as tangible memory, fireflies as moral inventory, the grotto as mirror rather than oracle) add texture, but the emotional arc (hardened ruler rediscovers feeling through supernatural confrontation) follows a well-worn template. The story commits fully to its lyric mode and avoids hedging, yet the central turn (self-recognition leading to potential healing) resolves predictably without a non-obvious moral calculus or structural risk that heightens stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The queen's choices drive all major beats: she dismisses the oracle's warning, climbs alone, reaches into starlight, moves deeper, asks the grotto a question, and decides to descend carrying the wound. Setup is immediate (title, opening line). Development: her reaching into starlight and moving deeper are active choices that narrow options. Payoff: the descent is framed as a choice to carry the wound, though it reads more as acceptance than a decision with visible cost. The trait "disenchanted" is named but her agency—commanding her fingers, imposing will—demonstrates it in action across beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ember grotto is seeded in the opening dream, named by the oracle as "cobalt grotto" (a shift that slightly muddles the motif), and is the story's spatial anchor and closure site. It appears in at least four beats: dreams, oracle's warning, entrance, interior confrontation, and final departure. The grotto's mechanics (bleeding starlight, voices, fireflies) actively constrain and enable the queen's journey. However, the "ember" descriptor from the dream never coheres with "cobalt" on the page, reducing irreplaceability slightly; a single consistent name and color would tighten the motif's charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Bleeding starlight is seeded in the opening dreams, literalized in the grotto (dripping down walls, touching her skin with cold burn, leaving trails of sensation), and carried internally at closure ("carrying the bleeding starlight inside her like a wound"). It shapes the queen's tactics (she reaches out, follows trails) and charges the final image. However, its mechanics remain somewhat ornamental: the starlight is described vividly but does not narrow or redefine options in a way that a different mystical substance could not. The concept is present across setup, development, and payoff, but its specificity (why bleeding, why starlight) does not alter the story's logic as decisively as required for higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The attribute "softly commanding" appears once in action: "softly commanding her own trembling fingers to steady" when she reaches toward starlight. This moment demonstrates the trait and ties to her regal discipline under pressure, but it does not recur or constrain a second beat. The queen's commanding nature is implied throughout (she dismisses warnings, climbs alone, interrogates the grotto), yet the specific adverbial phrase "softly commanding" is used decoratively in one line without altering tactics or incurring visible cost. Label-only beyond the single gesture.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The climb is the story's structuring action: framed in the opening ("she climbed alone"), sustained through the ridge approach and grotto entry, and closed with "the long climb back down." All major turns—leaving the kingdom, reaching the grotto, confronting the reflection, deciding to descend—are predicated on the climb. Removing it collapses the spatial and symbolic journey. The climb is signaled early, drives the middle (each step deeper into the grotto tightens self-confrontation), and the return descent reweights it as a choice to carry the wound back to her kingdom.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The shared exhale and fireflies appear only in the grotto's central beat: "she felt an answering breath leave her own lungs, involuntary and synchronized. In that shared exhale, she spotted them: fireflies, the first of summer, impossible at this altitude." This moment triggers the memory-images (father, poisoning, calcified heart) that constitute the story's emotional climax. Setup is absent (no prior signal of breath or fireflies in dreams). Development: the synchrony and impossibility create the pivot. Payoff: the fireflies "descend back into the darkness," but they do not reappear or constrain the final choice. Present in one key beat with causal force, but without early seed or closure reprise, capping eligibility near mid-6s per lyric-resonance allowance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The cobalt grotto above clouds is seeded in the opening dreams, located by the oracle's warning, and serves as the story's sole setting for all confrontation beats. The grotto's features—bleeding starlight, phosphorescent trails, the abyss, impossible fireflies—pressure every choice: the queen follows trails, stands at a drop, sees her reflection in starlight, and carries the wound as she leaves. Its altitude ("above the world," "above the clouds") isolates her from the kingdom and court, forcing solitary reckoning. The setting is indispensable; removing it removes the story's logic and closure site.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Timeframe is signaled: "after the final warning" (title and oracle scene "three days ago"), and "every night for a month" of dreams. However, the clock does not tighten tactics on the page. The climb and grotto encounter unfold in a single continuous present without urgency or countdown pressure. The "final warning" sets up the queen's defiance but does not impose a ticking constraint during the confrontation. Time is tracked but does not alter moves or narrow options within the scene, placing it in functional mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The motivation—to unravel the mystery of recurring dreams—is named in the opening and drives the climb ("driven only by the dreams that clawed at her sleep"). The grotto confrontation delivers the answer: the dreams exist "because you needed to climb beyond your kingdom... to remember what you have become." This motivation is setup early, contested implicitly (she dismisses prophecy, yet the dreams compel her), and resolved at closure. However, the unraveling is delivered by the grotto rather than earned through the queen's active inquiry or choice, reducing friction slightly. The want is clear and causal, but the cost of satisfying it (what she gives up to know) is more implied than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Tone is established in the oracle's "voice lacy with menace" and sustained through "copper and coming thunder," "mouth mid-scream," "mountains dreaming," and the grotto's pronouncement carrying "that same lacy menace." The tone modulates with pressure: regal coldness at the start, wonder and dread in the grotto, terror at the reflection, quiet resolve at closure. "Lacy menace" recurs verbatim (oracle, grotto), charging the callback but also risking label-repetition without evolving the image. The tone coheres across turns and infuses the final descent with charged ambiguity (wound/healing), meeting the high-band test for modulation and closure charge.</comment>
