<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Miren's motivation is clear and her sensitivity to objects is embodied through concrete handling of the tapestry and diaries. However, she remains observational throughout—no internal contradiction or high-stakes choice forces her to weigh competing values. The connection to Catherine reads as discovery rather than dilemma, and the ending smile suggests satisfaction without visible cost or foreclosed path. The work stays in chronicler mode without pressure that would test her commitment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story establishes a clear accumulative lens: Miren collects fragments and the discovery of the Catherine connection deepens the collection's meaning. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by ~80 words). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration—the alignment of tapestry and diary charges the final image—but the cost remains conceptual and oblique; no prior option is visibly foreclosed. The "displaced" humanity and Miren's smile suggest Charged Poise, yet the pressure never crystallizes into a stakes-altering choice on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The silo library is vividly rendered with spiraling shelves, bronze light, and dust motes; sensory detail is selective and atmospheric. The tapestry's dragon claw becomes a tactile anchor that constrains Miren's final gesture (she presses her hand where Catherine did). The setting functions as both archive and sanctuary, and the "reclaimed space" motif charges the ending image. Micro-setting use (the tapestry fragment, the cushion for sorting) supports choices without overwhelming the frame.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—preserving stories that walls have heard—is signaled early and remains consistent. The discovery of the tapestry-diary link tightens meaning but does not narrow options or force a trade-off; Miren simply mounts the tapestry as intended. No reversal tests her resolve, and the ending celebrates success without visible friction. The accumulative lens allows for deepening without causal conflict, yet the lack of a credible loss or complication keeps pressure modest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the collection motif: human stories persist even after the "great displacement" stops dreaming and remembering. The tapestry-diary alignment offers a resonant, non-literal answer—touch across centuries—without moralizing. However, "axis," "displacement," and the post-dream premise remain abstract; the story does not ground them in concrete consequences that constrain Miren's choices. The final image charges prior material, but the thematic frame stays declarative rather than tested.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and the prose carries a distinct, measured texture ("bronze quiet," "sensitively perceptive"). Diction matches Miren's historian sensibility without register drift. No dialogue appears. Perceptual signature is clear: she notices textures, hears whispers in objects, and connects fragments across time. Psychic distance is consistent, and the voice modulates gently with discovery without artificial inflation. Minor reliance on filter verbs ("her fingers… traced," "she cared") is voice-motivated and does not dull immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high in the tapestry and diary beats. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes effectively. Minor scaffold appears: "Every object… spoke if you knew how to listen" and "Every whisper, every witness, every fragment" trend toward list rhythm, and the phrase "always, always worth doing" adds emphasis without new information. The Catherine discovery sequence is propulsive and clear. No loops or figurative muddle touch the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The "library of salvaged things" and "stories walls have heard" premise offers a fresh angle on memory and archival work. The tapestry-diary connection synthesizes historical detail with emotional charge in a way that feels earned. However, the "great displacement" and "axis shifted" framing remain generic post-apocalyptic gestures without specificity; swapping those terms would not alter the core emotional arc. The closing alignment of past and present through touch is resonant but not entirely surprising.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Miren is present throughout and her vocation frames all beats. She makes one key choice—mounting the tapestry beside other fragments—but this is execution of her existing mission rather than a decision under pressure. Her sensitivity enables discovery but does not constrain action or force trade-offs. Observational work dominates; no turn tests her commitment or alters her stance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The tapestry fragment appears early (first third), is handled concretely in the examination beat, and returns at closure when Miren presses her hand to the dragon's claw where Catherine touched it. The object bridges past and present and charges the final image. Its specific detail (dragon's claw, three ravens) matters causally. It shapes two beats (initial acquisition, discovery of the Catherine link) and anchors the ending, though it does not constrain a choice under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Displaced axis" is invoked twice—"after humanity's axis shifted" and "axis of connection… aligned, displaced no longer"—but functions as thematic decoration rather than a constraint on tactics or stakes. The concept does not shape Miren's choices or alter what she can or cannot do. It remains abstract; swapping it for "fracture" or "rupture" would leave the plot intact.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Miren's sensitivity is stated ("sensitively perceptive to textures") and shown when her fingers trace the tapestry and she discerns words through soot. It enables the Catherine discovery but does not constrain her—no trade-off or cost attaches to this perception. The trait is functional in one beat (diary probing) but remains closer to a skill than a pressure point.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Probe" appears explicitly when Miren examines the half-burned diaries, and the careful, investigative method characterizes her entire approach. The discovery of Catherine's story turns on this probing work. However, the action is swappable with "examine" or "sift through" without structural loss. It shapes one key beat (the diary scene) and is implied in the tapestry handling, but does not redefine options at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The half-burned diaries are introduced in the second beat, their charred state creates the puzzle Miren solves, and they supply the Catherine connection that drives the discovery and final mounting. The fireplace origin is specific and causally relevant (someone tried to erase the life). The method matters: without the diaries, the tapestry remains anonymous. Present across setup, middle discovery, and closure participation (added to the collection in the final paragraph).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The reclaimed silo library is anchored early with vivid detail (spiraling shelves, high windows, bronze light) and functions as both workspace and thematic container. The lower level is where donations are sorted, and the spiral stairs carry the tapestry to its final position. The setting enables Miren's work and charges the final image ("here in this reclaimed space"). It does not constrain choices under pressure but provides resources and atmosphere integral to closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the last human dream had been dreamt" is invoked in exposition but never tracked or felt as pressure. No clock tightens Miren's decisions; the story unfolds in "late afternoon" fading to dusk without urgency. The post-displacement setting is atmospheric but does not alter tactics or create a live deadline. Present as backstory, absent as dramatic constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Miren's desire to collect stories walls have heard is declared early and motivates all her actions. The discovery of Catherine's voice deepens this mission and is dramatized through concrete handling of objects. However, the motivation faces no friction or competing pull; Miren's work proceeds without internal conflict or external obstacle. The goal is clear and pursued, but never tested by cost or competing want.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Bronze quiet" appears in the opening and closing paragraphs, establishing a hushed, reverent atmosphere that fits the archival setting. Tone is consistent and modulates gently with discovery (breath catches, smile) without breaking into overt sentiment. However, it remains largely static—one mood maintained rather than charged by pressure. The reprise at closure reweights the quiet as sacred space, but the tonal arc is subtle rather than dynamic.</comment>
