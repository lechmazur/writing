<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is well-embodied through somatic markers (helicopter thrum locks knees, jasmine tightens throat), and her motivations are consistent. The internal contradiction between grief and cultivation creates genuine tension that drives micro-choices throughout. However, the final transplant metaphor feels slightly didactic, and some therapeutic framing ("somatic markers," "the pearl of stillness") borders on over-articulated self-awareness during what should be lived experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The piece establishes an Accumulative/Textural lens early through layered imagery and holds it cleanly to closure. Orientation is prompt (arboretum, Mira, morning routine by paragraph two). The closure—Mira releasing the photograph and returning to seedlings—delivers Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis) with visible cost: she holds grief and hope simultaneously, building "something luminous from what could not be removed." The final image of transplanting seedlings recharges the cultivation motif with undeniable pressure, making the choice to continue meaningful.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The arboretum setting is vivid and purposeful: salt-kissed air, bromeliads, Japanese maple, night-blooming cereus all anchor Mira's work and constrain her daily choices. The seaside cliff and defunct lighthouse operate as thematic mirrors rather than tactical constraints. Spatial choreography is clear throughout (greenhouse, gravel paths, glass conservatory). The setting charges the final image—seedlings waiting for transplant—but doesn't narrow a pivotal choice within the scene itself, keeping it just below the 8.0 threshold.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming survival into cultivation while holding grief—is signaled early and deepens through the pregnant couple's visit, which tests Mira's stance. The night-blooming cereus exchange ("that one night makes everything worthwhile") crystallizes her philosophy under gentle pressure. The piece delivers one meaningful tightening when Mira touches then releases the photograph, a micro-renunciation that forecloses retreat. Cost is visible but quiet: she must continue working among reminders of loss, and the final image of transplanting carries felt weight under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the pearl-of-stillness metaphor, the obsolete lighthouse, and Mira's cultivation practice without overt moralizing. The night-blooming cereus moment offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question: brief beauty justifies long waiting. The pregnant couple's understanding nods at futurity without forcing optimism. The final image—grief and hope held simultaneously, "one careful layer at a time"—reweights survival as active cultivation. Minor deduction for the slightly on-the-nose "holding grief and hope simultaneously" articulation in the penultimate paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited throughout, with perceptual signature clear (Mira notices plants, light qualities, the body's involuntary responses). Diction remains within her lexicon except for minor clinical precision in "somatic markers" and "trauma specialist" framing. The dialogue with the couple is natural and purposeful, carrying subtext about resilience. Rhythmic control is strong, modulating from the morning's "economical and precise" movements to the resonant final paragraph. Brief register lift in "the body's involuntary 記憶" (Japanese character likely accidental) and some therapeutic vocabulary prevent entry to the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Prose is clear and propulsive with strong imagery: "wearing hope like jewelry," "the sky had opened with fire," "the ocean below sang its endless song." Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high. Minor scaffold appears in paired constructions: "She would never stop missing them. The photograph would remain crumpled. Some mornings..." creates a template cadence. The phrase "the pearl of stillness was this" explicitly defines the metaphor rather than trusting the image. No loops or major artifacts, but the explanatory tendency in key beats prevents higher scoring.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The pearl-of-stillness metaphor is freshly rendered and grounds the narrative in Mira's specific perspective. The arboretum-as-recovery frame avoids template grief narratives by making cultivation literal and tactical rather than purely symbolic. The night-blooming cereus detail and the lighthouse's obsolescence transformed into adaptive purpose offer non-obvious inflections. However, the trauma-survivor-finds-healing-through-nature premise is well-trodden, and while execution is strong, the emotional arc follows a predictable trajectory. Specificity and voice elevate it above generic execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's survivor status frames all choices: her morning routine, her deflection of praise, her practice of stillness when somatic markers trigger. Her decision to stop fighting the freeze response and later to release the photograph are key turns. The wedding photo and helicopter references keep the trauma causally active. Present in setup, development (choosing stillness over flight), and closure (releasing the photo, returning to work). Essential but the survival itself is backdrop; her cultivation choices do the heavier lifting.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The photograph appears in four distinct beats: carried in pocket (setup), described in detail (wedding faces), Mira's involuntary responses tied to wedding scents, and the climactic touch-then-release at closure. Its "edges soft from years of handling" signals repeated use, and the final release—"touched the photograph in her pocket, then released it"—delivers visible cost. The object charges the ending by representing what she must hold and let go simultaneously. Strong integration, but slightly short of indispensable since the story could function with another grief token.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The "pearl of stillness" concept is introduced early (paragraph five), explained through oyster/nacre imagery, and directly shapes Mira's on-page tactics: when her body freezes, she stops and waits rather than fighting, coating panic "layer by patient layer." The pregnant couple scene tests this philosophy (one night makes everything worthwhile). Closure explicitly invokes it: "The pearl of stillness was this: holding grief and hope simultaneously." The concept both names and enacts her method, constraining her responses and charging the final image. Slightly over-explained but causally essential.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira's talent is shown through "impossible blooms" and visitors' remarks, and it enables her teaching role with teenagers and her night-blooming cereus arrangement. The "quietly" modifier shapes her deflection of praise and her solitary work style. However, the trait doesn't constrain a pivotal choice—she could be loudly talented or mediocre and the grief-to-cultivation arc would remain intact. Present in setup and development but peripheral to escalation and closure. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Freezing is the central somatic marker: "lock her knees," "make her hands freeze mid-task, shears suspended." Mira's tactical response—choosing to stop and wait rather than fight—defines her pearl-of-stillness method and directly shapes the arc. The freeze recurs in multiple beats (helicopter thrum, jasmine scent, afternoon light) and the final release of the photograph depends on her mastery of this response. Her hands returning to work ("returned to the greenhouse, where seedlings waited") completes the freeze-thaw-cultivation cycle. Removing this action would break the story's logic and thematic closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Somatic markers are introduced early (paragraph three) with specific examples: helicopter thrum, jasmine scent, afternoon light trigger bodily memory. Dr. Reeves explains the mechanism, and Mira's method (the pearl of stillness) is her tactical response to these markers. The markers shape multiple beats and her cultivation practice is the sustained answer to them. Present in setup, development (when she stops and waits), and implicitly at closure (she can now "witness the hummingbird...and feel something like joy"). The method is causally essential, though the clinical framing slightly dilutes organic integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The arboretum is established immediately (paragraph one) and provides Mira's daily work, the specific plants (ferns, orchids, bromeliads, Japanese maple, cereus) she tends, and the physical space for her stillness practice. The seaside cliff and proximity to the defunct lighthouse add thematic weight (obsolescence, adaptation). The greenhouse and conservatory are tactically relevant to her work and the couple's visit. The setting enables her cultivation and charges the final transplant image. Present across all three gates, but the arboretum could be replaced by another garden setting with minor adjustments; it's essential to execution but not uniquely irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe ("after the last lighthouse keeper departed") anchors the setting's obsolescence theme and signals that Mira's arrival postdates the lighthouse's decommissioning by an unspecified interval. However, it doesn't create urgency or constrain present choices—the story could occur at any point post-trauma. The "seventeen years" since the lighthouse's obsolescence is spatial color, not a ticking clock. Present in setup but absent from development and closure. Functional for atmosphere but replaceable without structural impact.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>This motivation is articulated mid-story ("She anchored her optimism in realism now, not fantasy") and demonstrated throughout: she acknowledges ongoing grief ("would never stop missing them") while finding joy in hummingbirds and teaching. The night-blooming cereus exchange dramatizes this balance ("that one night makes everything worthwhile"), and the closure—holding grief and hope simultaneously—is its fullest expression. The motivation shapes her stance at every beat and charges the final image. However, it's slightly tell-heavy; the phrase "anchor optimism in realism" is more thesis than embodied choice, preventing top-band scoring.</comment>
