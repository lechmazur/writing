<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marina's interiority shows concrete embodiment ("tears on her cheeks, that peculiar sensation of joyful sorrow") and her motivation to map silence is rooted in lived isolation. However, the emotional arc relies heavily on summary ("feeling erased, forgotten") rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Theo remains functionally one-note—supportive advisor without internal conflict or visible cost to his labor. The final choice (joining Theo to adjust parameters) lacks a genuine trade-off or foreclosed path; Marina's renunciation of permanence is told rather than dramatized through a micro-choice that alters present options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when promptly. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: Marina's silence-mapping project accumulates density through Theo's program, the harbor audience response, and the final camera click that reweights "nothing captured/everything preserved." Closure is a Conceptual Repricing—the empty camera transforms from tool of loss to method of presence—with felt cost (acceptance of impermanence, "they'll forget by morning"). One meaningful deepening occurs when the crowd emerges, validating her invisible labor. Causality is mostly clean, though Theo's months-long conversion work is compressed into exposition rather than shown as a constraint that shaped earlier tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The harbor setting is vivid and filtered through Marina's visual focus ("waters catching light like scattered diamonds," "profile illuminated by screen-glow and moonlight"). The laptop and motion-capture device function as micro-setting tools that enable the climax. However, the physical choreography of the performance—where speakers are positioned, how the crowd gathers—remains vague, and the harbor itself does not constrain Marina's choices; it serves primarily as atmospheric backdrop. The final camera gesture charges the closure image, lifting the score, but the environment itself remains largely ornamental rather than a tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Marina's desire to be heard/remembered in a world that erases her—is signaled early and coheres throughout. The tightening occurs when Theo reveals the program and the harbor crowd responds, narrowing Marina's isolation and validating her method. The final trade-off ("maybe they'll forget, but right now you exist louder than anyone") carries visible cost: she accepts impermanence as the price of presence. However, escalation is largely external (Theo's reveal, crowd reaction) rather than driven by Marina's agency; she remains reactive until the final parameter adjustment, which arrives too late to charge earlier pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—presence versus permanence, visibility through translation of absence—emerges organically from the empty camera, sign language, and the music-from-silence conversion. The final image ("Nothing captured. Everything preserved.") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in Marina's gesture of clicking the empty shutter and in Theo's patient translation work. However, the piece edges toward thematic statement in lines like "the methodology remained—a way of being seen by those who could not see," which borders on abstract philosophizing rather than letting the particulars speak.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable in close third with Marina as focalizer; no head-hopping. Her perceptual signature—visual focus, sign language as primary mode—is distinct and consistent. Free indirect style is clean ("She had spent so long feeling erased"). However, register drifts upward in several beats ("methodology remained," "transcendent," "disrupt the night with a voice more profound") into elevated diction that exceeds Marina's established lexicon under emotional pressure. Dialogue via sign language is purposeful and goal-driven, though brief. Psychic distance modulates appropriately with emotional intensity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with strong imagery ("luminous harbor," "flowers opening"). However, several paraphrase loops appear: "capturing nothing but the memory" / "not trying to preserve the past" restates the same idea; "feeling erased, forgotten" / "isolated world" / "threatened to erase her" recycles the same concept across beats. Template cadence: "She lifted... She raised... She set down..." in close succession. Stock metaphors: "joyful sorrow," "windows lighting up... like flowers opening." Line-level clarity is good, but density suffers from explanatory scaffolding ("the gift he'd given her—not permanence, but presence") that summarizes rather than trusts the image. These artifacts accumulate to −0.8, and one touches the closure vicinity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—Deaf protagonist translates visual silence into music via technology—offers a fresh angle on accessibility and presence. The empty camera as mapping tool rather than capture device shows specificity. However, the emotional arc (isolation → validation through technology) follows a familiar template: the supportive helper enables the disabled protagonist's breakthrough moment for an awed crowd. Transformation test: the core journey (forgotten artist gains temporary recognition) would survive intact with different medium and disability. The "joyful sorrow" tone and moonlit harbor setting lean toward lyric convention without challenging it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Theo appears early, frames the disruption ("Tonight we disrupt everything"), enables the key turn by revealing the program, and shapes the ending by adjusting parameters with Marina. His decision to spend months converting her drawings drives the climax. However, his agency remains supportive rather than conflicted; he has no visible cost or competing stake. Present in setup, development (program reveal), and payoff (final adjustment). Causal pressure +0.9, closure linkage +0.7, but swappability −0.5 (any patient collaborator with tech skills could fulfill the role). Two-beat involvement +0.9, but no specificity beyond the helper archetype.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The vintage camera appears in the opening line, returns mid-story when Marina frames Theo, and closes the piece with the final click and "Nothing captured. Everything preserved." Three distinct beats: setup (framing the harbor), development (framing Theo), payoff (final gesture reweights the object's meaning from loss-tool to presence-tool). Early signal +0.6, three-beat involvement +1.4, closure linkage +1.2, charged reprise +0.8. However, the camera's emptiness does not constrain Marina's choices in the middle; it functions primarily as thematic motif rather than tactical pressure. Swappability −0.3 (any symbolic placeholder could serve). Strong lyric resonance but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Sign language is signaled early ("signed her companion, Theo") and establishes Marina's Deaf identity as the dominant stake. It shapes one key choice: her visual mode of observation (mapping silence, tracking light patterns) flows from her sensory reality. The music program translates her visual maps, making sign language part of the conceptual architecture. Present in setup, development (sign language exchanges with Theo), and payoff (the translation premise). Early signal +0.6, two-beat involvement +0.9, causal pressure +0.8 (her visual perspective is the source material), closure linkage +0.5 (the translation is validated). However, sign language itself does not constrain tactics or impose a trade-off; it functions more as premise than active obstacle. Swappability −0.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Quietly charismatic" is asserted in exposition ("that rare quality of being quietly charismatic—never demanding attention, yet impossible to ignore") but not dramatized through Theo's actions, speech, or visible effect on others. The trait does not constrain or enable any on-page choice with cost; it remains label-only. Theo's supportiveness and technical skill do shape the plot, but those qualities are distinct from "quietly charismatic." No setup beat that shows the trait in action, no middle development where it alters tactics, no payoff where it charges the ending. Label-only −0.8, ornamental use −0.7, late closure absence −0.6. Cap at 4.6 for missing closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Disrupt" is signaled explicitly ("Tonight we disrupt everything") and drives the major turn: Theo's program broadcasts Marina's silence-music across the harbor, drawing the crowd and validating her invisible work. The action redefines Marina's options from isolation to temporary presence. Present in setup (Theo announces the plan), development (the broadcast happens, crowd responds), and payoff (Marina accepts impermanence as the cost). Early signal +0.6, two-beat involvement +0.9, causal pressure +1.2 (the disruption is the story's hinge), closure linkage +0.9 (the crowd's response enables the final trade-off). However, the disruption is executed by Theo, not Marina; her agency in the act is limited to consent and final adjustment. Swappability −0.3 (the broader action could be rephrased without loss).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Mapping silence" is signaled early (Marina "tracking patterns of reflected moonlight, rhythm of waves") and its mechanics matter: she sketches movement and luminosity, Theo converts those maps into sound waves. The method shapes the middle attempt (months of observation fed into the program) and is validated at closure ("mapping new patterns of silence, translating the untranslatable"). Present in setup, development (the conversion process), and payoff (continuing the method). Early signal +0.6, two-beat involvement +0.9, causal pressure +0.9 (the method is the means of the climax), closure linkage +0.8. However, the actual mapping work happens off-page in summary ("For months, she'd been photographing"), and the mechanics remain abstract; we never see Marina make a tactical choice shaped by the mapping process itself. Summary-only −0.6.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The "luminous harbor by moonlight" is vividly rendered throughout and charges the atmosphere. It appears in setup (opening line), development (the broadcast occurs across the harbor, boats light up), and payoff (final image of the harbor singing). Early signal +0.8, three-beat involvement +1.4, closure linkage +0.7. However, the harbor does not constrain Marina's choices or supply resources that alter tactics; it functions as postcard backdrop and thematic mirror (light = visibility) rather than tactical pressure. The moonlight metaphor is static across beats. Ornamental use −0.7, swappability −0.5 (any scenic nighttime setting could serve). Strong atmospheric presence but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"When no one remembers you" is the thematic timeframe anchoring Marina's isolation and desire for permanence. It motivates her months-long mapping project and frames the final trade-off ("They'll forget about this by morning"). Present in setup (she feels "erased, forgotten"), development (the crowd's temporary attention), and payoff (acceptance of impermanence). Two-beat involvement +0.9, causal pressure +0.8 (the fear of erasure drives the stake), closure linkage +0.9. However, the timeframe itself does not tighten decisions or impose a live clock; it remains thematic context rather than tactical constraint. No concrete deadline or time-pressure that alters Marina's moves. Swappability −0.6 (any existential isolation could substitute).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The motivation to "translate silence into music" is signaled early ("you wanted to translate silence into music?") and drives Marina's months-long mapping project. It shapes the middle turn (Theo's program realizes the goal) and the ending (continuing the translation work, accepting impermanence as the cost). Present in setup, development (the translation is achieved), and payoff (she joins Theo to adjust parameters, embracing the method over permanence). Early signal +0.6, two-beat involvement +0.9, causal pressure +1.2 (the desire is the story's engine), closure linkage +1.0 (the final choice reaffirms the motivation with visible cost). Friction between want (to be remembered) and cost (impermanence) is dramatized at the ending. Strong integration across beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Joyful sorrow" is embodied in Marina's tears at the climax ("that peculiar sensation of joyful sorrow—the ache of loss transformed into something transcendent") and charges the final image ("Nothing captured. Everything preserved."). The tone modulates coherently: isolation and loss in the opening, wonder and validation at the crowd response, acceptance and bittersweet presence at the close. Present in setup (empty camera as gesture of loss), development (tears at validation), and payoff (the paradox of impermanent presence). Two-beat involvement +0.9, closure linkage +1.2, coherence under pressure +0.8. However, the phrase "joyful sorrow" is stated rather than consistently woven through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously; the emotional arc is more linear (sad → validated → accepting) than genuinely paradoxical. Told-only at peak −0.4.</comment>
