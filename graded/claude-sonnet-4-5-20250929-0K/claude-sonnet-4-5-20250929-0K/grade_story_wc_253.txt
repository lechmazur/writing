<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus's narration habit is well-motivated as resistance that persists after the mandate, and his internal conflict between performance and grief is embodied through the whittling and flower-tending. Emma's blank performer's mask and her slow thaw are legible, though her arc is more observed than driven by her own choices. The final moment—"muscles remembering expressions they'd suppressed"—earns the shift through prior constraint, and the cost of years suppressed is felt. Minor: the morally-ambiguous attribute (prompt element) is stated rather than dramatized in a choice with visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (farmhouse, post-mandate timeframe, Marcus and Emma, dried flowers as grief-marker) land cleanly by paragraph three. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through Marcus's narration-as-survival habit, the flowers as taboo witness, and Emma's suppressed affect, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis transitioning to release) when both allow grief its natural weight. The closure lands on the page with felt cost—years of performance and the fragility of relearning emotion—and the final image (whittling in silence, flowers between them) reweights prior material. One meaningful deepening (Marcus's voice breaking, Emma's mask cracking) is sufficient for this length and tightens the dominant stake.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The farmhouse under turbines, the dried flowers, and the whittling knife all function as micro-setting that constrains and charges. The turbines' "seventeen point three megawatts of renewable indifference" and the flowers' gray brittleness anchor the post-mandate void without catalog. Spatial choreography (table, stove, Marcus crossing to Emma) is coherent. The flowers return in the ending to charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate for setting involvement, but sensory detail leans heavily visual; other senses (sound of wood curls, texture of brittle stems) are present but could deepen.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Marcus and Emma can reclaim genuine emotion after the mandate—is signaled early and tightens through Marcus's narration cracking and Emma's mask shifting. The escalation is driven by Marcus's agency (choosing to break performance, reaching for Emma's hand) under the Accumulative lens, and the cost is legible: years of suppressed grief, the fragility of relearning humanity. No coincidence resolves; the flowers and narration habit pay off the setup. The tightening is meaningful—moving from theatrical distance to silence—and forecloses the option of continued performance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—cultivating lightness in grief by carrying it without erasing it—emerges through the dried flowers, the narration habit, and the final silent whittling rather than direct statement. The ending offers a non-literal answer: the flowers rest "gray and fragile and honest," and the quiet becomes "space for whatever came next," reweighting the prior performance without a moral. Marcus's epiphany ("cultivating lightness…doesn't mean erasing the grief itself") verges on articulation but is immediately embodied by his tears and Emma's shift, so the cost anchors it. Minor: "remade hush" as concept (prompt element) is stated thematically more often than it pressures a choice on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable on Marcus; psychic distance modulates purposefully (zooming in on his interiority during the whittling, pulling back to observe Emma). The narration habit—"I am now lifting the kettle"—is voice-particular and Marcus's perceptual signature (noticing the turbines' megawatts, the flowers' gray sameness) filters all detail. Dialogue is sparse but functional: Emma's flat "Dad, you don't have to do that" and her later "I remember" track her arc. Minor: the phrase "remade hush" and "unauthorized emotions" lean slightly explanatory rather than dramatized, a small distance wobble in an otherwise controlled voice.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well: short fragments during peak emotion ("Yes."), longer accumulative sentences during reflection. Information density is high—most lines advance both Marcus's habit and the grief underneath. Minor loop: "mask" for Emma's face appears three times in similar phrasing without added pressure. The final paragraph risks slight overwriting ("gray and fragile and honest," "void, not mandate, just space") but the specificity holds. No major template cadence or filter-verb stacks. Propulsion is steady, though the middle third (whittling description, backstory on the mandate) slows slightly before the emotional turn.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The narration-as-resistance conceit and the post-mandate emotional void offer a fresh angle on grief and compliance. The specific detail—turbines generating "renewable indifference," the flowers from a funeral that couldn't be mourned—anchors the premise in lived particulars. The transformation test holds: swapping names or setting would lose the mandate's ghost and Marcus's theatrical survival tactic. Minor: the premise echoes familiar dystopian-compliance templates (mandatory happiness, emotional policing); the story personalizes it through Marcus and Emma but does not fully subvert the premise's logic in an unexpected direction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Emma (blank-faced performer) is present in setup, her suppressed state pressures Marcus in the middle (her flat voice, her mask), and her mask cracking in the ending contributes to closure. She enables Marcus's final turn by cradling the flowers and remembering. Her own agency is limited—she reacts more than she drives—so she trends mid-band. Two gates clear, closure involvement is real but reactive.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Dried flower bouquet appears in setup (paragraph one), returns when Emma names them as from the funeral (middle beat that reweights their meaning), and is physically handled in the ending ("took the bouquet from him, cradling it") to charge the final image. All three gates, two distinct beats, closure linkage, and the flowers' gray brittleness is irreplaceable to the grief-witness theme. Cost tied directly to their presence.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Remade hush" is named in setup and again late, framing the post-mandate void. It shapes the dominant stake (breaking the silence) but mostly operates thematically rather than constraining a specific tactic. The hush is what Marcus and Emma must overcome, so it participates in closure, but the concept itself is more atmosphere than mechanism. Two gates (setup, closure), one beat involvement, some causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>Morally ambiguous is stated in reflection ("Was it cowardice dressed as cleverness? Was it survival?") without a dramatized choice that forces a visible trade-off on the page. Marcus's narration habit is present and clever, but the moral cost or ambiguity isn't tested in a scene where he must choose between self-protection and honesty with consequence. Setup and middle mention, but no closure beat where the ambiguity constrains an option. Label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Whittling appears in setup, Marcus narrates peeling away the surface (thematic link), and he picks up the knife again in the ending, this time carving "in silence" to signal the shift from performance to genuine quiet. Two beats, closure participation, and the action is specific enough that swapping it (e.g., folding paper) would lose the texture. Not indispensable—the flowers do more causal work—but well-integrated.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Dramatically narrating mundane tasks is signaled in paragraph two ("I am now lifting the kettle"), sustains through multiple beats ("I am acknowledging my daughter's statement," "I am reaching for my daughter's hand"), and its abandonment in the ending ("this time he carved in silence") is the closure mechanism. The method shapes Marcus's survival tactic and its breakdown is the emotional turn. All three gates, multiple beats, high causal pressure, indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Farmhouse and turbines are anchored in paragraph one and the turbines return twice ("seventeen point three megawatts," "the turbines turned"), providing atmospheric continuity. The setting frames the emotional void but does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics. The turbines' symbolic weight (generating power for a defunct system) is purposeful but ornamental. Setup and closure mention, minimal causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Post-mandate timeframe is anchored in setup ("three months ago when the administration collapsed") and the temporal pressure—learning to feel again after years of suppression—drives the dominant stake throughout. The time constraint is not a live clock but a historical weight that tightens Marcus and Emma's options (they've forgotten how to grieve). Two beats (setup, middle reflection), closure participation via the "long work of remembering," moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Cultivating lightness in grief is dramatized through Marcus's narration habit (a way to witness without collapsing), tested when his voice breaks, and articulated with embodied cost ("I am realizing…It means learning to carry it without collapsing"). The friction between wanting lightness and needing to feel grief fully drives the arc. Three beats (setup, middle whittling, ending tears), closure participation, visible cost. The epiphany leans slightly tell-heavy but is immediately embodied.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Emotional void is established early (pale gray, flat voice, "permanent shadow") and modulates with pressure: Marcus's theatrical monotone shifts to broken voice, Emma's mask cracks. The tone charges the final image—silence that is "not void, not mandate, just space." Coherent through turns, purposeful modulation, and the ending reconfigures the void from oppressive to open. All three gates, solid closure linkage, tone integral to theme.</comment>
