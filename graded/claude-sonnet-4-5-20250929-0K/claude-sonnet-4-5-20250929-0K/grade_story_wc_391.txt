<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Ren's interior life is consistently rendered through sensory detail and her relationship to inherited duty. The motivation to expand traditional methods is clear, though the internal contradiction between rebellion and continuation could be sharper—her "restrained wildness" reads more as patient determination than genuine conflict. The choice to pursue moon mapping feels inevitable from page one rather than earned through dramatized pressure. Embodied emotion is present but tends toward contemplative distance rather than contradictory impulses acting simultaneously.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds pressure through recursive imagery (basalt, viaduct, moon) and seasonal observation toward a Resonant Reconfiguration at closure. Orientation anchors cleanly within the first two paragraphs. The ending achieves Charged Poise—"one mapper, one moon, one frozen lake"—crystallizing Ren's patient revolution as a before/after stance with conceptual cost (isolation, generational break) made legible. One meaningful deepening occurs as her nightly practice accumulates into an argument "written in light and time." The cost is felt but oblique; the final image reweights the opening restlessness without a sharp on-page sacrifice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct form a coherent spatial triangle that recurs across beats and charges the closure. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Ren's professional lens: ice contracting "like the earth itself was speaking," rain-silvered iron. The theodolite constrains her nightly practice, and the sanctuary's stillness enables her transformation. The viaduct's magnetic interference after rain is a specific constraint that shapes her calculations. Micro-setting (body at theodolite, numb fingers) reinforces the cost of patient work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving that vigilance can encompass imagination—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure tightens through accumulation: "one night" becomes "each night for the past month," building toward spring when findings will be revealed. Ren's agency is renunciation of old methods through persistent demonstration, a valid form of Earned Stasis. The escalation is textural rather than causal, fitting the inferred lens, though the absence of a complicating obstacle (village resistance, failed measurement) keeps the tension contemplative. Cost is conceptual—unyoking from lineage—but remains implied rather than dramatized in a peak choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the moon-path work: patience as radical act, tradition expanded rather than rejected. The recurring viaduct and basalt walls anchor abstraction in concrete images. "Sculpt patience from impatience" is stated early but then demonstrated through nightly ritual and the ice-forming metaphor at closure. The final paragraph risks moralizing ("The patient revolution had no battles") but the preceding image work earns the resonance. Subtext operates in the gap between Ren's solitary certainty and the unseen village council. No diagnostic label-speak or thematic echo in peak beats.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited distance with strong perceptual signature: Ren notices theodolite angles, atmospheric light-bending, magnetic interference—all filtered through her mapper's expertise. Diction is elevated but consistent ("restrained wildness," "softly purposeful") and voice-motivated. No dialogue present; no head-hopping. Psychic distance remains steady even under cold and fatigue. The phrase "patient revolution" recurs but as her private coinage, not authorial intrusion. Compression is purposeful: forty years of family observations condensed into "leather journal" without exposition dump.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies appropriately, with longer contemplative sentences in reflective beats and shorter declaratives at closure. Information density is high: most sentences do multiple jobs (setting + character + theme). Minor loop detected: "softly purposeful movements" (paragraph 4) echoes "softly purposeful rhythm" (paragraph 8), a synonym cycle without added pressure. Stock metaphor: "silver coin pressed into dark glass" for moon reflection. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence. The final paragraph's declarative list ("one mapper, one moon...") is pattern-taught and pays off. Proofreading clean; no causality breaks.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The core premise—expanding horizon mapping to vertical/lunar observation—offers a modest fresh angle on tradition-versus-innovation. The magnetic viaduct after rain is a specific, unusual detail that lifts the world beyond generic fantasy. Emotional truth in Ren's quiet determination feels authentic, though the contemplative mode and solitary protagonist avoid risk. The "patient revolution" frame is thematically coherent but borders on familiar counterculture tropes (quiet resistance, lone visionary). Transformation test: swapping moon paths for star charts or switching basalt to granite would not fundamentally alter the arc. No proximity echoes of famous lines.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Ren's role as vigilant horizon mapper frames her purpose and shapes her nightly observations. The vigilance manifests in meticulous tracking and theodolite use across multiple beats. Her choice to expand methods (vertical knowledge) alters tactics but lacks a high-stakes decision that narrows options under pressure. Present in setup, middle work, and closure metaphor. Functional but observation-heavy; the mapper identity enables rather than constrains a pivotal choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The magnetic viaduct appears in three beats: opening view, recalled family history, and theodolite alignment. Its magnetic properties after rain create measurable interference that Ren accounts for, a specific constraint on her calculations. The rain-silvered gleam returns at closure. The viaduct represents inherited duty she must unyoke from, charging its thematic role. Beats are somewhat static (observation > memory > observation) rather than escalating use, keeping it from higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Patient revolution" is named in paragraph 3 and recurs as a private frame for Ren's work. The concept shapes her tactics: refusing to rush, accumulating data over months, demonstrating rather than declaring. It appears in the closure paragraph, reweighting her solitary practice as radical persistence. The revolution is told more than shown—no dramatized friction with village norms tests the patience on the page. Present across setup, middle, and ending; drives method but not a specific high-cost choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Softly purposeful" appears twice as a descriptor of Ren's movements and rhythm. It characterizes her approach but does not constrain a choice or create visible tradeoff. The trait is consistent with the patient revolution theme but remains label-level; no beat shows where being soft costs her something or where purpose must override restraint. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Unyoke" appears in paragraph 2 as Ren's goal and returns implicitly at closure when she has demonstrated "something better." The action frames her motivation and the spring reveal stakes. However, the unyoking is prospective—she will unyoke by spring—rather than enacted on the page. No beat shows her severing a specific tie or paying a relational cost. Signaled early and tied to closure but not dramatized as a decisive turn.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Tracking moon paths is signaled in paragraph 1 and enacted across paragraphs 4, 5, 7, and 8. The method's mechanics matter: theodolite positioning, atmospheric deviation after rain, alignment with the viaduct's arch. It shapes her nightly attempts and distinguishes her from daytime predecessors. The method appears in the closure metaphor ("argument written in light and time"). Functionally drives multiple beats and integrates with other elements (viaduct, timeframe). Strong causal role.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The basalt sanctuary appears in the opening line, recurs in paragraph 5 ("basalt walls around her absorbed the cold"), and is touched at closure ("The sanctuary had sheltered her transformation"). It provides the stillness and shelter necessary for her patient work, a micro-setting that enables her practice. The frozen lake's ice contraction and cold pressure her endurance. Both setting elements constrain her physically (numbing fingers) and enable the revolutionary isolation. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The timeframe—after the lake freezes, through winter nights, until spring thaw—is established early and recurs. Ren's work is bounded by the freeze/thaw cycle: she will present findings "in spring, when the lake thawed." The nightly repetition ("each night for the past month") builds accumulative pressure. The clock is seasonal rather than immediate, providing patience but not urgency. Time shapes the scope of her demonstration but does not tighten a single-night decision. Present across all three gates; moderate causal role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The motivation to "sculpt patience from impatience" is named in paragraph 4 and demonstrated through her refusal to rush and month-long observation. It drives her choice to track moon paths slowly versus her predecessors' speed. The friction between wants (immediate change) and method (patient accumulation) is present but mostly resolved by paragraph 4; little on-page struggle remains. The motivation frames setup and closure but is not tested by a complicating desire or fear. Functional; modest dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Restrained wildness" is named in paragraph 6 and coheres across the piece: disciplined observation (restraint) pursuing unconventional vertical knowledge (wildness). Tone modulates slightly from restless spirit (opening) to conviction (closure) but remains contemplative throughout. The oxymoron charges the final image of ice forming "molecule by molecule"—patient yet transformative. Tone is stable rather than dynamic; it supports theme but does not escalate with pressure. Present and coherent; moderate charge at closure.</comment>
