<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Senna's interior shows concrete motivation rooted in her training and the community's need, embodied through her peripheral-sensing technique and the ritual actions at the stone. The old man's "strangely honest" directness adds a credible voice contrast. The prophet remains off-page but her influence shapes Senna's choices with visible cost (kneeling, whispering the consecration, risking failure). Minor: interiority occasionally leans toward exposition ("The echo of the prophet's wisdom wasn't in her words...") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph (Senna, parapet beneath dunes, three days post-prophet). Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: pressure accumulates through the fading clearings, Senna's mapping of "pockets," and the consecration ritual that reweights the stakes. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (the clearings hold through collective attention and ritual, a form of Charged Poise with the cost of ongoing maintenance visible). One meaningful deepening as Senna moves from reconnaissance to consecration. Cost legibility is clean: "They would need maintenance—a line walker's regular visits, the community's gentle attention—but they would hold."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The kinetic parapet "hummed under her feet, its ancient mechanisms still responding to footfalls, still shifting its metal lattices" provides immediate tactile grounding and recurs as Senna uses sand and iron filings from it as physical anchors for the consecration. The murmuring pavilion functions as both setting and object of preservation, its "fabric walls breathing with the voices" creating sensory pressure. Micro-setting (the stone, the circle of mixture) constrains the ritual and charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent across descent, pavilion interior, and exit.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: can Senna preserve the prophet's conjured clearings? Pressure accumulates through the fading spaces, the old man's question, and Senna's careful peripheral mapping. One meaningful deepening occurs when she kneels and performs the consecration, narrowing from reconnaissance to active preservation with the cost of ongoing maintenance made explicit. Agency is clear: her ritual forecloses the alternative (letting the clearings dissolve) with visible price. Under the Accumulative lens, the tightening reads as cadence shift from observation to ritual act that reweights the community's responsibility.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the conjured clearings metaphor: spaces of gathering without prescription, sustained by peripheral awareness and collective attention rather than rigid ritual. The final image "spaces conjured from nothing, preserved through the simple act of believing in what existed at the edge of sight" resonates without moralizing, reweighting the prophet's absence as a gift of method rather than loss. Subtext operates in the half-mask's symbolism (line walker between known and sensed), the pavilion's breathing fabric, and the whisperfield calm that settles "like snow." No thematic echo or diagnostic label-speak in peak beats. The consecration earns its insight through prior mapping and ritual particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited through Senna; perceptual signature filters setting through her line-walker training ("not listening to their words but to the spaces between"). Diction stays consistent with a formal, measured register appropriate to ritual and observation. The old man's dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("Can you preserve what she made?"). Free indirect style is clean; no head-hopping. Minor: the prophet's description "voice like wind through reeds" and "whisperfield calm" trend slightly toward stock lyricism, though they remain voice-motivated. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from exterior action (descent) to interior awareness (peripheral sensing) to spoken ritual.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; information density is high with most lines doing double duty (e.g., "The parapet hummed under her feet" anchors setting and introduces kinetic mechanisms). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Some figurative language clusters without quite overwriting: "moth's wing," "wind through reeds," "morning mist," "like snow" all appear but remain legible and support the whisperfield tone. Minor: "strangely honest in his directness" is a slight tell-not-show moment, and "She had studied the method all her life" front-loads exposition that could be inferred from action. Propulsion remains steady; no momentum drag.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The conjured-clearings premise and peripheral-awareness method offer a fresh angle on grief/preservation themes, avoiding the expected mourning-ritual arc. The half-mask symbol and kinetic parapet details feel specific rather than generic. The turn from observation to consecration grows organically from Senna's training. However, the prophet-as-catalyst and the need to preserve her legacy trends toward familiar mentor-death templates; transformation is present but modest. The whisperfield calm and line-walker role provide distinctive texture. Risk-taking is moderate: the piece commits to its metaphysical premise without retreat but does not push into genuinely unconventional structural territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Senna (half-masked line walker) drives every major beat: she descends, maps the clearings, kneels at the stone, consecrates the spaces, and departs. Her training and perceptual method shape tactics throughout. The consecration is a decision-point that alters the community's future and forecloses the alternative (dissolution). Present in setup (opening), development (mapping), and closure (ritual and exit). Causal pressure is strong; her agency is the hinge of the story. Two deductions: she lacks internal contradiction or visible struggle beyond competence; the cost is more collective than personal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The kinetic parapet appears in the opening (anchoring setting), recurs when Senna uses "sand from the parapet above, iron filings from its kinetic mechanisms" as physical anchors for the consecration, and is mentioned at closure ("the kinetic parapet continued its eternal adjustments"). Present in three beats but its function is mostly atmospheric and symbolic; removing it would weaken texture but not break story logic (the consecration could use other anchors). The parapet does not constrain a choice or shift meaning decisively. Lyric reprise (first paragraph → near-final line) adds resonance but the causal role remains modest.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Conjured clearings are the story's engine: the prophet created them, they are fading, Senna must preserve them. The concept shapes every beat—her descent, peripheral sensing, identification of "pockets of potential," and the consecration ritual that reweights the stakes from individual to collective attention. The clearings define the dominant stake, constrain Senna's method (peripheral awareness required to avoid collapse), and charge the final image ("spaces conjured from nothing, preserved through the simple act of believing"). Present in setup, development, and closure with high causal pressure and specificity. Indispensable to story logic and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Strangely honest" modifies the old man's approach to Senna in one line ("An old man approached, strangely honest in his directness. Most people avoided looking at her mask"). It signals social friction (others avoid her) and enables the old man's question, which triggers Senna's attempt. However, the trait does not constrain a later choice or carry visible cost; it is label-only flavor that could be cut without altering structure. Present in setup but absent from development and closure. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The action "consecrate" is the story's climactic turn: Senna pours the mixture, places palms on stone, speaks the ritual words, and uses peripheral awareness to acknowledge the pockets, shifting the clearings from fading to sustained. The consecration is signaled early ("I'm here to try"), dramatized in full at the pavilion's center, and its effect closes the story ("the clearings held"). Removing this action would collapse the narrative arc. Causal pressure is high; specificity (the mixture, the words, the peripheral method) makes it irreplaceable. Present in all three gates with visible cost (ongoing maintenance required).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Through peripheral awareness" is the method Senna uses to sense and preserve clearings: "not to create clearings herself, but to recognize them through peripheral awareness, to sense the edges of spaces that existed only when observed from the corner of consciousness." The method is taught in the first third, applied during her walk through the pavilion ("she felt it. A pocket of potential"), and used at the consecration ("expanded her peripheral awareness, feeling for the pockets"). It constrains her approach (direct scrutiny would collapse the clearings) and shapes the thematic insight at closure. Present in setup, development, and closure with moderate causal pressure; somewhat abstract but tied to on-page actions.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The murmuring pavilion is both setting and object of preservation: its "fabric walls breathing with the voices" anchor sensory detail, it houses the fifty mourners whose murmuring creates the "pockets of potential," and the stone at its center is the consecration site. Senna's movement through the pavilion structures the middle beats; the pavilion's survival (holding at closure) is part of the stakes. Present in setup (anchors setting), development (provides spatial choreography and the pockets she maps), and closure (murmuring resumes, whisperfield calm settles). Causal role is strong; removing it would require a different setting and spatial logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the prophet arrives" structures the backstory (prophet arrived six months ago, died three days ago) and creates the urgency (clearings are fading now). The three-day marker anchors when and signals the ticking clock. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions on the page in real time; Senna's actions are not visibly constrained by a deadline within the scene. Present in setup and thematically relevant but does not escalate pressure during the middle or closure beats. Functional but not indispensable to moment-by-moment tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Motivation "to preserve the echo of wisdom" drives every beat: Senna climbs to the parapet, descends to the pavilion, maps the clearings, and performs the consecration explicitly to hold onto "what they'd been given." The old man's question ("Can you preserve what she made?") and her reply ("I'm here to try") dramatize the desire. Friction appears in the risk of failure ("threadbare, wearing thin") and the cost of ongoing maintenance. The motivation is embodied in ritual action and anchors the thematic insight at closure. Present in setup, development, and closure with visible cost and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Whisperfield calm" appears in the opening third ("the whisperfield calm that had characterized the prophet's presence still lingered here, though threadbare"), recurs at the consecration ("The murmuring stopped" then resumes "softer now, reverent"), and charges the final image ("whisperfield calm settled over it like snow"). Tone modulates purposefully: initial threadbare calm → silence during ritual → restored calm at closure. The tonal shift mirrors the narrative arc and reweights the prophet's gift from fading to sustained. Coherent through turns and legible at closure, though the term "whisperfield" is somewhat abstract and coined rather than concretely embodied in sensory particulars.</comment>
