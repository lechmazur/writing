<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation is clear and her shift from protocol-based listening to seeking silence feels earned through her seven years of repetitive work. The mentor's deathbed directive and her moment of recalibration ("discarding assumptions") show agency under pressure. However, the final epiphany arrives too smoothly—no visible struggle or trade-off when she finds the fragment, just immediate understanding. The closing insight about transformation feels asserted rather than dramatized through a costly choice that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes who/where/when within the opening paragraph and maintains a coherent Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered imagery (towers, gorge, moonlight, silence-as-signal) that culminates in the fragment's revelation. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the shift from mourning silence to recognizing it as canvas) with conceptual cost legible in the reweighted towers and gorge. One meaningful deepening occurs when Mira recalibrates to detect absence. Minor causality slip: the fragment's exact location is convenient rather than earned by prior clues.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The suspended city, gorge, and transmission hub are vividly rendered with purpose-driven detail (dust motes, broken windows, debris-strewn floor). Spatial choreography is clean as Mira moves across the hub following silence. The fragment itself—crystalline, dark, veins of frozen light—charges the final image by reweighting the towers and gorge from graveyard/throat to chrysalis/potential. Lunar perigee anchors time and the "serenely electric" hum integrates environment with her array, meeting the 9+ gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake (finding new meaning in celestial signals beyond hollow repetition) is signaled early and deepens when Mira recalibrates her array to detect absence, a tactical shift that narrows her method. The discovery itself carries conceptual weight—understanding endings as beginnings—but lacks a visible on-page cost or trade-off in the moment. Under the Accumulative lens, one meaningful intensification occurs, but the resolution feels more bestowed than fought for, limiting the felt price at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the fragment's "shard of hush" and the recurrent silence/transformation motif. The final image—silence as canvas—offers a resonant answer to the central question (finding beginnings in endings) without stating a moral. The mentor's teaching and Mira's shift in interpretation method ground the insight in specific action. However, "silence wasn't absence / It was the canvas on which everything began" risks overt thematic statement in the final lines, though the particulars (towers humming, gorge reweighted) anchor it sufficiently.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with a distinct perceptual signature: "serenely electric," "throat of darkness," "blueprint of silence" create a consistent idiom blending technical and lyrical registers. Distance control is clean; no head-hopping. The prose modulates effectively under pressure (short sentences when she finds the pocket of quiet, more expansive at the epiphany). Free indirect style is clean. Minor issue: "fantasy practicality" appears as a concept label in the penultimate paragraph, nudging toward tell rather than embodied demonstration, but overall voice remains character-specific.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; imagery is vivid and concise ("iron prayers," "throat of darkness," "elemental vocabulary"). Information density is high with minimal scaffolding. However, several lines risk overwriting: "cosmic geometries that predated the star's explosion" and "mathematical poetry that had assembled hydrogen into helium" stack elevated diction in adjacent beats without clear pattern-teaching. The phrase "practicing her fantasy practicality" late in the piece reads as scaffold or meta-commentary rather than earned lexicon. No major loops, but figurative density in the closure sequence approaches threshold without crossing into muddle.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The celestial-interpreter premise and the "shard of hush" concept offer a fresh synthesis of signal-decoding and star-death mythology. The shift from detecting presence to absence is a non-obvious tactical turn. However, the emotional arc (interpreter seeks meaning, finds fragment, understands transformation) follows a familiar discovery-epiphany template. The suspended city and lunar-perigee frame add specificity, but the resolution feels too aligned with the setup without significant complication or surprise in hindsight. Risk-taking is moderate; no bold structural or perspectival deviation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira's decision to recalibrate the array (detecting absence) creates the key turn that leads to finding the fragment. She appears in setup, drives the middle search, and integrates the fragment at closure. Her choices are causal and shape tactics under the Accumulative lens. However, post-discovery she processes rather than decides; no secondary choice complicates or tests her understanding. Two beats (recalibration, integration) with closure linkage, but limited cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The fragment is signaled in setup (mentor's deathbed instruction), discovered mid-story (northeast corner beat), and integrated at closure (synchronized with her array, reweighting the towers and gorge). It appears in three distinct beats with evolving use: clue → object → conceptual key. The fragment's properties (crystalline, veins of light, origin codes) are specific and irreplaceable. Strong closure linkage and causal pressure. Minor friction: the fragment resolves the search it was introduced to solve, reducing surprise.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The "shard of hush" (moment between death and rebirth) is named in setup via the mentor, sought in the middle, and revealed in the fragment's properties at closure. It shapes the dominant stake (finding beginnings in endings) and Mira's interpretive shift. However, it functions more as thematic anchor than tactical constraint; the mechanics of "hush" don't alter her on-page choices beyond the initial recalibration. Present across all three gates, but causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Serenely electric" appears twice: describing the equipment's hum early and the fragment's pulse at closure. It colors atmosphere but does not constrain or enable a specific action with cost—it's adjectival rather than functional. No visible trade-off tied to this attribute; it remains label-level. Present in setup and closure (lyric reprise), but ornamental use limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Tune" is the core action: Mira tunes her array differently by recalibrating to detect absence, which leads directly to finding the fragment. The action appears in setup (her training in tuning signals), drives the middle turn (the recalibration beat), and is enacted again at closure (tuning the towers with the fragment). Three beats with clear causal pressure. The major turn traces to this action, and it's irreplaceable given the signal-interpreter premise.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Discarding assumptions" is named on-page ("by discarding assumptions about where celestial signals should originate") and drives the key recalibration: Mira stops looking for presence and seeks absence. This method is signaled in the middle beat and its mechanics matter—it enables discovery. However, it's told more than shown; the specific assumptions discarded are not dramatized in prior protocol scenes. Present in middle and implied at closure, with moderate causal work.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The "abandoned radio tower city suspended over a gorge" is established in the opening line, provides the spatial arena (transmission hub, northeast corner, debris-strewn floor) for the search, and is reweighted at closure (graveyard → chrysalis, gorge as throat → space of potential). The setting pressures the search through physical obstacles and supplies the transmitter where the fragment is lodged. Three gates met with strong closure linkage; the gorge's reweighting charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Lunar perigee" is established in setup ("when the moon pressed closest to earth and the celestial signals grew clearest"), frames the search window, and reaches apex at closure ("As lunar perigee reached its apex, Mira began her work anew"). However, it does not tighten decisions or alter tactics on the page—it's atmospheric and thematic (the moon "pressed close") rather than a live clock. Present in all three gates but functionally passive.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"To find the beginning in every ending" is stated early as Mira's motivation, tested when she recalibrates her method (discarding old approaches to find new meaning), and fulfilled at closure when the fragment reveals origin codes in death throes. The motivation is clear and shapes her interpretive stance. However, it's more reflected upon than dramatized through conflicted choices; no visible friction between this want and a competing cost. Present across all three gates with thematic coherence, but limited dramatized conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Fantasy practicality" (believing impossible things while remaining grounded in method) is embodied in Mira's recalibration: she shifts her array to detect absence (fantastical premise) using technical procedure (practical method). The tone is coherent and modulates from technical early beats to lyrical at closure. However, the phrase "practicing her fantasy practicality" appears explicitly near the end, reading as a label rather than organic voice. Tone charges the final image (silence as canvas) but the on-page invocation of the term itself feels inserted.</comment>
