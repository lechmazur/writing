<question>1</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>Mara's character is established through concrete action (lighting lamps, diving) and her grandfather's obsession provides backstory that tilts present choices. However, interiority remains sparse—her decision to dive and photograph the bottles lacks visible internal conflict or contradictory impulses in the moment. The final choice to "complete his luminous vow" is stated rather than dramatized through a micro-choice that reveals hierarchy of values. Embodied emotion is minimal; we see action but not the layered, contradictory feelings driving it.</comment>

<comment>Orientation anchors (who/where/when) arrive clearly within the first paragraph. The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: Mara's purposeful collection of records and waiting for conjunction builds density toward the underwater discovery and photographic documentation. Closure operates as Resonant Reconfiguration—she reframes her lamplighting work as translation rather than mere illumination, a cognitive shift with conceptual cost (taking on the burden of transcribing her grandfather's lifetime project). The cost is somewhat abstract; while the commitment is stated, we don't see a live option foreclosed or a visible price paid on the page at the closure beat itself, keeping this from the high 8s.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The pier, wetsuit, underwater breach, and bioluminescent bottles supply vivid, purposeful detail filtered through Mara's professional and memorial focus. The sunken library's physical layout (gash, swollen door, makeshift shelves) constrains her path and discovery. Spatial choreography remains clear through the descent and return. The lanterns above function as both setting accent and thematic mirror, charging the final image when she surfaces and sees them "not memorials for the lost, but her grandfather's theory proven correct." Micro-setting (body in wetsuit, waterproof lamp) and recurring object (bottles, key tag) drive choices and charge closure.</comment>

<comment>The dominant stake—documenting her grandfather's color-sound dictionary—is signaled by midpoint and drives the dive. Pressure is coherent under the Accumulative lens: months of preparation, waiting for lowest tide and memorial night, then executing the descent. However, escalation is linear rather than tightening; no live complication forces a trade-off or narrows options once she's inside the wreck. The discovery proceeds smoothly, and the resolution (photographing bottles, hanging the key tag) lacks a visible cost or renunciation that forecloses a path. Agency is present but the final act feels completionist rather than conflicted.</comment>

<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>Theme—translation between senses, memory made visible—emerges from concrete particulars (bioluminescent bottles labeled with musical notes and colors) rather than stated thesis. The grandfather's synesthetic obsession and Mara's lamplighting converge in the closing image: "each lamp a word in the sentence between darkness and dawn, between silence and seeing." The piece resists tidy moralizing and allows ambiguity (the theory is "proven correct" only subjectively, through Mara's perception). Minor slip: "luminous vows" as a phrase appears in backstory but remains somewhat abstract, not fully grounded in dramatized action or visible cost on the page.</comment>

<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; Mara's perceptual signature favors maritime and memorial detail (brass lighter, iron stairs, tide charts). Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("meteor hush ascent," "infinite dark score"). However, psychic distance wobbles: "her grandfather had hidden behind truth his entire life" and "These bottles were meant to signify his life's obsession" read as narrator summary rather than Mara's live inference in the moment. No dialogue on the page. The phrase "luminous vows" recurs but feels slightly imposed by prompt rather than organic to the character's lexicon.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Sentence rhythm varies and momentum is generally strong through action beats. However, two paraphrase loops appear: "converted into a private library before it sank" is immediately restated in the next sentence ("ship had gone down...mast still visible...hull settled"), and the closing paragraph recycles "luminous vow" three times across four paragraphs without added pressure. Template cadence emerges in backstory: "He'd been a sound engineer who went deaf...spending his remaining decades obsessing..." follows a familiar biographical summary pattern. Stock metaphors ("cathedral," "delayed stars") don't obscure sense but lack freshness. Overall density is good, but these artifacts prevent entry to high 7s.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>6.6</grade>
<comment>The synesthetic premise (color of sound via bioluminescent algae) offers a non-obvious synthesis of sensory translation and memorial ritual. The sunken-library setting is specific and the lamplighter's dual role (surface light, underwater discovery) creates structural elegance. However, the core "hidden collection" beat follows a familiar treasure-hunt template, and the grandfather's secrecy ("hidden behind truth his entire life") is told rather than shown through specific lived choices. Risk is moderate; the piece commits to its lyrical register but does not take bold structural or moral chances that would elevate originality into the 8+ range.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>Mara as lamplighter frames the opening, drives the middle dive sequence through her occupational access and timing (memorial night shift), and returns in the closing walk. Her decision to photograph and commit to transcription alters her future path. Present in setup, development (dive enabled by shift timing), and payoff (resumed lamplighting with "new understanding"). Strong integration; not quite indispensable since a diver or archivist could execute similar beats, but the occupational specificity and memorial-night conjunction make substitution costly.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>The brass key tag from room 317 is handled in two beats: Mara carries it as talisman during the dive, then hangs it above the collection in the captain's quarters. The second use reweights it as a memorial anchor linking her grandfather's dreaming-space to his hidden work. However, its causal role is minimal—removing it would not break plot logic or closure; it functions more as symbolic punctuation than a constraint on choice. Present in setup (pocket), absent in middle escalation, returns at closure with thematic charge but no visible cost tied specifically to the object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>4.2</grade>
<comment>"Luminous vows" appears three times: once in backstory (grandfather's whispered phrase), once as narrator label for the bottles' purpose, and once in Mara's closing intention ("complete his luminous vow"). It operates more as thematic label than a concept that shapes on-page stakes or tactics. The vow itself—translating sound into light—is the grandfather's, not Mara's; her action (photographing, transcribing) is adjacent but the "vow" mechanism doesn't constrain her choices or create visible friction. Functional presence, but swappable with "promise" or "project" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>5.1</grade>
<comment>"Hides behind truth" is applied to the grandfather: he told everyone he was "simply collecting specimens, conducting harmless experiments" while actually creating a synesthetic dictionary. This trait is told in backstory and affects Mara's discovery (the bottles were hidden/misunderstood) but does not constrain her on-page action with a cost. It explains the setup but doesn't enable or prevent a live choice during escalation or closure. Present by implication in setup, absent in development, returns as explanation at closure without visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>"Signify" drives the grandfather's bottle project ("meant to signify his life's obsession, transform his silent world into something others might witness") and Mara's photographic act makes the signification public/permanent. The action is central to theme and motivates the underwater sequence. However, it's somewhat passive—Mara documents rather than creates or changes the meaning; the bottles already signify, she merely records them. Present in setup (bottles' purpose), drives development (photographing), and charges closure (lamplighting as "translation"). Essential but not indispensable; "preserve" or "document" could substitute with minor tonal edits.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>"Wandering purposefully" is signaled early ("Mara had been wandering purposefully toward this night for months") and demonstrated through her preparation (collecting records, studying charts, waiting for conjunction). It structures her approach—methodical yet intuitive—and recurs in the closing beat: "purposeful wandering between land and water, memory and light." The method shapes her tactics (timing, route) and charges the final image by reframing her nightly routine as translation work. Present in setup, enables development choices, and reweights closure. Strong lyric reprise.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>The forgotten library inside the sunken ship is introduced early (survey maps, 1847 wreck, air pockets), becomes the primary location for the middle discovery beat (breach, swollen door, bottle shelves in captain's quarters), and provides the spatial pressure that makes the collection hidden/preserved. Removing it would collapse plot logic; the underwater setting enables both the grandfather's secrecy and Mara's memorial-night access. The physical details (gash, door, depths) constrain her path. Present in setup, drives development, and the surfacing moment charges closure by contrasting submerged library with sky lanterns. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The sky lantern release occurs simultaneously with Mara's dive, providing thematic counterpoint (upward memorial vs. downward discovery) and social cover ("everyone looked skyward instead of down"). It times her window (annual event, lowest tide) and charges the final image when she surfaces and reinterprets the lanterns as visual notes. However, the timeframe doesn't tighten decisions—she's not racing a clock or facing discovery. Present in setup, enables timing in development, and reweights at closure through perceptual shift. Functional but the urgency is more thematic than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>The grandfather's desire "to discover the color of sound" drives his lifetime project (cultivating algae, labeling bottles) and motivates Mara's dive to document his work. The motivation is inherited but dramatized through her preparation and commitment to transcription. Friction between the grandfather's silent obsession and Mara's public role (lamplighter, potential transcriber) creates tension between private memorial and public translation. Present in setup (backstory establishes the question), drives development (bottles answer it), and charges closure (Mara sees lamplighting as continuing the translation). Cost is conceptual—taking on his burden—but legible.</comment>

<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>"Meteor hush" tonally anchors the piece: quiet, elegiac, luminous. The phrase appears once explicitly ("meteor hush ascent" of lanterns) but the tone pervades—muted action, reflective interiority, lyric pacing. It modulates slightly under pressure (cold shock of water, urgency of the dive) but returns to contemplative register at closure ("simply walked her familiar path"). Coherent through turns and charges the final image (lanterns as "musical notes into the infinite dark score"). The tone doesn't shift dramatically but its consistency supports the accumulative lens and thematic resonance.</comment>
