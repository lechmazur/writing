<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus's interiority is concrete and particular—"ethics were simply market inefficiencies" feels earned, not therapy-speak. The internal contradiction between his systematic cruelty and sentimental preservation impulse drives the story, though the father's journal and bird-song memories risk sliding into stock backstory. The final choice to release the egg lands with visible cost (seven figures, board incomprehension, empire contradiction), and the renunciation forecloses his prior path. Minor slip: "felt something like grace fracture through him" edges toward label-speak at the climax.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Lens reads as Causal-Accumulative Hybrid: Marcus's eighteen-month drought engineering creates the footprint pattern, which triggers the sentimental recognition, which motivates the release, which allows the rain. Orientation anchors quickly (salt flat, helicopter, briefcase). The closure—egg released, rain falls, map washes clean—lands on the page with conceptual and financial cost (seven figures destroyed, monopoly abandoned). One micro turn when he sees the footprint from above yesterday charges the final beat. The "something like grace" line at closure risks soft labeling but the rain and dissolving map provide concrete reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The salt flat, fissures, alkaline dust, and storm are vivid and selective. The footprint pattern constrains Marcus's final choice—he kneels at "this exact coordinates" because the cracks converge there. The setting charges the closure: rain dissolves the map he engineered, salt under his feet liquefies. Minor gap: the helicopter's quarter-mile distance and the pilot's later questions are mentioned but not woven into spatial choreography during the peak beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Marcus's unexamined guilt versus his sentimental inheritance, braided with the monopoly he's built. The footprint discovery (yesterday's helicopter view) tightens pressure into the kneeling choice. The egg release is pure agency—decision that narrows all prior options, costing seven figures and board comprehension. The rain's arrival immediately reweights the manufactured drought. One escalation beat is sufficient at this length, and the cost is undeniable on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the drought-as-map, the fossilized egg, the father's journal spectrograms, and "preserve the echo" motif without overt thesis. The final image—rain erasing the deliberate ruin, storm percussion carrying extinct-bird echoes—offers a resonant answer to preservation versus exploitation with no stated moral. "Echo dissipating into alkali" and "shape of deliberate ruin, now washing clean" are non-literal and specific. Minor risk: "something like grace" in the penultimate beat edges toward thematic summary, though the sensory rain and dissolving map ground it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds steady; Marcus's perceptual signature is consistent (cartographer reading fissures, pricing guilt, "dense as grief"). Diction is controlled and voice-specific: "ethics were simply market inefficiencies," "nested in the spaces between profit margins." No dialogue to evaluate. Minor slips: "spectrograms of vanished species" and "cloud-seeding prevention" momentarily drift into technical catalog, and "felt something like grace fracture through him" softens the established clinical register at the peak without clear motivation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, information density is high, and most lines advance character or atmosphere. "The weight of it surprised him every time, dense as grief" is sharp. Opening and closing images anchor and recharge. Two paraphrase loops lower the score: "echo of birds" / "echo dissipating" and "something cracked inside his own chest" / "felt something like grace fracture through him" restate the internal shift without added pressure. Filter-verb reliance ("He felt," "thought he heard") in the final third dulls immediacy during peak beats. No other template cadence or scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis—water-scarcity engineer manufactures drought into extinct-bird footprint as sentimental map—is specific and non-obvious. The amoral-philanthropist frame and terror-bird egg avoid template plots. Risk: the father's ornithologist journal and "preserve the echo" line trend toward familiar redemption-through-inheritance, though Marcus's monopoly context and the map's eighteen-month scale add fresh weight. The ending's grace-fracture moment is earned in hindsight by the converging cracks and storm, not a late rule change.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus's amorality (water monopoly, no guilt) and his philanthropic brass-plaque reputation frame the story from paragraph three. His choice to release the egg—contradicting "every principle he'd built his empire upon"—is the decisive turn at closure. The trait is present early, pressures the middle (kneeling at the coordinates), and drives the ending with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The egg appears in paragraph two (briefcase), is handled in paragraph nine ("lifted... from its foam nest"), weighs "dense as grief" in paragraph ten, and is released/shattered in the climax. Three beats: briefcase mention, lift/weight, release. The object's fossilized permanence versus fragility charges the final image and reweights preservation versus destruction.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Manufactured drought is signaled in paragraph four (Hendren Solutions, eighteen months), shapes the fissure-map Marcus reads, and controls the rain withheld until his release of the egg. The concept alters tactics (kneeling at coordinates, releasing egg toward clouds he prevented) and reverses at closure when rain falls "inexplicably." Causal pressure throughout and closure linkage are undeniable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus's sentimentality is seeded early (father's bird songs, journal kept despite finding it "stupid, romantic"), returns in paragraph ten ("something in those extinct melodies had burrowed beneath his calculations"), and enables the irrational release. The trait constrains his rational empire-building and pays off at closure, but much of its work occurs in reflective summary rather than on-page friction during the peak beat.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>Release is the climactic action: "He lifted the egg skyward... Then Marcus did something that made no financial sense... He released it." The egg shatters, rain falls, map dissolves, empire principles break. The action redefines all prior options (water monopoly, board incomprehension, farmer recovery). Entirely indispensable; removing "release" collapses the closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The crack-map is introduced in paragraph five ("pattern of fissures... like a cartographer reading ancient texts"), seeded across eighteen months in paragraph six, and converges at "this exact coordinates" forming a bird's footprint from above. The map shapes Marcus's kneeling choice and is erased by rain at closure. Two beats (study, convergence) and closure participation, but the mechanics of why he kneels *there* rest partly on yesterday's aerial view rather than present discovery.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Salt flat anchors the opening line, supplies the alkaline dust Marcus kneels in, and dissolves under rain in the final paragraph ("salt dissolving beneath his feet"). The white expanse and cracked earth provide the canvas for the footprint map and constrain the climactic release ("shattered against the crystallized salt"). Environment shapes tactics and charges the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Thunder appears in the opening ("promised rain but never delivered"), rolls closer in paragraph nine, cracks overhead in paragraph fourteen when the egg is released, and the first drops fall immediately after. The storm's approach tightens the window for Marcus's choice and charges the release beat, but elapsed time within the scene is not tracked with precision and no clock explicitly narrows his options.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Marcus's desire to preserve echoes is seeded through his father's journal ("If we preserve the echo, something of them persists"), conflicts with his monopoly logic, and drives the egg purchase (seven figures, outbidding museums). The motivation is dramatized in the release choice and in Marcus hearing "the echo of birds" in the storm. Friction between the sentimental impulse and empire-building is legible, though much of the internal debate occurs in reflection rather than present micro-choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Tone blends clinical detachment ("ethics were simply market inefficiencies") with lyric sensory weight ("dense as grief," "thunder rolled somewhere beyond the mountains"). The "fractured grace" phrase appears explicitly in the penultimate paragraph and the modulation from amorality to release is coherent. Tone charges the final image (rain, dissolving map, standing long after he should leave) and supports the closure without becoming static or sentimental.</comment>
