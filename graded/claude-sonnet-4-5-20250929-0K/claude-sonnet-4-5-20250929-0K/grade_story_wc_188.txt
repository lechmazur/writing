<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kael's interiority is consistently grounded in embodied habit (the chant, muscle memory with the knot) and his choices under pressure feel earned by prior causality. The woman's motivations are thinner—her burned hands suggest shared history but her role tilts toward sage facilitator rather than crucible. Internal contradiction appears when Kael simultaneously cries and laughs while spinning, a credible collision of relief and grief; the final choice to continue spinning is dramatized rather than declared. Minor deduction for the woman's static function and the slightly telegraphed community-of-artists frame.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece anchors who/where/when cleanly within opening lines (Kael, fortress walls, dusk). Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Kael spins the unlit knot while lanterns glow around him, reweighting his relationship to failure and motion with felt cost (tears, laughter, acknowledgment he won't return to who he was). One meaningful deepening occurs when he accepts the knot and his hands move "without permission," tightening from walking observer to active participant. Cost is legible in the final lines: he understands the path forward is different, not restoration. Minor penalty for the mosaic-note setup feeling slightly ornamental—it delivers him but doesn't constrain mid-story choices.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Evening primrose, spiral path, courtyard mosaics, and the blooming fortress itself all anchor spatially and filter through Kael's professional lens (he reads instructions in tile as technique). The kerosene knot functions as micro-setting, constraining his muscle memory and enabling the final turn. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "pale petals catching amber light," "hush of a night with no stars." The fortress charges the closure image by holding the community's collective practice. No major slips; the setting does more than backdrop work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is legible early: Kael seeks relief from hopelessness after professional ruin. Pressure tightens when the woman hands him the knot, forcing embodied confrontation rather than intellectual distance. Agency is present: he chooses to spin, and his chant/motion alters his stance from "I just walk" to active participant. The tightening is meaningful—his hands act "without permission," collapsing internal resistance. Cost is visible in simultaneous crying and laughing, and the realization he won't recover his old identity. No reversals, but the single deepening suffices under Accumulative lens. Coincidence (the mosaic note) complicates but does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete particulars: filtering awareness through damage, spinning beauty from failure's rags, walking through fear while keeping rhythm. The kerosene knot and chant recur with shifted weight at closure, charging the final image without overt statement. Subtext operates in the woman's "serious playfulness" and Kael's muscle memory bypassing his conscious resistance. The ending resists tidy moral: Kael doesn't return to greatness, he accepts a new practice. Minor deduction for "defy the gravity of hopelessness" skating close to prompt-echo phrasing, though it's filtered through the woman's voice rather than narration.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV holds stable; psychic distance tightens during the spinning sequence without head-hopping. Diction is consistent and body-specific: "fingers tracing patterns in the air," "figure eights, halos, thread-the-needle motions." Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; the woman's lines pursue recruitment without exposition dump. Brief dialogue exchange ("You're the one who designs light" / "I was. Now I just walk" / "Good") advances plot economically. Minor deduction for the woman's idiom occasionally sliding toward facilitator-archetype ("filtering our awareness differently") rather than fully individuated voice, and one filter-verb cluster ("felt," "realized") in the final paragraph that slightly dulls immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; opening long immersive lines contrast with clipped dialogue mid-scene. Information density is high: "burned hands" signals shared failure without backstory dump, mosaics serve as both setting and instruction archive. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Minor deductions: "serious playfulness dancing in her eyes" mixes metaphor (playfulness doesn't dance spatially), and "the hush of a night with no stars" borders poetic stock phrasing. The final paragraph stacks several abstracted summary clauses ("who he might become," "different kinds of darkness") that slightly dilute the prior embodied momentum. Propulsion is strong through mid-scene but eases into thematic wrap at the close.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The mosaic-note premise is clever and the "filter" concept threads literally (mosaic tiles) and metaphorically (awareness). Kael's professional detail (timing fuses by syllable-count) and the kerosene knot's danger feel specific rather than generic. The community-of-failed-artists frame risks Workshop Trope territory but is grounded through burned hands and unlit lanterns rather than talking-heads exposition. Transformation test: swapping fireworks for another art form would require mechanical edits, suggesting adequate specificity. Risk-taking is modest—structure and arc follow familiar redemption-through-practice beats. No close echoes of famous lines detected. The piece earns its emotional honesty without gimmickry, landing in solid-professional range rather than exceptional.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael is present throughout, his choices (accepting the knot, beginning to spin, continuing through tears) create the key turn from passive walker to active spinner. Early signal in opening paragraph. Beat involvement: arrival decision, knot acceptance, spinning choice. Closure linkage strong: his chanting and motion anchor the final image. Cost visible in simultaneous crying/laughing and renunciation of return to former self. Minor swappability: another trauma-scarred artist could substitute with edits, though fireworks-specific detail (syllable-count timing, aerial shells knowledge) adds some irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kerosene rag knot introduced early (woman unwraps it), handled in middle beat (Kael feels weight, muscle memory), and active in closure (whirling unlit through lantern-lit courtyard). Three distinct beats. Specific properties matter: dangerous, requires presence, evokes Kael's early performance work. Cost connection: choosing to spin it forces bodily confrontation with fear. Reweighted meaning: shifts from relic of past to tool for new practice. Strong integration; only cap at 7.4 because the knot remains unlit—igniting it would have raised physical and symbolic stakes further.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Mosaic note frames inciting incident (brings Kael to fortress) and final image mentions primrose petals closing while lanterns burn, echoing hidden-then-revealed pattern. Early signal strong. Closure participation weak: the note's method (tiles spelling words in light) doesn't constrain Kael's spinning choice or visibly reweight at the end. Mid-scene, mosaics function as instructional archive but the note itself becomes inert backdrop. Lyric reprise (opening mosaics → closing petals/lanterns) provides thematic echo without causal pressure. Caps at 5.9 for setup + lyric payoff without middle development.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Chanting introduced paragraph one as "old habit," recurs when Kael begins spinning, and voices the final beat's rhythm ("Three beats rise…"). Three beats. The chant enables tactic: it anchors his motion and filters his awareness toward geometry. Cost: vulnerability (chanting aloud reveals emotional state). Closure linkage: the woman completes his chant, sealing the community acceptance. Swappability moderate—another grounding ritual could substitute, though the syllable-count history ties it specifically to fireworks timing. Scores mid-6s for multi-beat presence and closure voice but modest irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Filter" appears in the mosaic note ("filter truth from ash"), the woman's explanation ("filtering our awareness differently"), Kael's internal shift ("filtering his awareness away from what had been lost"), and implied in the closure realization (new way of working). Four mentions across setup, explanation, internal turn, and closure reflection. The action shapes Kael's tactic (he redirects attention from loss to remaining skill) and the conceptual frame (community's shared practice). Causal pressure moderate: the filter concept permits rather than forces the turn. Swappability: "reframe" or "redirect" could substitute with minor edits. Scores 6.4 for pervasive presence and thematic anchoring but lacks hard physical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Ambient awareness" named explicitly once by the woman ("We work through ambient awareness now"), implied in Kael's "sensing what remains" and hands moving "without permission." Setup clear, method described mid-scene. Payoff: Kael's muscle memory and chant rhythm enact the method at closure. The means matters—bypassing conscious resistance enables the turn—but mechanics remain somewhat abstract (no specific technique demonstrated beyond "let hands remember"). Two gates (setup, closure) with thematic development. Scores 5.8 for clean signal and closure presence but modest middle constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Blooming fortress introduced title-line, grounds all action, provides mosaics (instructional resource), courtyard (performance space), and lanterns (visual closure charge). Early signal strong. Beat involvement: arrival, courtyard walk, lantern-lighting finale. The fortress supplies spatial resource (courtyard for spinning) and symbolic frame (sanctuary). Closure linkage: "blooming fortress held them" anchors final image, lanterns burn while primrose closes, enclosing the transformation. Specificity moderate: another artist sanctuary could substitute. Scores 6.7 for multi-beat presence and closure framing but lacks unique physical constraint that only this fortress enables.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Dusk" anchors opening, "hush of a night with no stars" mid-scene, "darkness deepened" and "primrose petals closed for the night" at closure. Three temporal markers. Time progression coheres (evening to night) but does not tighten decisions—Kael's choice unfolds at the pace of realization, not a live clock. The dark/light contrast (petals close, lanterns light) charges the final image thematically but imposes no urgency. Scores 4.2 for consistent presence and closure echo but lacks tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Defy the gravity of hopelessness" stated by the woman, dramatized in Kael's arrival choice (he followed the note despite dismissing it), tested when he accepts the knot (confronts fear vs. remaining passive walker), and resolved at closure (he spins, cries, laughs—chooses motion over stasis). Early signal, middle test, closure choice. Cost visible: tears, relinquishing hope of return to former self. Friction: wanting relief vs. fearing re-engagement with fire tools. Scores 7.1 for multi-beat dramatization with felt cost, though the motivation is slightly on-the-nose when named.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Serious playfulness present in opening (amber light, primrose), the woman's demeanor ("serious playfulness dancing in her eyes"), Kael's simultaneous crying/laughing, and the chant's rhythm. Tone modulates: somber at arrival, warming through courtyard description, exuberant at spinning finale. Coherence across pressure: even peak emotion (tears + laughter) maintains the double register. Closure charge: the tone's duality anchors the final image—loss acknowledged, motion embraced. Scores 7.3 for pervasive integration and modulation under pressure with strong closure linkage.</comment>
