<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's arc from thief to artist is present but lacks embodied contradiction under pressure. The moonbeam revelation ("I'm not the thief. I'm the subject") arrives via exposition rather than dramatized choice with visible cost. Celeste functions primarily as an oracle dispensing insight rather than applying pressure that forces Maya to struggle. The final walk-away feels contemplative rather than earned through on-page friction between competing impulses.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly (who/where/when by opening lines). The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural, building through moonbeam imagery and the "seventeen portraits" motif. Closure attempts Resonant Reconfiguration via the decision to paint, but the cost is asserted ("some thefts are actually homecomings") rather than felt on the page—no visible forfeiture, no path foreclosed with dramatized price. The jar's return and Maya's departure occur without friction or sacrifice that would charge the final image.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The emerald-tiled station glowing under sunset/moonlight is vivid and consistent. Spatial choreography (ticket booth, platform seven, bench, rails) tracks cleanly. The jar as micro-object constrains the handoff beat and charges the ending decision. Sensory details (amber light, silvered rails, liquid shadows) are filtered through the moment's urgency. The setting enables the choice to leave the jar and walk toward a new identity, meeting the 9+ gate for constraint/closure linkage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake (understanding her compulsion vs. creating her own illuminated moments) is signaled early. One meaningful deepening occurs when the moonbeams reveal her future as painter, narrowing options. However, the resolution lacks visible cost: Maya simply walks away, already seeing golden hour differently, with no on-page trade-off or forfeited path. The jar's return is a gesture, not a price that alters tactics or forecloses a live alternative.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme (theft as seeking vs. creating meaning, destiny as open door) emerges through the moonbeam image and portrait motif. The ending offers a non-literal answer via the walk through moonlight and tomorrow's canvas. However, the final paragraph's explicit thematic statements ("destiny's door hadn't needed her ear pressed against it. It had been open all along") replace scene pressure with moralizing, reducing resonance. The "homecomings in disguise" line is a stated thesis rather than an earned image.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable. Perceptual signature is consistent (light, crossroads, codes). Celeste's dialogue carries subtext and advances plot. The prose texture—"lunar light pooled thick as honey," "shadows into liquid pools"—is purposeful and voice-motivated. Elision of Maya's darkroom moment (the impossible portrait) is functional, priming the station revelation. Distance control is clean; no head-hopping or POV leakage.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high in early beats. However, figurative language clusters in peak moments without consistent payoff: "moonlight spilling out, coalescing into forms," "illuminated moment when someone's life had pivoted irrevocably" (abstract high-register phrasing), "quietly savvy understanding bloom" (mixed metaphor/stock phrase). Template cadence in the final paragraph: "Tomorrow she would [X]. Tomorrow she would [Y]. Tonight, she simply [Z]." These patterns dull closure propulsion, triggering −0.6 in Q7 and disallowing 9+ globally per artifact rules.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The golden-hour thief premise and moonbeam jar offer a fresh synthesis. The flower-code signal and the reveal that Maya is the painted subject provide non-obvious turns. However, the emotional arc (compulsive thief → destined artist) follows a familiar template: the protagonist discovers they were meant for creation all along. The ending's tidy transformation lacks the friction or ambiguity that would elevate originality. Specificity in setting and sensory detail rescues mid-band placement.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Maya is present throughout and makes the final choice to walk away and begin painting. However, her decisions lack on-page friction: she arrives to return the jar (off-stage decision), listens to Celeste's exposition, and then departs with new understanding. The thief role is backstory; her active choice at closure is contemplation rather than a contested turn. Two gates (setup, payoff) but minimal middle development or causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The jar appears in three beats: Maya carries it, sets it on the bench, Celeste opens and reseals it. It enables the moonbeam revelation and the handoff ritual. The jar participates in closure (Maya leaves it with Celeste), reweighting her relationship to stolen light. However, it does not constrain a contested choice—Maya's decision to leave it is uncontested. Early signal, beat involvement, closure linkage present; causal pressure modest.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>"Illuminated moments" frames the premise (golden-hour portraits, moonbeam-preserved pivots) and shapes Maya's motivation. The concept appears in reflection and dialogue but does not constrain on-page tactics. It functions more as thematic backdrop than a force that narrows options under pressure. Functional setup and thematic payoff; limited middle development or visible cost tied directly to the concept's mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Quietly savvy" appears once as a label ("Celeste had been quietly savvy enough to hide instructions") and once as abstract interiority ("quietly savvy understanding bloom"). Neither instance dramatizes a trade-off or visible cost. The trait does not constrain choice or enable a contested action. Ornamental use; swappable with "clever" or "perceptive" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Reinterpret" is stated explicitly ("I need to reinterpret what I've been doing") and drives the thematic turn from thief to subject. The action shapes Maya's understanding and the decision to paint. However, the reinterpretation occurs via Celeste's exposition rather than Maya's on-page struggle. Present in setup and payoff; modest causal pressure. Swappable with "reconsider" or "rethink" without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The flower code (lilies for return, white for truth, stems pointing northeast) appears once in the opening beat, guiding Maya to platform seven. It signals the meeting but does not return or constrain later choices. Functional setup with specificity; no middle development or closure participation. Mechanics are shown but do not shape contested attempts or the ending image.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Emerald Station is anchored early and revisited (green-tiled walls, vaulted ceiling, platforms, rails under moonlight). The setting enables the handoff ritual and final departure. The moonlight progression (sunset → dusk → moonlight) tracks time and charges the ending image. The station participates in closure as the site of transformation. Early signal, atmospheric detail, closure linkage; modest causal pressure (station as meeting-ground rather than obstacle).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Golden hour is signaled in the opening line and frames the premise (seventeen portraits, each painted at golden hour). The sunset-to-moonlight progression tracks time across the scene. However, the timeframe does not tighten tactics—no live clock forces urgency. Golden hour functions thematically (beauty, fleeting moments) rather than as a constraint. Setup and thematic payoff present; limited middle pressure or visible cost tied to elapsed time.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The motivation ("press my ear against destiny's door") is stated explicitly in dialogue and drives Maya's search for understanding. It shapes the decision to steal the moonbeams and the realization that the door was open. However, the desire is told rather than dramatized through on-page friction. No visible conflict between wants and costs; the revelation arrives via exposition. Setup, dialogue involvement, thematic payoff; modest causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Luminous disbelief" is named once ("The luminous disbelief she'd felt seeing herself as someone else's subject"). Tone is atmospheric (amber light, silvered rails, moonbeams as trapped smoke) and modulates from urgency to contemplation. However, "disbelief" does not recur or deepen under pressure. The tone is more consistently wonder and revelation than disbelief. Present in one beat; limited modulation or closure charge tied specifically to disbelief.</comment>
