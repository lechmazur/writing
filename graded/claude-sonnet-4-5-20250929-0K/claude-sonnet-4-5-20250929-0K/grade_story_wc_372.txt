<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maren's interiority is concrete and her actions align with her motivation to document fading promises. The discovery of the unwavering slide earns her small smile through prior causality—decades of meticulous work make this find meaningful. Internal contradiction is present (intimate with loss without being consumed) but could be more embodied in a peak choice. The tears moment reads genuine, though the transition to renewed purpose feels slightly expedient given the established solitude.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (reweighted purpose): Maren's work shifts from documenting fade to watching for rare endurance, with visible emotional cost (tears, allowed smile). The accumulative lens holds—density increases through measured slides building to the 528-hertz anomaly. Orientation anchors early (frozen library, Keeper Maren, her role). One meaningful deepening occurs when the extraordinary slide reframes her entire mission, though the cost could press harder on what she foregoes by staying in this isolation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The frozen library constrains Maren's work (thick wool, fingerless gloves, dangerous tears) and charges the final image (cold library becoming "briefly, impossibly golden"). Sensory detail is purposeful: quartz hush, misting breath, crack of expanding ice. The measuring device and temperature-controlled cases ground the setting in lived practice. Spatial choreography tracks clearly through the stacks, and the elevation detail (three miles above cloudline) isolates Maren in ways that matter to her choice of solitude.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: to preserve meaning at oblivion's edge. The 528-hertz slide provides one meaningful deepening that reweights Maren's understanding and forecloses pure documentation in favor of hope-watching. Agency is attention and stance crystallization (keeping the slide for herself, writing in her private journal). The cost is visible but quiet: shifting from official ledger to private record, allowing tears despite the cold. Under the accumulative lens, pressure coheres through the measuring sequence and crescendos at the extraordinary slide.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: frequencies declining versus the one that holds, official ledger versus private journal, documenting fade versus watching for endurance. The final image offers a non-literal answer to whether meaning survives memory without stating a moral. "Luminous vows" recurs with shifting weight but never as thesis. The extraordinary slide earns its thematic charge through prior measurements. Minor deduction: "proof that meaning could survive" edges toward articulation where image alone would resonate more.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV distance is stable; perceptual signature is distinct (detecting frequencies only she can hear, fountain pen despite cold). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated: "gently meticulous," "quartz hush," "luminous vows once bright, now cooling toward absolute zero." Occasional elevated register ("conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion") feels slightly authorial but remains within a solitary archivist's internal lexicon. No dialogue to judge. Narrative certainty matches what Maren can know through her instruments and experience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings shift. Information density is high: most lines advance character, atmosphere, or the measurement sequence. Minor pattern debt: "She placed it" / "She moved to" / "She came upon" template stems appear three times but don't obscure causality. The phrase "luminous vows" recurs five times, bordering on mantra but justified by Maren's professional idiom. One paraphrase moment: the paragraph beginning "While illusions fade" restates Maren's mission already shown, costing −0.2. No filter-verb stacks or metaphor muddles in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The frozen archive of broken promises is a strong synthesis; measuring frequencies of fading vows adds specificity. The 528-hertz anomaly provides a non-obvious turn within the frame. The conceptual premise (frequency as proxy for fidelity) is committed and followed through. Minor deduction: the archivist-discovers-hope-in-artifacts arc echoes familiar curatorial redemption templates, though the frequency mechanics and the detail of official versus private ledgers add fresh angles. Risk-taking in tone and pacing is modest but coherent.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's role as orderly records chief shapes all on-page choices: measuring, recording in ledger, cataloguing. Her decision to place the extraordinary slide in a private case and write in her personal journal instead of the official record is the story's key turn. The trait is causally active across beats and drives the closure choice, though the occupation itself could be any archivist role—specificity of "orderly records chief" adds flavor but isn't indispensable to the logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Magic lantern slides appear in setup (wedding scene), development (soldier slide with fractured frequency), and payoff (the extraordinary clasped-hands slide that reweights Maren's purpose). Handling is concrete: lifted from case, held to light, placed on measuring device, shelved in special case. The final slide's pure 528 Hz transforms prior material and charges the closure image. Removing this exact object—thin panes capturing promise-moments—would break the story's measurement logic and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Luminous vows shape stakes throughout: Maren measures their fade, the soldier's vow fractures on-page, and the extraordinary slide's unwavering vow redefines her mission. The concept constrains her tactics (temperature control, frequency sampling) and charges the ending (a vow that refuses to fade). It recurs as idiom across beats, anchoring the thematic question. Minor cap: while deeply integrated, the phrase itself trends slightly ornamental in middle mentions; the measurement results do the causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Gently meticulous" appears in the opening and is embodied throughout: careful lifting, precise handwriting despite cold, decades in the profession, the measuring ritual. It enables her detection of the faint hum only she hears. The trait costs her speed but ensures discovery. It's present across beats and visible in action, though the exact modifier "gently" versus "methodically" or "patiently" wouldn't alter story logic—the meticulousness matters more than the gentleness.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Measuring is the spine action: Maren measures the wedding slide (432 Hz), the soldier slide (fragmented readings), and the extraordinary slide (528 Hz singing). Each measurement produces a distinct consequence and reweights her understanding. The final measurement triggers the tears and purpose-shift that close the story. The story is structured as a measurement sequence; swapping "measure" for another verb would require reimagining the entire frequency premise. Strong causal role and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sampling frequencies is signaled early (instrument of her own design, detecting hums, recording hertz). The method matters: different readings (432 steady, 278–301–156 unstable, 528 pure) create distinct consequences. The mechanics shape Maren's attempts and her recognition that the final vow hasn't diminished. The method is irreplaceable to this story's logic, though slightly more texture on how the device works under stress or her hand movements during key measurements would deepen the causal specificity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The frozen library pressures every choice: cold stiffens joints, breath mists, tears might freeze, no wind or human sound reaches this elevation. The setting supplies resources (temperature-controlled cases, measuring device, the extraordinary slide misfiled in the stacks). The quartz hush isolates Maren in ways essential to her life choice. The final image—cold library transformed "briefly, impossibly golden"—depends on the frozen elevation and refracted light. Removing this exact setting would break the isolation logic and sensory closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"While illusions fade to memory" frames the story and Maren's mission but functions more as thematic backdrop than live pressure. The timeframe isn't tracked beat-to-beat; no urgency tightens her choices. The phrase reappears in her internal mantra and justifies the archive's existence, but she could measure slides across any duration without altering the plot. It primes the theme of endurance versus dissolution, earning mid-band, but doesn't impose a deadline or escalating cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Maren's desire to conjure meaning from oblivion's edge is dramatized across all beats: she records each fading frequency, seeks the skeleton of faith, and ultimately finds proof that some promises outlive memory. The motivation drives her solitary life choice and her decision to keep the extraordinary slide privately. Friction is present: intimacy with loss without consumption, official duty versus personal hope. The cost is visible when she allows tears and shifts to her private journal. Strong integration with closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Quartz hush" is established early (no wind, no voices, only ice cracks and pen whispers) and modulates with pressure: the 528 Hz "filled the frozen air with warmth she could almost feel," breaking the silence. The tone charges the final image—silence transformed by the singing slide, then resumed with Maren's renewed purpose. It's coherent through turns, reflects Maren's interior state, and the breach-then-return pattern supports the closure's emotional weight. The exact phrase "quartz hush" recurs, locking specificity to the setting.</comment>
