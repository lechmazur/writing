<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to document "small gestures" is stated early and shapes her walking-word ritual, but her interior life remains somewhat abstract—we get reflective observations rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The crisis-actor backstory provides ironic weight ("now no one believed her testimony"), yet this conflict never forces an on-page choice that narrows her options. The archivist arrives as a convenient ally rather than applying secondary pressure, and the partnership forms without friction or visible cost to Mira's solitary practice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates observations and images (chessboard, walking-words, nomadic penumbra) toward a thematic cadence shift rather than causal reversals. Orientation anchors (whispering gallery, interregnum, Mira) arrive early. Closure reads as Conceptual Repricing: the final image of the chessboard and "ordinary courage" reweights the premise with conceptual cost (official narrative unbinding), though the cost remains oblique and the partnership formation lacks felt friction. One meaningful deepening occurs when the archivist joins, but the transition is frictionless, limiting escalation pressure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The whispering gallery is vivid and purposeful: "stone ear," dusty skylights, and the chessboard's "luminous absence" anchor Mira's ritual spatially. The parliament's game room and the gallery's perimeter create a micro-setting that constrains her walking-word method. The setting charges the final image (dust, light, the board between them) and the gallery's acoustic design subtly mirrors the story's concern with carrying and preserving secrets. Minor: the "nomadic penumbra" zones are described but never shown pressuring a specific choice in a named district.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: to preserve "small things" as true history against official narratives. The interregnum provides situational pressure, and Mira's ritual intensifies when she finds the archivist. However, no on-page reversal or tightening forces a trade-off—she simply gains an ally who agrees with her mission. The crisis-actor irony is set up but never tested; no one challenges her testimony on the page. The accumulative lens allows for deepening through partnership, but the absence of friction or visible cost (she loses nothing, risks nothing in the encounter) keeps escalation modest.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (ordinary courage vs. grand narratives) emerges organically from the chessboard metaphor (missing pawns), the walking-words, and Mira's catalog of gestures. The final image ("luminous absence at its heart") resonates without overt moralizing, and the interregnum provides thematic pressure. The crisis-actor backstory enriches irony. Minor slip: "benevolently ruthless" and "nomadic penumbra" feel slightly ornamental—they're named but not dramatically tested. The ending offers a non-literal answer through image and recurrence, meeting the 9+ quick test, but the lack of on-page conflict dilutes the thematic stakes slightly.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and filters detail through Mira's historian lens ("spelled out the gestures," "benevolently ruthless in her documentation"). Diction is controlled and purposeful: "nomadic penumbra," "unbinding of civilization visible in how they stopped saying 'please.'" The archivist's brief dialogue feels natural and goal-driven. Perceptual signature is consistent (Mira notices small gestures, absence, light through dust). Minor: some reflection edges toward thesis statement ("These small moments, she believed, were the true history") but remains anchored to her role and the scene.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is clear and rhythmically varied with strong imagery ("stone ear," "luminous absence," "slow unbinding of civilization"). Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. No loops or scaffold detected. Minor issues: "benevolently ruthless" and "nomadic penumbra" are coined but feel slightly elevated for the POV without embodied grounding. The phrase "luminous absence" recurs but borders on thematic echo rather than fresh perception. The archivist's introduction is efficient but slightly abrupt, eliding the social negotiation of two strangers meeting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The crisis-actor/real-crisis irony is fresh, and the walking-words ritual offers a specific, non-obvious method of documentation. The chessboard metaphor (missing pawns) is apt and well-integrated. However, the interregnum setting and "historian of small gestures" premise echo familiar post-collapse templates (archivist preserving truth amid chaos). The "nomadic penumbra" coinage and "benevolently ruthless" feel crafted for ingenuity rather than organic necessity. The partnership forms without resistance, reducing risk. Transformation test: swap names/places and the emotional arc changes little.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's crisis-actor past is present by the end of the first paragraph and shapes her motivation (the irony that "no one believed her testimony"). It does not, however, drive a key turn—no one challenges her on the page, and the profession's baggage never forces a choice or alters tactics. The backstory enriches theme but remains ornamental to plot.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The chessboard appears early ("missing all the pawns"), is described in the middle third ("frozen in an impossible game"), and returns in the final image ("sat between them, its missing pawns a reminder"). It metaphorically frames the theme (small players vanished) and charges the closure. It is not handled or used to constrain a choice, limiting its causal role, but the reprise reweights prior material.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "nomadic penumbra" is coined and described in the fifth paragraph but never shown pressuring a specific choice. Mira "followed these zones" but no on-page beat demonstrates the concept altering her tactics or options. It enriches atmosphere and theme but remains swappable with "shifting zones of order" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Benevolently ruthless" is introduced in the fourth paragraph and illustrated through Mira's documentation choices (noting who hoarded, tracking vigilante transformation). It shapes her method but does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost—she records everything without trade-off. The trait is present and consistent but not tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Unbind" appears twice: "slow unbinding of civilization" (middle) and "unbinding the official narrative" (ending). The term frames Mira's project thematically and charges the closure image, but the action itself is not dramatized—no on-page moment where she or the archivist literally unbinds a record or breaks a constraint. The lyric reprise reweights the stake, but the action is metaphorical rather than causal.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The walking-word pattern is signaled early ("her footsteps forming letters only she could read from above") and returns in the collaboration scene ("Mira would walk her observations into the gallery's floor"). The archivist recognizes the method ("You're walking words"), and the ending emphasizes "she walked her truth into existence, one footstep at a time." The mechanics matter to her ritual and the closure, though the method never constrains a choice or tactic under pressure. Present across three beats and shapes the ending.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The whispering gallery is introduced in the opening line, frames every scene (Mira walks its perimeter, places the chessboard, meets the archivist there), and its acoustic design ("carry secrets") resonates with the closure theme. The setting constrains Mira's ritual spatially and charges the final image ("where secrets carried and light fell through dust like hope"). Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The interregnum is named in the second paragraph ("when no one ruled and everyone waited") and provides situational pressure throughout (soup kitchen rationing, neighborhood vigilantes, temporary leaders). It does not tighten a specific decision on the page, but it frames the stakes and the urgency of Mira's documentation project. Present across beats and implied in the closure reflection ("The interregnum would eventually end").</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mira's desire to document "small gestures" as "true history" is stated in the opening third and drives every beat: the walking ritual, the chessboard placement, her "benevolently ruthless" method, and the partnership with the archivist. The motivation is dramatized through action (walking, noting who hoarded) and shapes the closure ("walked her truth into existence"). Friction is minimal—no cost or competing want tests the desire—but the motivation is causally central.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Luminous absence" is coined in the third paragraph ("caught whatever light filtered through the dusty skylights, creating a luminous absence that matched the city itself") and recurs in the penultimate paragraph ("reveal the luminous absence at its heart"). The tone is consistent—melancholy yet hopeful, contemplative—and modulates slightly when Mira meets the archivist (collaborative warmth). The phrase charges the final image but feels slightly ornamental, as the tone does not shift under pressure or test Mira's stance.</comment>
