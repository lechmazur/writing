<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivations are clear—she wants to reunite her community through recorded song—and her decisive action (taking the cuckoo weight) drives the climax. However, her interior life reads more as curatorial mission statement than embodied contradiction; she never doubts, hesitates, or pays a visible personal cost on the page. The farmers' turn from suspicion to singing feels abrupt, summarized rather than earned through resistance or misunderstanding. The ending gesture ("smiled, already planning") flattens what could be Charged Poise into tidy satisfaction without foreclosing a path or naming what she gave up.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation is clean (tower librarian, midnight, valley below), and the causal chain from grain-hum observation to weight-attachment to community singing is legible. The closure moment—farmers walking between silos, teaching songs—does show a Decisive Change in the valley's social fabric, and Mara's theft of the weight carries a stated cost ("she'd have to explain that to the historical society eventually"). Yet that cost remains prospective and offstage; the on-page consequence is pure gain, which softens the closure's bite. The drive lens reads Causal with an Accumulative overlay (layered languages), held adequately but without a final tightening that narrows options.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The astronomical clock tower is vividly anchored (brass gears, glass dome, spiral stairs, meteor-iron weight), and the grain elevators' ventilation shafts and different pitches (wheat alto, corn bass, rye soprano) create a micro-setting that directly enables Mara's solution. The cuckoo weight's physical heft and pendulum function constrain her choice—she must carry it down and attach it to regulate airflow—charging the final image of the valley singing. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (choral training makes footsteps rhythmic), and the tower/silo geography remains coherent across moves.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—reconnecting an isolated community—is signaled early and sustained. Mara's decision to take the weight and descend creates one meaningful tightening: she risks historical-society censure and the tower clock's precision. But the opposition is atmospheric (suspicion, silence) rather than active resistance; no farmer objects, no technology fails, no secondary pressure complicates the climb. The resolution unfolds as immediate success without setback, and the stated cost ("she'd have to explain that") remains future-tense, not paid on the page. Escalation is present but soft.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—harmony forged from isolation through one person's risk—emerges from concrete acts (attaching the weight, layering recordings) rather than abstraction, and the grain elevators' literal song avoids allegorical flatness by grounding the metaphor in ventilation physics. The line "sometimes bridges required one person willing to risk disharmony to find deeper harmony" edges toward thesis statement but remains embedded in reflection rather than dialogue. The final image (cuckoo weight swinging, Mara planning tomorrow's composition) reweights the tower's role from preservation to conducting, offering a resonant answer without overt moral. No motif is token; each object (weight, recordings, elevators) participates causally.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Mara; no head-hopping. Diction is elevated but consistent ("hush of borrowed starlight," "empathetically decisive," "calcify further into isolation"), reading as a narrator slightly above Mara's register yet anchored in her choral/curatorial expertise. The phrase "empathetically decisive because she had to be" and "construct bridges from their isolation" veer toward prompt-label echo, but the narration integrates them as reflection rather than dialogue, mitigating the intrusion. Perceptual signature is clear (she hears rhythm, catalogs by harmony), and the prose modulates from lyric stillness (tower work) to vigorous action (descent, attachment) without losing coherence. Brief dialogue (farmers singing along) is natural and goal-free, serving atmosphere rather than plot.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies across paragraphs, and information density is generally high (each detail—meteor iron, ventilation fan, wireless speakers—advances the mechanics). However, paraphrase loops appear: "grain elevator talks" is restated in "silos wanted… to harmonize," and "interspersing languages" is explained twice (once as method, again in the descent scene). Template cadence runs in the middle third: "She began composing… She layered… threading in…" followed by "Her eyes fell… She lifted… feeling…" The phrase "harmonious choral librarian" in the penultimate paragraph feels like scaffold, labeling her role rather than showing it. Filter-verb density ("she understood," "she watched") is moderate but not clustered enough to trigger the stack penalty. Closure image (weight swinging, Mara smiling) is clean and propulsive, limiting non-closure deductions to −0.8 for loops and stems.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—grain silos hum, librarian uses recordings and a clock weight to harmonize them—offers a fresh synthesis of music, architecture, and community repair. The ventilation-shaft mechanism and the weight's regulatory function show specific world logic rather than magic-wand convenience. Yet the core arc (lone curator fixes fractured village through art and ingenuity) maps closely to template "artist heals community" plots, and the resolution's frictionless success (no failure, no reversal, no one resists) pulls toward the safety middle. The meteor-iron weight and Polish/Vietnamese/Spanish layering add texture, but the emotional stakes and moral calculus remain legible from the opening paragraph, offering no surprise in hindsight. Risk is present in the tower-to-valley descent, but the payoff is immediate and uncontested.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara the harmonious choral librarian appears in paragraph one, frames the central goal (rehabilitate fractured community via curated voices), makes the key decision (take the weight, descend, attach it), and conducts the final image (valley singing, planning tomorrow's composition). Her choices create the inciting observation (grain hum), the escalation (layering languages), and the climax (weight attachment). Removing her exact role—choral training informing rhythm perception, librarian access to recordings—would collapse the causal chain. She is present and decisive across setup, middle choice, and closure, with visible cost (historical-society debt) stated on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The cuckoo clock weight is introduced early (paragraph six: "ancient, carved from meteor iron"), handled in two distinct beats (lifted from the tower, attached to the ventilation fan), and its specific property (steady pendulum regulating airflow) enables the climax. The weight's absence from the tower is noted at closure ("mechanisms still precise even without the cuckoo weight"), reweighting its symbolic role from timekeeping to community pulse. The object is irreplaceable—its meteor iron and historical mass matter to Mara's calculation and the tower's sacrifice. Cost is tied directly to its removal (she'll have to explain). All three gates met; high causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Grain elevators talking is signaled by paragraph four ("Then the grain elevators began to talk"), mechanized via ventilation-shaft vibrations and pitch variation (wheat alto, corn bass, rye soprano), and drives Mara's entire tactical plan: she must regulate airflow and layer recordings to let silos "dialogue." The concept shapes every middle beat (composing, descending, attaching the weight) and the closure image (silos singing through winter, farmers teaching songs). Removing this exact concept—grain as choir—breaks the story's logic. Setup, development, and payoff are clear; causal pressure is strong; specificity (different grains, different pitches) is high.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Empathetically decisive" is stated once in the climactic paragraph ("she had been empathetically decisive because she had to be") and tied to the choice to act without consensus. The trait enables the weight-theft and unilateral deployment of speakers, constraining her to solo risk. However, the label arrives late (60% mark) and is told rather than shown through contradictory impulses or embodied hesitation earlier. The cost (waiting would mean calcification) is conceptual and retrospective, not a visible tradeoff in scene. The attribute is functional but borderline ornamental; it could be swapped for "bold" or "unilateral" with minor edits. Setup is weak; development and payoff are present but thin.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rehabilitate—Mara's stated mission—frames the opening ("worked to rehabilitate what her community had fractured") and drives every major turn: cataloging folk melodies, composing the layered recordings, descending with the weight, watching farmers reconnect. The action is specific (not "heal" or "restore") and tied to the valley's fracture (isolation symbolized by silos). The ending directly shows rehabilitation on the page (farmers walking between silos, teaching songs, "community learning to sing together"). Removing this exact verb and replacing it with a generic goal would weaken thematic coherence but not break causality; still, it shapes the closure image unmistakably. Early signal, beat involvement, closure linkage, and cost connection all present.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Interspersing languages is introduced in paragraph seven ("began composing at dawn, interspersing languages with empathetic decisiveness") and demonstrated in beat: Polish lullabies, Vietnamese fishing songs, Spanish chants, Arabic prayers. The method is mechanized (wireless speakers on each elevator) and drives the climax (recordings dialogue with grain's song). However, the actual layering occurs off-page between paragraphs, and the piece does not show Mara testing, failing, or adjusting the mix—only that "something was missing" until she adds the weight. The method is present and causal but secondary to the weight; swapping "interspersing" for "blending" or "weaving" would not alter the plot. Setup and payoff are clear; middle development is thin. Cap at 6.9 for minimal mid-scene use.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The astronomical clock tower frames the opening (brass gears, spiral stairs, glass dome), houses the cuckoo weight (the key resource Mara extracts), and provides the vantage for the closure image (Mara watching the valley transform). The tower's height and isolation mirror the community's fracture, and its mechanism room supplies the weight that solves the problem. Spatial choreography is clear (climb stairs, descend to valley, climb back to watch). The tower is not merely postcard description; it constrains Mara's access to the weight and charges the final image (she returns to the tower, clock still precise). Setup, development (weight extraction), and payoff (return vantage) all present; causal pressure moderate; specificity high.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Under the hush of borrowed starlight" appears twice (opening and penultimate paragraph), establishing a nocturnal, meditative timeframe. Mara climbs "each midnight," and "that night" she descends with the weight; the astronomical clock "struck three" at closure. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—Mara has leisure to compose "at dawn," descend "that night," and watch "through the winter." No clock pressure, no deadline, no urgency derived from the hour. The phrase is evocative but ornamental; swapping "starlight" for "moonlight" or removing the time cue would not alter stakes. Setup and lyric reprise present; middle constraint absent. Cap at 4.9 for ornamental use.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's desire "to construct bridges from silos" is stated in paragraph three ("to construct bridges from their isolation") and dramatized through her cataloging, composing, and weight-deployment. The friction between wants (reunite community) and cost (tower clock precision, historical-society debt) is named on the page, and the final image shows the motivation fulfilled (farmers teaching songs, silos no longer lonely). However, the internal conflict is thin—Mara never doubts or fears failure; she "understood immediately" and acts without hesitation. The motivation is setup early, drives all beats, and shapes closure, but the lack of contradictory impulses or visible struggle keeps it from the highest band. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage; moderate cost connection.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Tone modulates from meditative hush (opening tower work: "whispered secrets," "borrowed starlight") to vigorous action (descent and attachment: "immediate and vigorous," "unprecedented sound") to tender closure (silos "no longer lonely," "tender now"). The shift from isolation to connection is mirrored in tonal warmth. However, the vigorous beat is brief (one paragraph), and the piece returns quickly to lyric stillness without sustaining urgency. The final image ("Mara smiled, already planning") reads as satisfied rather than charged, softening the tenderness. Tone is coherent and purposeful but does not reach the final line with undeniable pressure; it resolves into calm rather than crystallizing stakes. Closure participation is moderate.</comment>
