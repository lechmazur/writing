<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's internal contradiction between professional expertise and emerging moral doubt is embodied through concrete sensory actions (static electricity, blotter manipulation). The shift from counterfeiting easy lies to creating "something more honest" is earned through accumulative pressure rather than epiphany. Minor slip: "affectionate detachment" appears twice as a label without sufficient behavioral grounding in the middle section. The final choice feels motivated by the amber's metaphoric pressure rather than pure character agency, but the renunciation is legible and carries cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly within the first paragraph (who, where, when). The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the amber's transformative properties accumulate meaning across three beats (initial sensing, deeper structural reading, final remake decision) and the closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration—Mara's small change in the blotter's emotional content reweights her professional identity with visible cost (she delivers a weaker product). The cost is legible: "acknowledgment of the wish to forgive" is explicitly less effective than the false forgiveness, and "already knowing what would come next" implies professional consequences.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The amber grotto functions as more than backdrop: its resinous walls and static electricity constrain Mara's method, and the fossilized insects provide the metaphoric frame for transformation-through-time that charges her final choice. Sensory details (dusk light, resinous walls, electric whisper) filter through Mara's professional perception. The micro-setting (grotto interior vs. exterior where Therese waits) spatially encodes the choice between isolation and engagement. One minor slip: "ancient joy, prehistoric fear, millennia-old contentment" reads as catalog rather than POV-specific selection.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether to deliver authentic emotion or professionally useful lies—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens through three moves: Therese's request establishes the ethical problem, the amber's transformation offers a reframing lens, and Mara's remake decision narrows options (she delivers a less effective product with professional consequences hinted in "already knowing what would come next"). The cost is legible: she forfeits professional thoroughness for moral honesty. Under the Accumulative lens, the pressure deepens rather than reverses, and the final choice forecloses the path of pure counterfeit.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the amber's dual nature (neither living nor dead, neither past nor present) rather than statement. The final image—Mara handing over a half-truth "that pointed toward a whole one"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the authenticity/artifice question without moralizing. The story resists binary resolution: her choice is neither full honesty nor pure lie, mirroring the amber's liminal state. The "space between authenticity and artifice...was where transformation actually lived" risks explicitness but is earned by prior concrete work with static electricity and resin.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited remains stable with clean focalization through Mara's professional lens. Perceptual signature is strong: she reads emotions as "electrical residue," filters amber through molecular chemistry, and evaluates her work with craft terminology. Voice modulates effectively from clinical assessment ("professionally thorough work") to emerging doubt ("And yet"). Minor weakness: "affectionate detachment" appears as direct label twice without sufficient behavioral anchoring, and the phrase "subsume countless insects" uses an unexpected register (the verb "subsume" feels elevated for the moment's texture).</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance through sensory detail and metaphor simultaneously. Rhythm varies effectively between short declaratives ("It was still a lie") and longer accumulative sentences. Two distinct issues lower the score: (1) "affectionate detachment" appears identically twice, creating a label loop; (2) the phrase "As the transformation completes, she thought, reading the electrical signature" embeds an incomplete sentence fragment awkwardly. The opening and closing images are strong, and no major clarity issues obscure causality. Total deduction: −0.8 for two distinct patterns (label repetition, fragment awkwardness).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise—emotion counterfeiting via olfactory chemistry—offers a fresh synthesis of sensory trade and moral choice. The amber grotto as workshop/metaphor avoids generic settings. The transformation from false-forgiveness to acknowledged-wish-to-forgive is a subtle, non-obvious turn that grows from the resin's metaphoric pressure rather than external reversal. Risk is present in the quiet, accumulative structure and the refusal of confrontation scene. Minor limitation: the "static electricity as emotion-sensing" method is introduced cleanly but could bear more mechanical specificity to deepen irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara the counterfeit emotion dealer is present from the title beat, drives all three major choices (initial sensing, deeper amber reading, blotter remake), and her professional identity is reweighted at closure. The final decision—to deliver honest incompleteness rather than false completion—is causally rooted in her accumulated perception of the amber's transformation. Cost is visible: she sacrifices professional effectiveness. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met; causal pressure is strong; closure linkage is direct.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The fragrance chemist's blotter petal appears in three distinct beats: initial description (paragraph 3), Mara lifting it to assess (paragraph 7), and the final remake/handoff (paragraphs 9–11). Its physical properties (absorbent, stained edges, thumbnail size) enable the plot's central mechanism. The remake action—changing the emotional cocktail—directly shapes closure. Specificity is high (the object's craft origin and repurposing are clear), and cost is tied to it (the altered blotter carries reduced efficacy). Minor cap: while essential, a non-paper medium could hypothetically work with heavier edits, keeping it below 8.5.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Half-truths structure the entire narrative: Mara's business model (paragraph 4), the initial blotter cocktail (paragraph 3), and the pivotal shift to "an acknowledgment of the wish to forgive...a half-truth...that pointed toward a whole one" (paragraph 10). The concept constrains her final choice—she cannot deliver full forgiveness (unavailable) or pure lie (newly unacceptable)—and the cost is legible in the weaker product. Setup and payoff are strong; development is present in her reflection on "necessary lies" versus emerging doubt. The concept shapes stakes and tactics across all major beats.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Professionally thorough" appears three times as a descriptor and shapes her method (seven years of perfected technique, detailed blotter assessment). It constrains the final choice: she applies that same thoroughness to the remake, maintaining craft standards while altering content. However, the trait functions more as consistent characterization than as a lived tradeoff with visible cost; it does not force her to sacrifice speed, accuracy, or another value on the page. Setup and payoff are present; closure linkage is weak. Two beats (initial work, final remake) involve it, lifting it past mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Subsume" appears once in a key metaphoric sentence: "The resin had subsume countless insects...and transformed." This image seeds the transformation logic that Mara applies to her own work, but the verb itself does not recur or drive a physical action. The concept of subsumption (taking in and altering) is thematically active and shapes her final reframing, but the exact action is not repeated or mechanically essential. Setup (mid-story) and thematic payoff are present; middle development as a constraining action is absent. Lyric resonance is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Static electricity sensing is introduced in paragraph 1, used in two distinct beats (initial surface reading, deeper structural sensing in paragraph 6), and retrospectively charged in the final paragraph ("static electricity still humming in her bones...taught her something"). The method is specific to Mara's skillset and enables both the initial assessment and the metaphoric breakthrough. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met. Minor limitation: the mechanics remain somewhat abstract (how does static convey molecular structure?), reducing irreplaceability slightly. Still, removing it would collapse the causal chain.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The amber grotto at dusk provides the extended metaphor (resin transformation under pressure and time) that reframes Mara's choice. The setting's sensory details (resinous walls, fading light, static-charged surfaces) are filtered through her professional perception and constrain her method (she must touch the walls to sense). The dusk timeframe creates atmospheric pressure and mirrors the transformation's liminal state. Setup, development, and payoff are all present; the grotto's properties directly enable the final cognitive turn. The setting is not purely postcard; it supplies both resource (metaphor) and method (tactile sensing).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"As the transformation completes" appears once as a direct phrase (paragraph 6) and structures the implicit urgency: Therese waits outside, her mother is dying, and Mara's window to remake the blotter is narrow. The timeframe metaphor (millions of years for amber vs. hours for counterfeits) is thematically active. However, the clock itself does not tighten tactics on the page—Mara does not rush, weigh time costs, or face a visible deadline consequence. Setup and thematic payoff are present; middle development as a tactical constraint is weak. Lyric resonance lifts it past mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"To fuse insight with empathy" is articulated once (paragraph 6: "the desire to fuse insight with empathy, to bridge the impossible distance") and dramatized in the final choice: Mara's remake attempts to bridge the gap between Therese's current state and her mother's need without falsifying. The motivation is conflicted—she has "affectionate detachment" and recognizes her counterfeits as lies, yet she seeks a middle path. Setup is mid-story; development and payoff are clear. The friction between professional detachment and emerging conscience creates visible cost at closure. Two beats (amber reflection, final remake) are driven by this desire.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Affectionate detachment" appears as a direct label twice (paragraphs 4 and 11, framing and closing). The tone is embodied in Mara's clinical assessment of Therese's emotions ("a tangle...observed with affectionate detachment") and her coolly precise remaking process. The tone modulates subtly: early detachment is confident, final detachment carries ambivalence ("already knowing what would come next" implies consequence). The phrase charges the final image by reappearing after the moral shift, showing the tone persists despite the choice's cost. Setup, development, and payoff are present; coherence through turns is strong; closure charge is moderate to high.</comment>
