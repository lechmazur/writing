<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's curator identity is established early and her breakthrough follows a consistent pattern (bathroom revelations). Her micro-choices—pacing, cataloging, soaking—show embodied pressure. However, the final acceptance ("she would tend these impossible trees") feels more like settled contemplation than a choice that forecloses a path with visible cost. The interiority remains abstract at key moments ("disquiet that had settled in her chest"), missing the contradictory impulses that would elevate characterization into the high band.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of nonlinear inheritance and temporal folding, then deepens it through bathroom-epiphany and the cameo blank discovery. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maya understands her role in the inheritance chain and accepts the blank shell's purpose with visible conceptual cost—she must fill it with forbidden knowledge during her tenure "between arrival and ending." Orientation anchors arrive promptly (conservatory dome, astral orchard, asteroid). One meaningful deepening occurs when she connects "first and last page" to her own temporal span. The cost is felt but could be sharper on the page—no immediate forfeiture or tactical shift, only acceptance of future obligation.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The astral orchard is vividly rendered with selective detail: peach trees drinking starlight through crystalline substrate, pistachio shells as micro-etchings, a mirror showing three-second-delayed reflections. The bathroom functions as micro-setting, constraining her breakthrough moment and tying to her established pattern. The spiral arrangement of trees guides her to the central pistachio, shaping the discovery beat. The setting charges the final image—phosphorescent twilight and impossible fruit frame her acceptance—meeting the 9+ gate test for Q3.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: understanding the inheritance and finding the cameo blank. Pressure accumulates through bewilderment → cataloging → breakthrough → discovery. One meaningful deepening occurs when Maya realizes "first and last page" are temporal, narrowing her search to the spiral center. However, the escalation is primarily cognitive; no external opposition or internal want-versus-fear friction sharpens the choice. The resolution (accepting the blank shell) is contemplative rather than a decision that forecloses options with immediate on-page cost. Entering 8.0+ typically requires a live trade-off; here the cost is deferred ("during her tenure").</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: nonlinear inheritance as knowledge flowing backward, forbidden truths carved into disposable shells, museums as pursuit versus cultivation. The bathroom-breakthrough motif recurs with purpose, shaping Maya's recognition. The final image—someone future-perpendicular learning "in steam and silence"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. One slip: "simply complicated" appears twice as a phrase without sufficient dramatic grounding, bordering on thematic echo. The piece resists tidy morals and invites reflection on curatorial versus custodial knowledge, meeting most high-band tests.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV distance is stable; Maya's perceptual signature (curator's lens, bathroom-epiphany pattern) is consistent. Diction is controlled and purposeful ("phosphorescence," "loam of crushed starlight"). However, register drifts into elevated abstraction at key beats: "the vulnerability of hot water and solitude," "channels of time's own strange fruit." These phrases feel ornamental rather than character-specific under pressure. The final paragraph's syntax ("only cultivated, only lived, only passed along") employs purposeful repetition but risks rhythmic sameness. No dialogue present to evaluate. Free indirect style is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "fear itself had learned to phosphoresce," "soil of crushed starlight," "water spiraling up a drain." Several metaphors blur under scrutiny (phosphorescent fear; spiraling upward against gravity). The phrase "simply complicated" recurs without concrete grounding, reading as placeholder. Paraphrase loop near the end: "only cultivated, only lived, only passed along" restates the same concept three ways without added pressure. Template cadence in the exposition-heavy opening ("She had inherited... who had inherited... who hadn't been born yet") stacks clauses mechanically. These artifacts pervade but do not fully obscure causality, staying within the Q7-only penalty range (−0.8 for density + coherence + loop).</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of astral horticulture, nonlinear inheritance, and bathroom epiphanies is specific and non-obvious. The pistachio-shell library transforms the tired "forbidden knowledge" trope through embodied particulars (microscopic etchings, disposable objects in an impossible place). However, the core emotional arc—bewildered heir accepts mysterious legacy—follows a familiar template without sharp moral calculus or lived friction. The mirror showing three-second-delayed reflections is a vivid detail that shapes one beat (bath scene) but could constrain more choices. Risk-taking in structure (temporal folding, reflective mode) is coherent but not bold enough to earn the upper band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya (bewildered curator) is present throughout and her curatorial lens shapes several beats: cataloging trees, recognizing the spiral as chronology, lifting the blank shell "with curator's hands." Her choices—pacing, soaking, kneeling—drive the discovery sequence. However, her final decision (accepting the role) is contemplative rather than a turn that alters tactics or forecloses a path with immediate cost. Present in setup, middle, and ending; constrains one key beat (spiral recognition); closure linkage is weak (acceptance without tactical shift). Three gates met but causal pressure is modest.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The pistachio shell cameo blank is introduced obliquely in the letter (first third), becomes the object of search (middle), and is held at the end with recognition of its purpose. Handled in three beats: letter mention, scattered shells beneath the tree, lifting the blank. The blank's unique property (waiting for her contribution) is specific and irreplaceable. It charges the final image and ties to the inheritance theme. Setup, development, and payoff gates are met; beat involvement is strong; closure linkage is present but the shell is not causally active in the final image—Maya holds it and understands it, but no tactical cost is shown. Score reflects solid integration with modest closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Nonlinear inheritance (core concept) frames the premise in the opening (inherited from an aunt never met, from a cousin not yet born) and is restated at closure ("passed backward and forward through bloodlines that tangled through time"). It shapes Maya's stake—understanding the inheritance—and the concept of "first and last page" as temporal bookends drives her breakthrough. However, the concept operates mostly at the thematic level; it does not constrain moment-to-moment tactics or force a visible trade-off on the page. Setup and payoff gates met; middle development is weak (cataloging trees does not engage nonlinearity). Two of three gates plus thematic reprising places this in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Simply complicated" appears twice as a label (letter description, final paragraph) but never constrains an on-page action or enables a choice with cost. It functions as thematic shorthand rather than a trait that shapes tactics. No setup (first mention is ~10% in via letter), no middle constraint, no closure action tied to it. Ornamental use; swappable with any paradoxical phrase. Scores in the ornamental/label-only band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>Inquire (action): Maya's desire to "inquire with someone, anyone" is mentioned once in the fourth paragraph, immediately blocked by malfunctioned communications. The action is not attempted on the page and does not shape any beat. No setup signal, no middle development, no closure participation. The word "inquire" does not recur; the concept of seeking answers is present throughout but not tied to this verb or method. Absent from all three gates; mentioned but not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Having philosophical breakthroughs in bathrooms: signaled early (third night in the copper tub) and tied to Maya's history (museum forgery realization, Mesopotamian tablets, marriage ending). The method is dramatized in one key beat—soaking leads to understanding that "first and last page" are temporal. This breakthrough drives the spiral-search tactic and the discovery. However, the method does not recur or shape the ending; the final image is in the orchard, not the bathroom. Setup and development gates met; payoff absent. Lyric reprise weak (steam and silence mentioned at the end but not as Maya's action). Scores in the purposeful-middle-use band with modest causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Astral orchard on a lonely asteroid: present throughout, frames every beat, and supplies concrete resources (spiral tree arrangement guides search, pistachio shells beneath the tree, starlight as substrate). The setting defies physics in ways that charge the premise ("trees shouldn't exist here"). Micro-setting (cottage, bathroom, spiral center) constrains choices. The orchard is indispensable to closure—Maya's final stance is to "tend these impossible trees" and the phosphorescent twilight frames the ending image. Setup, development, and payoff gates all met; causal pressure high; closure linkage strong. Irreplaceable; removing the orchard would collapse the story's logic and final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Between the first and last page (timeframe): the phrase is central to the puzzle and Maya's breakthrough ("the orchard existed between her arrival and her death"). It shapes one key beat (realization) and is restated at closure ("between their first and last page"). However, no live clock or ticking pressure emerges; the timeframe operates as metaphor rather than constraint. Setup weak (timeframe is implicit but not foregrounded until the letter clue); development is the breakthrough beat; payoff is thematic restatement. Two gates met via lyric reprise; causal pressure modest. Scores in the single-turn band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>To pursue forbidden knowledge (motivation): implied throughout (finding the cameo blank, understanding the library of "what shouldn't be known," accepting the role of adding her own forbidden truth). The motivation is told more than shown—no moment where Maya weighs the cost of knowing versus not knowing, or where desire conflicts with fear. The forbidden nature of the knowledge is asserted but not dramatized as a friction point. Setup present (letter instructions), development weak (discovery is cognitive, not conflicted), payoff present (acceptance of the blank shell's purpose). Two gates met; causal pressure modest; no visible want-versus-cost struggle on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Brightened disquiet (tone): established early ("the disquiet that had settled in her chest since arriving felt somehow bright, as if fear itself had learned to phosphoresce") and sustained through bewilderment, cataloging, and breakthrough. The tone modulates with pressure—bewilderment sharpens to purpose, disquiet shifts to acceptance—and the final image recharges it ("The disquiet remained but no longer frightened her"). The oxymoronic quality (bright fear, phosphorescent dread) is integrated into the astral-orchard aesthetic. Coherent through turns, charges the ending, and the tonal signature is irreplaceable. Setup, development, and payoff gates met; strong closure linkage.</comment>
