<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Aldric's motivation is clear and his technical competence well-established through specific action (jeweler's loupe examination, meteoric tuning fork). The forget-me-not serves as an external compass rather than forcing internal contradiction, which flattens his interior conflict. The peak choice—completing the transmutation rather than simple removal—shows professional judgment but lacks visceral cost or competing impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Minor craft debt: "worry-worn eyes" is a stock descriptor that doesn't reveal the duchess through Aldric's particular lens.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal. Orientation anchors (who, where, task) land cleanly by the third paragraph. The central problem—music box steals joy via failed transmutation—motivates the repair sequence through clear because/therefore links: fragment discovered → covenant identified → correct transmutation applied → balance restored. Closure is a Decisive Change with visible cost (the transformation from crimson to clear, wilted flower blooming). One meaningful tightening when Aldric realizes removal won't work and must complete the transmutation. Modest slip: the duchess's "worry-worn eyes" phrase and the final paragraph's slight tell-drift ("small magics that repair the world") soften the ending's concrete charge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The resonance chamber functions as micro-setting that enables the repair: "sound accumulated and amplified, notes building upon themselves until they achieved a kind of physical weight." Sensory detail is purposeful (lantern light on mahogany, shimmer of interference patterns) and filtered through Aldric's professional attention. The forget-me-not and the tools (meteoric tuning fork, dawn-oils) constrain his method and charge the final transformation. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the single-location scene. The chamber's acoustic properties directly enable the solution, meeting the 9+ gate criterion.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—restore the box without spreading corruption—is signaled early and tightens when Aldric realizes simple removal would fail. The problem escalates through his agency: discovery of philosopher's stone → recognition of covenant → choice to complete rather than extract. One meaningful reversal (can't remove, must transmute) narrows options under causal pressure. Visible cost is present but modest: the transformation requires specialized knowledge and the resonance chamber's unique properties. The "balance restored" phrasing in the final movement slightly abstracts what should remain concrete.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of repair-as-completion emerges through concrete particulars: the failed transmutation, the covenant of rust, the distinction between "perfect and profoundly broken." The forget-me-not's response to dishonesty and its blooming at resolution enacts rather than states the thematic question. Modest slip: "small magics that repair the world one gear at a time" in the final paragraph edges toward summary statement rather than letting the transformed music box image speak. The "tinkersong wonder" phrase carries conceptual weight but borders on prompt-label territory without full embodiment in scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and filtered through Aldric's professional lens: jeweler's loupe, understanding of resonance, recognition of philosopher's stone. Perceptual signature is consistent—he notices mechanism details, acoustic properties, alchemical traces. Diction fits the artisan-scholar register throughout. Minor register wobble: "the space between function and purpose" and "tinkersong wonder" tilt slightly abstract for the otherwise concrete technical voice, though they remain within plausible reach. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. The duchess appears only in reported speech, keeping focalization clean.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean with strong rhythmic control and purposeful detail. Information density is high: most sentences advance understanding of problem or solution. Modest loop/scaffold issues: "the melody darkened rooms, that candles guttered" and "light stolen by midnight" recur without added pressure; "whispered" and "worry-worn" are stock descriptors. The phrase "a testament to the small magics that repair the world one gear at a time" in the closing verges on abstraction that dulls the concrete image of echoes singing. Figurative language (covenant of rust, oxidized joy) is coherent and purpose-driven. No grammatical errors or unclear pronoun references.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The synthesis of music-box repair with alchemical transmutation and acoustic resonance offers a specific, non-obvious frame. "Covenant of rust" and "mending what isn't torn" transform familiar fantasy-repair tropes through the particular physics of the resonance chamber. Derivative pressure: the artisan-healer premise and the "small object holds dark magic" setup are widely used templates; the story elevates them through technical specificity (interference patterns, dawn-oil, meteoric tuning fork) but doesn't fully escape the archetype. The tinkersong-wonder frame risks whimsy-label territory. Transformation is present but not radical; swapping to another magical-craft repair would preserve most structural beats.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aldric present throughout; his choices create all key turns: examines mechanism, identifies philosopher's stone, decides against removal, applies correct transmutation method. Development and payoff gates fully met. Setup implicit in opening descent. Causal pressure high; his professional knowledge and tools are irreplaceable. Closure depends entirely on his action. Minor cap consideration: early setup could be slightly sharper (he's named and established as repairman but his decision-making role is clearest only after problem identification).</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Philosopher's stone fragment discovered mid-scene, functions in two beats: identification of problem cause and transformation during resolution. It enables the specific method (must complete transmutation, not extract) and its color shift (crimson → gold → amber → clear) charges the closure image. Late first appearance (~40% mark) and the fact that a similar magical-corruption token could substitute with minor edits cap the score below 8.5. Causal pressure is strong; cost connection clear (wrong transmutation caused the problem, correct one resolves it).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Covenant of rust" shapes the central problem: a binding that corrodes goodness and cannot be simply removed. It constrains Aldric's method (must complete, not extract) and appears in both diagnosis and resolution beats. The phrase is evocative and the concept changes tactics on the page. Setup and payoff gates met; development present in the middle explanation. Swappability consideration: "curse," "binding," or "corruption" could replace it with modest rewrite, though the rust metaphor (oxidized joy) does specific work. Reaches mid-6s on two-gate participation and causal constraint but not higher due to replaceability.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The forget-me-not wilts near the music box's dishonesty (failed transmutation) and blooms when balance is restored. Present in two beats: problem confirmation and resolution. The attribute enables measurement but doesn't constrain a choice with visible cost—it's a diagnostic tool, not a forcing function. Setup and payoff gates met; no middle development. Lyric reprise (wilted → blooming) reweights the ending image with modest charge. Functional but somewhat replaceable (another truth-indicator could serve); its specific property (wilting) is used but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Tether" appears implicitly when Aldric identifies that the philosopher's stone "tethered the music to midnight's essence, creating a bridge between the box and darkness." This diagnosis shapes his method (must sever/complete the binding). Present in middle explanation but not in opening setup or explicit final action—the resolution is "transmutation" and "unravel," not "tether" itself. One causal beat where the concept narrows options. Swappable with "binding" or "link" without major structural loss. Reaches mid-6s on one-gate participation and modest causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Mending what isn't torn" is signaled early ("fixing a wound that existed in the space between function and purpose") and directly shapes his method: he cannot remove the stone because the mechanism is mechanically perfect. The concept drives the central tactical choice (complete transmutation rather than extract) and is implicit in the closure (transformation, not removal). Setup, development, and payoff gates met. The phrase itself appears early and the concept is active in two beats. Causal pressure is strong; irreplaceability high (the specific paradox defines the problem type). Reaches 7+ on full gate participation and causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Resonance chamber introduced in opening and provides the essential resource: "sound accumulated and amplified, notes building upon themselves until they achieved a kind of physical weight." Aldric's method depends on this property (interference patterns from tuning fork + music box). Present in setup (location established), development (chamber's acoustic properties explained), and payoff (the transformation requires resonance). The chamber is irreplaceable; the repair could not occur elsewhere. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity. Final echoes "continued to sing" in closing image. Reaches high 8s on full integration and necessity.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"In the balance" as timeframe is thematic (balance must be restored) but not a live temporal constraint. No clock or deadline tightens decisions. The repair unfolds in a single continuous scene without time pressure or urgency beyond the duchess's prior suffering (off-page). Present as metaphor in closure language ("balance had been restored") but does not shape tactics. Setup and payoff gates weakly met through thematic echo; no middle development. Swappable phrasing. Scores low-4s on ornamental presence without tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Reclaim the light stolen by midnight" is the duchess's framing and Aldric's implicit goal throughout. Motivation shapes his refusal of simple extraction (which would leave corruption spreading) and drives the completion method. Present in setup (duchess's description), development (diagnosis of light-theft mechanism), and payoff ("midnight's theft reversed, light reclaimed"). The desire is enacted through problem-solving rather than interior conflict, which keeps it functional but less charged. Reaches low-7s on clear goal-pursuit across beats with modest cost visibility (professional stakes, not personal).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Tinkersong wonder" is named once explicitly and evoked through the artisan-craft frame: gears singing particular notes, small magics, mechanisms singing true purpose. Tone is coherent through the repair sequence and modulates appropriately (problem diagnosis is sober, resolution lifts). The phrase "tinkersong wonder" appears during peak transmutation beat and charges the moment. Present in setup (satchel that "clinked with tiny gears...each one singing"), development (implicit in careful craft), and payoff (echoes "continued to sing"). Reaches mid-6s on atmospheric consistency and final-image charge but remains somewhat label-dependent rather than fully enacted through rhythm and diction alone.</comment>
