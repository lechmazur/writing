<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The painter's interiority shows some embodied pressure—insomnia as vigil, the tingling recognition—but the internal contradiction remains largely told ("meaning had become slippery") rather than dramatized through incompatible impulses acting simultaneously. Marcus functions primarily as exposition vehicle; his dialogue delivers world-building but rarely applies immediate pressure that forces the painter into a choice with cost. The final "ready to sleep" shift is stated rather than earned through a foregrounded micro-choice that visibly forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: rain-trail patterns accrue meaning through repeated following until the cave convergence reweights "unearthed convergence" from mystical to memorial. Orientation anchors arrive cleanly (painter, island, dawn, post-war). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration—"communion rather than curse"—with felt cost (four sleepless nights, the artist's isolation). One friction: the brooch discovery and cave revelation feel more juxtaposed than causally tightened; the middle beats accrue texture without a sharp narrowing of options before the final reprice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tidal causeway, limestone caves, ochre handprints, and the twice-daily flood cycle supply concrete spatial anchors and constrain the painter's nocturnal following. The brooch's glow and the still pool mirror charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and apt—rain-slick rocks, weak morning light, the causeway swallowed by tide—without postcard excess. The island's isolation and reclamation station ground survival stakes in the post-war setting.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: threshing meaning from chaos. The painter's insomnia and obsessive rain-trail painting establish early pressure. One meaningful deepening occurs when she follows trails by moonlight to the cave, driven by the brooch's recognition-tingle. The convergence reweights her purpose from singular to continuous (humans always sought patterns). The cost—four sleepless nights, isolation—is present but lightly sketched; the deepening feels more contemplative than an urgent tightening that forecloses a live option.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the rain-trail patterns and ochre handprints: the continuity of human meaning-making across millennia. "Haggard awe" as the marriage of exhaustion and wonder charges multiple beats without overt statement. The final image—painting convergence, brooch glowing—offers a resonant answer to the opening question without moralizing. One friction: "communion rather than curse" verges on labeling the shift rather than letting the image speak alone, but the handprints and still pool anchor the reweighting in concrete particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited with stable distance and a distinct perceptual signature—"wryly earnest," rain trails "branching like neurons," "haggard awe." Dialogue with Marcus is functional but occasionally expository ("They used to trade them…The island floods twice daily now"). Internal voice modulates with pressure but occasionally slips into summary ("she'd been following those rain trails for weeks"). No head-hopping; psychic distance held. The prose carries idiom but some filter verbs ("wanted to dismiss," "felt different") dull immediacy in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; sentence openings diversify; no major loops or template cadence. Figurative language is controlled—"branching like neurons," "map of thirst and endurance"—without overwriting. Minor scaffold appears: "she'd been trying to capture" and "she'd been following" across adjacent paragraphs repeat the "she'd been [verb]ing" stem without new pressure. Information density is high; most lines advance character or atmosphere. The final image charges prior motifs cleanly. Propulsion suffers slightly in the Marcus exchange, where exposition slows momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The convergence of post-apocalypse survival and ancient human pattern-seeking offers a fresh synthesis. "Unearthed convergence" as memorial recognition rather than mysticism transforms the trope. "Haggard awe" and "wryly earnest" are specific character inflections. One friction: the amber brooch as mystical marker, rain trails as guides, and ochre handprints as climax echo familiar quest-object and sacred-cave templates; the piece personalizes them through the painter's lens but the structural bones remain recognizable.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Setup: present from opening. Development: insomnia drives nocturnal following in the cave beat. Payoff: "finally ready to sleep" after painting the convergence. The character's choice to follow by moonlight enables the discovery, and the insomnia reframes as vigil. Cost: four sleepless nights, isolation. The trait shapes two beats and the ending reweights it, but the final choice feels contemplative rather than a high-stakes decision that narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setup: discovered in lower caves, second paragraph. Development: tingling recognition prompts the exchange offer with Marcus; pinned to jacket during nocturnal following. Payoff: "still glowing against her heart" in final paragraph. The brooch appears in three distinct beats and its "trapped sun" glow charges the final image. Cost linkage is moderate—it primes the convergence search but does not constrain a tactical choice under pressure. Swappability is low; its amber glow and ancient origin tie to the ochre handprints thematically.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: Marcus names it explicitly in dialogue. Development: drives the cave search and is tested when the painter sees the handprints. Payoff: the convergence as "memory—the unearthed recognition" reweights the concept. The concept shapes the dominant stake (threshing meaning) and the ending's thematic repricing. One friction: "convergence" risks abstraction; the handprints and still pool concretize it, but the mechanic of how convergences "occur" remains vague. The concept is present across all three gates and charges closure, but its causal pressure on tactics is light.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>Setup: "wryly earnest in her skepticism" appears once during the brooch exchange. Development: not visible in a second beat. Payoff: not directly present at closure. The trait labels the painter's stance but does not constrain an action with cost. Single mention, no causal work. Cap at 4.6 for missing setup if interpreted as second-third arrival; here it appears early but remains ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Setup: painter offers to exchange the brooch for knowledge. Development: Marcus refuses, redirecting her to "keep following." Payoff: "The island had made its exchange after all" closes the arc. The exchange shapes the middle beat's redirection and the ending's thematic reframe. The refusal drives her to follow alone, enabling the cave discovery. Cost is conceptual—understanding without transaction. The element is present in setup, middle, and closure, with moderate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: rain trails introduced in opening paragraph, painted obsessively. Development: following them leads to the brooch, then to Marcus, then by moonlight to the cave. Payoff: "she painted the handprints, the rain trails, the convergence." The method drives at least three distinct beats and shapes tactics under pressure (nocturnal navigation, pattern obsession). The trails are irreplaceable—removing them breaks the causality to the cave. The method appears in setup, middle, and closure with strong causal linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setup: Skellig Minor named and anchored by opening paragraph. Development: tidal causeway, limestone caves, twice-daily flooding constrain access and time the painter's vigil. Payoff: the island's isolation and the cave's stillness charge the final convergence image. The setting supplies resources (caves, rain trails) and constraints (flooding, isolation) that alter tactics. Marcus's water reclamation station grounds survival stakes. The island is indispensable; the tidal rhythm and convergence sites are unique to this exact setting.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>Setup: "after the water wars" in opening line and Marcus's "haggard" survival face. Development: changed tides and the reclamation station context ground the post-war setting. Payoff: "after the latest ones" and "since the water wars ended" bookend the frame. The timeframe supplies atmosphere and motivates the painter's arrival but does not tighten a decision or impose a live clock. The wars are backdrop rather than active pressure. Present in setup and closure with thematic weight but no tactical urgency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Setup: "motivation had always been singular: to thresh meaning from experience" in opening paragraph. Development: the search for convergence and the exchange offer dramatize the drive. Payoff: painting the convergence fulfills the motivation. The desire is stated early and tested through the cave search, with the insomnia and isolation as costs. One friction: the motivation is told more than shown through conflicting micro-choices. It shapes the dominant stake and closure but lacks visible friction between wants and costs in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: "haggard awe" named and embodied in Marcus's face, second page. Development: the tone recurs in the painter's own state—"haggard as everyone who'd survived" yet obsessively seeking wonder. Payoff: "all the haggard awe of survival meeting wonder" in the final painting. The tone is coherent across turns, modulates with pressure (insomnia as vigil), and charges the final image. The term is used three times with each reprise reweighting its meaning, from description to synthesis.</comment>
