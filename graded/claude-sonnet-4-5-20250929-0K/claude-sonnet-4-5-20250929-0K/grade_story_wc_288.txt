<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior state is vivid and embodied in early passages ("brittle glass breaking inside her skull"), but the central transformation from isolation to "fierce, unprecedented independence" is largely asserted rather than earned through on-page micro-choices under pressure. The thylacine memory provides texture but remains ornamental; no concrete decision forces her to choose between her two selves with visible cost. The cataloging work and translation metaphor are told activities that don't narrow options or test her stance at closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers images (reflections, sundial, stone hum, blank book) toward a reweighting at closure. The final recognition—"She was no longer the last of anything. She was the first of something new"—offers Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise), but the cost remains abstract and未 felt; no on-page forfeiture or tactical shift proves the transformation. Orientation anchors promptly (floating library, Mira's reincarnation memory). One meaningful deepening occurs when the book "The Art of Being Multiple" reframes her reflections, but because the cost is conceptual only and not tied to a concrete choice or loss, closure stays in the mid-band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The tidal library is vivid and purposeful: crystalline foundations, atmospheric currents, books materializing with pressure changes. The brass sundial—useless above clouds, then reinterpreted as measuring "light received"—constrains Mira's understanding and charges the final image with metaphoric weight. Sensory detail (verdigris, amber light, cloud-ocean) is selective and voice-filtered. The Chronology Wing and Acoustic Archives add texture without cluttering spatial choreography, and the sundial's reappearance supplies the micro-setting anchor that elevates the score into the 7s.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Mira seeks to reconcile her fractured dual identity. However, pressure remains static; she catalogs memories and reads a conveniently affirming book without any on-page reversal or cost that narrows options. The "Art of Being Multiple" arrival feels like a prompt-answer rather than an earned turn. No visible price is paid—no choice forecloses a path, no resource is spent—so escalation under the Accumulative lens stalls at descriptive accumulation without tightening.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—coexistence of past and present, singularity as bridge rather than fracture—emerges organically from the thylacine memory and library setting. The sundial's reinterpretation (shadow to light) and the infinite reflections (proof of multiplicity) offer concrete particulars that avoid overt moralizing. The closing assertion "She was the first of something new" edges toward thesis statement but is cushioned by prior imagery. No epiphany is tested under pressure, limiting resonance; the book's message ("You are not broken. You are a bridge") borders on Thematic Echo but remains integrated enough to stay in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Diction is controlled and voice-particular ("brittle glass breaking," "fierce, unprecedented independence"), though some constructions veer toward elevated register ("contemporary of extinct species watching the world forget her kind"). Free indirect style is clean. No dialogue on the page to assess. Perceptual signature is present (thylacine instincts layered with human thought) but not dramatized under stress. Filter verbs ("she understood," "she realized") appear but do not dull immediacy excessively.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is purposeful in most passages. However, paraphrase loops appear: "coexist with herself" / "coexistence" recurs across adjacent paragraphs without added pressure; "brittle," "fractured," "scattered" cycle near-synonyms for fragmentation. Template cadence in exposition: "She had awakened... The reincarnation memory had come... Now, in this floating sanctuary..." reads as scaffold sequencing. The sundial reprise is effective, but minor redundancies and elevated diction ("liminal," "verdigris-streaked," "contemporaneous") in non-stress beats prevent entry into higher bands. No artifacts touch the closure image directly, so penalties remain modest.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The tidal library and reincarnation memory combine into a fresh premise, and the thylacine specificity (Hobart zoo, 1936) avoids generic extinction tropes. However, the emotional arc—lonely outsider finds self-acceptance—follows a familiar template without sufficient transformation. The sundial's reinterpretation is elegant but does not arise from character struggle; the "Art of Being Multiple" book feels like a prompt-answer artifact. Risk-taking in structure (reflection-heavy, lyric closure) is present but does not elevate stakes. Swappability test: replace thylacine with passenger pigeon and the arc holds unchanged, signaling mid-band originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Mira is identified as "a contemporary of extinct species" and her thylacine memory seeds the premise. She catalogs extinct memories and practices translation work, but these remain told activities. No on-page choice hinges on her extinct-species status; the identity functions thematically but does not constrain or enable a beat with visible cost. Present by setup, touches middle work, appears in closure phrasing ("contemporary of extinct species, alive"), satisfying two gates and reaching the 5s, but swappable with another reincarnation type limits the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The brass sundial appears in beat one (reading desk, verdigris, useless above clouds), returns in the closing passage ("picked it up, feeling its substantial weight"), and is reinterpreted ("measured time differently—not by darkness cast but by light received"). This lyric reprise reweights the persistence motif and charges the final image with metaphoric cost. Three touches (discovery, contemplation, reinterpretation) across setup, middle, and closure satisfy all gates. Causal pressure is modest—it does not narrow a tactical choice—but the charged return and irreplaceability (sundial's shadowlessness is unique to the setting) push it into the 6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Brittle awakenings" appears once as "brittle glass breaking inside her skull" to describe the reincarnation memory's arrival. The image is vivid but ornamental; the concept does not recur, constrain choices, or shape tactics. Functional mention in setup only, no middle or closure participation. Present but replaceable with "sudden," "sharp," or "shattering" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.4</grade><comment>The "atomically reflective walls" produce infinite multiplied reflections of Mira in the opening and closing. Descriptive in both beats; the reflections symbolize fragmentation-to-multiplicity but do not enable or constrain an action with cost. Label-only attribute ("atomically") adds no mechanical consequence. Two touches (setup and closure callback) give it a lyric frame, but purely symbolic use without tactical work keeps it in the low band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Coexist" is the thematic spine: Mira learns "to let her human thoughts and thylacine instincts move through her simultaneously" and works "learning to coexist with herself." The verb frames her goal and recurs at closure ("learning to coexist with herself"). However, coexistence is a state she describes rather than an action with on-page stakes or friction. No scene tests her ability to coexist under pressure; the resolution is asserted. Present across setup, middle (memory cataloging), and closure, satisfying three gates and enabling mid-band score, but the action's passivity and swappability (replace with "integrate" or "reconcile") cap it below 6.5.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The stone circle's hum appears in one sustained passage: "By the hum of an ancient stone circle... she practiced her translation work. The stone circle's frequency helped her focus... making the space between her two selves feel less fractured." Signaled in setup, shapes her work method (translation practice), and recurs in the closing paragraph ("The stone circle's hum continued its ancient song"). Three touches; the hum enables focus but imposes no cost or constraint on a choice. Mechanics are vague ("sonic recording," "prehistoric resonance"), and removing it would not break story logic—her translation work could proceed via another ambient cue. Functional across beats but replaceable, landing in the mid-4s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The tidal library is established early (drifting 3,000 feet, crystalline foundations, books materializing with atmospheric tides) and supplies micro-settings: Chronology Wing (where time moves differently, sundial found), Acoustic Archives (stone hum), reading desk. The setting's rules (books appear/dematerialize with tidal pull) enable the "Art of Being Multiple" arrival and frame Mira's work. Present in setup, middle (cataloging in various wings), and closure (clouds beneath, "library above the clouds where time moved like tides"). The tidal pressure metaphor charges the ending. Causal involvement is modest—no choice hinges on navigating the library's spaces—but the setting's specificity and closure linkage elevate it into the upper 6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the reincarnation memory" is established immediately ("six months ago") and structures the premise: Mira awakens with dual-life awareness and now works in the library. The six-month span is static; no on-page clock tightens her choices. Time's thematic treatment (Chronology Wing, sundial measuring differently, "time moved like tides") enriches atmosphere but does not create urgency. Present in setup, colors middle work, implicit at closure. Functional frame but lacks tactical pressure, placing it in the mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Motivation is stated early: "learning to translate isolation into independence, converting the loneliness of being singular into the freedom of being unprecedented." Mira's cataloging and translation work dramatize the process across beats, and the closing line confirms success: "translating her isolation into a fierce, unprecedented independence." Desire is consistent and frames her arc. However, no on-page friction tests the want—no moment where independence costs her connection or safety. The motivation is told and affirmed rather than contested. Present setup to closure, drives activity, but low conflict keeps it in the low 6s.</comment>
