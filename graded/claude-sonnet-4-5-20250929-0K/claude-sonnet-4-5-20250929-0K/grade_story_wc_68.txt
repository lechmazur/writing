<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Marcus's interior is concrete and well-embodied ("obsessively" turning the cog, the smile "for the first time in months"), and his choice to distribute the texts rather than hoard them shows contradictory impulses resolved with visible cost. Karin's agonizing over words and her "abrasive calm" cracking slightly are effective. Minor weakness: Marcus's philosophical stance is told more than tested under pressure until the final beat, and his shift from solitary preservation to networked action feels slightly abrupt despite setup.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation is clean (Marcus, flooded ruins, post-plague, dawn descent anchored early). The piece follows a Causal lens: Karin's request narrows Marcus's options, his counter-proposal creates the network plan, and the cog becomes their sign—each beat motivated. Closure is Decisive Change with visible cost: Marcus hands over his "most precious possession" and commits to a distributed method, foreclosing his solitary stance. One meaningful tightening (Karin's arrival forces the choice) is sufficient for this length. Cost is legible in the cog transfer and the final image of him alone "with the rising water."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The flooded ruins are vivid and selective: "sedimentary layers of civilization's collapse," storm-drain home, waterproof containers, candles. Spatial choreography is clear (descent, platform, Karin wading closer). The chronometer cog and rising water constrain the final choice and charge the closure image. Minor slip: "two levels down" and the general layering are described but not used tactically mid-scene, though they frame the thematic stakes well.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake (preserve truth vs. weaponize it for factions) is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: Karin's proposal forces Marcus to choose between hoarding and distributing, raising the cost from personal purity to collaborative risk. His agency (handing over the cog, proposing the network) forecloses solitary rebellion with visible price. The escalation is driven by protagonist choice under the Causal lens. Minor note: the "convenient" arrival of Karin at this exact moment is functional but slightly coincidental in timing.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme (truth as sediment vs. narrative as erasure) emerges from concrete action: Marcus's library, the cog's mechanical precision, Karin's historiography, the final network plan. The ending offers a resonant answer—"ensuring truth survived argument"—through the cog-as-sign and distributed preservation, not a stated moral. Subtext is strong in gesture (the cog transfer, the smile, the rising water). No thematic echo or moralizing. The final image reweights the opening solitude with earned cost and complexity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Marcus; psychic distance is controlled. Voice is distinct: "sedimentary layers," "abrasive calm," "rational rebellion" feel character-particular. Dialogue is natural, goal-driven, and carries subtext ("not force truth on the unwilling, but preserve it"). Karin's speech reflects academic idiom without caricature. Minor slip: "agonizing over her words, weighing each one" is slightly filter-heavy for a peak beat, though it serves to show her care. No head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high (each line advances setting, stakes, or character). Opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Minor deductions: "That was before he'd chosen rational rebellion over their comfortable narratives" is slightly tell-heavy; "The candles flickered as she departed" is a stock transition. "Abrasive calm" recurs as a phrase without fresh embodiment mid-scene. No paraphrase loops or template cadence, but a few lines lean on scaffold ("he realized") where image could carry the weight.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The sedimentary-layer metaphor as literal setting and thematic frame is a fresh synthesis. The drowned-city philosopher and the cog-as-network-sign are specific, non-obvious angles. The piece avoids post-apocalypse clichés (no scavenger violence, no simple redemption arc). Minor limitation: the "truth vs. narrative" theme is well-executed but not uncommon in speculative literary fiction; transformation is solid but the conceptual territory is familiar. Risk-taking in the quiet, discursive closure elevates within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus (philosopher, sewer-dweller) drives the key turn: his decision to distribute the texts and create the network. Present from paragraph one, active in every beat, and his choice shapes the closure with visible cost (handing over the cog, abandoning solitary purity). Highly integrated.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The chronometer cog appears early (paragraph two), is turned obsessively, used to illustrate Marcus's belief in mechanical truth, handed to Karin as the network's sign, and mentioned in the closure ("The cog will be our sign"). Causally active in three beats and indispensable to the ending; removing it would break the closure image and symbolic transfer.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Competing narratives (council's divine-punishment story vs. epidemiological data vs. Marcus's preservation-without-alignment) shape every stake and tactic on the page. Karin's entire visit hinges on this conflict, and the resolution (distributed sedimentary truth) is a non-binary answer. Introduced early, drives middle negotiation, and charges the ending. Highly specific to this story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Rationally rebellious" constrains Marcus's choice: he refuses both the council and its opposition, proposing instead the network model. The trait is embodied (saving the library, rejecting comfortable lies, smiling at the distributed solution) and creates visible cost (exile, solitude, the cog transfer). Present early, active in two beats, and shapes closure. Slightly less indispensable than core elements—other traits could produce similar choices—but well integrated.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Karin "agonizing over her words, weighing each one" appears once at a pivot moment and signals her care/strategy, prompting Marcus's shift. It's dramatized and purposeful but limited to one beat. A major turn traces to this (Marcus trusts her enough to propose the network), but the word "agonize" itself could be swapped for synonyms without breaking logic. Functional, signaled early enough, but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Through sedimentary layers" is the story's central method: Marcus descends through collapse-strata daily, lives in a drain, preserves texts "below their narratives," and the final plan is explicitly "through the sedimentary layers of this drowned world." Signaled in paragraph one, shapes setting and tactics throughout, and is essential to the closure image. Removing it would collapse the metaphor-logic backbone.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sunken city ruins provide resources (the cog from drowned captain's quarters, the storm-drain home, waterproof containers), constrain access (wading, descent, rising water), and charge the ending ("the rising water" as threat and inevitability). Present from the start, active in tactical choices, and integral to the sedimentary-layer metaphor. Highly purposeful.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"After the plague ends" (three months post) frames Marcus's exile and the council's revisionist window. It enables the conflict (no immediate survival crisis, so narrative battles begin) and Karin's urgency. Present in setup and implied throughout, but the timeframe itself doesn't tighten a single on-page choice or add escalation—any post-crisis window would serve. Functional, early signal, but replaceable in mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Preserving "ancient methods" (observation, documentation, rational inquiry) is Marcus's stated and dramatized motive: he saved the medical library, refuses narrative weaponization, and devises the distributed-network solution to outlast erasure. It drives his refusal of Karin's first pitch and his counter-proposal. Active in two beats, integral to theme and closure. Desire is conflicted (purity vs. collaboration) with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Abrasive calm" is assigned to Karin twice and coheres through her controlled speech and the crack at "I've spent my career studying." The tone modulates slightly under pressure and charges her final moment of understanding. It's present and purposeful but not pervasive enough to define the whole piece's texture—Marcus's sections carry a different idiom. Solid integration in her arc; less structural to the overall closure than other elements.</comment>
