<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's interiority is concrete and voice-particular ("modestly fearless in the way of those who've faced death enough to know its textures"). The lost soul collector's motivation to weave laughter into healing is shown through active choice—shifting melody to find absurdity in the shade's confession. Internal conflict emerges when she laughs through tears, embodying contradictory impulses. The shade's transformation feels earned by her tactical shift, though his final release lacks a visible cost that forecloses a path for Kael herself.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—density builds through the harp's distorted notes, the gorge's echoes, and the shade's layered confession until the final release. Orientation anchors (who/where/when) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration (the shade releases himself, integrated rather than extracted), but the cost to Kael is conceptual rather than felt on the page—she continues her descent unchanged. The piece needed one visible constraint or price that alters her next move to fully earn the closure under this lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The gorge functions as active setting: its echoes layer guilt, and the narrow point forces confrontation. The crocodile's tooth and warped harp are handled on the page and constrain her method. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("pale threads," "scorch marks—old pain, burned deep"). The limestone switchbacks and outcropping provide clear spatial choreography. The setting charges the final image when the gorge falls silent, marking the soul's release.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: transform collection into genuine healing, signaled early through guild heresy. One meaningful tightening occurs when Kael shifts from listening to playing the absurdity, narrowing the shade's options from endless loop to release. The shade's agency drives his own closure, but Kael's tactics (finding the frosting detail, laughing through the harp) enable it. The resolution lacks a trade-off or visible price for Kael—she descends to the next soul without tactical or emotional cost on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: laughter as healing, grief tangled with mundanity (the birthday cake, pink frosting). The crocodile's tooth and warped harp recur with shifting meaning—predator instinct recognizing the moment, distortion creating harmonics. The final image offers a resonant answer: "She'd have laughed too" reweights memory without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the gorge's transforming echoes and Kael's tears-through-laughter. Minor slip: "luminous ache" appears twice as a phrase rather than being enacted through fresh images.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Kael; perceptual signature is consistent ("modestly fearless," her way of noticing frequencies and temperatures). Diction stays character-particular and controlled under pressure. The shade's dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, pursuing confession and release. Psychic distance tightens appropriately when the tooth flares and when Kael laughs. Free indirect style is clean. No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high—most lines advance character, atmosphere, and stakes. Zero paraphrase loops or template cadence. Minor register drift: "modestly fearless in the way of those who've faced death enough to know its textures" reads slightly elevated for the established voice during a physical descent, though it remains character-motivated. The opening and closing lines anchor voice and recharge motifs ("hidden sunrise" / "waking canyon"). No scaffold or text artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The misaligned harp as healing tool offers a fresh angle on soul-collection trope; distortion creating healing frequencies is specific and non-obvious. The integration of laughter into grief work transforms familiar material. The crocodile's tooth as compass pointing toward grief rather than north is a striking particular. Minor derivativeness: the "collector of lost souls" frame and the spectral confession loop echo widely used templates, though the frosting detail and harp mechanics personalize execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael (lost soul collector) is present from the opening and makes two key choices: settling to play rather than extract (beats the guild method), and shifting melody to find absurdity (enables the shade's release). Her occupation shapes stakes (guild heresy) and tactics (matching frequencies). She appears in the closure, continuing her descent. Strong causal pressure and beat involvement, but the final choice belongs to the shade, limiting her agency at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The crocodile's tooth appears in three beats: opening (compass toward grief), mid-scene (grows warm, signaling proximity), and peak moment (flares hot, recognizing release). It functions as a tracking tool that guides her pursuit and marks the transformation. Present in setup and development, contributing to closure atmosphere but not causally active in the final image. Purposeful but not indispensable—a different supernatural compass could serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Spectral confessions shape the entire narrative: the shade's looped confession is the central problem, the gorge echoes and layers his words, and Kael's method targets confession transformation. The concept drives her heretical approach (healing vs. extraction) and defines success (he releases himself through integrated memory). Present in setup, pressures every middle beat, and determines closure when confession shifts from loop to voluntary release. Removing this exact concept would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Modestly fearless" is articulated on the page ("She wasn't brave in the bold sense; she simply understood that fear served no purpose here") and enables one key action: settling cross-legged before the shade without hesitation. The trait is label-heavy but shown through her unhurried approach and willingness to laugh in the presence of trauma. It does not constrain a choice or create visible cost—she never faces a moment where fear would alter tactics. Present in setup, functional in one beat, absent from closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>"Pursue" drives the entire narrative arc: Kael descends into the gorge pursuing trapped souls, the crocodile's tooth guides her pursuit, and she continues pursuing "the next luminous ache" in the final line. The action defines her occupation, motivates the descent, and shapes her tactical approach (she pursues what others flee). Setup, development, and closure all trace directly to this action. Removing "pursue" would require a fundamentally different frame—she would need to stumble upon the shade rather than hunt him. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The misaligned harp is signaled in setup ("damaged in a rockslide years ago, its frame subtly warped, its strings never quite true") and its mechanics matter: distortion creates "spaces between the notes" and "harmonics that shouldn't exist" that reach trapped souls. She uses it across multiple beats (first string snaps the shade's attention, melody builds through deliberate wrongness, faster playing enables his fade). Present in setup, drives middle pressure, and is active ("still playing") at closure. The exact distortion property is indispensable to her heretical method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Echo Gorge is named and described in the opening, functions actively throughout (swallows and returns sound transformed, catches and layers the confession, throws back laughter and the daughter's name), and its silence at closure marks success. The gorge's narrowest point is the encounter site. The setting shapes tactics (she uses its echo properties) and charges the final image (it falls silent, then she descends into "the waking canyon"). Strong causal role in two beats and closure, though "gorge" could be replaced with another resonant landscape feature with moderate edits.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"In the hush of a hidden sunrise" appears in the opening paragraph and establishes atmospheric timing (fog, pale threads of light, growing light at the shade's fade). The timeframe does not tighten decisions or create urgency—the encounter unfolds without time pressure, and "waking canyon" at the end suggests continuation rather than deadline. Present in setup and closure atmosphere but does not constrain tactics. Functional as mood but replaceable with any dawn/dusk transition.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Kael's motivation to integrate laughter into healing is framed as guild heresy in setup, dramatized through her tactical shift (finding absurdity in the frosting, laughing soft and genuine), and validated at closure when the shade releases himself "integrated and healed rather than merely collected." The motivation creates friction (heretical vs. standard extraction), shapes every middle beat (her playing method, her tears through laughter), and defines success. Removing this exact motivation would collapse her differentiation from other collectors and eliminate the story's thematic core.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Luminous ache" appears as phrase in the opening (pursuing "the next luminous ache") and ending, and is enacted throughout: Kael's tears while laughing, the shade's voice breaking, the gorge's transformation of sound into "something luminous, aching with recognition." Tone modulates from hush to layered guilt to breakthrough without flattening, and charges the final image when she continues pursuing. Coherent through pressure and purposeful at closure, though the repeated exact phrase leans slightly toward label rather than pure enactment.</comment>
