<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's interiority shows contradictory impulses—running versus confronting—and the final choice to retrace "the harder path" feels earned by prior causality. Embodiment is present ("felt gravity loosen," "ache in her knees") but some therapy-speak intrudes: "labyrinth of self" and "procedurally generated realities" read diagnostic rather than lived. The moment where she "pressed her thumb against the deepest rune" and fragments rejoin carries visible cost (gravity reasserts, singularity returns), though the gathering of selves could be more concretely dramatized. Minor penalty for label-speak in peak beats ("cowardice," "infinite maybes") that slightly abstracts the stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when within opening lines. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: seventeen retraces build density, the tablet aligns runes into clarity, and the ending reconfigures her from scattered to singular. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): she gathers fragments by choosing harder paths, forecloses the scattered self, and gravity's claim is the visible cost. One meaningful deepening (runes reveal the map of her timeline) tightens options. Minor causality slip: "procedurally generated" appears as metaphor but the mechanism remains abstract; the tablet's function could be more concretely tied to her actions.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The viaduct's amber glow, wet stone, and shifting states (moss-covered, pristine, fractured by veins of light) provide vivid micro-setting that charges the seventeen retraces. The tablet as recurring object constrains her final choice: pressing the rune shatters the bridge into memory-shards, then reforms it singular and solid. Spatial choreography stays coherent (apex, cornerstone, bridge). The final image—rain-slicked bridge, wet stone underfoot—anchors the closure and reweights the premise with tactile specificity. Sensory detail is selective and purpose-driven, modulating with her condition (temporal uncertainty versus singular solidity).</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: gather fragmented selves to escape the labyrinth. One meaningful tightening: the runes align into a timeline map, she retraces deliberately, and each choice rejoins a fragment. Agency is renunciation (choosing harder paths over running away) with visible cost (gravity reasserts, singularity replaces infinite scatter). The escalation reads more as accumulative deepening than causal pressure—fragments rejoin as she retraces, but the mechanics of "choosing the harder path" remain somewhat abstract. The final image reweights her condition (scattered → whole) with felt cost (weight, ache, chill) that fits the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: the labyrinth is her own fragmented choices, timelines branch from fears and evasions, and the ending reconfigures running versus confronting without stating a moral. The tablet's procedural-generation runes offer a non-literal map of her timeline, and the final image (gravity as "old friend," one woman walking forward) resonates as earned wisdom from specific struggle. The brightening darkness motif charges key moments (memories "blazed bright and then darkened at the edges"). Minor thematic echo: "infinite variations of running away" and "cowardice" tilt toward thesis-statement, but the closure image avoids overt moralizing and lets the weight of singularity answer the question.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, psychic distance controlled. Perceptual signature is character-specific: gravity "loosen[ing] its claim," time folding, symbols as "cosmic algorithm." Diction stays consistent except for register drift into elevated metaphor under pressure ("brightening darkness," "periodically eternal") that reads slightly forced for the moment. No head-hopping. The line "each timeline branched according to her deepest fears" tells rather than shows the realization, and "procedurally generated realities" borrows prompt language in a way that breaks immersion. Sentence rhythm modulates well (short bursts at the climax, longer reflection at the close), and the final paragraph's grounded simplicity earns the shift.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, information density is high, and the read-aloud test mostly passes. Line-level clarity holds except for a few overwritten moments: "brightening darkness that hurt to perceive" and "periodically eternal" stack metaphor without payoff. Paraphrase loop: "She was here, now, whole" and "one woman walking forward" in the final paragraph restate singularity with slight synonym churn. Template cadence appears mid-story: "The viaduct had appeared... sometimes moss-covered, sometimes pristine, occasionally fractured" uses parallel stems without taught pattern. Figurative language is dense in the climax ("shattered into light," "blazed bright and darkened") but mostly coherent. Minor scaffold: "This was her curse and gift" and "This was the truth" are boilerplate frames that could be cut. No major loops or artifacts touching closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The gravity-defier navigating fractured timelines through retracing offers a specific synthesis, and the tablet as physical map of her timeline is a fresh inflection. The "procedurally generated" conceit reads borrowed from the prompt rather than organically integrated into her experience; it competes with the emotional stakes rather than charging them. The ending's reconfiguration (scattered → singular via choosing harder paths) feels earned in hindsight, though the mechanics of fragment-gathering remain somewhat abstract. The piece commits to its premise and follows implications (seventeen retraces, gravity reasserting with bodily cost), avoiding safety-middle hedging. Transformation test: the plot and arc lean on the specific gravity/timeline mechanics enough that swapping them would require significant restructure.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's choice to retrace deliberately, following the map backward and choosing harder paths at each divergence, drives the key turn: fragments rejoin and gravity reasserts. She is present in setup (discovering the tablet), middle (seventeen retraces building density), and payoff (pressing the rune, retracing, and arriving whole). Causal pressure: her agency (pressing, choosing) narrows options from scattered infinite to singular present. Visible cost: she loses the escape of infinite maybes and gains the weight of one body, one path. Specificity: her gravity-defying trait and timeline-navigation constraint make her irreplaceable to the closure logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The tablet appears in setup (lodged in cornerstone, warm against palm), middle (runes shift and pulse, she asks "Show me"), and payoff (presses thumb to deepest rune, shatters viaduct, crumbles to dust). Two distinct beats: discovery and activation. It enables the key turn (reveals timeline map, triggers memory-shatter and retrace sequence). Causal linkage: without the tablet's map she could not see the pattern or gather fragments. Closure participation: it crumbles at the end, signaling purpose fulfilled, but the crumbling is passive rather than charged with new meaning. Swappability: a similar magic-map object could replace it with minor edits; the runes' shifting and "procedural generation" language feel prompt-driven rather than organically necessary.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Fractured timelines shape stakes (she is scattered across infinite branches) and tactics (must retrace to gather fragments). The concept appears in setup ("existed between," scattered across timelines), middle (seventeen retraces reveal different viaducts, timelines branch from fears), and payoff (fragments rejoin, she becomes singular). Two beats: the seventeen retraces and the backward retrace that gathers selves. Causal pressure: fractured timelines create the problem and dictate the solution method. Closure linkage: singularity versus scatter is the before/after pivot. Minor swappability: the fracture could be spatial rather than temporal without major restructure, but the timeline-branching from choices is specific enough to anchor the theme.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Periodically eternal" appears as label in setup ("this was the truth of being periodically eternal") but is not dramatized with specific constraint or cost in scene. Middle development absent: the attribute does not visibly enable or constrain a choice under pressure. Payoff weak: the phrase recurs in reflection but does not charge the final image. The concept (experiencing all time at once) overlaps with fractured timelines and gravity defiance, making the trait somewhat redundant. Label-only mention trends low; the story's mechanics would hold without this exact phrase. Late first use (midpoint) and summary-only treatment lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Retrace appears in setup (implied through "she'd crossed it today" seventeen times), middle (the act of retracing reveals new details, teaches her the pattern), and payoff (she "began to retrace deliberately, following the map backward"). Three beats: the seventeen automated retraces, the realization that retracing reveals pattern, and the deliberate backward retrace that gathers fragments. Causal pressure: retracing is the method that solves the labyrinth and earns singularity. Closure linkage: the final retrace forecloses scatter and enables the walk forward. Specificity: the action is tied to her gravity-defying condition and timeline navigation; hard to swap without restructuring stakes. Visible cost: retracing forces her to confront avoided grief and choices.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Procedural generation" appears in setup (runes "generated by some cosmic algorithm") and middle (timelines "procedurally generated," viaduct "procedurally generated landscape"). The method is mentioned but not demonstrated: we do not see the generative rule-set or how its mechanics constrain her tactics. Middle development weak: the phrase is metaphorical rather than actionable. Payoff absent: the ending does not use procedural logic to resolve or charge the image. Swappability high: "algorithmic," "iterative," or "fractal" could replace it. The language reads prompt-borrowed rather than integrated into her lived experience. Summary-only and ornamental use lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The glowing viaduct after rain appears in setup (amber glow, wet stone, beaded mortar) and payoff (reformed solid, rain stopped, no temporal uncertainty). Two beats: opening image and closing reformation. Causal pressure: the viaduct's shifting states (seventeen variations) teach her the pattern; its reformation signals closure. Closure linkage: the bridge's singularity mirrors her own; wet stone underfoot anchors the final image. Specificity: the viaduct's apex, cornerstone (tablet location), and role as crossing-point make it less swappable than generic liminal space. Minor middle-development gap: the viaduct does not constrain a mid-story choice, though its variations accumulate meaning.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "between the drop and the ripple" appears in setup ("suspended in that infinite moment before consequence") and resonates at payoff ("unafraid of the ripple she would make"). Lyric reprise: the opening seed returns in the final line with reweighted meaning (suspended → walking forward into consequence). Middle development weak: the timeframe does not constrain tactics during the retracing sequence; it functions more as thematic motif than ticking clock. Closure linkage strong: the shift from suspended to ripple-making charges the final image. Swappability moderate: the metaphor is vivid but could be replaced with another liminal-time image without breaking logic.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The motivation to conquer the labyrinth of self appears in setup ("to conquer the labyrinth of self, she needed to gather these fragments"), middle (she sees the labyrinth built from cowardice, timelines branch from fears), and payoff (she retraces deliberately, becomes whole). Two beats: realization and action. Causal pressure: the desire to escape fragmentation drives the backward retrace and the choice of harder paths. Closure linkage: achieving singularity fulfills the stated motivation. Friction: "labyrinth of self" reads slightly abstract and prompt-borrowed, and the desire is told more than dramatized through conflicted micro-choices. Visible cost: she trades infinite escape for singular weight.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tone "darkening brightness" appears in setup (amber glow, "dying sun," beaded rain), middle ("memories blazed bright and then darkened at the edges, a brightening darkness that hurt to perceive"), and payoff (stones "no longer glowed," singular solidity replaces temporal glow). Three beats: opening glow, peak paradox, and closing dim solidity. Coherence: the tone modulates from defiant light to painful brightness to grounded dim without breaking mood. Closure linkage: the loss of glow charges the final image (she is no longer scattered light but singular weight). Specificity: the oxymoron is woven through sensory detail (amber, blazing, darkening) and reflects her condition (infinite light → singular shadow). Strong thematic and sensory integration.</comment>
