<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Celeste's interiority is concrete and well-embodied; her curiosity drives micro-choices (tracing the phrasebook, noting coordinates, smudging the chalk) that show consistent character-particular motivation. The decision to hide the discovery and proceed cautiously at the end feels earned by the layered understanding of Mara's fate and the Guild's threat. Internal contradictions—fascination versus self-preservation—operate simultaneously in the final beats. Minor: the master Hendrik remains largely off-stage and contributes only background threat rather than on-page pressure, limiting relationship crucible work.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural; the piece builds pressure through layered discoveries (luminance, hopscotch, coordinates, Mara's disappearance) that converge in a Charged Poise closure—Celeste crystallizes her stance (hide evidence, continue plotting) with felt cost (risk, duplicity) visible in the final image of "innocent questions." Orientation is clean by paragraph two (airship, navigation chamber, Celeste's role). The escalation unfolds through revelation density and the final act reweights the opening curiosity with survival stakes. One weakness: the luminance below is noted but never revisited on-page after the initial observation, leaving that thread hanging without clear payoff in the ending.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The airship *Meridian* is vividly anchored (brass hull, porthole, cargo hold, magnetic tethers) and the navigation chamber setting constrains Celeste's movements and discoveries. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (starlings, chalk dust in planking lines, rolled pencil). The hopscotch board—micro-setting object—directly enables the key discovery and charges the final image when Celeste erases it. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. Minor: the luminance field below is noted but does not constrain any on-page choice or return with altered meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (charting a discovery that threatens the Guild) is signaled early through Celeste's observation habits and sharpens once she decodes the hopscotch pattern. The tightening is meaningful: understanding Mara's hidden map + inferring Guild danger → Celeste must hide evidence and proceed covertly. Cost is visible (erasure, duplicity, risk) and the final stance forecloses open inquiry. One deduction: the escalation hinges entirely on Celeste's solo deduction; no external complication tests her commitment, and the luminance strand introduced early does not return to pressure the ending.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—the tension between discovery and survival, between mapping truth and protecting oneself—emerges organically from the hopscotch puzzle and Mara's fate without overt statement. The starling murmuration functions as a non-literal motif (patterns that dissolve and reform, impossible to capture) and the final callback reweights the opening image with earned irony: Celeste must become a pattern that hides to survive. The phrasebook's "seventeen tongues" line recurs with fresh meaning ("seventeen different ways of saying *here be something wonderful*"). Subtext operates cleanly in Celeste's cautious final plan. No moralizing; the ending offers a resonant answer to the cost of curiosity.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and tightly filtered through Celeste's perceptual signature (curious, pattern-seeking, cautious). Diction is consistent and voice-motivated ("sociable isolation," "sky-sickness," "dog-eared corner"). The prose reflects Celeste's mind under rising pressure with appropriate modulation. No dialogue present to judge. Minor slip: "the starlings outside suddenly scattered" at the climactic realization feels slightly convenient as an external correlative; the causal link is metaphorical rather than motivated, creating a brief break in POV modesty (Celeste cannot know the scattering is a "secret someone had decided to stop keeping").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.5</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings are diverse; information density is high with minimal scaffolding. The key discovery beats (chalk marks, coordinate cross-reference, Wayfinder constellation) advance knowledge efficiently without padding. No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. One weakness: "wondered if perhaps language itself was a kind of cartography, mapping meaning instead of mountains" reads slightly elevated and thesis-like mid-paragraph, a brief register drift that does not recur. The final paragraph's closing flourish ("translating coordinates into seventeen different ways of saying *here be something wonderful*") borders on lyric overreach but remains voice-coherent and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The core premise—apprentice discovers predecessor's hidden map encoded in a children's game—offers a fresh synthesis of exploration, espionage, and cartographic mystery without relying on stock tropes. Celeste's internal logic (pattern recognition, cautious risk management) feels specific to her voice and training. The hopscotch cipher is inventive and the transformation of murmuration into survival metaphor is non-obvious. Minor: the airship-as-plotting-instrument concept is intriguing but underdeveloped on the page; we never see how the ship's movements were used to trace the constellation, leaving the method partially abstract. The piece takes purposeful risks (quiet ending, internal escalation) that succeed.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Celeste's curiosity drives every major beat: tracing the phrasebook, chasing the pencil (which leads to the hopscotch discovery), decoding the pattern, cross-referencing coordinates, and deciding to hide evidence. Her choices create the key turn (discovery → covert investigation). The final decision to "continue plotting Mara's hidden map, one innocent question at a time" alters tactics with visible cost (duplicity, risk). Present early (paragraph 1), active across all major beats, and indispensable to closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The phrasebook appears in two beats: initial tracing (paragraph 3) and the final line reprise ("the dog-eared phrasebook open beside her, translating coordinates into seventeen different ways of saying *here be something wonderful*"). The dog-eared corner is noted but the object does not constrain a choice or enable a discovery; it functions as atmospheric texture. The final callback reweights the object thematically but the use remains ornamental rather than causal. Cap at 4.6 (missing middle development); decorative mention −0.3; lyric reprise lifts slightly within band to 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Stranded luminance" is introduced early (paragraph 4) as a mysterious pulsing light below the airship, Celeste notes it in her journal, and she later realizes it marks the Wayfinder constellation's central star position—this realization sharpens the stakes (someone is using the airship for celestial mapping). It shapes one key turn (the decoded pattern). However, the luminance does not return in the ending or constrain Celeste's final choice; she plans to "investigate the luminance below" tomorrow but this remains future intent, not on-page action. Present in setup and development, absent from closure → eligible to ~6.0; causal pressure in one beat +0.5; no closure linkage; round to 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Diligently curious" is demonstrated rather than merely labeled: Celeste's persistent observation of the starlings, her tracing of the phrasebook, chasing the pencil, and decoding the hopscotch all enact the trait. The attribute enables the discovery (curiosity) and constrains the final choice (she must mask her curiosity to survive—"diligent" shifts to covert). The tension between curiosity and caution creates visible cost in the ending (she cannot openly investigate). Present early, active in middle beats, and directly shapes closure tactics. Setup, development, payoff all met; causal pressure +1.0; closure linkage +0.8; specificity +0.5; cost connection +0.4; total ~6.8.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The action "note" is central: Celeste notes the luminance in her observation journal (paragraph 4), notes the hopscotch sequence in her journal and cross-references coordinates (paragraph 6), and copies the pattern before erasing it (paragraph 10). These acts of notation drive the discovery, enable the constellation insight, and constitute the final choice to preserve and hide Mara's map. The piece could not function without this repeated action; every major turn traces to noting. Early signal +0.6; three distinct beats +1.4; causal pressure +1.2; closure linkage +1.5; irreplaceability +0.8; cost connection +0.5; total ~8.1.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The hopscotch board's "secret patterns" are introduced early (paragraph 5: "faint chalk marks...arranged in the classic pattern of a children's hopscotch board" with non-sequential numbers). The method is fully dramatized: Celeste decodes the sequence, cross-references it with coordinates, and realizes the pattern forms the Wayfinder constellation. The mechanics matter and are made legible on the page. The method shapes the central discovery and the final act (erasing the marks, continuing the hidden map). Setup, development, payoff all met; causal pressure +1.3; closure linkage +1.2; specificity +0.7; cost +0.4; total ~7.9.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The airship *Meridian* frames the entire story and supplies the core discovery (the cargo hold's hopscotch board, the navigation chamber, the porthole view of luminance and starlings). The setting constrains Celeste's movements (she is suspended in the sky, isolated from external help) and enables the realization that the airship itself is a plotting instrument. The magnetic tethers and the vessel's hovering position are concrete and relevant. The environment shapes tactics (she must act alone, hide evidence aboard) and charges the final image (continuing the map while airborne). Setup, development, payoff met; causal pressure +1.1; closure linkage +0.9; cost +0.3; total ~7.1.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The starling murmurations are present in the opening, recur during the key realization ("The starlings outside suddenly scattered"), and return in the final paragraph with reweighted meaning ("teaching her their wisdom: the most beautiful patterns were those that could dissolve and reconstruct themselves"). The timeframe creates atmosphere and thematic resonance but does not tighten a decision or impose a clock. The murmurations function more as recurring image than temporal pressure. Setup and payoff met (lyric reprise), missing middle development as live constraint → cap 4.6; lyric reprise +0.8; thematic charge at closure +0.5; round to 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Celeste's motivation "to chart the next great discovery" is dramatized early (watching murmurations as "living maps," copying trade routes, noting phenomena) and faces friction when she realizes discovery threatens survival. The desire is tested: she must choose between open inquiry and covert plotting. The final choice (continue Mara's map "one innocent question at a time") enacts the motivation under constraint with visible cost (duplicity, risk). Setup, development, payoff met; causal pressure +1.1; closure linkage +1.0; friction/cost +0.6; total ~7.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The tone "sociable isolation" is established early ("that sociable isolation of understanding patterns while floating alone in the clouds") and sustained: Celeste is surrounded by the social structures of the Guild and master Hendrik yet operates in solitary observation and decision. The tone modulates under pressure (curiosity → caution) and the final image charges it (she will remain outwardly sociable, inwardly isolated in her secret map-making). The phrase itself appears only once; the effect is coherent but not deeply layered. Setup and payoff met, middle embodiment implicit; tone coherence +0.8; modulation +0.6; closure charge +0.7; specificity moderate; total ~6.9.</comment>
