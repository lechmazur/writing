<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Aria's motivation to retrieve her brother is clear and her mirror-making craft is sufficiently particularized through the grandmother's teaching and the grinding/mixing sequence. The brother's interiority upon return ("I mapped the spaces between things") feels earned by the sextant repair rather than convenienct. However, his seven-year absence and translucent physicality at the end receive minimal embodied consequence—no struggle with re-entry, no visible cost to his long dissolution. The final handclasp reads solid but the lack of friction or lasting damage from boundary-erasure slightly undercuts the stakes.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when within the first paragraph and establishes a causal arc: sextant appears → Aria recreates the moment through mirror-paste → brother returns. The synchronized breathing technique provides motivated linkage between repair and retrieval. Closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost (the brother is "translucent at the edges," boundaries are illuminated rather than erased). One micro-turn when the sextant pieces "began drawing together" deepens the escalation. The lens reads Causal with accumulative texture; no contradiction at closure. Cost is visible but light—translucence signals incompleteness, yet the reunion feels nearly complete, slightly softening the price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ruined orchard, calcified apple trees, frost patterns, and fog with breath-like rhythm create a vivid, coherent micro-setting. Spatial choreography is clean: workshop interior, windows, doorstep, fog beyond. The frost that "wouldn't melt" becomes a material ingredient, directly constraining Aria's technique. The setting charges the final image when "fog settled peacefully around the workshop, no longer erasing boundaries but illuminating them." Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Aria's craft-focused attention. The "glass-mountain fog" tone integrates with the mirror-maker's perceptual bias.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: retrieve the brother by repairing the sextant. One meaningful tightening occurs when Aria's hands tremble but she persists, narrowing the path to success. The synchronized breathing imposes a procedural constraint that raises difficulty. Agency is clear: Aria's craft decision and her opening the door at the correct moment drive the resolution. Cost is present but muted—"translucent at the edges" and the brother's need for her anchor are noted, yet the reunion feels nearly frictionless compared to seven years lost. A stronger visible forfeit or complication would push this higher.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of boundaries (erased vs. illuminated) emerges through the fog, the sextant's fractured arc, and Aria's grounding technique. The final image—"frost-bright lines that showed exactly where one world ended and another could begin"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without overt moralizing. The mirror-paste as a medium for recreating moments and the synchronized breathing as a balance of anchor-and-sail are conceptually coherent. No thematic echo or prompt-speak intrudes. The piece resists tidy closure: the brother remains partly translucent, accepting ambiguity with cost. The sextant and fog motifs recur purposefully without checklist pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and anchored in Aria's craft-focused perception. Diction is elevated but consistent: "prismatic fragments," "breath-like rhythm," "glass-mountain fog" cohere as a singular idiom. The brother's brief dialogue ("I found where all boundaries end") carries metaphysical weight fitting the tone without breaking voice. No head-hopping; all knowledge stays character-bound. Psychic distance is controlled; purposeful compression in the middle (synchronized breathing sequence) maintains clarity and momentum. Filter verbs are minimal. The final paragraphs modulate tone effectively, moving from procedural focus to quiet reunion without register clash.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no template cadence runs. "The fog beyond her windows moved with breath-like rhythm, thick as mountains of translucent glass" demonstrates figurative density without muddle. Clarity is high; spatial and temporal progression are legible. Minor scaffold appears: "She arranged...," "She closed...," "She began applying..." forms a light stem pattern across three beats, but it does not obscure causality. "Firm" appears twice in close proximity ("firmly grounded," "firmly present"), a small synonym echo. Information density is strong overall; the grinding/mixing sequence and the vision through mirror-paste advance multiple jobs per line. No loops or paraphrase that dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The mirror-maker / boundary-fog / sextant-as-navigation-tool synthesis is purposeful and less common than standard quest-retrieval frames. The synchronized breathing technique and frost-that-won't-melt as material ingredients show specific world logic. Emotional particularity in the seven-year gap and the brother's translucence add texture. However, the core arc—artisan repairs artifact to retrieve lost loved one—is a recognizable template, and the resolution (door opens, brother appears) feels slightly inevitable without a counter-pressure that tests Aria's success. The "glass-mountain fog" tone and the ending's "frost-bright lines" image offer fresh inflection, lifting the piece above derivative but not into bold risk territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Aria the mirror maker drives all key turns: she interprets the sextant's return, grinds the paste, synchronizes her breathing, and opens the door at twilight. Her craft decision to "recreate not just images but the moments reflected in broken things" is the causal hinge. Present in setup, middle choice (mixing and breathing), and closure (opens door). Two distinct beats of active choice. Indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The astronomer's broken sextant appears in paragraph two (setup), is handled and repaired in the middle (Development: grinding paste, applying it to the breaks), and blazes with cold fire at closure, guiding the brother back. Its fractured state → restoration arc is the structural spine. Three beats of evolving use. Specific properties (the angle-measuring arc, the frost that won't melt) matter causally. The "perfect semicircle of silver" at the end reweights prior brokenness. Indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Erasing boundaries is dramatized on the page: the fog "erased the boundaries between dreaming and waking," the brother became "caught in the dissolving space between," and Aria's technique requires balancing anchor and sail. The ending shifts from erasing to illuminating boundaries, a clear reweighting. Shapes tactics (synchronized breathing to thin workshop boundaries) and charges the final image. Present in all three gates. Strong causal integration.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Firmly grounded" appears twice: Aria is "firmly grounded in this single moment of clarity" and the brother is "firmly present" at the end. The trait enables Aria's technique ("absolute presence—you couldn't chase the vision while also being firmly grounded") and contrasts with the brother's translucence. It constrains her approach (she cannot chase the vision, must anchor) with implicit cost (the fog presses in, her hands tremble). Present in setup and closure; one middle beat. Functional but the cost is understated and the trait reads partly label-only.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Recreate" is signaled early ("a mirror maker could recreate not just images but the moments reflected"), executed in the middle (applying paste, seeing the path), and completes at closure (brother reaches back through recreated boundary). The action is the method by which retrieval succeeds; swapping it would require a different craft logic. Two distinct beats plus closure payoff. Strong causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Synchronized breathing is taught by the grandmother, signaled early ("through synchronized breathing..."), executed in the repair sequence ("matched her breathing to the fog's pulse"), and enables the boundary-thinning that lets the brother return. It appears in at least two beats with clear mechanics (in/out rhythm with the fog). The method shapes the attempt and is causally necessary. Present in all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ruined orchard district with calcified trees and thick fog is established in the opening line, provides the brother's disappearance context (he walked into the fog seven years ago), supplies the frost ingredient ("frost that wouldn't melt"), and the fog itself breathes in sync with Aria's technique. At closure, "the fog settled peacefully...illuminating" boundaries. The setting constrains choices (fog rhythm dictates breathing) and charges the final image. Three beats, indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Twilight is anchored early ("catching the twilight"), the fog's rhythm is described as pressing close "during twilight," and the final action occurs "at twilight's shimmer, when frost and fog became indistinguishable." The timeframe tightens the window for action (Aria must act when boundaries blur) and is the causal moment of the brother's return. Present in setup and closure; implicit constraint in middle. Strong necessity.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"To capture a runaway dream" is voiced by Aria ("You can't capture a runaway dream...But you can recreate the boundary it crossed"), dramatized through the brother's chase of "the dream of boundaries dissolving," and tested when Aria must balance chasing the vision with staying grounded. The motivation shapes the repair attempt. However, the "capture" language appears late and feels slightly imposed; the story emphasizes retrieval and recreation more than capture. Present in two beats with moderate friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Glass mountains" as tone appears in "fog, thick as mountains of translucent glass," "glass-mountain fog," "cold as mirror-glass," and the prismatic frost imagery. The tone is coherent, elevated, and metaphysically charged throughout. It modulates purposefully (procedural focus during repair, quiet awe at reunion) and charges the final image ("frost-bright lines"). The glassy, translucent texture integrates with the mirror-maker's craft. Present in all three gates, strong tonal coherence.</comment>
