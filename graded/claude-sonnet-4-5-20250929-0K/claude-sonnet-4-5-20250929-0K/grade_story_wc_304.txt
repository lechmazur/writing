<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyra is rendered with strong embodied specificity—"warming them between her palms," the precise threshold temperature, the practiced micro-choices—and her dual vocation is legible through action rather than exposition. Her interior focus ("that spark, that moment—Lyra had captured it. She always did") shows professional clarity without therapy-speak. The girl remains static by design, so relationship pressure is absent, but Lyra's solitary agency drives every beat. Minor slip: the parents' hollow voices and the emerald handoff feel slightly stock, but they don't undercut Lyra's consistent interiority or the earned ritual closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Accumulative/Textural lens is inferred and held: density increases through layered preparation beats, the aurora's intensification parallels the ritual's progression, and closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—the radiant hush crystallizes the "spark, that moment" with felt cost (the coming dawn will erase it, but it exists "undeniable, now"). Orientation anchors (grotto, Lyra, the girl, night ritual) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. One meaningful tightening occurs when the emerald chip begins pulsing in sync with the aurora, narrowing focus to the final illuminated threshold. Cost is visible: impermanence is acknowledged on-page ("beauty that would fade with the dawn"), and the families' climb underscores the price paid for this fleeting transcendence.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto is no postcard: steam vents maintain "that precise temperature where water neither froze nor fully melted," a constraint that governs Lyra's entire practice and appears in micro-setting detail ("too much warmth and the features would slacken"). The aurora functions as both atmosphere and active element—its pulsing rhythm shapes Lyra's read of the girl's interrupted youth and charges the mirrors' reflection in the final image. Sensory filtering is purposeful: warmth between palms, silver dust shimmer, the oils' texture all anchor the POV in tactile work rather than tourist description. The setting constrains the ritual and charges closure when "the girl lay in a pool of green-gold light."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—capture the spark before dawn erases it—is signaled early ("before that threshold, before the crossing back") and tightens through escalation: oils warming, emerald pulsing in sync with aurora, mirrors angled to multiply radiance. The tightening is textural (density and tempo increase) rather than causal reversal, fitting the Accumulative lens. Agency is Lyra's practiced precision under the ritual's time pressure; the cost is legible in "beauty that would fade with the dawn but existed, undeniable, now"—ephemerality accepted as inherent price. One minor gap: we never see a moment where Lyra risks failure or adjusts tactics when something resists, which would have elevated tension further, but the single meaningful deepening (emerald lighting, mirrors positioned, face shifting "not alive, but not quite gone") is sufficient at this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete ritual: the threshold of stillness (neither frozen nor melting, neither alive nor gone) structures every image and anchors the story's meditation on impermanent beauty and the value of ephemeral witness. The emerald chip shifts meaning from a girl's last grasp to a light source pulsing with "youth interrupted," and the aurora's patterns externalize Lyra's practice of reading meaning in apparent chaos. Closure offers a resonant answer without moralizing: "endings could still hold light" is earned by the layered preparation and the undeniable radiance of the final image, not asserted as thesis. No thematic echo or summary intrudes; the oils, pigments, mirrors, and aurora do the conceptual work. Subtext operates in "Lyra had captured it. She always did"—both confidence and compulsion without diagnosis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with tight psychic distance; perceptual signature is lucidly watchful—Lyra notices aurora rhythms, temperature thresholds, pigment catch, each filtered through her dual-vocation lens ("beautician and mortician, twin vocations that had merged"). Diction remains voice-coherent under pressure: "skyborne sanctuary," "threshold of stillness," "radiant hush" carry a formal, ritualistic register without slipping into corporate or academic jargon. No dialogue, so naturalism and subtext bullets don't apply. Filter verbs ("watched," "recognized") appear but feel voice-motivated rather than automatic. One small register wobble: "lucidly watchful care" in the parents' departure feels slightly elevated beyond prior narration, but it's brief and doesn't disrupt the overall texture. Purposeful compression in the final beat ("That spark, that moment—Lyra had captured it. She always did.") accelerates to closure without obscuring clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully—short declaratives ("She always did. It was why...") accelerate closure while longer descriptive sentences ("The walls were carved ice, softened by steam vents...") establish the grotto early. Information density is high: most sentences layer sensory detail with ritual function or thematic charge. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs. Minor scaffold appears in a few lines: "Lyra was both beautician and mortician, twin vocations that had merged in her hands until she could no longer separate them" restates the merger twice; "Tonight's subject was different. The girl on the preparation table couldn't have been more than sixteen" could compress. Stock phrase "hollow as they'd left" and "grain of rice" lean generic. These small slips don't obscure cause/effect or dull closure, so cumulative deduction remains modest. Figurative language ("green curtains rippling," "tiny star") is controlled and legible throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of beautician-mortician in a floating grotto under aurora is specific and non-obvious, and the threshold-of-stillness premise governs every tactical choice (temperature, timing, pigment application). The emerald-as-light-source and aurora-reading feel fresh rather than stock. Transformation test: swapping names and setting would gut the story's logic, since the grotto's precise temperature and the aurora's pulse are load-bearing. Risk is present in the premise and sustained through the ritual's particularity. Small deduction: the parents' hollow grief and the climbing-accident backstory trend toward familiar YA-loss templates, and Lyra's three-decade solitude edges toward archetype (the isolated artisan-mystic). The final image's radiant-hush closure is earned and memorable, but the emotional frame around it (grieving families, interrupted youth) doesn't fully escape convention. Still, the execution transforms familiar elements through tactile, world-specific ritual detail.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Lyra (beautician mortician) drives every beat: she warms oils, positions the emerald chip, angles mirrors, reads aurora patterns, and completes the ritual. Her practiced precision shapes the preparation sequence, and her dual vocation constrains her method (threshold temperature, pigment timing). She appears in the closure beat ("Lyra stepped back, her work complete") and the story's final line credits her repeated success. Early signal in paragraph one; beat involvement across preparation, aurora observation, and final illumination; causal pressure (her choices enable the radiant-hush moment); closure linkage (her completed ritual is the story's resolution). High specificity: removing her exact vocation and practiced micro-choices would break the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The emerald chip appears in three distinct beats: the parents' handoff (setup), Lyra placing it on the girl's forehead where it transforms under aurora light (development), and its blazing "like a tiny star" in the final illuminated moment (closure). It shifts from a clutched relic to an active light source pulsing in sync with the aurora, and its glow charges the closure image. Early signal (paragraph four); causal pressure (its pulsing rhythm helps Lyra recognize the pattern of "youth interrupted"); closure linkage (it "blazed" in the radiant pool). Swappability test: another object wouldn't carry the same visual transformation or thematic link to the girl's last grasp. Minor gap: we don't see Lyra choose to use it as a light focus versus, say, keeping it as a keepsake, so agency around it is slightly passive.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The threshold of stillness governs the entire story's logic: the grotto hovers at "that precise temperature where water neither froze nor fully melted, where decay paused," which shapes Lyra's ritual constraints ("too much warmth and the features would slacken, too little and the skin would resist"). The concept extends to the girl's state ("not alive, but not quite gone either") and to the ephemeral moment captured before dawn. Early signal (paragraph one); beat involvement (temperature management during preparation, final suspended state); causal pressure (the threshold enables Lyra's work and defines the ritual's window); closure linkage ("suspended in the threshold, caught between worlds"). Highly specific: removing this exact concept would collapse both the setting's physics and the thematic frame.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Lucidly watchful" appears once in paragraph five ("lucidly watchful care") as a descriptor when the parents depart. It fits Lyra's perceptual signature—her practiced ability to read aurora patterns and manage micro-details—but it's label-only in that moment and doesn't constrain or enable a specific on-page action with cost. The trait is demonstrated throughout (she watches, reads, adjusts) but the exact phrase doesn't recur or drive a decision. Setup present (mid-story); no distinct beat where the trait alters tactics; no closure link. The broader watchfulness shapes her method, but the specific attribute phrase is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Infuse" appears twice with distinct function: Lyra infuses the girl's skin with oils (core preparation action, paragraph six) and infuses the girl's hair with silver dust (paragraph eight). These actions structure the ritual sequence and enable the final radiant effect—without the infusions, the pigments wouldn't catch light and the closure image wouldn't work. Early signal (paragraph six); beat involvement (skin oils, hair dust); causal pressure (the infusions prepare the body to hold and reflect aurora light); closure linkage (the shimmering hair and rouge-painted lips are visible in the final pool of light). Swappability: replacing "infuse" with "apply" or "paint" would lose the alchemical, penetrative quality central to Lyra's dual-vocation method. High specificity and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Finding patterns in static" is signaled in paragraph five ("she had learned long ago to find patterns in static, to read meaning in the aurora's apparent chaos") and enacted when Lyra recognizes the emerald chip's pulse matching the aurora's rhythm ("a signature she'd seen before in the lights, a rhythm that spoke of youth interrupted"). The method shapes her tactical response: she positions mirrors to multiply the aurora's radiance, using the recognized pattern to charge the final image. Early signal (paragraph five); one distinct development beat (pattern recognition leads to mirror positioning); closure linkage (the pattern's culmination is the radiant hush). Minor gap: we don't see her fail to find a pattern or adjust when static resists, so the method's cost or difficulty isn't fully dramatized. Still, it's causally essential and specifically tied to her expertise.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The skyborne grotto under aurora is load-bearing: the three-mile elevation isolates the ritual, the carved-ice walls and steam vents maintain the threshold temperature (a hard constraint on Lyra's method), and the aurora's nightly performance is both atmospheric pressure and active element (its pulsing light must be read and multiplied). Early signal (paragraph one); beat involvement (temperature constraint during preparation, aurora intensification paralleling ritual progress, mirrors angling aurora light); causal pressure (setting enables and constrains every choice); closure linkage (the girl lies "in a pool of green-gold light" generated by the grotto's unique conditions). Swappability: a ground-level morgue or any non-aurora setting would break the story's logic and thematic charge. High irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>N/A</grade>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"To capture one last spark before oblivion" is signaled in paragraph seven ("before that threshold, before the crossing back to the world of the living, Lyra needed to capture one last spark before oblivion claimed it entirely") and drives the entire ritual sequence. The motivation is dramatized through every preparation beat: warming oils, painting lips, positioning mirrors, reading aurora patterns. Friction between want and cost is visible—the spark exists "undeniable, now" but "would fade with the dawn," and the families' three-mile climb underscores the price of this fleeting transcendence. Early signal (paragraph seven, but implied from paragraph one); beat involvement (all preparation and illumination beats); causal pressure (the desire structures every tactical choice); closure linkage (the final line affirms "Lyra had captured it"). Minor gap: the motivation is told more than conflicted—Lyra never doubts or struggles with whether the spark is worth the isolation or the families' grief, so internal friction is muted.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"Radiant hush" appears explicitly in paragraph nine ("in that radiant hush, the girl's face seemed to shift") and is woven throughout via diction and rhythm: "stillness," "threshold," "suspended," "illuminated," the quiet precision of Lyra's ritual gestures, and the aurora's silent intensification. Tone modulates subtly—calm procedural focus during preparation, then a crystallizing, charged stillness at closure. The final sentence ("That spark, that moment—Lyra had captured it. She always did. It was why the grieving climbed three miles into the sky...") sustains the hush while delivering resonance. Early signal (implicit in "threshold of stillness," paragraph one; explicit in paragraph nine); coherence through all beats; closure linkage (the radiant hush is the story's climactic image and tonal resolution). High specificity: the tone is integral to the ritual's logic and the story's emotional register.</comment>
