<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority shows embodied contradiction—she feels both terrified and lighter when the leash breaks. The guides feel more symbolic than individuated, delivering thesis-adjacent wisdom rather than pursuing their own goals. The confession scene ("told them about the job she'd refused...") compresses years into summary rather than letting one micro-choice reveal her pattern. The final choice to run forward is earned by the prior reflection, but the therapeutic precision ("unused courage") edges toward label-speak at a pivotal beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph; the ridgeway vigil and Mara's goal are clear. The piece reads as Accumulative/Textural: density builds through the guides' indirect teaching, Mara's confession deepens understanding, and the final image of running forward with the ticket punch reweights the opening leash-break. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Mara stands alone, ready to run, options reconfigured—but the cost is felt rather than paid on the page, which fits the length and lens. One substantive deepening (the confession) tightens her stance sufficiently.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The veiled ridgeway, mist-meeting-fog, and "hour between dog and wolf" anchor atmosphere and constrain movement (they lead her upward, not down to beaches). The ticket punch becomes micro-setting: she presses it to leaves, bark, sky—each use a small ritual that alters her perception. The broken leash remains warm and present, a tactile anchor. The final image charges both punch and ridgeway with the decision to run forward, satisfying the 9+ gate for constraint and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding Luna—is signaled immediately, then reweighted: what she's lost is her own unused courage. Pressure accumulates through indirect routes and the confession beat, which narrows her options from rescue-search to self-confrontation. The guides' final directive ("you'll have to walk there without a leash") crystallizes the cost: she must release control to proceed. One meaningful deepening (realizing "also lighter") shifts her stance, sufficient for this length and Accumulative lens, though the antagonistic pressure comes entirely from Mara's own reflection rather than external complication.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the leash/courage motif without overt statement until the guides articulate it—borderline Thematic Echo, but the final image (running forward, star-shaped hole in hand) answers the question through action rather than summary. The ticket punch's star-shaped hole and twilight recur with shifted meaning, charging the closure. Subtext operates in the guides' indirection and Mara's confession. The ending resists a tidy moral; Mara runs into gathering dark, cost and outcome open, resonance clean.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; distance tightens during Mara's confession and final realization. Perceptual signature is present (leash "still warm," ticket punch "held twilight") but not strongly individuated—the diction occasionally drifts into elevated lyricism ("shoreline lullaby, rhythmic and sure") that feels authorial rather than character-rooted. Dialogue is minimal and functional; the guides speak in parallel, nearly interchangeable cadence. Psychic distance shifts purposefully at key beats (confession, final image). No head-hopping or filter-verb stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; opening simile ("like polished driftwood") and closing momentum are strong. Figurative density is high throughout—nearly every paragraph carries a metaphor or simile—but most are coherent and voice-consistent. Minor template cadence in the confession paragraph: "about the job... about the man... about the art" is a three-part list that reads slightly mechanical. "Gently persistent as waves reshaping shore stones" and "shoreline lullaby, rhythmic and sure" approach stock oceanic phrasing. No paraphrase loops or major clarity breaks. Information density is solid; minimal scaffold.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The mentor-guides-seeker frame is familiar; transformation occurs through specific choices (ticket punch as active tool, upward not downward search, confession as turning point). The twilight vigil and indirect-routes method add texture, but the "unused courage waiting" resolution echoes self-help templates. Emotional specificity in the confession beat (job, man, art) personalizes the arc. The ticket punch's star-shaped center is a memorable particular. Risk-taking is moderate; the piece executes its lyric-fable mode cleanly but does not surprise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: present immediately. Development: they lead her upward and prompt the confession, constraining her path and forcing reflection. Payoff: they dissolve at closure after delivering the final directive. Their observation enables Mara's shift but they do not make visible choices that turn the plot; their role is facilitative. Swappable with other wise-mentor archetypes. Two beats (leading, prompting confession) and closure presence, but causal pressure is indirect.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup: introduced early (first third). Development: she uses it multiple times—punches leaves, presses bark, raises it to sky—each use a small action that shifts her perception. Payoff: "pocketing the punch like a promise" charges the final image; the star-shaped hole becomes the lens through which she sees the new path. Three distinct beats, causal role in reweighting her stance, irreplaceable symbolic and practical function. Visible cost: she must use it to see differently.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: "waiting as they always did in the hour between dog and wolf" signals vigil and twilight immediately. Development: the vigil structures the guides' role—they keep watch while Mara crosses from one stance to another. Payoff: "stood alone on the veiled ridgeway" and "gathering dark" anchor the closure in sustained twilight. The concept shapes the encounter's tone and timing (threshold moment) and charges the final image. Specificity: the vigil is not generic waiting; it brackets transformation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Setup: the woman guide's tone is "gentle and persistent as waves" in the first third. Development: this trait enables her to prompt the confession—Mara speaks because the guides' patience outlasts her resistance. Payoff: the older guide's voice is "shoreline lullaby, rhythmic and sure" at closure, reinforcing the trait in the final directive. The trait constrains their method (no direct answers, only patient leading) and enables the confession beat. Label-plus-embodiment; visible in action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: "traverse" appears in body text ("traversed another slope") mid-story. Development: the act of traversing upward (not down to beaches) and along indirect routes is the central physical action; each traverse is a small choice to follow rather than resist. Payoff: "traversing at last toward where both her dog and her courage had been waiting" charges the closure—she moves from following to self-directed motion. The action is irreplaceable; swapping to "walk" or "journey" would lose the specific grinding, difficult quality. Three beats, closure-active.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Setup: "The direct path won't lead you" signals the method in the first third. Development: they lead her upward into mist, not down to beaches—each detour dramatizes the principle. Payoff: "following the indirect routes that fear had always forbidden" makes the method the final breakthrough. The method constrains all middle movement and is inseparable from theme. Specificity: indirect is not vague; it means counter-intuitive, away from the obvious search zone. Two beats plus closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setup: "veiled ridgeway where mountain mist met ocean fog" anchors location immediately. Development: the ridgeway's upward direction forces Mara away from the beaches, altering her search tactics; the mist obscures and the guides use the ticket punch to navigate it. Payoff: "stood alone on the veiled ridgeway" and runs "down from the ridge" root the final choice in this exact terrain. The setting pressures every move and charges the closure image. Irreplaceable; no other landscape would supply the veil, height, and liminal meeting-place.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Setup: "She's been gone three days" and "the leash finally snapped" anchor time in the opening. Development: the broken-leash state structures every beat—Mara has already searched the obvious places, forcing her to accept the guides' help. Payoff: "for the first time in years, she felt ready to run" and "broken leash still in one hand" loop the timeframe into the closure. The "after" is sustained but not tightened by a ticking clock. The timeframe shapes her desperation and the guides' intervention but does not narrow options in real time. Early signal, closure presence, one causal constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Setup: Mara's stated goal is to find Luna; "where unused courage waits" is articulated by the guides mid-story. Development: the confession beat dramatizes the friction—she wanted safety, refused travel, abandoned art—courage was leashed. Payoff: "following...toward where both her dog and her courage had been waiting" makes the motivation explicit at closure. The want (find Luna) conflicts with the need (release control) throughout. Cost: she runs into dark without the leash, forfeiting safety. Told-then-shown: guides name it, Mara enacts it.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Setup: "hour between dog and wolf," "voice breaking like foam on stones," "gentle and persistent as waves" establish tone in the first third. Development: tone remains steady—lyric, oceanic, mythic—through confession and realization, never tipping into urgency or panic. Payoff: "shoreline lullaby, rhythmic and sure" in the final beat names the tone and the older guide's voice "dissolving like sea foam" completes the oceanic motif. Tone modulates subtly (Mara's breathlessness to her final readiness) but the lullaby quality persists, charging the quiet closure. Coherent, purposeful, closure-linked.</comment>
