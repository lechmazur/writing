<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elena's interiority is grounded in concrete ritual and contradiction (cremating portraits, finding purpose in abandonment). The shift from scattering ash to understanding incomplete images shows embodied perception through the mask rather than abstract epiphany. However, the founder remains a device rather than a fully dimensional character, and Elena's final stance—continuing her work "differently now"—lacks a micro-choice with visible cost that forecloses a live option. The reflection-heavy design (roughly 40% retrospective material) anchors in present stimuli (mask, chair, garden) but applies modest pressure to Elena's present choices, pushing against BRR's ceiling without fully earning the expanded allowance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Accumulative/Textural: density builds through the mask discovery, the garden ash-pattern reveal, and the final placement act. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Elena's decision to continue scattering "as acknowledgment rather than ending" reweights her ritual with felt cost (faith dispersed, safety revealed as mirage). Orientation anchors within 120 words (Elena, gallery, evening). One meaningful deepening occurs when the ash forms new words, reframing the founder's message and Elena's role. Cost is legible in "dispersing the components of faith itself," though the final image's felt price is more oblique than visceral.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The gallery's fog-edged architecture, perpetually rocking chair, and meditation garden constrain Elena's movements and charge the ending (mask placement, ash scattering). The mask's kintsugi construction (gold lacquer, sharp edges) is handled tactilely across multiple beats. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "fog," "charcoal," "particles," "stones." However, the "vanishing point" metaphor leans toward symbolic overlay rather than spatial choreography that alters tactics mid-scene. The garden and chair anchor closure, satisfying the 9+ gate test (environment charges the final image), but the gallery interior remains slightly generic beyond "walls lined with works."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is Elena's understanding of her ritual's meaning, signaled early through "melancholy work" and the founder's disappearance. The chair stopping (inciting incident) and the ash forming new words (reversal) tighten pressure once, reframing scattering from ending to acknowledgment. Agency is deliberate: Elena lifts the mask, reads, powders the message, and chooses to place the mask on the wall. Visible cost: faith in preservation is dispersed; she continues work under a reweighted understanding. The escalation is modest but coherent under the Accumulative lens—one meaningful deepening that narrows her stance without requiring multiple causal turns.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (the mirage of safety, incompleteness masked as wholeness) emerges organically from the mask's kintsugi construction, the gallery's partial images, and Elena's ritual. The ash forming "Safety is forgetting what the frame excludes" avoids stating a moral but hovers close to Thematic Echo. The ending offers a resonant answer: scattering honors "what had necessarily, honestly, been left out," reweighting prior material without sermon. Subtext operates in the mask's sharp edges softened by gilt and the founder's vanishing after declaring "the only honest art was ash." No overt philosophizing in the final paragraph, though the penultimate line ("Each portrait's cremation would honor...what had...been left out") edges toward thesis articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable; psychic distance shifts intentionally (close during mask handling, wider during reflection). Diction is consistent and voice-particular ("charcoal portrait ash scatterer," "mirage of safety," "components of faith"). No head-hopping. However, the narrative occasionally drifts into elevated register ("terrible, marvelous instant of recognition," "dispersing the components of faith itself") that, while apt for the contemplative mode, slightly exceeds Elena's established idiom under peak pressure. No dialogue to assess. Perceptual signature (ash patterns, incomplete paintings) is selective and character-specific. The piece teaches its reflective pattern early and pays it off at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; paragraph lengths create visual breath. Information density is high in key beats (mask discovery, ash-word reveal). However, mild paraphrase loops appear: "The gallery wasn't vanishing at its edges—it had never been complete. They'd all chosen to see wholeness where fragments existed" restates the same insight across adjacent sentences without added pressure. Template cadence: "She lifted...She held...She understood...She thought...She returned...She sat" stacks subject-verb stems across the middle third without pattern-taught payoff, triggering −0.4 in Q7. No filter-verb stacks in peak beats. Figurative language (fog, dissolution, ash) is coherent and purposeful, but the paraphrase loop and template run prevent entry to the 8-band.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The kintsugi mask and ash-scatterer occupation offer fresh angles on preservation and incompleteness. The founder's disappearance and the rocking chair's stop are specific, non-generic choices. However, the core premise (art curator discovers hidden truth about her work through symbolic object) follows a recognizable literary template without fully transforming it through lived occupational detail or a non-obvious moral calculus. The ash forming new words is a clever turn but slightly convenient. Emotional specificity (melancholy work, faith dispersed) avoids generic templates. The mirage-of-safety theme is coherent but not boldly unconventional. The piece synthesizes familiar elements competently; transformation is partial.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elena discovers the mask, lifts it, powders the message, scatters ash, and places the mask on the wall—beats spread across setup, middle, and closure. Her choices alter tactics (from ending to acknowledgment) and participate in closure. However, her decision to "continue her work, but differently now" is more stance crystallization than a choice with visible forfeiture. Specific cost (faith dispersed) is tied to her role but feels conceptual rather than immediate. Early signal, multiple beats, closure linkage present; causal pressure moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The mask is discovered (setup), examined through its eye slits (middle beat revealing incomplete paintings), and placed on the wall (closure participation). Its kintsugi construction (gold lacquer, sharp edges, charcoal message) is handled tactilely across beats, and its meaning reweights: from artifact to symbol of constructed safety. All three gates satisfied; strong causal pressure (the mask enables Elena's realization); closure linkage solid. Irreplaceability high (the shattered-reassembled form is essential to theme). Cost tied to the mask's use (faith dispersed through its lens).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The mirage of safety is seeded through the founder's lectures and paid off in Elena's realization ("safety revealed itself as mirage"). It shapes stakes (understanding her ritual's true purpose) and the final image (scattering as acknowledgment of incompleteness). However, the concept operates more as thematic scaffolding than as a constraint that narrows on-page options. Setup and payoff gates satisfied; middle development weak (no choice directly hinges on the mirage). Lyric resonance reweights the dominant stake, but causal pressure is oblique.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The founder "weaves truth carefully" by showing visitors partial images (landscapes missing skies, portraits with hands omitted). Elena discovers this trait via the mask's lens. Setup (founder's obsession mentioned early), payoff (partial images revealed), but no middle beat where this trait constrains Elena's choice. The trait enables understanding but does not impose visible cost. Functional but replaceable; swappable with "conceals truth selectively" without structural change. Causal role in one beat (revelation through mask).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Powdering the charcoal message is the pivot: Elena performs her usual ritual, but this time the ash forms new words, triggering her realization. The action drives the key reversal (from ending to acknowledgment) and participates in closure (scattering the powder). Setup (ritual described early), middle (powdering reveals new message), payoff (scattering as acknowledgment). However, the action itself (grinding charcoal) is not unique—dissolving/reading/scattering is a compound beat where the reading matters more than the grinding. Causal pressure solid; specificity moderate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Elena perceives the gallery's paintings as incomplete through the mask's eye slits. The method is dramatized in one beat (middle revelation) but not signaled early or shaped by prior attempts. Setup gate missed (no mention of incomplete information as a method until the mask scene). Development and payoff present but weak. The method enables one realization but does not constrain tactics or recur with reweighted meaning. Functional in one beat; swappable with "hidden meaning" or "partial truth" without major edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The gallery's meditation garden, corner chair, and fog-edged walls pressure Elena's ritual and supply the closure location (mask placement, ash scattering). Setup (gallery described early), middle (chair stops, mask discovered), payoff (garden scattering, wall placement). The setting constrains choices (where to scatter, where to place the mask) and charges the final image. However, the "vanishing point" remains more metaphor than spatial mechanic—the gallery's edges dissolving into fog does not alter Elena's tactics. Causal pressure moderate; closure linkage solid.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.3</grade><comment>The rocking chair's stop marks the inciting incident, and its "strange new silence" bookends the story in Elena's final seated moment. Setup and payoff gates satisfied; middle development absent (the chair does not constrain Elena's choices after it stops). Time is not tracked as a live clock; the "evening" frame is vague. The chair functions as a symbolic marker rather than a tightening constraint. Lyric resonance reweights the opening, but causal pressure is minimal. Swappable with "as the gallery closes" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Elena's desire to crystallize the "fleeting moment when safety revealed itself as mirage" is articulated late (final third) and operates more as thematic claim than dramatized want. Her on-page goal is to understand the founder's message and her own ritual, which she achieves. The motivation shapes her final stance (continuing work as acknowledgment) but lacks friction between competing wants. Setup weak (motivation arrives via the mask's charcoal inscription, not Elena's prior desire); payoff present. Cost is conceptual (faith dispersed) rather than a felt trade-off between desires.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Tone is consistently somber (melancholy work, ominous stillness, "terrible, marvelous instant") yet tinged with wonder (mask's gold lacquer, ash forming new words, "marvelous"). Modulates with pressure: contemplative in reflection, taut during mask handling and ash-pattern discovery, quiet resolve at closure. Coherent through turns; charges the final image ("ash settled into the spaces between stones, filling gaps, completing nothing"). No tonal whiplash or static flatness. The tone supports the piece's accumulative design and reweights the dominant stake (understanding incompleteness) without overt sentiment.</comment>
