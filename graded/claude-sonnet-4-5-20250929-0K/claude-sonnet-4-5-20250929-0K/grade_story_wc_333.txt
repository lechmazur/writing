<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's arc from avoidance to acceptance is present but leans on label-only interiority: "punctual," "unassumingly bold," "ready." The sister's backstory is told rather than embodied, and Mara's transformation into locksmith arrives as announcement rather than earned stance crystallization. Internal conflict between fear and longing exists but remains abstract; micro-choices (unwinding the ribbon, walking seven steps) feel like puzzle-solving rather than character-specific renunciation with visible cost. The final "I'm ready" declaration replaces on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural. The nexus setup, ribbon coordinates, and descent into the room create a pattern, and the final "new locksmith" line offers a reconfiguration. However, the Orientation Test applies: who/where/when anchors arrive late (~100+ words of atmospheric scene-setting before "Mara" names the POV), and the disorientation itself is told ("sense of direction dissolve") rather than embodied through Mara's perceptual breakdown. The closure lands (Mara's transformation), but the cost—leaving her old life, confronting systemic fear—is implied rather than made legible on the page. No specific sentence shows what Mara forfeits.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The nexus, twilight star, cobblestones-as-water, and the underground room of doors provide vivid micro-settings. The ribbon constrains Mara's path (coordinates guide her steps), satisfying the 9+ gate requirement. However, sensory selection leans visual-only ("indigo sky," "dark water," "charcoal gray"), and the disorientation is asserted ("up became sideways") without tactile or proprioceptive grounding. The "room made of doors" arrives late and functions as a reveal rather than a lived-in constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: confronting her sister's vanishing and the city's hidden truth. One tightening occurs when Mara decodes the ribbon and descends, narrowing her path from avoidance to action. Yet the locksmith's guidance reduces Mara's agency—she is told what to do rather than choosing under conflicting pressure. The final transformation to "new locksmith" is declared by the locksmith rather than earned through Mara's refusal of a safer option. No live trade-off or visible price is dramatized at closure; the cost remains conceptual.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—secrets as collective fears, city as living architecture—emerges from concrete images (nexus, doors, ribbon coordinates). The sister's transformation into "hidden architecture" offers a resonant final reweighting. However, the last paragraph edges into moralizing: "The first star told me you would be." The book's idea ("The city is alive… every locked door a fear we collectively decided to keep closed") is stated rather than implied through action. The piece invites reflection but closes by telling rather than showing the thematic answer.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable, anchored to Mara. Psychic distance is controlled, and the locksmith's voice ("You already have the key") carries distinct cadence. However, the prose drifts into elevated diction incongruent with Mara's fear-state: "across the hush of cosmic possibility," "envelope themselves in layers of fear." Under peak stress (the nexus spinning), Mara's perception is summarized ("disorientation washing through her") rather than shown through fragmented syntax or sensory breakdown. Dialogue advances plot but leans expository.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and several images land (cobblestones "gleamed like dark water," the star's pulse matching the streets). However, figurative language clusters densely: "shadow of the old fountain," "swallowed light," "dark water," "enveloped secrets," "hush of cosmic possibility" within the opening third—elevated register without pattern-teaching or payoff. Paraphrase loop: "Neither old nor young" / "deliberately forgettable" restates the same idea. Template cadence in the sister's description: "Not died—vanished… Not the hair—the ribbon." Propulsion is intermittent; the locksmith's exposition stalls momentum mid-scene.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The locksmith-as-guide and hidden-city-consciousness premise echo familiar urban fantasy and mystery-school templates (mentor reveals truth to chosen initiate). The ribbon-as-map and the room-of-doors are vivid particulars, but the emotional arc (orphaned seeker inherits mentor's role) follows a well-worn path without transformation. The sister's fate—becoming part of the city—offers a fresh inflection, but the closure ("a new locksmith was born") is announced rather than earned through a non-obvious synthesis. Risk-taking in the disorientation sequence is present but does not fully land.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The locksmith appears early, guides Mara through two beats (nexus conversation, steadying her shoulder), and names the closure ("a new locksmith was born"). However, the locksmith's choices are limited: they explain, gesture, and fade. No on-page decision by the locksmith alters Mara's path; Mara decodes the ribbon and descends without the locksmith forcing a trade-off. Setup and payoff are present; middle development (a choice that constrains Mara) is weak.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lock of hair tied with ribbon is introduced early, handled in two distinct beats (Mara clutches it, then unwraps it to reveal coordinates), and the ribbon's embroidered symbols constrain her final path (seven steps north, three east, one down). The hair itself is scattered, a micro-sacrifice. The ribbon's coordinates are irreplaceable—removing the ribbon would break the closure mechanism. Strong setup, development, and closure participation. Cost is present but light (scattering hair is symbolic rather than viscerally felt).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Enveloped secrets" is named explicitly ("secrets envelope themselves in layers of fear") and the city's hidden truth (doors, book) dramatizes it. The concept shapes the dominant stake (Mara must unlock what she's kept sealed). However, it functions more as thematic overlay than on-page constraint; Mara's tactics (decode ribbon, walk coordinates) are puzzle-steps rather than choices where the nature of "enveloped secrets" forces a trade-off. Functional but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Unassumingly bold" is applied to the sister ("Your sister was unassumingly bold") as a label, not dramatized. Mara's actions—decoding the ribbon, descending—could read as bold, but the text does not tie those moves to the specific tension of being "unassuming." No on-page cost where Mara's boldness conflicts with her desire to remain unseen. Present as characterization claim; absent as causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Disorient" appears explicitly: the nexus spins, Mara's sense of direction dissolves, the locksmith coaches her through it. The disorientation functions as the lock's defense mechanism and must be endured for Mara to decode the ribbon. Two beats (the spinning streets, the locksmith's steadying) involve it. However, the disorientation is told ("up became sideways") rather than shown through Mara's fragmented perception. Removing it would require rewriting the nexus encounter, so it's essential but not irreplaceable in execution.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The first star at twilight is introduced in the opening line, pulses to match the spinning streets, and the locksmith credits it at closure ("The first star told me you would be"). The star's hint is the rhythm (pulse), which Mara uses to decode the nexus. Setup and payoff are strong; middle development is implicit (the pulse guides her timing). The mechanics are present but not foregrounded—Mara does not overtly adjust her steps to the pulse. Causal role is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The "shadowed nexus under starlight" is introduced early, hosts the key action (nexus spins, Mara decodes ribbon, descends through cobblestones), and the final image returns to it ("in the shadowed nexus under starlight, a new locksmith was born"). The nexus's geometry ("five streets met in impossible geometry") and spinning streets create pressure that Mara must endure. The underground room extends the setting. Strong setup, development (the nexus's physics constrain Mara), and closure participation. Starlight charges the final image.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Across the hush of cosmic possibility" appears twice, framing the piece. However, it functions as atmospheric phrasing rather than a tracked timeframe. No clock tightens Mara's decisions; the nexus encounter could unfold over minutes or hours without altering tactics. The phrase charges tone but does not constrain action. Present as mood; absent as time pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara's motivation—to unlock what she's kept sealed, to understand her sister's fate, to free the dangerous idea—is stated early and drives her descent. The locksmith names it: "to unlock what you've kept sealed… an idea too dangerous to speak." Mara's choice to scatter the hair and follow the coordinates dramatizes the desire. However, the friction between fear and longing is told rather than shown in conflicting micro-choices. Setup and closure are strong; middle friction is implied rather than embodied.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Improbable longing" is named once ("Their voice carried an improbable longing, as if they'd watched countless others fail"). The locksmith's tone supports it. The piece's atmosphere—Mara's three-year avoidance, the starlight vigil—evokes longing. However, the tone does not modulate measurably with pressure; the locksmith remains serene, Mara's interiority stays abstract. The final image ("I'm ready" / "I know") carries quiet resolution but not heightened yearning. Present as mood; does not charge the climax.</comment>
