<comment>Mara's interior motivation is clearly signaled ("what trees witness—what memories live in their rings") and drives her through the extraction work. The physical acts—pressing palm to bark, drawing crystallized dreams—ground her agency in embodied choices. However, the emotional journey remains largely observational; her transformation from curiosity to knowledge lacks internal contradiction or a visible cost that forecloses a prior path. The work proceeds smoothly without genuine struggle, limiting the sense of earned change.</comment>

<comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds density through repeated tree-by-tree extraction until the pattern crystallizes meaning at closure. Orientation anchors cleanly (Mara, tower base, midnight shift). The final image—dreams dissolving into fountain water to nourish new seedlings—offers Resonant Reconfiguration (the labyrinth's cyclical witness-and-release function is revealed), and conceptual cost is legible (sorrow must be extracted and transformed; trees will absorb anew). One meaningful deepening occurs when Mara witnesses the moonlight transformation, reweighting her understanding of maintenance work.</comment>

<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The stormlit tower, moonlight breaking through clouds, and the northwestern maze provide vivid sensory grounding. The broken sextant functions as micro-setting/tool, constraining Mara's method (she cannot measure stars, only dreams). The moonlight actively transforms the extracted dreams, charging the closure image where "dreams dissolved into water that would nourish new seedlings." Spatial choreography (tower exterior stairs, maze entry, fountain) remains coherent throughout.</comment>

<comment>Dominant stake: understand what trees witness and deconstruct the maze safely before dawn. The first tree extraction provides a meaningful tightening—Mara discovers the trees hold human sorrow and witnesses the moonlight miracle, reweighting her task from mechanical removal to sacred transformation. However, the work proceeds without setback or forced trade-off; each tree yields its dream cleanly, and dawn arrives as scheduled. The escalation is more accumulative density than narrowing pressure, fitting the lens but limiting tension.</comment>

<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Theme emerges organically: sorrow can be measured, witnessed, and healed through patient work. The sextant's brokenness-as-new-function and the moonlight transformation avoid didacticism. The final image—"sorrow could be measured, witnessed, and healed... This was the work—mundane, miraculous, necessary"—risks mild thematic statement but remains grounded in Mara's concrete labor and the fountain image. The piece resists false equivalence (the labyrinth's function is affirmed, not questioned) and the ending reconfigures "maintenance" from janitorial duty to sacred stewardship.</comment>

<question>6</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and close to Mara's perceptual signature ("what trees witness" frames her curiosity; "she'd discovered it could measure something else entirely" reflects her professional precision). Diction fits a maintenance worker with poetic sensibility ("Dreams accumulated in corners, pooled in dead ends, crystallized on leaves like dew"). Minor slips: "quantified sorrow: precise measurements of longing, loss, hope deferred. Three units of grief here, seven of yearning there" edges toward tell-not-show and repeats the concept without deepening it mid-paragraph. Psychic distance modulates appropriately from task-focus to wonder.</comment>

<question>7</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and lengths create visual flow. Information density is high in the sextant introduction and tree extraction beats. Minor artifacts: "She'd always wondered what trees witness—what memories live in their rings, what truths their roots gather" uses dashes for synonym expansion without advancing pressure. "The dream healed in moonlight. The sorrow transformed, not erased but resolved" paraphrases across adjacent sentences. "Mundane, miraculous, necessary" in the final paragraph risks theme-label stacking. These accumulate to −0.6 but do not obscure closure clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>7.9</grade>
<comment>The broken-instrument-as-new-tool (sextant measuring dreams instead of stars) offers a fresh synthesis. "Quantified sorrow" with unit measurements provides specific, non-obvious detail that grounds the fantasy conceit. The tree-witness premise transforms familiar "trees remember" tropes through the maintenance-work frame and moonlight-healing mechanism. The emotional truth—that holding others' pain changes the holder—resonates without safety-hedging. Risk: the ending's explicit articulation of theme ("sorrow could be measured, witnessed, and healed") edges toward statement over implication, but the fountain image rescues it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>Mara's role is signaled early (maintenance worker, shift change) and her choices drive all major beats: gathering tools, climbing the tower, extracting dreams tree by tree, placing them in the fountain. Her professional curiosity ("what trees witness") motivates the work and is answered by the extraction sequence. However, her decisions feel exploratory rather than conflicted; no alternate path is foreclosed with visible cost. Present in setup, development, and closure; causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The sextant appears in tool-gathering, is explained ("couldn't measure stars anymore... could measure something else entirely"), and is used on the tower to map the maze's dream-coordinates. It enables Mara's method and returns with reweighted meaning (broken-as-new-function). Present in three beats (gathering, tower mapping, implicit use in extractions) and shapes tactics. Specific properties (shattered mirrors, bent arc) matter to its re-purposing. However, it does not constrain a choice or appear in the closure image itself, limiting indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>8.1</grade>
<comment>"Quantified sorrow" is introduced early ("precise measurements of longing, loss"), demonstrated on-page ("Four-point-three units of grief, the sextant confirmed"), and drives the extraction mechanics. The numeric transformation (4.3 → 0.1) provides the story's key turn—sorrow heals but is not erased. The concept shapes stakes (trees have absorbed too much and must be deconstructed) and tactics (each dream must be measured, extracted, and moonlight-transformed). Present in setup, multiple middle beats, and closure participation (transformed dreams dissolve into fountain). High causal pressure and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>7.8</grade>
<comment>Moonlight healing is set up ("moonlight broke through the storm clouds in a shaft of pure silver"), demonstrated on-page when the first extracted dream transforms ("the mundane miracle she'd heard about but never witnessed"), and drives the resolution (all dreams are healed at night under the moon before dawn). The trait constrains timing (work must occur at night under moonlight) and enables the transformation that answers Mara's quest. Present in setup, pivotal middle beat, and implicit in closure. Visible cost: the work is slow, must be completed before dawn, and requires exposure to storm conditions.</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>8.3</grade>
<comment>"Deconstruct the northwestern hedge maze" is the assignment given early, frames the entire task, and is completed by closure ("the northwestern maze stood quiet, its trees returned to simple wood and leaf"). The action redefines "deconstruct" from destruction to careful extraction and transformation—a major semantic turn. Drives all middle beats (tree-by-tree removal) and the final image (maze quiet, dreams in fountain). Could not be swapped for "repair" or "prune" without losing the story's premise. High causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The method is explained early ("Mara had learned to map scattered dreams... The sextant... could triangulate their positions"), demonstrated when she raises the sextant on the tower ("The northwestern maze appeared in her vision, overlaid with glowing points of light"), and executed in the extraction sequence. It shapes her approach (systematic, coordinate-driven) and enables the work. Present in setup, development (tower mapping), and implicit in each extraction. Moderate causal pressure; the specificity of "mapping" matters less than extraction itself, making it somewhat swappable with "locate" or "sense."</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The stormlit tower and moonlight are vivid and persistent: Mara climbs the exterior stairs through wind and rain, moonlight breaks through clouds, and the moon transforms the dreams. The setting provides timing constraint (nighttime moonlight required) and atmospheric charge. However, the tower functions more as vantage point than tactical constraint—Mara could map from ground level. Present in setup, development (tower climb), and closure mood. Moderate contribution; the moonlight matters more than the tower structure itself.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>4.2</grade>
<comment>The pin drop marks midnight shift change and opens the story with vivid specificity ("its tiny chime announcing the midnight shift change"). However, the timeframe functions only as atmospheric anchor; the work proceeds through the night to dawn without clock pressure. No choice is tightened by elapsed time or urgency beyond the general "before dawn" deadline, which is met without tension. Present in setup and closure bookend (morning shift pin drop) but does not constrain middle tactics. Ornamental use of a specific moment.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Mara's desire "to discover what trees witness" is stated early ("Mara had always wondered"), drives her curiosity through the extraction work, and is answered on-page ("what trees witness is everything we cannot bear to carry alone"). The motivation is dramatized in her careful approach to the first tree and her wonder at the moonlight miracle. However, it lacks internal conflict—no competing desire or cost pulls against her curiosity. Present in setup, middle realization, and closure knowledge. Moderate friction; more quest than struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>8.0</grade>
<comment>"Mundane miracles" is embodied throughout: shift-change pins, maintenance uniforms, pruning shears that "cut through probability," broken tools re-purposed, sorrow measured in units, moonlight healing. The tone remains coherent—workmanlike precision meets quiet wonder—and modulates subtly (task focus → awe at first transformation → satisfied knowledge). The phrase appears explicitly in the final third ("the mundane miracle she'd heard about") and again at closure ("mundane, miraculous, necessary"), charging the ending. The tone shapes every beat and reweights the concept of "maintenance" as sacred labor.</comment>
