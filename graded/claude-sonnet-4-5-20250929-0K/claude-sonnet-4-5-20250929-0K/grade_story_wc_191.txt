<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kaida's professional motivation is clear and her arc from cataloger to descender is earned, but interiority lacks embodied contradiction under pressure. The "wisely adventurous certainty" label appears without dramatized tension between caution and risk. The final choice to descend feels inevitable rather than earned through conflicting impulses acting simultaneously in scene. Emotional states are asserted more than shown through contradictory bodily experience.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with accumulative texture. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise)—Kaida descends into the archive, reweighting "ascension" and "throne" with conceptual cost legible in the final image. The sunrise deadline tightens options and the ruby flake knowledge creates a meaningful turn. Orientation is swift (lore keeper, chapel wall, empire ruins established by ~80 words). One small causality hiccup: the palace "recognizing her" after the ruby flake dissolves borders on convenient rather than fully motivated by prior setup.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The orchard's circuit-bark and fiber-optic waterfall constrain Kaida's path and charge the final throne-room choice. Smart-stone walls shifting through programmed seasons anchor the futuristic setting with purpose. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from chapel to rail-bike to ruins to orchard to throne room. The glass-floor peeling and descending stairway serve as micro-setting that alters the closure image decisively.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—finding the stairway—is signaled early and tightens through the sunrise deadline. The ruby flake moment narrows Kaida's options by revealing hidden engravings, creating one meaningful escalation. Agency is clear in her choice to descend. The sunrise activating orbital mirrors creates temporal pressure, but the resolution feels slightly frictionless once the palace "opens" for her; a visible cost or trade-off at the threshold would sharpen the final beat.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—ascension as descent into truth rather than climbing over others—emerges through the orchard's hidden space, the ruby flake's data-gift, and the downward stairway. "Futuristic nostalgia" and "serving memory" cohere without overt statement. The final image of descending steps "into light" reweights "throne claimed not by sitting, but by remembering" with resonance. One phrase borders on thesis: "ascending to understanding... serving memory itself" skirts direct moral statement but recovers through the physical descent that follows.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited and voice is distinct ("futuristic nostalgia," "world-that-was"). Psychic distance is consistent. The ruby flake "spoke—not in sound but in pure data streaming" is an elegant filter that respects Kaida's neural interface. Minor slip: "She was a lore keeper, and she'd finally found what had always been waiting" in the final paragraph edges toward helpful-narrator summary rather than trusting the image. Perceptual signature is present but could be sharper under peak stress.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in the chapel and orchard beats. Two issues lower the score: "her scanner crackling against the chapel's wall" then "Each frequency pulse peeled back another era" is paraphrase-loop (−0.2). The phrase "make her pulse quicken with the kind of wisely adventurous certainty that separated historians from treasure hunters" is register drift into authorial commentary (−0.3). Final paragraph's "she was a lore keeper" summary flattens momentum slightly. Otherwise propulsion is strong and figurative language ("light parted like beaded curtains") is coherent.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Ascension as descent" and the orchard-behind-projector are fresh inflections on hidden-knowledge fantasy. The fiber-optic waterfall and smart-stone walls synthesize sci-fi texture with mythic quest in a specific, non-obvious way. Risk: the story commits to its premise fully. One friction: the palace doors opening "without resistance" after the ruby flake feels slightly convenient, reducing the transformation cost. The lore-keeper frame distinguishes this from a generic treasure hunt, and the ending's image-driven resonance avoids the explain-everything trap.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kaida's choices drive the inciting scan, the journey to the ruins, pushing through the waterfall, lifting the ruby flake, and the final descent. Present in setup, middle, and closure. Her decision to descend rather than report the find is causally grounded in her profession and the autocrats' threat. High irreplaceability: the story is her arc.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Ruby flake appears at the orchard's heart (midpoint), dissolves against Kaida's palm to grant knowledge (second beat), and its effects enable the throne-room revelation (closure participation). Three distinct beats with causal pressure. The flake's unique property—streaming data into her neural interface—matters and is irreplaceable. Cost is conceptual (she becomes the archive's servant). Minor: it arrives late (past 40% mark) but transforms prior material decisively.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The unclaimed throne is introduced in the second paragraph, framing the quest. It reappears at closure when Kaida kneels and the floor peels to reveal descending steps, reweighting "throne" from seat-of-power to marker-of-truth. Two beats (setup, closure). The concept constrains her understanding and alters the ending's meaning, but middle development is thin—she never confronts the throne's symbolic weight until the final scene.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Wisely adventurous" appears once as a label in the opening paragraph ("the kind of wisely adventurous certainty that separated historians from treasure hunters"). It does not constrain an on-page choice with visible cost; Kaida's actions read as determined rather than torn between wisdom and adventure. Swappable with "confident" or "bold" without structural loss. Ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Sally" appears once: "her footsteps echoing through the orchard as she made her sally back toward the throne room." It marks the transition from orchard to palace but does not create a turn or redefine options; easily replaceable with "run" or "dash." The action moves the plot but lacks unique causal properties. Functional but mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Paint-layer peeling is the inciting method (scanner pulses peel back eras to reveal the mural in the opening beat), returns as metaphor when the glass floor peels to reveal steps (closure beat), and structures Kaida's archaeological identity throughout. Two on-page uses with metaphoric reprise that charges the ending. High specificity: the method is irreplaceable and its mechanics matter. Strong closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Hidden orchard is signaled in the mural (setup), explored at midpoint (spiral trees, circuit bark, ruby flake at its heart—distinct resources), and its memory pressures Kaida's final choice to descend rather than report. Three beats. The orchard's impossible-space geometry and bioluminescent trees are specific and irreplaceable. It supplies the ruby flake, which unlocks the throne room. Strong causal role and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Until sunrise" is stated early and the orbital mirrors' dawn activation is mentioned twice, creating urgency. The final paragraph notes "first rays of orbital sunrise" as Kaida descends, confirming the clock ran out. The deadline tightens her choice to act immediately rather than return later. Two beats (setup, closure reprise). Cost is implied—she crosses the threshold just as surveillance begins—but middle tactics are not visibly shaped by time pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Finding the stairway is Kaida's stated goal from paragraph two, drives her scan-discovery and journey, and is fulfilled when she kneels and the glass peels to reveal descending steps. Three beats (setup, middle pursuit, closure achievement). The motivation is dramatized through her actions and choices rather than merely told. The ruby flake creates friction by revealing the stairway's hidden location and redefining "ascension." Strong causal linkage and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Futuristic nostalgia is named in paragraph three ("mourning technologies more elegant than what replaced them") and permeates the smart-stone walls, fiber-optic waterfall, rail-bike's magnetic hum, and the lost empire's mastery. Tone modulates from wistful catalog to urgent discovery to reverent descent. The final image—descending into the old archive hidden from corruption—charges the nostalgic longing with purpose. Coherent through turns and legible at closure, though the label itself in paragraph three is slightly on-the-nose.</comment>
