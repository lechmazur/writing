<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's choice to declare herself after months of anonymous work is motivated by a clear concern about cultural continuity, and the young woman's response provides embodied confirmation. However, the resolution feels too clean—families arrive, listen, and the young woman's pledge arrives without visible internal struggle or cost to her own plans. The dawn-to-morning compression and Mara's interior access remain consistent, but the emotional pivot at the arbor lacks the contradictory impulses that would mark genuine crisis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors early (Mara, arbor, dawn, sanctions context by paragraph two). The drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece builds through descriptive density (bell inscriptions, midnight runs, network calls) toward a tonal shift when Mara rings the bell and declares the network, crystallizing the community's knowledge and future stance. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the young woman's pledge and the final image of "fed futures" reconfigure survival into continuity with felt cost (exile persists, sanctions remain). One ambiguity: the midnight-run habit and the declaration feel like separate modes without a single causal tightening that forces the choice to reveal; the turn reads more thematic than pressure-driven.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The terra-cotta arbor recurs across the opening, middle, and closure, grounding the declaration scene and charging the final image with historical weight (three generations, crumbling clay, morning light). The silver bell's inscriptions and border-crossing history anchor it in lived experience. Sensory economy is strong—"dirt roads lay empty under stars," "headlights cutting tunnels"—without catalog sprawl. The arbor's physical state (crumbling, repaired by hand) subtly mirrors the community's fragility and persistence, meeting the micro-setting test for choice constraint at closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—cultural continuity versus dissolution through exile—is signaled early and sustained. Mara's decision to declare the network is a meaningful tightening that forecloses anonymity and exposes the structure to risk, and the young woman's pledge provides an on-page answer. However, the escalation is more thematic accumulation than tactical pressure: no antagonist tests the midnight runs, no donor threatens withdrawal, no internal faction resists transparency. The cost of declaration (exposure, potential sanctions violations) is implied but not dramatized in a beat where Mara or a donor faces a concrete price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the contrast between anonymous survival and named continuity, crystallized in Mara's line "anonymous donations feed our bodies, but they starve something else." The silver bell's generational passage and the arbor's decay both charge the final image without overt symbolism. The young woman's request ("Teach us") reweights prior material—exile becomes transmission rather than abandonment—without a stated moral. One slip: "fed futures" in the penultimate paragraph edges toward thematic summary, though it stops short of sermonizing.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds steady on Mara with no head-hopping; psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority ("rolling the antique silver bell between her palms, feeling the inscriptions") to slightly elevated communal observation ("exile itself might not"). Dialogue carries subtext and goal pursuit—the old man's "Why tell us now?" and the young woman's "Teach us" both advance the thematic question without exposition. Diction remains consistent: "shame of need compounded by statelessness" fits an educated exile leader without register drift. Free indirect style is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies effectively—short declaratives ("She decided to declare herself, but carefully") against longer accumulative phrases ("the children studying by candlelight… the elder men repairing… the women teaching"). Two minor loops: "anonymity, she realized, had limits" is paraphrased two lines later as "anonymous donations feed our bodies, but they starve something else"; and "three generations of exile" in the opening echoes structurally in "intergenerational" later without adding pressure. The final paragraph stacks three negations ("neither would exile mean… nor survival mean") that slightly muddy the closure image. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence runs; information density is high.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The premise—anonymous aid under sanctions—is familiar from diaspora and resistance narratives, but the specific inflection (building intergenerational memory through revelation rather than secrecy) offers a fresh angle. The silver bell as a carried object across borders and the terra-cotta arbor as a fixed communal anchor both feel particular. However, the emotional arc follows a predictable template: noble secret-keeper → communal revelation → pledge of continuity. The young woman's response arrives without complication, and no counter-pressure (a dissenter, a practical objection, a donor's fear) tests the transformation, leaving the turn feeling more assured than earned.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's choices drive the two major beats: building the anonymous network (paragraphs 3–5) and declaring it publicly (paragraphs 7–10). Her decision to reveal herself narrows options (exposes donors, risks sanctions enforcement) and the young woman's pledge confirms the intergenerational stake. Early signal strong; closure linkage direct.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The bell is handled in the opening (Mara rolls it, feels inscriptions), rung three times to summon the community (paragraph 7), and held up during the speech (paragraph 9). Its border-crossing history seeds the intergenerational theme, and the final image ("ready to call generations yet unborn") reweights it. However, the bell does not constrain a tactical choice or alter an outcome; it functions as a召唤 device and thematic echo rather than causal lever. Two-beat presence with lyric reprise → mid-6 range.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Anonymous donations shape the central conflict: Mara builds the network (paragraphs 3–5), realizes anonymity "had limits" (paragraph 6), and abandons it by declaring the network (paragraphs 7–10). The concept redefines the stakes from survival to continuity and alters Mara's tactics (from secrecy to transparency). Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong; the young woman's pledge depends on knowing the network exists.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Gently persistent" is attributed to Mara's phone calls (paragraph 4: "gently persistent phone calls and careful trust") and echoes in her decision-making (paragraph 6: "carefully"; paragraph 11: "persist gently but unbreakably"). The trait colors her method but does not constrain a choice with visible cost—she succeeds in building the network without friction from her gentleness, and no beat shows a tradeoff where persistence costs her speed or safety. Label-plus-method usage without on-page cost → mid-5 range.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Declare" is the fulcrum action: Mara's choice to reveal the network (paragraph 6: "She decided to declare herself") redefines the story's second half, the bell-ringing and speech dramatize it (paragraphs 7–9), and the young woman's response confirms the reweighted stakes. Removing this action would collapse the intergenerational turn into continued secrecy. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Midnight food runs are established early (paragraph 3: "She began at midnight… her truck… carried bread, rice, tins"), recur in paragraph 4 ("driving through midnight streets, her headlights cutting tunnels"), and frame Mara's speech (paragraph 8: "I've been making the midnight runs"). The method shapes the network's secrecy and the logistics of anonymous aid, though the runs themselves do not face on-page obstacle or tactical pivot. Method signaled, sustained, and tied to the declaration beat → solid 7-band.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The arbor anchors the opening and closing, frames the declaration scene (paragraphs 7–10), and its physical state (crumbling, three generations old, repaired by elders) mirrors the community's fragility. Morning light warming the clay charges the final image. However, the arbor does not constrain a tactical choice—Mara could have gathered the community anywhere. Strong closure linkage and thematic charge, but no causal pressure → upper-6 range.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The sanctions period is signaled early (paragraph 2: "The sanctions had tightened like a noose") and tracks through "the sixth sanctions month" (paragraph 7). Time pressure shapes the stakes (food scarcity, statelessness, young people leaving) and motivates Mara's shift from survival to continuity. However, no on-page clock tightens a choice—donations continue, no deadline looms, and the declaration's timing feels thematic rather than forced by escalating sanctions. Setup and development clear; causal tightening absent → mid-6 range.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Mara's goal to build intergenerational support is dramatized through the network (paragraphs 3–5), articulated in her realization that "anonymous donations… starve something else" (paragraph 6), and actualized in the declaration and the young woman's pledge (paragraphs 8–11). The motivation drives two major beats and shapes the closure. Minor friction: no visible cost or competing desire (e.g., safety, donor relationships) complicates the choice to declare. Strong development and closure linkage with light internal conflict → high-7 range.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Amplified quiet" operates throughout: "the settlement's dirt roads lay empty under stars" (paragraph 3), "The amplified quiet of the ridge seemed to deepen" (paragraph 10), and the final image of morning light and the bell "ready to call generations yet unborn" sustain a hushed, charged atmosphere. Tone modulates from solitary midnight work to communal gathering without breaking register. The phrase "amplified quiet" directly appears once (paragraph 10), confirming the taught pattern. Coherent modulation and closure charge → low-7 range.</comment>
