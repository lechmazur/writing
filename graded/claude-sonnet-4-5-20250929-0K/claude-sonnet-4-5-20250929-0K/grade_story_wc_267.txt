<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Rielle's journey shows embodied physical sensation ("pins and needles blossoming into crude sensation") and her motivation to understand cost drives choices throughout. Silent-Choir demonstrates consistent character particularity through action rather than exposition—his muteness is dramatized, not merely stated. The final piano-playing scene delivers earned agency: Rielle chooses to remain and play despite pain, accepting the cost of survival. Minor deduction for Silent-Choir's trauma being gestured at but never concretized enough to test his own hierarchy of values on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Inferred lens: Accumulative/Textural with Situational pressure. The piece anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph (Rielle climbing, cobalt fortress, three months post-battle). Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Rielle accepts that "someone always paid" the cost and chooses to play through pain, forecloses the option of retreat, with the cost visible in "each note a small resurrection." The staircase discoloration → music room → piano bench bolt → final anthem playing accumulates pressure and reweights the opening question. One meaningful deepening is present and the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress, snow, arrow-slitted windows, and broken piano bench bolt all ground the scene with concrete, selective detail. The piano bench bolt constrains a choice: its wobble is felt when Rielle sits, reminding her of damage and persistence. Spatial choreography remains clear (staircase → landing → eastern corridor → music room). Deduction for "seraphically mundane precision" in the Silent-Choir introduction—elevated diction clashes slightly with the POV's urgency and reads ornamental rather than perception-driven in that beat.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: Rielle needs to understand what safety cost. Pressure tightens through the accumulation of details (staircase path, Silent-Choir's presence, the wobbling bench, the children's story) until the final choice to play despite pain. Agency is clear: Rielle's decision to sit and play forecloses the option of avoidance, with on-page cost ("her regenerating nerves sparked and ached"). One credible tightening is present. Minor gap: the enemy's discovery of the children is mentioned but not dramatized, slightly softening the stakes' visceral proof.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through particulars: the broken bench bolt, the discolored staircase, the anthem's lyrics all converge on "someone always paid" without stating a moral. The piano bench becomes a charged recurring object—mentioned as broken, then felt as wobbling, then used despite instability. The final image ("each note a small resurrection") reweights the opening climb with non-literal resonance. Subtext operates cleanly in Silent-Choir's wordless communication and the anthem's unsung words. No late-breaking theme summary mars the ending.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and anchored to Rielle's perceptual signature (nerve sensations, architectural noticing). Psychic distance modulates purposefully: intimate in physical sensation, wider when narrating the children's hiding. Silent-Choir's wordlessness is shown through gesture and action, not exposition. Deduction for one diction slip: "seraphically mundane precision" reads as author vocabulary rather than Rielle's stressed perception. Dialogue is minimal but functional; the anthem lyrics are integrated as cultural knowledge rather than exposition.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high ("The surgeons promised full recovery, but she needed to understand what that safety had cost"). Figurative language is controlled and voice-specific ("turrets like frozen fingers," "steam rising like small prayers"). Template-cadence penalty: the final paragraph opens three consecutive sentences with similar structure ("The cost of safety…" / "The grace was…" / "She played until…"), creating a summary-conclusion feel that slightly flattens momentum. One paraphrase loop: "frostbitten hope" appears in both the opening move and the penultimate paragraph with near-identical framing. Clarity and propulsion otherwise strong.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of nerve regeneration as physical metaphor for understanding trauma's cost is specific and non-obvious. Silent-Choir's muteness integrated with the "unpardonable silence" concept offers fresh texture. The fortress-under-siege frame is familiar but executed with grounded detail (the wobbling bench bolt, the staircase discoloration). Slight derivative pressure: the music-room-as-sanctuary and playing-through-pain beats echo common post-trauma narrative templates. The emotional calculus (shared cost, communal endurance) is earnest and well-rendered but does not take a bold or unexpected stance.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Silent-Choir appears in two beats: arranging luggage at the landing and delivering tea/playing the piano note in the music room. His gesture (pointing to the bench bolt, then his chest) and his piano-playing enable Rielle's realization and final choice. Early setup (named and characterized by the staircase), middle presence (tea delivery), and closure participation (humming beside her) satisfy all three gates. Causal pressure is present but modest: he enables understanding rather than forcing a turn. Specificity is high (the muteness, the seraphic descriptor, the single note). Score reflects solid integration across beats with moderate causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The piano bench bolt is introduced in the music room scene ("One bolt had sheared clean through"), used when Rielle sits ("it wobbled"), and reweighted when Silent-Choir points to it and his chest, linking damage to survival. Two distinct beats: discovery and realization. It charges the final image by making the act of playing an acceptance of brokenness. Setup occurs in the second half (~40% mark), capping potential at mid-7s. Causal pressure is moderate: it informs rather than constrains. Specificity and closure linkage are strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Unpardonable silence" is named once in the music room beat ("The unpardonable silence pressed against her ears") and governs the children's story (they had to remain silent). It shapes the dominant stake—understanding the cost of that enforced quiet—and Silent-Choir's muteness embodies it. Early signal is weak (not mentioned until the music room, ~50% in). It constrains the middle choice (Rielle must confront the silence) and charges the ending (the anthem played aloud breaks it). Two-gate satisfaction with moderate causal work places it in mid-5s.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Seraphically mundane" describes Silent-Choir once ("arranging luggage with seraphically mundane precision"). It is a label without on-page constraint or cost: his actions (ferrying ammunition, delivering tea, playing a note) do not hinge on this duality. No middle beat explores the tension between the sacred and the ordinary. Ornamental use with no causal pressure. Present in setup only; no development or closure participation. Swappable with "calm" or "methodical" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Remain" is the thematic and tactical center: Rielle "held the eastern wall alone for seven minutes while others evacuated," the children remained hidden, Silent-Choir stayed during the siege, and Rielle chooses to remain and play at the end. Early signal (staircase climbers "remained when she'd been carried away"), middle pressure (the staying-versus-fleeing calculus), and closure (she plays instead of leaving). The anthem's lyric ("We stand where we're needed") crystallizes it. High causal weight and irreplaceability; all three gates met. The action redefines options at closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"The slightest discoloration on a dusty spiral staircase" appears in the second paragraph as Rielle's path upward, showing where others walked. It signals persistence but does not constrain a later choice or return with reweighted meaning. Setup is early and vivid, but there is no middle development: the discoloration is not revisited or used tactically. No closure participation. Functional but replaceable: any trace (footprints, worn stone) would serve the same purpose. One-gate satisfaction caps potential below 5.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cobalt fortress provides spatial structure (staircase, landing, music room) and thematic weight (a place worth defending). Snow "that never stopped falling" frames the opening and closing, and the fortress anthem ("while snow falls on stone") integrates setting into theme. The arrow-slitted windows and the broken bench are micro-setting elements that ground pressure. Early setup, middle choreography (Rielle's climb), and closure participation (snow continues in the final paragraph). Setting pressures the choice to stay but does not directly alter tactics. Solid two-plus-gate integration with thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Three months since the battle—three months of nerve regeneration" anchors time in the opening and recurs in the final line ("until full sensation returned to her fingertips"). The regeneration process drives Rielle's motivation (she needs to understand cost before healing completes) and charges the ending (sensation returns as she plays). Early signal, thematic pressure throughout, and closure linkage. Deduction: the timeframe does not create urgency or a ticking-clock constraint—Rielle could have climbed yesterday or tomorrow. Two-gate satisfaction with moderate causal weight.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Rielle's stated need—"to understand what that safety had cost"—is introduced in the opening and dramatized through her climb, her interaction with Silent-Choir, and her final realization ("The cost of safety, Rielle finally understood, was that someone always paid it"). The desire is conflicted: she must confront pain (nerve sparks, emotional weight) to gain understanding. Early setup, middle friction (the wobbling bench, the children's story), and closure payoff (playing through pain). High causal pressure and thematic centrality. Minor deduction for the penultimate paragraph stating the insight rather than letting the piano-playing alone carry it.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Frostbitten hope" is named twice: in the opening ("each step an act of frostbitten hope") and the penultimate paragraph ("their frostbitten hope a small warmth against the winter of what they'd witnessed"). Tone coheres throughout: cold imagery (snow, cobalt, ice-blue eyes, frozen fingers) balanced with warmth (tea steam, small prayers, resurrection). The tone modulates under pressure—clinical at the start, warming toward communal resilience at the end—and charges the final image. Early signal, consistent modulation, and closure participation. Deduction for the explicit label repeated in the ending, which slightly over-telegraphs rather than trusting the temperature imagery alone.</comment>
