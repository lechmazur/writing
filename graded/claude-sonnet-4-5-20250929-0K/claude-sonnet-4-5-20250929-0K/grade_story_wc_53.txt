<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is textured through collecting fragments and sensing erosion, but her internal contradiction—why she remains versus her stated desire to negotiate—lacks concrete embodied pressure in the middle beats. The ghost encounter at the end earns the final acceptance through prior causality, though the shift from "negotiate" to "accept" feels somewhat abstractly resolved rather than tested by a specific micro-choice under duress. Embodiment is present but sometimes dissolves into poetic register ("regret tasted like cloud-mist") that distances emotion. The camera wheel drop and hand-taking provide visible action, preventing full abstraction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration: Mira accepts her ghost-self, relinquishing negotiation, with visible cost (camera wheel lost, former resolute self merged). Orientation is delayed—who/where/when solidifies only around line 5–6 ("kinetic lagoon," "carousel stopped three days ago")—but the pattern of temporal disorientation is taught early and pays off thematically, waiving the Orientation Test penalty. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural: density of fragment-collection, erosion imagery, and the ghost's approach build pressure through pattern and cadence rather than strict because/therefore linkage. One meaningful deepening occurs when the ghost offers memory rather than stolen fragment, shifting Mira's stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon—water spiraling upward, droplets suspended, columns touching clouds—constrains Mira's position on the crystal platform and charges the final moment when it "stills its spinning" as she accepts the ghost. The carousel's absence as causal anchor for broken physics is specific and purposeful. Sensory detail is filtered through Mira's disoriented perception (cloud-mist, fractured stillness, light from everywhere/nowhere) and integrated into her collecting behavior. The camera wheel as micro-object returns with reweighted meaning at closure, functioning as setting-extension.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake—Mira's negotiation with her ghost/former self—is signaled early and tightens when the ghost materializes closer, then steps onto water. One meaningful deepening: the ghost offers a memory ("You were never meant to go back") that reframes the stake from negotiation to acceptance, narrowing options. Escalation under Accumulative lens reads as density increase (collected fragments, ghost's approach, carousel silence converging) rather than causal reversals. Cost is legible: she releases the camera wheel (her scavenging token) and merges with the ghost, foreclosing her collector identity. Agency is acceptance/renunciation, fitting Earned Stasis within Resonant Reconfiguration.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—transformation without direction as disintegration, acceptance versus negotiation—emerges through Mira's fragment-collection, the carousel's halt, and the ghost encounter without overt thesis statements. The final image (lagoon stilling, "everything began to move") offers a resonant, non-literal answer: acceptance enables motion where negotiation stalled. The camera wheel's broken film and Mira's scavenged stories function thematically without becoming allegory. One slip: "regret tasted like cloud-mist" verges on abstraction, and the phrase "transformation without direction was just disintegration" edges toward articulation rather than full dramatization, though it's brief and character-voiced.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; Mira's perceptual signature—collecting overheard phrases, chronological confusion, erosion metaphors—is distinct and consistent. Voice modulates appropriately from fragmented uncertainty to the resolute final beat. Two minor slips: the phrase "regret tasted like cloud-mist: substantial enough to choke on, insubstantial enough to question whether it existed at all" reads as writerly commentary rather than Mira's in-the-moment thought, and "negotiate with that specter of her former self" uses slightly elevated register. Psychic distance shifts are purposeful (zooming into the camera wheel, then out to the lagoon), and no head-hopping occurs.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies well, and information density is high in key beats (carousel debris, ghost approach, camera wheel drop). Two accumulating patterns lower the score: paraphrase loops appear ("her own ambitions had eroded slowly" / "the resolute girl who'd climbed here had become this fractured thing" restates the same erosion concept across paragraphs without added pressure), and several figurative constructions in succession ("fractured stillness—violent and calm simultaneously, moving and frozen" / "regret tasted like cloud-mist") create density that occasionally slows momentum in the middle third. Clarity remains intact, and the final paragraph accelerates cleanly. No grammar or tense errors.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The scavenger-of-stories angle offers a fresh inflection on identity-loss narratives, and the kinetic lagoon's physics-defying stillness is specific rather than generic fantasy. The ghost-as-former-self encounter and the camera wheel (disposable, broken, film exposed) synthesize purposefully. Risk is present in the temporal disorientation and accumulative structure. One limitation: the carousel as transformation-mechanism and "negotiate with ghost" frame echo workshop-familiar premises; the execution's lyric specificity and the fragment-collection method elevate but do not fully transform the template into unfamiliar territory.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Mira as resolute scavenger is introduced early (collecting the camera wheel, grabbing overheard phrases). Her scavenging appears in multiple beats (camera wheel, fragment collection, attempting to wear stolen stories). At closure, she takes the ghost's hand and accepts rather than continuing to collect, decisively altering her tactic. However, the scavenging itself does not create a major reversal or narrow her options mid-story; it functions more as characterization than engine. Cost is present (releasing the wheel, merging identity) but tied to acceptance rather than scavenging as action.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Camera wheel appears in three beats: initially pocketed from debris, held to light mid-story to frame the ghost, and dropped into the lagoon at closure. Its broken teeth and exposed film reweight across appearances—first a scavenged token, then a lens, finally a relinquished anchor. Removal would weaken the physical specificity of Mira's collecting and the closure gesture. Strong integration, though the wheel does not directly constrain a choice or enable a tactic; it charges the final image and provides tactile continuity.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Eroded ambitions shape the dominant stake: Mira's loss of purpose after the carousel stopped drives her fragment-collecting and ghost negotiation. The concept appears early ("her own ambitions had eroded slowly"), recurs in the middle ("she'd had a name for what she wanted"), and is directly confronted at closure ("transformation without direction was just disintegration"). It constrains her choices (she remains, scavenges stories, cannot leave) and is causally active at the ending when acceptance allows motion to resume. Essential and irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Chronological confusion is signaled immediately ("three days ago, or perhaps three years") and embodied in Mira's inability to sequence events ("yesterday, or tomorrow" / "this morning—or was it her reflection?"). It creates local disorientation and contributes to the piece's fractured tone. However, it does not visibly constrain a specific choice or tactic with cost; Mira's confusion is descriptive rather than decision-blocking. The trait colors perception but does not drive a turn. Present across beats but functionally atmospheric rather than mechanically decisive.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Regret appears mid-story in a single vivid image ("regret tasted like cloud-mist") and is invoked as the emotional driver for staying and facing the ghost. It does not create a discrete turn; rather, it contextualizes the ongoing pressure. The element is present and thematically coherent but could be replaced with "grief" or "shame" without structural breakage. It colors the middle beat but does not reappear at closure with charged specificity, limiting its causal necessity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Collecting fragments is introduced early (camera wheel scavenged, "she collected everything now"), demonstrated in multiple beats (catching the phrase "cartographer of impossible places," grabbing "he stayed because…," pressing "she didn't fail" into her archive), and directly contrasted at closure when the ghost offers a real memory instead of a stolen fragment. The method shapes Mira's tactics (wearing stories, trying them on) and the final acceptance rejects it, making the shift legible. Strong integration; removal would obscure why Mira remains and what changes at the end.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The kinetic lagoon is anchored early and appears in every major beat: its upward spiraling water establishes broken physics, the crystal platform positions Mira, droplets suspend while the ghost walks across, and the lagoon stills at closure ("holding its breath"). The setting directly constrains Mira's options (she cannot cross, the ghost can) and charges the final image when "everything began to move." Physics that defy gravity and the carousel's absence as cause are specific and irreplaceable. The lagoon drives pressure and closure, making it indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The timeframe—after the carousel halts—is established at the opening and frames the entire situation (broken physics, Mira's erosion). However, elapsed time is vague ("three days ago, or perhaps three years"), and the halt does not tighten decisions beat-by-beat; it functions as static backdrop rather than live clock. The past event (carousel stopping) caused the current state but does not escalate during the story. Present in setup and thematically relevant, but does not constrain tactics or narrow options across beats.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Negotiation with the ghost is stated early ("why she remained: to negotiate with that specter"), demonstrated when Mira observes the ghost's approach and beckoning, and directly tested at closure when the ghost offers memory and Mira shifts to acceptance. The motivation drives her staying, her fragment-collection (seeking explanations), and the final choice. It creates friction (negotiate versus accept) with visible cost (merging identities, releasing the wheel). Essential; the story's central question hinges on this desire and its transformation.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Fractured stillness is embodied throughout: the lagoon's "fractured stillness—violent and calm simultaneously, moving and frozen," Mira's chronological confusion, the carousel's stopped music, and the suspended droplets. Tone modulates subtly as the ghost approaches (tension rising) and shifts decisively at closure when "the lagoon stilled its spinning, just for a moment" before movement resumes. The tone charges the final image and is maintained coherently under emotional pressure. Strong integration; the oxymoron is specific to the piece's logic and closure would lose resonance without it.</comment>
