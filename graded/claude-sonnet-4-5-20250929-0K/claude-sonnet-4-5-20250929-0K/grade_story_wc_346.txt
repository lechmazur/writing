<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The protagonist's role as adjuster is established, and her seventeen-year burden with the puppet head provides history, but her interior life remains largely abstract. The motivation "to whisper a lullaby across a thousand lifetimes" is stated rather than dramatized through conflicting impulses in scene. Embodied emotion is sparse—"hands trembling" and "bruised awe" are the primary physical markers, while much of the interiority operates at a conceptual altitude ("mathematical poetry," "nested patterns") that distances us from immediate sensory pressure. The final choice to descend with the puppet head feels like acceptance rather than a turn that forecloses a live option with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a single POV, one location, and a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis: she completes the adjustment and accepts the ongoing burden). Orientation anchors arrive early (lighthouse keeper, dusk, Doomsday Clock mechanism). However, the closure unit—her descent with the puppet head and the whispered "We did what we could"—relies on thematic assertion rather than a dramatized cost that changes her options on the page. The adjustment itself is described in nested abstract phrases ("nested patterns of cause and effect," "seeds of reversal") without a concrete on-page consequence or sacrifice that we witness. Under an Accumulative/Textural lens, the ending reprises motifs (puppet head, nested patterns, lullaby) but does not reweight them with a felt price; the final image of locking the door and walking into darkness reads as closure but the cost remains conceptual and pre-established rather than newly crystallized.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The lighthouse lamp room is sketched with brass-and-crystal mechanism, salt-stained windows, and fractal ocean waves. The puppet head recurs as a talisman and witness, but it does not constrain a tactical choice or alter her approach to the adjustment. The setting provides atmospheric grounding—spiral stairs, darkening ocean, automatic lighthouse beam—yet remains largely a backdrop for reflection rather than a space that pressures decisions. The mechanism's presence is declared essential but its physical properties (dials, instruments, "pane of hush") remain abstract and do not force a micro-choice or tradeoff on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—moving the Clock three minutes closer to midnight and embedding "seeds of reversal"—is signaled early but never tested by a counterpressure or complication that narrows her options. The adjustment proceeds smoothly without an on-page obstacle, failed attempt, or price paid beyond the conceptual "ache of responsibility." No reversal or tightening choice appears; she decides to proceed, executes the adjustment, and reflects on the outcome. Agency is present (she performs the adjustment) but the lack of visible escalation or a moment where success costs her something immediate leaves the conflict feeling declared rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Theme—humanity's fragile proximity to extinction, the nested nature of causation, and the burden of stewardship—emerges through images (puppet head's cracked smile, fractal waves, lighthouse beam's rhythm) and the protagonist's reflections. The puppet head as a "beautifully flawed" witness and the "whispered lullaby threaded through probability" carry metaphoric weight without overt moralizing. However, the final paragraph's "We sang our song" and "someone might hear the lullaby" edge toward thematic summary, and the piece does not pose a hard question that the ending reweights through a concrete turn. The resonance is present but operates more as atmosphere than as a non-literal answer earned by prior particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited with consistent access to her interiority. The voice carries a formal, elevated register—"bruised awe," "vouchsafe," "hush of time's final ripple"—that remains coherent but occasionally drifts into abstract philosophical diction ("mathematical poetry underlying causation") during emotional beats. No dialogue appears, so naturalism and subtext cannot be judged. The perceptual signature is present (she sees nested patterns, fractal repetitions) but the lexicon feels more authorial than character-particular, especially in peak moments where embodied compression might sharpen the voice. Filter verbs ("she felt," "she understood") are present but not excessive.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Recurring phrases create a self-conscious pattern: "nested patterns" appears at least five times, "bruised awe" twice, "across the hush of time's final ripple" bookends the piece, and "beautifully flawed" recurs without new information. Elevated diction ("vouchsafe," "causation," "probability") in reflective passages reads as register drift from the hands-trembling, puppet-cradling woman on the page. Sentence openings vary, but several beats loop conceptually—paragraph four's "nested patterns" summary is echoed in paragraph six's mechanism description and again in paragraph nine's "nested patterns within nested patterns." The puppet head "rolled free" then is "picked up" and "cradled" without clear spatial choreography between those moments. Information density is moderate; many lines do double duty (image + theme) but some recycle the same abstraction.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The Doomsday Clock as a literal mechanism at a hidden lighthouse offers a speculative premise, and the protagonist's role as adjuster across timelines is non-obvious. However, the emotional arc—accepting a lonely burden, performing the task, descending with renewed resolve—follows a familiar steward-of-the-world template without a surprising turn. The puppet head as witness and the "beautifully flawed" motif provide texture but do not transform the premise through lived contradiction or unexpected cost. The piece commits to its metaphysical frame, yet the adjustment itself unfolds without friction or a moment where the established rules surprise us.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The doomsday clock adjuster role is signaled in paragraph two, frames her motivation and action throughout, and she performs the adjustment in paragraph six. However, the adjustment itself is a smooth execution without a choice between competing tactics or a moment where her decision alters the story's direction. She decides to proceed, does so, and reflects on the outcome—observation and enactment rather than a turn driven by conflicting options. The role is functional and present across beats but does not create a key reversal.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The broken puppet head appears in paragraph one (carried for seventeen years), paragraph three (rolls free, one glass eye missing), paragraph four (received from the previous adjuster), paragraph nine (watches with its single eye during the adjustment), paragraph eleven (picked up and cradled, spoken to), and paragraph thirteen (safe in her bag). It recurs with thematic weight—witness, talisman, "beautifully flawed"—and the final cradle moment reprises the early image. Yet it does not constrain a choice or alter her approach to the adjustment; it remains symbolic presence rather than a tool or object whose state or use changes tactics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"The pane of hush" is introduced in paragraph five as the "fragile membrane between one possible future and another" through which she moves when making adjustments. It reappears in the final line as "across the hush of time's final ripple." The concept is named and thematically threaded but does not shape an on-page tactical choice—we do not see her navigate the pane, test its limits, or face a consequence of breaching it. It functions as metaphoric flavor rather than a constraint or resource that alters her approach.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Beautifully flawed" appears three times: paragraph four (the previous adjuster found her as "a beautifully flawed child"), paragraph ten ("she lived in the space between certainty and chaos, beautifully flawed in her attempts to matter"), and implicitly in the puppet head's cracked smile. The trait is declared but never dramatized through an on-page mistake, blind spot, or tradeoff where her flaw costs her something or shapes a choice. It reads as thematic label rather than a constraint that enables or limits action.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Vouchsafe" appears once in paragraph seven: "to vouchsafe the possibility of dawn even as night deepened." It describes her motivation but is not enacted as a distinct action in scene—she performs the adjustment and embeds "seeds of reversal," but we do not witness a moment where she secures or guarantees something at a visible cost. The term could be replaced with "safeguard" or "preserve" without altering the story's structure. Present in motivation, absent as a dramatized beat.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Nested patterns" is signaled in paragraph two ("nested patterns within patterns, each decision cascading"), recurs in paragraph four (the previous adjuster showed her "how everything connects"), paragraph six (she reshapes probability "through nested patterns of intervention"), paragraph eight (she weaves influence "through nested patterns of cause and effect"), paragraph ten ("nested patterns within nested patterns"), and paragraph twelve (lighthouse beam "matched the nested patterns of her work"). The method is named repeatedly and frames her approach, but we do not see the mechanics—how nesting differs from a single intervention, or what constraint the pattern imposes. It shapes the conceptual frame but not the tactics or a choice on the page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The hidden lighthouse at dusk is established in paragraph two, anchors the entire scene, and the lamp room mechanism is the site of the adjustment. Dusk deepening to night tracks time across the piece, and the spiral stairs frame her ascent and descent. The setting provides spatial continuity and the mechanism's presence drives her purpose. However, the lighthouse does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters her approach—she climbs, adjusts, descends—so it functions as essential locale rather than as pressure. The automatic beam activation in paragraph twelve adds atmospheric closure but does not change tactics.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"Across the hush of time's final ripple" bookends the piece (paragraph one and paragraph thirteen) and "the hush of time" appears in paragraph ten. The phrase evokes a liminal temporal state but does not function as a tracked timeframe that tightens decisions. We know it is dusk moving to night, but no clock or urgency within that window pressures her choices. The "final ripple" suggests an ending moment but is not dramatized as a deadline or constraint. Present as tone and metaphor, not as tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to whisper a lullaby across a thousand lifetimes" appears in paragraph seven, framing her purpose, and reprises in paragraph eleven ("We sang our song") and paragraph thirteen ("the lullaby she'd woven into tomorrow's uncertain dawn"). It is thematically present and drives her acceptance of the burden, but it is told rather than shown through a conflicting want or a moment where the lullaby costs her something immediate. The desire is consistent and sincere but not dramatized as friction between what she wants and what she must give up to achieve it.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Bruised awe" appears twice: paragraph eleven ("that familiar bruised awe—the wonder of touching infinity, tempered by the ache of responsibility") and paragraph twelve (she carries "her bruised awe"). The tone is coherent—wonder tempered by burden, beauty shadowed by cost—and modulates from contemplative opening through reflective adjustment to quiet closure. The lighthouse imagery, fractal waves, and puppet head's single eye sustain the tone. However, the final image does not sharply reweight the tone; it extends the established mood rather than crystallizing a new charge. Consistent and purposeful, but not transformative at the end.</comment>
