<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is established through backstory (Kenji's grandmother, the vandalized portrait) but remains largely told rather than tested on the page. The cave sequence lacks meaningful choice under pressure—she documents, photographs, and weeps, but no opposition or internal friction emerges. The "volcanic tenderness" emotional note feels asserted rather than embodied through contradictory impulses. The final walk toward judgment is declared but not dramatized with visible cost in the present frame.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The story operates in Accumulative mode: Mara's three-year trail culminates in the cave discovery. Orientation arrives late (who/where/when unclear until paragraph two; the "six months after going off the grid" anchor is buried). The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration (she completes the promise and prepares to face judgment), but the cost is abstract—"ready to face whatever judgment awaited"—rather than a concrete on-page forfeiture or choice that narrows options. The entire cave sequence is unopposed reflection; no reversal or tightening occurs.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The limestone cave system and Tethyan frescoes are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (ochre pigments, woven threads, harsh sunlight at exit). The tapestry fragment and wall frescoes function as micro-setting that charges the final revelation. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. However, the cave itself does not constrain Mara's choices—she encounters no physical or social obstacles—limiting its role to backdrop rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving cross-cultural love transcends censorship—is signaled early and consistent. However, the entire cave sequence is unopposed: Mara photographs, weeps, and documents without friction, reversal, or a choice that forecloses a path. The escalation is told (she "had become a criminal for this") rather than dramatized on the page. The final walk toward judgment is declared but not enacted, so the cost remains abstract rather than visible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme—love transcends institutional erasure—emerges through specific images (the scratched-out portrait, the tapestry fragment, Kenji's grandmother's grip). The final image of Mara walking back "ready to face whatever judgment" offers resonance without overt moralizing. However, the line "some acts of destruction were really acts of love, volcanic in their intensity, tender in their ultimate purpose" veers into thesis statement. The promise motif recurs with purpose, charging the ending without symbolic convenience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable throughout. Mara's perceptual signature—"analytically intuitive," precise academic habits—filters the cave description effectively. However, the interiority occasionally slips into abstraction: "volcanic tenderness erupting in tears" and "her motivation had always been specific" tell rather than show. No dialogue appears, so voice is tested only in narration. Psychic distance stays consistent, though the reflective passages sometimes flatten immediacy.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with varied syntax and strong verbs ("traced," "liberated," "gripped"). The opening effectively anchors voice and stakes. However, the piece carries scaffold sentences and paraphrase loops: "Some promises...required you to burn down your own life" immediately follows similar phrasing about "acts of destruction were really acts of love." The metaphor "volcanic tenderness" is strained and undercuts rather than sharpens the emotional beat. Information density is high in backstory but thins during the unopposed cave sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The premise—an art thief rescuing censored love across cultures—offers a fresh angle on archive/recovery narratives. The vandalized self-portrait and interlibrary loan misdirection provide specific ingenuity. However, the execution relies on familiar beats: the lone academic outcast, the hidden cave revelation, the declared-but-not-enacted confrontation with authorities. The "lending library arsonist" inversion (she never burned books) is clever but underused. The emotional arc—grief-driven quest to closure—could transfer to other premises with minor edits, limiting transformation.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The "lending library arsonist" label is present and frames Mara's backstory, but the character makes no on-page decisions that create key turns. The cave sequence is unopposed reflection; she documents without friction. The arsonist identity is inverted (she never burned books) but that reversal is told in backstory rather than shaping present tactics. Cap applied: introduced in backstory, no middle development on the page, no closure-active choice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The faded tapestry fragment appears in paragraph four (setup), is unfolded and placed beside the cave wall (middle beat), and is pressed against her heart in the final line (closure reprise). The object is handled across three beats and its meaning reweights—from condemned artifact to proof of continuity. However, it does not constrain a choice or impose cost; Mara simply discovers the match. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage, but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The vandalized self-portrait is introduced in paragraph two as Mara's "first theft" and returns in paragraph eight as awaiting digital restoration. It frames her motivation (raw emotion disrupting institutional narrative) and ties to the theme of portraying truth. However, it does not shape on-page stakes or tactics in the cave sequence—it functions as thematic echo rather than active pressure. Present at setup and mentioned near closure, but no middle development.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Analytically intuitive" is attributed in the opening line as Mara traces frescoes. The trait colors her perceptual filter (methodical precision, pattern recognition) but does not constrain or enable a single on-page choice with visible cost. It remains a label describing her assessment style rather than forcing a trade-off or shaping tactics under pressure. No middle beat tests the trait; it is not reweighted at closure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Portray" appears explicitly in Kenji's grandmother's demand ("portray the truth instead of the convenient lie") and in Mara's promise to "show the world both versions" of the self-portrait. The action shapes Mara's overarching goal and appears in the closure zone (she will restore and reveal). However, no on-page portrayal occurs—she photographs and documents, but the act of portraying remains future intent. Present at setup and closure, but the mechanics are told rather than enacted.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.9</grade><comment>The "trail of artistic creations leading to a hidden message" is introduced in paragraph three ("each artifact...formed a trail...pointing to this forgotten promise") and the tapestry fragment completes the chain. The method is signaled and its payoff occurs on the page when Mara matches the fragment to the cave wall. However, the mechanics of how she traced the trail are summarized in backstory rather than demonstrated. Functional but swappable with "clues" or "evidence."</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The "lost civilization archive" (Tethyan cave system) is established in the opening line, provides the sensory environment for the revelation (ochre frescoes, limestone), and supplies the matching wall image that validates Mara's quest. The setting is present across all three beats and charges the final image (she emerges into harsh sunlight). It does not constrain choices—no obstacles or resource scarcity—but it is indispensable to the story's central discovery and thematic resonance.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.6</grade><comment>"After going off the grid" is mentioned in paragraph one ("six months after") and the timeframe colors Mara's fugitive status. However, it does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page—the cave sequence is undisturbed by pursuit or deadline. The three-year theft spree and Kenji's grandmother's death are backstory anchors but do not create live pressure. The timeframe is present but ornamental; it could be removed without altering the cave revelation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to rescue a forgotten promise" is dramatized through Kenji's grandmother's deathbed grip and Mara's whispered vow in the archive. It drives the three-year theft campaign and shapes the emotional charge of the cave discovery. However, the motivation is not tested against a competing desire or cost on the page—Mara's commitment is unwavering throughout. Strong setup and closure linkage, but no friction or trade-off that would elevate the score higher.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Volcanic tenderness" is named explicitly in paragraph six ("her volcanic tenderness erupting in tears") and echoed in the penultimate paragraph ("volcanic in their intensity, tender in their ultimate purpose"). The tone aims to unify passion and precision, but the execution is mixed: the phrase feels strained and the emotional beats (tears, fierce grip, walking toward judgment) are told rather than modulated through syntax or image. Present at key moments but not coherently charged through rhythm or escalation.</comment>
