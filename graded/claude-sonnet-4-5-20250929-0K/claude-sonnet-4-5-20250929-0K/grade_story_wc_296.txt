<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation (finding lost things as core drive) is clear and her warlike serenity provides consistent texture. The apprentice's arc from frozen terror to gasping confession is dramatized, though his interior contradiction feels more told than shown—the flesh-eating seeds backstory arrives late as exposition rather than discovered tension. Maren's guarded nature is stated but her micro-choices don't reveal competing impulses in action; she operates with professional competence but minimal visible cost to her stance. The final exchange about "refusing to unbend" reads as thematic summary rather than earned insight from prior embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens is Causal with lyric-accumulative accent; the apprentice's mirror-walking failure creates the trap, Maren's expanding-circle search and war-song unbend him, leading to his scream-release and shore delivery. Orientation anchors (druid, orchard vortex, cursed lake, post-festival rescue) land within the first paragraph. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): Maren's final statement about people locking themselves into fear-shapes reweights the rescue mission as philosophical stance, and she moves on "carrying her warlike serenity like a blade sheathed in stillness." The cost is conceptual—visible in her continued solitude and her unchanged guardedness—but the final image charges prior material without a decisive emotional change, fitting RR. One meaningful tightening occurs when Maren shifts from comfort-song to war-song after discovering the blood-magic seeds, narrowing her approach and forcing the scream to crack the frozen moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The swirling orchard vortex is vivid and purposeful: "impossible spirals," "perpetual cyclone of white blossoms and rotting fruit," "roots drinking black water." The mirror-bright pools suspend the apprentice, and the black water threatens his fall—setting shapes choreography and danger. Maren's staff-planting and the expanding-circle method use spatial structure to organize the search. The dark seeds "at the water's edge" provide a concrete clue that shifts Maren's tactic from comfort to war-song. However, the vortex itself remains largely atmospheric; its mechanics (why it resists, how it "satisfies" after release) are asserted rather than shown through micro-constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: rescue the apprentice before the curse consumes him. The escalation is causal and clear: Maren begins with expanding circles (low-risk search) → discovers the frozen apprentice (raises difficulty) → reads the curse and attempts comfort-song (first tactic) → discovers blood-magic seeds (new information) → shifts to war-song (heightened tactic that forces the scream and cracks the paralysis). The apprentice's fall and wind-working catch provide physical consequence. However, the vortex "satisfied now that its prisoner had been claimed and released" implies the curse was waiting for narrative permission rather than tactical defeat, softening the sense of hard-won victory. Cost is present but muted: the apprentice survives shaken but mobile, and Maren's serenity remains uncracked.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—people lock themselves into fear-shapes and refuse to unbend—emerges from the apprentice's frozen confession and Maren's war-song method. The mirror motif (hidden truth, twisted soul, false reflections) recurs and the flesh-eating seeds literalize the danger of consuming lies. Yet Maren's closing line, "The truth that people are not lost—they simply refuse to unbend from the shape their fears have locked them into," is overt thematic summary that replaces scene pressure. The apprentice's whispered confession and Maren's hard-but-kind correction work better as earned subtext. The final image—"warlike serenity like a blade sheathed in stillness"—is vivid but slightly ornamental, reiterating her established trait rather than reweighting it with new cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Maren with consistent perceptual filter: "the old method her grandmother had taught her," "iron forged in stillness," sensory attention to wind and water. Diction is elevated but controlled—"warlike serenity," "unbend his rigid terror"—and fits the druid's formal register. The apprentice's dialogue ("I wanted to grow something that could consume lies") feels slightly expository but his whisper and shaking ground the moment. Maren's final dialogue crosses into authorial thesis ("they simply refuse to unbend from the shape their fears have locked them into"), a pocket of over-articulation in an otherwise clean voice. Psychic distance remains appropriate; no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Prose is rhythmically controlled and imagistic: "apple trees grew in impossible spirals," "A frozen confession, caught between speaking and silence," "each note a hammer striking the frozen moment." Sentence variety supports momentum and no paraphrase loops appear. However, two template-cadence runs weaken peaks: the second paragraph's "The magician's apprentice had attempted... seeking to discover... The spell had failed..." stacks passive-voice exposition, and "She planted her staff and began to sing... The trees shuddered... As she sang, she noticed" mechanically sequences actions. "Warlike serenity" recurs three times (opening, midpoint, close) without evolution, bordering on ornamental repetition. Information density is high and clarity remains intact.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The combination of elements—guarded druid, flesh-eating seeds, mirror-walking failure, expanding-circle search, vortex rescue—reads cohesive and specific. "Warlike serenity" as a druid trait and the shift from comfort-song to war-song offer fresh character texture. However, the frozen-in-mirror-of-soul setup leans on familiar curse logic (Medusa-adjacent paralysis-by-truth), and the resolution (sing the right song to crack the spell) follows expected fantasy-rescue beats. The thematic close—people refuse to unbend from fear—synthesizes the material but arrives as direct statement rather than transformation through image. Solid synthesis without a non-obvious inflection that redefines the premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren (guarded druid) drives the search structure, chooses the expanding-circle method, reads the curse, shifts from comfort to war-song upon discovering the seeds, and delivers the final thematic insight. Her guardedness is stated ("her guarded nature was legendary," "Maren's guarded expression never wavered") but her choices—calm precision, tactical song-shift, leaving the apprentice at shore—demonstrate professional reserve and solitary habit. The trait shapes her approach (methodical, unsentimental) and her unchanged demeanor at the end underscores Earned Stasis. Present in setup, middle tactical shift, and closure stance; two beats of decision and strong closure linkage justify high integration.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Flesh-eating plant seeds appear twice: first as dark seeds "scattered at the water's edge" that signal blood magic and prompt Maren's tactical shift to war-song, then in the apprentice's leather pouch (with mirror fragment) at shore, where he confesses the experiment. The seeds alter Maren's tactic (comfort → force) and anchor the apprentice's motivation (consume lies). However, they are discovered passively ("she noticed") rather than handled, and their final mention—"sank into black water, never to sprout"—is told aftermath without on-page consequence. Two beats of causal work but no charged reprise; mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Frozen confession is the central image: the apprentice "hung suspended... mouth open in a scream that made no sound. A frozen confession, caught between speaking and silence." The phrase names both the literal paralysis and the thematic stakes (truth-paralyzes). Maren's goal is to "unbend his rigid terror, let the scream complete itself," and the climax is the scream "finally emerged, raw and terrible"—the confession unlocking. The concept shapes the rescue's mechanics and metaphor, appears in setup and climax, and charges the theme. Strong causal role and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Finds lost things" is Maren's defining trait, framing the inciting hire ("lost things called to her like moths to flame") and her search method. Yet the trait functions as premise rather than constraint: Maren's actual choices (expanding circles, reading curse, war-song) are not shown to depend on a special finding-sense or cost of that gift. The apprentice is "not lost—they simply refuse to unbend" reframes the trait thematically at closure, but this is conceptual layering, not on-page tradeoff. Present in setup and thematic close, but no visible cost or enabling beat in the middle; lyric reprise without demonstrated necessity.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Unbend is both literal action and metaphor: Maren must "unbend his rigid terror" (the frozen curse-posture) via war-song that forces the moment to "crack," and thematically people must unbend from "the shape their fears have locked them into." The climax turn—"The apprentice's jaw began to move... His body unlocked"—is the unbending made physical. The word recurs three times (early goal, climax action, closing moral) and the final image ("people... refuse to unbend") charges prior material. Essential to both plot mechanics and theme; strong closure linkage and specificity.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Expanding circles is Maren's search method, signaled early ("the old method her grandmother had taught her. Start at the center, move outward in widening rings, miss nothing") and used on-page: "In the third circle, she found the apprentice." The method constrains her approach (systematic, patient) and fits her warlike serenity. However, the circles are mentioned twice and the mechanics (how she marks or traverses them in the vortex) remain abstract. The return journey—"retracing their path outward from the vortex's heart"—mirrors the method but does not reweight it. Present in setup and one middle beat; functional but light.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The swirling orchard vortex at the heart of a cursed lake is vivid and specific: "apple trees grew in impossible spirals," "perpetual cyclone of white blossoms and rotting fruit," "roots drinking black water," "wind screaming through skeletal branches." The vortex resists Maren's movement, the mirror-bright pools suspend the apprentice, and the black water threatens his fall (wind-working catch). The setting's spiral structure mirrors the expanding-circle search and the curse "satisfied now that its prisoner had been claimed and released" ties environment to plot logic. Present in setup, middle choreography, and closure satisfaction; strong causal and atmospheric role.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the magic trick fails" is the inciting past event ("three days ago"), establishing urgency and backstory. However, the on-page rescue unfolds without a ticking clock: Maren searches at her methodical pace, the apprentice's suspension is static until she acts, and no escalating time pressure (curse worsening, vortex closing) forces faster choices. The three-day gap implies stakes but does not constrain tactics. Present in setup as frame but does not tighten middle decisions; functional context without pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The apprentice's motivation—"to discover what mirrors don't show"—drives his failed experiment and is explained twice: the festival mirror-walking trick sought "the hidden truth behind reflections," and his confession reveals he wanted to "grow something that could consume lies... to eat away the false reflections people hide behind." The desire is told in exposition rather than dramatized through on-page choice or friction. The consequence (seeing his own twisted soul) is recounted backstory. Maren's tactical shift responds to the seeds, not the apprentice's want. Present in setup and closing confession but no middle friction; mostly ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Warlike serenity is introduced in the opening line ("moved through... with warlike serenity"), demonstrated through Maren's "calm precision" and "iron forged in stillness" during the War of Thirteen Winters flashback, tested when the vortex resists and she channels "the war-song, the melody that had once turned back armies through sheer unshakeable will," and reaffirmed in the closing image: "carrying her warlike serenity like a blade sheathed in stillness." The tone modulates appropriately—calm method, forceful song, hard-but-kind dialogue—without breaking coherence. The oxymoron is specific to Maren and charges the final image. Strong setup, middle escalation, and closure linkage.</comment>
