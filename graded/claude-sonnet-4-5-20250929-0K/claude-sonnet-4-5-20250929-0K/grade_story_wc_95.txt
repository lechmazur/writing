<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Adelaine's mechanical arm and academic ferocity show clear character signature, but her internal contradiction remains shallow—she's fierce yet patient, but these don't collide under pressure. The duel setup promises a values clash, yet both characters pivot too smoothly into collaboration without dramatized cost to pride or conviction. Harwick's fury dissolves into interest without embodied resistance, flattening what could have been a earned transformation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (glass atrium, sundial, duel postponed). The closure—violence averted through puzzle-solving, leading to a rematch promise—lacks felt cost: Adelaine loses no face, Harwick's rage evaporates without consequence, and the "questions become destinations" motif remains asserted rather than dramatized through a price paid. The causal lens wobbles; the sundial solution arrives conveniently without prior constraint shaping their tactics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The glass atrium, brook's murmur, and mechanical arm's crystalline panels create vivid sensory anchors filtered through academic urgency. The sundial's geometric shadows and painted numerals supply concrete workspace detail. The brook functions as atmospheric recurrence but doesn't constrain a choice or alter the ending image—it remains ambient rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—decode the overture before dueling—is clear, but the escalation is minimal: Adelaine simply works through the puzzle while Harwick watches, then joins. No reversal narrows options; Harwick's anger deflates without a trade-off. The resolution (rematch scheduled) resets the conflict rather than foreclosing a path with visible cost, reading more like a pause than a turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Questions become destinations" is stated multiple times but not earned through specific struggle—the sundial decode proceeds smoothly, and the philosophical claim about fencing with questions remains meta-commentary rather than enacted tension. The overture's revelation carries thematic potential, but the ending restates the thesis ("questions without answers, destinations without maps") instead of letting the final image resonate without a moral.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Adelaine's POV is stable, her diction mixing academic precision with embodied detail (mechanical arm whirring, "diplomatically fierce" voice). Dialogue carries goal pursuit and subtext—Harwick's "You're stalling" versus Adelaine's calm deflection. Minor slip: "dignified chaos" appears as authorial label in the final paragraph, breaking immersion. The perceptual signature (angles, brass, measurements) remains consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies, and sensory detail is concrete ("brass gears visible through crystalline panels," "Danish tin sewing needle card"). However, the final paragraph loops thematically—"questions without answers, destinations without maps" restates earlier dialogue without adding pressure. The phrase "diplomatically fierce" and "dignified chaos" read as over-engineered descriptor stacks. Minor scaffold: "the brook sang on" is a stock closer.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The mechanical-arm philosopher and musical-cryptography premise offer surface novelty, but the execution defaults to template: academic rivals bond over a puzzle, duel forgotten. The conflict's aversion without cost feels safe rather than bold. The overture's thirty-year hiding and Bellini's poisoning add backstory color but don't transform the emotional arc, which could play identically with any shared interest replacing the sundial.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Adelaine appears in every beat, her mechanical arm measures angles and records data in two distinct scenes (solo work, then collaboration), and her decision to prioritize decoding over dueling drives the story's trajectory. Her philosopher identity informs dialogue stakes. However, the arm's mechanical advantage (precision calculation) resolves the puzzle without visible cost or tradeoff, lowering irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The Danish tin sewing needle card appears once in the middle third, held against light to create a makeshift musical staff. It enables the decoding beat but could be replaced with any small grid or staff without structural loss. No setup in the opening, no reprise at closure, and no cost tied to its use.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The hidden overture frames the entire story: Adelaine refuses to duel until she decodes it, the sundial's coded angles drive the puzzle-solving sequence, and the final hummed melody becomes the story's climax. The concept shapes both characters' tactics (collaboration replaces violence) and appears in the closure image ("overture that had hidden silent for three decades"). Strong causal pressure and beat involvement across setup, middle, and ending.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Diplomatically fierce" is named twice—once as her tone perfected over twenty years of debates-turned-bloodshed, again as her reply voice. It colors her speech but doesn't constrain a choice with visible cost; she could be merely "firm" or "patient" without altering events. The trait remains a descriptor rather than a tactical lever.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>Fencing/dueling is the inciting frame (Harwick's drawn rapier, scheduled noon duel, previous duel that cost Adelaine her arm) and the promised future ("I'll bring my rapier" / "Same time next week"). However, no actual fencing occurs on the page—violence is deferred, not transformed through the action itself. The story turns on puzzle-solving; swordplay is context, not engine.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The half-painted sundial's coded angles appear in the opening paragraph, drive Adelaine's measuring and calculations across multiple beats, and the angle-to-musical-interval method enables the climactic overture reveal. The mechanics (painted vs. shadow positions create intervals, needles form a staff) are demonstrated on the page. The method is indispensable—remove the sundial's specific mechanism and the story's logic collapses.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The glass atrium is anchored early and hosts all action. Its transparent walls frame the brook, geometric shadows fall across Adelaine, and the space transforms into "impromptu laboratory" and "cathedral of questions" at closure. However, the setting provides atmosphere and workspace rather than constraining choice—the decode could occur in any bright room with a sundial. The brook recurs but remains ambient.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"While waiting" structures the frame (duel scheduled for noon, afternoon light in opening and close) but time pressure is absent—no clock tightens decisions, no urgency escalates. Adelaine works at her own pace, Harwick shifts from impatience to collaboration without time forcing the turn. The timeframe is premise, not engine.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Turn questions into destinations" is stated by Adelaine mid-story and echoed in the final line. It frames her philosophical stance and justifies her refusal to duel before solving the puzzle. However, the motivation is told rather than dramatized through conflicting costs—she experiences no friction between curiosity and honor, no visible sacrifice. The desire is present and thematically coherent but lacks on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Dignified chaos" is named once near the end and enacted through the described scene: papers scattered, calculations on glass walls, academic collaboration replacing planned violence. The tone coheres across the story—formal diction, measured pacing, wry humor—and modulates from tense standoff to collaborative discovery. The final image ("cathedral of questions") maintains the dignified-chaotic blend, charging closure with the tone's thematic weight.</comment>
