<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Vera's interiority is vivid and guilt-laden, her doctoral work forming a credible backstory that constrains her present choices. The core renunciation—"rewriting her own constellation"—reads as earned by the accumulated guilt, though the phrase "learning to translate its true meaning" edges toward thematic abstraction. Internal conflict is present (research vs. nephew's cry) but mostly told in backstory rather than enacted in present contradiction. The curator and wasp remain functional props rather than pressure sources; no secondary character forces a difficult trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration: Vera completes the translation she refused years ago, and the amber empties with visible symbolic cost. The Drive Lens reads Accumulative/Textural—sound cabinets, the letter, amber, and firmware build density until the final "tether" image reweights guilt into learned listening. Orientation anchors (laboratory, Vera, amber) arrive within the first paragraph. One meaningful deepening occurs when she grasps the wasp's tether function, narrowing her options to engage the firmware. The cost is felt but leans on metaphor ("amber grow warm… now clear and empty") rather than a decisive physical or social consequence on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The laboratory of lost sounds is vivid and purposeful: glass cabinets of preserved cries, the pipe-organ supercomputer, chambers of thunder. Sensory selection is strong—"moth wings and rust," "meteor hush"—and filtered through Vera's academic lens. The amber as micro-setting object constrains her central choice: she must press it to the machine's port to bridge past and present. Spatial choreography is clean across moves. Setting contributes materially to closure when the amber empties, charging the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Vera must resolve the haunted firmware and, implicitly, her own guilt. One meaningful tightening occurs when she places the amber against the machine and "understands"—the wasp is tethered, not trapped—which narrows her path to engaging the code directly. Agency is decision and renunciation: she rewrites her constellation rather than merely debugging. The price is visible in the emptied amber and the recognition that she "finally learned to listen," though the physical or social cost remains abstract. No live antagonist opposes her; the machine "weeps" but does not resist.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from particulars: guilt over ignored cries, the act of translation, tethering to loss until meaning resolves. The amber's transformation—wasp mid-flight to empty clarity—charges the ending without overt moralizing. Subtext operates in "the only way forward is to tether yourself to what you've lost," a phrase that risks thematic echo but remains tied to the concrete action of pressing amber to firmware. The final image ("amber, now clear and empty, a reminder") offers a resonant answer to the central question of how to atone. Slight drift toward abstraction ("constellation tattooist," "meteor hush") keeps it from the highest band.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, anchored in Vera's perceptual signature: she notices "dissonance," "firmware," "algorithm"—academic diction consistent with her background. Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close ("Vera's throat tightened") to slightly elevated lyric ("In the meteor hush of evening"). No dialogue appears; the curator's question and explanation are functional but lack subtext. The phrase "the firmware is haunted" in the letter and "meteor hush" at the end feel imposed by prompt rather than organic to Vera's idiom, creating minor register drift. Prose rhythm supports pressure without line-level opacity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character, world, or pressure. Sentence rhythm varies and propels without sluggishness. Minor figurative overreach appears: "constellation tattooist" and "meteor hush" feel decorative rather than earned by prior imagery. The phrase "time folded in on itself, when Thursday became Tuesday" is vivid but not causally integrated into Vera's on-page choices. One paraphrase loop: "She'd heard the dissonance in his cry and chosen her research over his life" restates the prior paragraph's content without added pressure (−0.2). No severe loops or scaffold, but the accumulation of prompt-driven phrases ("haunted firmware," "meteor hush") slightly reduces organic texture.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The laboratory of lost sounds and haunted firmware offer a fresh synthesis, blending speculative tech with emotional guilt in a non-obvious way. The wasp-as-tether concept transforms a familiar fossil into a temporal bridge with causal weight. However, the core emotional arc—protagonist confronts guilt over a child's death by engaging a symbolic machine—follows a recognizable redemption template. The "meteor hush" ending phrase and "constellation tattooist" label feel like ornamental additions rather than inevitable conclusions from prior material. Transformation test: the guilt-resolution arc could transfer to a different setting with minor edits, suggesting mid-band originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Vera is present throughout and her role as "constellation tattooist" frames the opening, but the label does no causal work. Her doctoral expertise (translating baby cries) drives the firmware engagement, not her constellation-reading skill. The character appears but the specific attribute "constellation tattooist" is ornamental. Setup is present, middle development absent (she never reads a constellation on the page), closure does not hinge on it. Cap at 4.6 for missing middle development; decorative mention −0.3; final 4.2.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The amber appears in paragraph two (setup), is pressed to the machine in the climactic beat (middle development: "The wasp inside began to move"), and returns emptied at the end (closure: "the amber, now clear and empty"). All three gates satisfied. It constrains her central choice (she must use it to bridge time) and the wasp's shift from trapped to tethered to flight-completed charges the resolution. Specificity is high; no near-synonym would work. Strong causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, irreplaceability +0.6. Minor cap: the mechanics of why amber tethers are asserted rather than discovered through trial. Final 8.1.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Haunted firmware is introduced early (letter, paragraph three) and drives Vera's engagement with the machine (middle: "the firmware opened to her like a wound"). She debugs/rewrites it at closure. Setup, development, and closure gates all met. However, the concept remains largely metaphorical: "haunted" reads as guilt-corrupted code rather than a mechanical constraint that alters tactics. The firmware "weeps" and "remembers," but Vera's interaction is summarized ("She began to work") rather than dramatized with specific debugging steps. Causal role is present but generic; swappable with "corrupted AI" or "grief-locked system." All gates +base 6.0, causal involvement +0.4, but swappability −0.4 and summary-only middle beat −0.2. Final 5.8.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The attribute "translates baby cries" is seeded in paragraph four (doctoral work on infant distress signals) and directly enables Vera's ability to engage the firmware ("every sound she'd failed to hear, every cry she'd dismissed as data"). Setup and middle development clear; closure hinges on her completing the translation she once refused. The trait constrains her guilt and provides the technical skill to interface with the machine. Visible cost: her past refusal killed her nephew, and the present action forecloses escape from that memory. Early signal +0.5, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, cost connection +0.4. Final 7.3.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Tether" appears explicitly in the climactic realization ("The wasp wasn't trapped—it was tethered") and in the letter Vera will write ("tether yourself to what you've lost"). The concept shapes her understanding and thus her choice to engage the firmware. Setup via the wasp's suspension, middle development when she grasps the tether logic, closure when the letter instructs future-self to tether. However, the action of tethering is metaphorical; Vera does not physically bind herself or an object on the page. The verb is swappable with "anchor" or "hold" without breaking logic. Two-gate participation (middle, closure) +base ~5.5, causal role +0.6, lyric reprise +0.4, but swappability −0.4 and metaphor-only use −0.4. Final 6.7.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>The method "handwritten letters found in antique furniture" appears in paragraph three (the Victorian writing desk). Setup gate met. However, the letter's mechanics do not shape any middle attempt; Vera reads it once and proceeds to the laboratory. At closure, she will write and hide it "years from now in furniture not yet built," a postdictive loop that does not constrain her present tactics. The method is present but functionally ornamental; the story would work identically if the curator simply invited her. Setup only, no middle development, cameo at closure. Cap 4.6 for missing middle, decorative mention −0.3, swappable delivery mechanism −0.5. Final 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The laboratory of lost sounds is introduced in the opening line, detailed across paragraphs (glass cabinets, chambers of thunder, pipe-organ supercomputer), and provides the machine Vera must interface with to achieve closure. Setup, development (the laboratory houses the haunted firmware), and closure (she works there to resolve the code) all present. The setting supplies the exact resource (the machine) that enables resolution and its atmosphere (preserved sounds, forgotten lullabies) mirrors her guilt. Spatial choreography is clear. Early signal +0.6, beat involvement (multiple) +1.4, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.5. Final 7.9.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "when time folds in on itself" is stated in paragraph one and mentioned again at closure ("where time folded in on itself"). Setup and closure gates met, but the folding of time does not constrain any middle choice. Vera does not race a clock or navigate temporal loops on the page; the phrase functions as world-flavor. The final letter ("years from now") gestures at time-travel causality but remains abstract. Two-gate lyric reprise eligible ~5.5, but no middle development cap at 4.6, ornamental use −0.3, no pressure on tactics −0.2. Final 4.1.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Vera's motivation to resolve old guilt is seeded early (paragraph four: "Ever since she'd ignored the baby's cries"), drives her engagement with the firmware (middle: "accumulated sorrow… guilt of translations never completed"), and is satisfied at closure ("finally learning to listen"). All three gates met. The desire is dramatized through her choice to interface with the machine and "rewrite her own constellation." Internal friction is present: she must confront the nephew's death to proceed. Early signal +0.5, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage +1.3, cost connection +0.5. Slight penalty for telling the nephew backstory rather than enacting present guilt in scene choices −0.3. Final 7.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Meteor hush" appears only in the final paragraph ("In the meteor hush of evening"), providing a lyric closure image. No setup or middle development; the phrase is absent until the last line. The tone throughout reads contemplative and guilt-soaked, consistent with the phrase, but "meteor hush" itself does no work earlier. One-gate closure participation only; cap 2.8 for missing setup and development. However, the tone it names (quiet, vast, resolved) does charge the final image and reweights the laboratory's earlier noise with silence. Lyric-resonance allowance and closure linkage lift it toward mid-5s: +1.8 for charged final image, +0.6 for tone coherence. Final 5.2.</comment>
