<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority carries embodied specificity ("hand returned to her chest," "breath caught"), and the borrowed-heart premise generates a coherent internal contradiction that drives her journey. Chen's observation about her "different shadow" feels more like a diagnostic label than dramatized perception, and his watchful stillness never forces a concrete choice on the page—he guides but does not oppose. The ending commitment ("stay… learn") reads as summary rather than a micro-choice with visible cost; we're told about future learning rather than watching her forfeit or risk something now. Backstory is well-anchored in the present via the heart motif, but the final beat would benefit from a specific renunciation or trade-off to earn the stasis.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clean by the opening paragraph (who, where, when), and the Drive Lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: pressure builds through Chen's revelations about Yuki's legacy, the morpho-wing metaphor system, and Mira's decision to stay. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis via commitment to apprenticeship), but the cost remains oblique—no visible forfeiture or consequence dramatized on the page, only the promise of future work. One meaningful deepening occurs when Chen explains "iridescent caution" and Mira recognizes the burden, but the final image ("learn to carry Yuki's legacy without being consumed") tells rather than shows the stakes. The lens holds, but the ending could charge harder with a concrete price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The floating tea house, tether chains, morpho wings on the lightbox, and valley mist are vivid and purposeful; the swaying platform subtly pressures Mira's grip on the table edge. The morpho-wing mechanics (structure versus pigment) constrain Chen's teaching method and charge the "iridescent caution" motif. Spatial choreography is clear, and the environment's verticality and lightbox setup directly enable Chen's "sun trails" observation. One small slip: "rice-paper walls" and "lightbox" feel slightly anachronistic together without a signal of deliberate tech/tradition fusion, but it does not break the scene.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake (learning why strangers share secrets) is signaled early and sustained; the tightening occurs when Chen offers to teach her and she accepts. The reversal is mild—Chen's explanation shifts her understanding from burden to legacy—but no live option is foreclosed on the page. Under the Accumulative lens, the beat deepens meaning rather than narrowing choice, yet the final cost is stated ("without being consumed") rather than dramatized through a visible trade-off or renunciation. The agency lies in Mira's decision to stay, but we don't see what she leaves behind or risks in the act.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme (attention as transformative burden, listening as structural illumination) emerges organically from the morpho-wing metaphor, Yuki's legacy, and Chen's pattern-recognition work. The "iridescent caution" and "quietly explosive" motifs accumulate and charge the final image without stating a moral. The ending's "to illuminate the hidden architectures of human need" skirts thesis-statement territory but remains grounded in Chen's teaching offer and Mira's internal acceptance. No overt thematic echo in dialogue, and the piece resists tidy resolution—Mira's journey is framed as beginning rather than complete. One small slip: "legacy" and "gift" language edges toward prompt-echo phrasing but stays within voice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited focalization is stable; Mira's perceptual signature (heartbeat awareness, physical anchoring) is consistent and specific. Chen's dialogue carries subtext and advances the teaching relationship; his lexicon (sun trails, architectures, pattern recognition) is distinct from Mira's more visceral framing. Psychic distance modulates appropriately—closer during Mira's embodied reactions, wider during Chen's exposition. One filter-verb cluster ("feeling," "thought of," "seemed to possess") in the opening third slightly dulls immediacy but does not break voice. No head-hopping, and the rhythm tightens slightly at the close without losing the valley-mist register.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout ("humming with iridescent caution," "beauty that could overwhelm," "colors rippled across its surface like water," "searching hands"), and while most images are clear, the accumulation in descriptive beats risks overwriting. Two paraphrase loops: "The effect was quietly explosive, beauty that could overwhelm if you weren't careful" restates the same caution twice in adjacent clauses; "listened… listening… listener" cycles across three lines without new pressure. Template cadence appears in the tea-preparation beat: "preparing tea… lifted a wing… set the wing down" uses identical verb-object stems. The closure paragraph stacks metaphors ("floating sanctuary," "hidden architectures," "iridescent caution," "quietly explosive") without clear propulsion, though the final toast image lands cleanly. Apply artifact penalty −0.8 for density and loops across non-closure beats; escalate slightly because one loop ("quietly explosive, beauty that could overwhelm") appears in the inciting-incident paragraph.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The donor-heart premise (memory/essence transfer) is familiar from medical-thriller and transplant-narrative templates; transformation occurs through the morpho-wing metaphor and the floating-tea-house setting, which add specificity. The "iridescent caution" synthesis of beauty and danger is fresh, but the ending's "learn to carry Yuki's legacy without being consumed" reads as a setup for future development rather than a completed arc with non-obvious stakes. Chen's watchfulness and the sun-trail method are distinctive details, yet the emotional trajectory (stranger approaches reveal a gift → seek teacher → commit to apprenticeship) follows a mentor-quest structure without a bold risk or subversion. Within-band penalty −0.5 for template premise; partial restoration +0.2 for the morpho-wing integration and floating-sanctuary specificity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Chen appears early, occupies the eastern wing, and his observation ("Your heart casts a different shadow") triggers Mira's question. He prepares tea, explains Yuki's legacy, and offers to teach—two distinct beats (observation, offer). His choice to teach enables the closure, but he does not face opposition or a visible cost; his role is guide rather than agent under pressure. Present in the final toast image but not causally reweighted there. Two gates (setup, payoff); middle development is observational rather than decisional. Base ~5.0 for functional enabler role; +0.8 for two beats and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Morpho wings appear in three beats: (1) arrangement on lightbox with color explosion, (2) Chen's explanation of structure versus pigment, (3) trembling with shared understanding at closure. The wings' microscopic-scale mechanics constrain Chen's teaching metaphor and charge the "iridescent caution" concept. Removing them would require a different teaching object and metaphor system. Setup, development (enables the pattern-recognition lesson), and payoff (trembling toast) all present. Base ~6.5 for three-beat presence; +0.7 for causal linkage to theme and closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Iridescent caution" is introduced in the morpho-wing description, explicitly named by Chen as a teaching principle, and restated in the final paragraph ("to listen with iridescent caution"). It shapes Mira's understanding of the burden and appears in the ending stakes ("illuminate… without being consumed"), but no on-page choice is constrained by it—Mira's decision to stay is framed as acceptance of future learning rather than a tactical trade-off now. Setup and payoff present; middle development is thematic rather than action-constraining. Base ~5.5 for two-gate presence and thematic coherence; +0.6 for closure participation via final image.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Quietly explosive" appears twice: as descriptor for the morpho-wing light effect ("The effect was quietly explosive") and in the final paragraph as a stance Mira will adopt ("to be quietly explosive with compassion"). No on-page action is constrained or enabled by this trait—it labels rather than drives a choice. Setup and payoff present via lyric reprise; middle beat absent. Base ~5.0 for two-gate presence; +0.6 for closure participation; −0.3 for label-only use without cost; +0.2 for charged final image that reweights the opening sensory moment.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Illuminate" appears in Chen's explanation ("listening… that illuminates what people didn't know they carried"), Mira's request ("teach me to understand"), Chen's teaching offer ("Learning to illuminate others requires learning the nature of light"), and the final paragraph ("to illuminate the hidden architectures of human need"). The action shapes the central stake and the closure commitment. Removing it would require a different verb for the teaching metaphor and final image. Setup, development (Chen's offer), and payoff all present. Base ~6.5 for three-gate presence and thematic coherence; +0.3 for closure linkage; flat on causal pressure because no middle choice is narrowed by it.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Tracking sun trails" is signaled when Chen explains his method ("I track them throughout the day, understand how light moves through spaces, through bodies") and recurs in the teaching offer ("We'll track the sun trails together"). The mechanics (observing light's movement to reveal truth) enable Chen's initial observation about Mira's heart-shadow but do not constrain a middle choice or alter tactics. Setup and payoff present; middle development is expository. Base ~4.5 for two-gate presence; +0.3 for enabling Chen's observation; flat on causal pressure because no cost is tied to the method on the page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The floating tea house (300 feet above the valley, tethered by chains, swaying in wind) grounds the setting from the opening line. The chains' singing, the platform's sway, and Mira gripping the table edge all pressure her physicality. The eastern wing, lightbox, and rice-paper walls enable Chen's sun-trail work. The setting's verticality and isolation charge the sanctuary metaphor at closure ("here in this floating sanctuary, light found every corner"). Setup, development (sway forces grip, lightbox enables teaching), and payoff all present. Base ~6.8; +0.6 for three-gate presence and micro-setting constraint (sway → grip).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The timeframe ("Six months after receiving the donor heart") anchors Mira's arrival and explains the new heartbeat's ongoing strangeness. The post-surgery period enables the magnetism phenomenon ("It had started the day after surgery"), but no on-page choice is tightened by elapsed time or a deadline. Setup present; middle and payoff are thematic rather than clock-driven. Base ~5.5 for setup and enabling backstory; +0.5 for grounding the central mystery; +0.3 for the "day after surgery" detail that sharpens causality; flat on tactical pressure because no future constraint narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mira's desire to learn why strangers share secrets is stated early ("to learn why some people magnetize stories"), dramatized through her examples (elderly man, child, monk), and directly addressed in her question to Chen ("Can you teach me to understand it?"). The motivation drives her pilgrimage and her decision to stay. Setup, development (her question), and payoff (commitment to learn) all present. Base ~6.5 for three-gate presence; +0.6 for causal linkage to closure; flat on friction because the motivation is stated rather than conflicted—no visible cost or competing want pressures the choice to stay.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tone is established through "valley mist at dawn, something ancient and renewing," the floating sanctuary, "soft wonder," and the lightbox's "quiet fire." The register modulates slightly under pressure (Mira's breath catching, Chen's precise movements) without breaking the contemplative mood. The final image ("the valley filled with mist, but here in this floating sanctuary, light found every corner") charges the tone with closure participation. Setup, development (tone holds through the teaching offer), and payoff (final mist/light image) all present. Base ~7.0 for coherent modulation and three-gate presence; +0.6 for closure linkage and charged final image.</comment>
