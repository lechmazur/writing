<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's motivation is clear and her interiority is concrete ("fingers already anticipating the familiar weight"), but internal conflict is largely absent—she encounters no contradictory impulses during the work. The fisherman's transformation from shifting features to "solid now, his face clear" provides embodied emotion and a credible arc earned by the net's unraveling. Micro-choices (selecting the needle, beginning at the net's edge) reveal methodology but lack high-stakes tension or visible cost that would foreclose a path for Maren herself.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the fisherman solidifies, names become starlight) with conceptual cost legible in "no longer drowning anyone in their unspoken weight." The pattern of knot-by-knot release accumulates pressure and reweights the dominant stake (grounding the spirit through exhumation of silence). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. One tightening deepening occurs as the net dissolves and the fisherman's voice "no longer echoed," fulfilling the 600–800 word expectation for meaningful cadence shift.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary's function (refracting names into visible light, holding them as starlight) directly charges the final image and constrains the ritual's purpose. Sensory detail is vivid and selective: "crystalline stone," "net...black with age and salt," "air itself felt heavy." Spatial choreography is clear (net draped on altar, Maren begins at the edge). The sanctuary's open sky and prisms return at closure to transform silence into light, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting constrain choice or charge the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (grounding the restless spirit by releasing bound secrets) is signaled early and tightens through the knot-by-knot process. One meaningful deepening occurs as each released name solidifies the fisherman's form, narrowing the path from dissolution to stability. Agency is Maren's methodical needle work, and the cost is legible: "Every knot holds a name...now the silence is drowning me instead." No high-risk reversal or protagonist sacrifice, but the accumulative lens supports this escalation pattern and the felt price (decades of guilt lifted) lands on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (secrets as drowning weight; witnessing as moral burden) emerges from the net's particulars and the fisherman's confession without meta-commentary. The prism's refraction of names into light offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how silence becomes unbearable. Subtext operates in "I helped the sea keep its secrets" and the sanctuary's role as holder of refracted names. The ending avoids moralizing yet reweights prior material: acknowledgment transforms hidden deaths into visible starlight with undeniable conceptual cost.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-person limited; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is selective and professional: Maren notices "resistance—not physical, but something deeper" and hears names "like a caught breath finally exhaled." Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven ("You know why I've called you"). The fisherman's voice modulates from "hollow echo" to clarity, supporting the arc. Diction remains consistent and accessible; free indirect style is clean. Psychic distance tightens during the ritual without filter-verb clutter, meeting the 9+ quick test for distinct signature and rhythmic control.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high (most lines advance character, atmosphere, or stakes). No paraphrase loops or template cadence detected. Figurative language is controlled: "accumulated silence the way old churches accumulated prayers" is coherent and anchored. Word choice favors strong nouns and verbs ("teased the knot loose," "refracting them into visible light"). Opening line anchors voice and premise; final line resolves by image that recharges the sanctuary motif. Zero scaffold or synonym churn in peak beats; propulsion is clear throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The "spirit restorer who unties literal knots" premise echoes common metaphor-made-literal fantasy templates, risking derivative terrain. However, the specific synthesis—prism sanctuary refracting names into starlight, the fisherman's accumulated witness guilt—feels purposeful rather than generic. The occupational detail (tapestry needle for spiritual work) and the net's double function (fishing tool / silence prison) provide a fresh inflection. Emotional specificity (the fisherman's trembling hands, Maren's anticipation of the needle's weight) avoids template emotion. No close echoes of famous lines detected; the transformation test suggests modest originality rather than bold risk-taking.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Maren (broken mask restorer) is present in setup, drives the middle ritual beats by selecting tools and working each knot, and frames the ending ("Another spirit grounded"). Her choices (beginning at the net's edge, loosening knots with intention) create the turn from restless to grounded. However, her arc is purely procedural—no internal conflict or sacrifice—so causal pressure is limited. Two-beat involvement (tool selection, knot work) and closure linkage lift the score into functional-essential range, but swappability (another ritual specialist could perform similarly) caps higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The tapestry needle appears in setup ("carrying her tools," "selected her tapestry needle"), is used throughout the middle ritual ("worked the needle into the first knot," "needle moving with practiced grace"), and is mentioned at closure ("gathered her tools"). Two distinct beats (selection, knot work) provide functional involvement. However, specificity is low—any fine tool could serve the unraveling logic—and no unique property (e.g., worn smooth point enabling spiritual work) constrains choice or charges the final image. Causal pressure is modest; swappability penalty applies.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Interlaced hush" is signaled early ("the particular quality of silence that came from secrets braided together"), shapes the fisherman's confession ("Every knot holds a name...the silence is drowning me"), and reappears at closure ("no longer drowning anyone in their unspoken weight"). The concept directly enables the stakes: releasing the braided silence is the mechanism for grounding the spirit. Three-beat involvement (setup, confession, closure), strong causal pressure (silence as prison that must be unbraid), and closure linkage (the sanctuary now holds names "no longer hidden") meet the essential threshold. Specificity is high; no near-synonym could replace "interlaced hush" without losing the braiding metaphor.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Accumulates silence" is introduced early (the net "accumulated silence the way old churches accumulated prayers"), drives the fisherman's crisis ("the weight had followed him past death"), and is reversed at closure ("no longer drowning anyone in their unspoken weight"). The attribute constrains the spirit's form (shifting features, hollow voice) and enables Maren's work (releasing accumulated silence). Two-beat involvement (setup, crisis) and causal pressure (the trait creates the problem Maren must solve) lift the score. However, the trait is largely label-only in the middle; no visible on-page cost (e.g., Maren absorbing silence, physical toll) is shown, capping higher bands.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Exhume" (to bring hidden things to light) is signaled in setup ("they needed excavation...secrets buried in silence were the hardest graves to open"), drives the ritual method (bringing names from the net's knots to light), and charges closure (names "no longer hidden"). The action is irreplaceable—unraveling or releasing could substitute mechanically, but "exhume" carries the burial/grave metaphor that shapes tone and theme. Two-beat involvement (setup explanation, ritual execution) and strong thematic linkage. Causal pressure is moderate; the action redefines the stakes from "restoring masks" to "opening graves," meeting the essential threshold.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Unraveling knots in the fisherman's net is introduced in setup (the net on the altar, "Every knot holds a name"), structures the entire middle ritual (Maren works each knot, releasing names), and completes at closure ("the final knot came free, the net...dissolving into mist"). The method is irreplaceable—no other mechanism could deliver the one-name-per-knot accumulation or the net's symbolic weight. Three-beat involvement, strong causal pressure (each knot must be loosened for the spirit to solidify), high specificity (centuries-old fisherman's net ties directly to the fisherman's guilt), and closure linkage. Visible cost: the method requires precision ("Rush the work, and the silence would scatter") and night-long labor.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The prism sanctuary is anchored in setup ("caught starlight in fragments, scattering it across walls"), provides the altar and containment for the ritual, and charges the final image ("The sanctuary would hold these names now, refracting them into starlight"). The setting's unique property (refracting names into visible light) is irreplaceable and directly enables closure. Three-beat involvement (setup, ritual space, closure transformation), strong causal pressure (the prisms transform released names into permanent acknowledgment), and high specificity. The sanctuary's function (holding and refracting) meaningfully shapes the stakes and final image, meeting the 8.5+ threshold.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Across sharing a secret" as timeframe is obliquely present: the fisherman shares his decades of secret-keeping, and Maren works "through the night" to release them. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—Maren has all night, no clock pressure is felt, and the duration could expand or contract without altering tactics. Setup mentions "midnight" and closure notes "dawn approached," providing a loose bracket. One-beat involvement (night-long ritual), no causal pressure from the timeframe itself, and no felt cost tied to the passage of time. The element reads as ambient rather than shaping; swappability applies (the ritual could occur over any span).</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To ground restless spirits" is Maren's stated motivation in setup ("restless spirits didn't need exorcism; they needed excavation") and frames closure ("Another spirit grounded"). The desire is dramatized through her professional actions (selecting tools, methodical knot work) and brief interiority ("her fingers already anticipating"). However, no internal conflict or competing want is shown—Maren experiences no friction between grounding spirits and personal cost. Two-beat involvement (setup declaration, closure confirmation), modest causal pressure (the desire structures her actions but does not force a sacrifice), and functional closure linkage. Told-more-than-shown caps higher bands; no visible trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Lucid unrest" (clarity amid disturbance) is established in setup through the fisherman's shifting features and "hollow echo" voice, modulates during the ritual as his form "began to ease...growing more stable," and resolves at closure with "his face clear" and voice that "no longer echoed." Tone is coherent and purposeful, supporting the arc from dissolution to solidity. The diction ("interlaced hush," "accumulated silence," "lucid unrest") maintains a consistent register of calm precision describing spiritual disturbance. The tone charges the final image by contrasting initial unrest with earned clarity. Three-beat modulation and strong thematic linkage meet the 7.0+ threshold; not quite indispensable, but essential to the atmosphere.</comment>
