<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kasimir's interiority is concrete and embodied through his revolutionary past informing present choices. His shift from "revolution as destruction" to "making cathedrals from shards" earns the ending stance through accumulated particulars. The grandmother's mirror superstition functions as genuine character texture rather than exposition. Minor slip: the realization about "honoring what broke" could have landed more obliquely without the explicit "he was only now learning" frame.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The accumulative/textural lens is taught early through baroque corridors and time-light imagery, held consistently, and paid off when Kasimir's counter-argument becomes a new kind of revolution. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (the corridors "finally making sense") with felt cost—his failed revolution now reimagined as patient archaeological work rather than smashing. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within opening lines. One meaningful deepening occurs when the shard's brokenness shifts from Dr. Vhen's merchant theory to Kasimir's memorialization thesis, narrowing interpretive options and charging his scholarly stance with personal weight.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The baroque architecture constrains Kasimir's interpretive choice—the spirals "echoing fractured edges" provide the evidence against Vhen's merchant theory. Time-light threads function as micro-setting, recurring across beats to mark philosophical shifts and charging the final image ("moments, like vases, were fragile things"). Sensory detail is filtered through a cataloguer's attention: "gilt edges catching amber light," "prismatic ghosts." The asteroid as ruin-site shapes his revolutionary repositioning from destroyer to preserver.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (proving the builders memorialized loss vs. Vhen's merchant theory) signals early and tightens when Kasimir photographs sixteen angles, making his counter-argument material. The escalation is accumulative: grandmother's superstition → covering mirrors reinterpreted → baroque excess as "emotional archaeology" → final recognition that "making broken things beautiful" requires "enormous effort." Agency is decision and attention that forecloses his prior revolutionary stance with visible cost: his fervor now serves "patient work" rather than mass mobilization. The price—obsolescence, failed revolution as cautionary tale—charges each turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the vase shard's brokenness integrated into architecture rather than stated. The mirror-covering superstition seeds early, returns reweighted: "sometimes you had to obscure one kind of seeing to achieve another," then pays off in "they made mirrors from their storms." Final image—"baroque spirals finally making sense"—offers a resonant answer to whether civilization can be reimagined without destruction, grounded in the particulars of mortared fragments and "emotional archaeology." No thematic summary; the reversal from "smash everything" to "cathedrals from shards" is shown through Kasimir's journal composition.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Voice is distinct and consistent: a defeated revolutionary's diction ("words were weapons," "mobilize the masses") modulates into archaeological patience without losing its fervor. Psychic distance is stable; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature—reading symbols "the powerful tried to hide"—filters all observation. Minor deduction: "burnished sorrow" appears as authorial phrase in the final line rather than fully inhabiting Kasimir's internal lexicon, a slight distance slip after otherwise tight focalization.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "revolution taught you to read symbols the powerful tried to hide" establishes expertise, motive, and interpretive lens). Rhythm varies appropriately. Two minor artifacts: "reimagining civilization" appears three times without enough functional variation, creating a template feel. "Burnished sorrow" in the closing paragraph reads slightly elevated relative to the established register. No loops or clarity breaks, but the repetition of core thesis language ("reimagining," "baroque excess," "brokenness") across multiple beats trends toward synonym churn in the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of failed revolutionary + archaeological dispute + covering mirrors as interpretive method feels specific and non-obvious. The "making cathedrals from shards" frame transforms the standard redemption-through-scholarship plot into something more particular. Visible time-threads since the Temporal Unveiling add fresh world texture. Risk: the story commits to a contemplative, accumulative design in a short form where most would force confrontation. The grandmother's superstition integrated as interpretive lens rather than folksy decoration lifts originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kasimir's revolutionary past shapes his ability to "read symbols the powerful tried to hide," enabling his counter-argument. His choice to compose the interpretation rather than accept Vhen's merchant theory creates the story's central turn. The attribute (defunct) charges every beat with obsolescence and cautionary-tale weight, altering his stance from mass mobilizer to patient cataloguer. Present in setup, development (the mirror realization), and payoff (new revolution as "patient work").</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The shard appears in setup (embedded in wall, refracting time-light), development (Kasimir traces its fractured edges, realizes it was already shattered when placed), and payoff (his photographs and final recognition hinge on its brokenness as testimony). It drives two major beats: the initial dispute with Vhen and the climactic reinterpretation. Specificity matters: "already shattered" when mortared is the evidence that shifts the thesis. Removing it collapses the archaeological dispute and the fragility-as-legacy theme.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dispute with Dr. Vhen (merchants vs. memorialization) frames Kasimir's stake and tactics throughout. It appears in setup (Vhen's claim), drives the middle beats (Kasimir's counter-evidence via baroque flourishes), and shapes closure (his completed counter-argument as "new kind of revolution"). The concept narrows his choices: he must work within scholarly methodology while subverting Vhen's clinical approach. Causal: without the dispute, his reinterpretation loses urgency and audience.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kasimir's poetic inclination enables his interpretive method: "poetry rendered in stone," "language academics like Vhen refused to learn." His journal filled with "verse fragments salvaged from revolutionary days" establishes the trait early. It constrains his argument—he must translate emotional truth into evidence Vhen's framework can't accommodate—and charges the middle beat where metaphor becomes methodology. Present in two beats (journal composition, final architectural reading) with visible cost: his poetic lens isolates him from academic consensus.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Devise" drives the story's action: Kasimir begins to compose his counter-argument, photographing sixteen angles and writing his interpretation across multiple beats. The act of devising (not the finished product) is on the page and shapes escalation: each paragraph deepens his thesis from "memorializing loss" to "making brokenness architectural" to "patient work of reimagining." Removing "devise" and substituting "present" or "discover" would lose the constructive, compositional spine. High integration: setup (enters chamber to counter Vhen), development (composes via journal), payoff (clutches completed journal).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The mirror-covering practice appears in setup (grandmother's superstition), returns reweighted in development ("sometimes you had to obscure one kind of seeing to achieve another"), and charges the thesis: "they didn't cover their mirrors during storms—they made mirrors from their storms." Functions as metaphor for interpretive method rather than literal action. Lyric reprise that reweights the dominant stake (how to handle destruction), but no middle beat shows Kasimir using the method to alter a specific choice. Just below the 6.0 threshold due to metaphoric rather than tactical constraint.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The baroque asteroid's architecture is the evidence: "excessive spirals" and "seemingly purposeless flourishes" are what Kasimir reads against Vhen. Setting supplies the fractured-edge geometry that proves memorialization. Present in setup (twisted corridors, gilt edges), development (flourishes "flowing toward the crystal"), and payoff (corridors "finally making sense"). The physical space constrains the interpretive dispute—Vhen and Kasimir are reading the same walls differently—and the specificity (baroque excess as verse) is irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Visible time-threads anchor the world ("since the Temporal Unveiling") and recur across beats: opening (time-light curling from Kasimir's touch), middle (drifting past the shard), closing (swirling around him, "moments, like vases, were fragile things"). The timeframe charges the philosophical stakes (everyone watches existence glow) and the final image. No tactical pressure—time doesn't tighten a decision—but the accumulative reprise reweights fragility as the point. Lyric integration; just above mid-band due to closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Kasimir's desire to reimagine civilization drives every beat: his failed revolution (wanted to "reshape humanity's course"), his new understanding (honoring what broke), and his counter-argument (these builders succeeded where he failed). The motivation is dramatized through friction: his obsolescence vs. his fervor finding "new purpose." Cost is visible—his name is now "an embarrassment"—and the final stance (patient work vs. smashing) forecloses his prior revolutionary identity. Present in setup (catalogues ruins alone), development (revolution reinterpreted), payoff (new revolution as scholarly reimagining).</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Tone is coherent and modulates with pressure: "familiar weight of obsolescence," "burnished sorrow of recognition," "stubborn hope." The phrase "burnished sorrow" recurs in the final line, charging the baroque spirals with the story's emotional signature. Tone reflects Kasimir's defeated-but-persistent stance throughout, never collapsing into bitterness or false uplift. It supports the accumulative design and charges the closure image. Slightly elevated diction ("burnished") trends authorial in the last beat, but the modulation across turns (from obsolescence to patient hope) justifies high integration.</comment>
