<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's interiority shows consistent motivation through the keepsake and her therapeutic approach, but the characterization leans heavily on professional competence without contradictory impulses acting in scene. Thomas's selective mutism breakthrough feels somewhat schematic—the humming-to-words progression is clean but lacks the messy psychological resistance that would make the shift costlier. The mother's reaction is summarized rather than dramatized, missing an opportunity to show Mara processing success with her characteristic doubt. Embodied emotion is present ("tears threatening but held back") but stays controlled throughout, never degrading under the pressure of the moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear Causal lens: Mara's deliberate therapeutic choices (location, eclipse timing, guitar) create the conditions for Thomas's breakthrough. Orientation anchors quickly (clinic, Sage Ridge, eclipse day). The closure—Thomas speaking and Mara planning next week's session—constitutes a Decisive Change with visible cost (the fragility of the moment, the careful planning required to sustain progress). However, the cost feels more anticipated than paid on the page; we see Mara's caution but not a tangible forfeiture or trade-off that narrows her future options in this specific moment.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sage Ridge, the garden, and eclipse glasses provide concrete setting anchors. The eclipse itself constrains the timing and creates the liminal sensory environment (cooling air, strange light, bird silence) that enables Thomas's breakthrough—environment actively shapes the climactic choice. The wooden box appears twice, framing the session, and the guitar functions as a therapeutic tool. However, spatial choreography during the eclipse scene (cushions, Mara's sight lines, Thomas's positioning) remains somewhat vague, and the clinic interior is barely sketched beyond "small wooden box on her desk."</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: helping Thomas find his voice. The eclipse session provides one meaningful tightening—the liminal moment creates pressure that enables the breakthrough. Mara's agency is visible in her therapeutic choices (melody "softly adaptive," not overwhelming his humming), and Thomas's three words carry weight. The cost, however, is more implied than visceral; Mara's "cautious exuberance" and tear-holding signal fragility, but we don't see what she must now sacrifice or risk to build on this moment. The resolution feels clean rather than purchased with visible price.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the eclipse-as-metaphor ("darkness and light can dance together") and the intergenerational pattern of nurturing wonder. The wooden box keepsake links Mara's past parenting anxiety to present therapeutic work, creating thematic resonance. However, the final reflection explicitly states the theme ("the real magic—not in grand gestures, but in teaching others to notice") rather than letting the eclipse moment and planning beat carry it implicitly. Thomas's line "Your guitar sounds like starlight looks" offers genuine wonder, but Mara's response borders on thematic statement. The ending session-planning beat provides concrete next steps but doesn't reweight prior material with fresh tension.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV maintained throughout with stable third-person limited focalization through Mara. Perceptual signature is consistent: professional observation, metaphorical thinking ("ordinary magic," "frequencies"), controlled emotional responses. Dialogue feels natural and Thomas's sparse speech contrasts effectively with Mara's measured therapeutic voice. Register occasionally drifts into workshop language ("softly adaptive," "lifelong wonder") that feels more like craft vocabulary than embodied thought, particularly in the opening and closing reflection passages. Psychic distance stays appropriate, pulling close during the eclipse and widening for bracketing reflections.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with strong individual images ("where the pines grew so dense that even noon felt like twilight," "beneath the hush of dreaming roots"). However, several passages loop thematically: the opening and closing both explain Mara's mission via similar abstract phrasing ("ordinary magic," "nurture lifelong wonder"). The phrase "ordinary magic" appears four times, functioning as a thematic tag rather than earning its recurrence through evolving context. Filter verbs cluster in reflective beats ("she'd learned," "she thought") without significant voice payoff. The eclipse description effectively compresses sensory detail, but the final two paragraphs dilute momentum with summary and planning rather than resting on the charged moment.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The music therapy premise combined with eclipse timing offers a fresh synthesis, and the specific detail of selective mutism feels researched and handled with care. However, the core emotional arc—anxious helper finds validation through client breakthrough—follows a familiar template. The eclipse functions somewhat predictably as the transformative catalyst, and the bracketing structure (keepsake → session → keepsake reflection) reads as tidy framing rather than risk-taking design. The "starlight" line from Thomas provides genuine surprise, but Mara's closing thoughts revert to gentle affirmation without complication. The piece executes its premise competently but stays safely within therapeutic-breakthrough conventions.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mara makes several key choices: selecting the eclipse timing, positioning in the garden, playing guitar adaptively, and planning future sessions. Her "mellow" quality is demonstrated through controlled reactions and measured therapeutic approach. Present in setup (clinic choice), development (adaptive playing), and closure (session planning). However, "mellow" doesn't create meaningful friction or cost—it's consistently beneficial. The attribute enables her work without constraining other options or forcing trade-offs.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The baby hair curl appears in two distinct beats: opening (Mara checks the box before session) and closing (she opens it again after). Both appearances anchor her motivation and anxiety about nurturing wonder, creating a frame. However, the object's meaning doesn't evolve between appearances—it represents the same reassurance both times. The curl doesn't constrain choices during the eclipse scene itself or participate in the therapeutic breakthrough. Functional lyric reprise but no reweighting with cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Ordinary magic" appears as a label four times but functions primarily as thematic claim rather than shaping tactics or creating constraints. The concept describes Mara's philosophy ("wonder lived in subtle frequencies") but doesn't generate specific on-page choices that differ from standard therapeutic practice. The eclipse provides the transformative moment, not the "ordinary magic" framework itself. Present in setup and referenced at closure, but the concept could be removed without altering the plot's causal chain.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Softly adaptive" directly shapes Mara's key action during the eclipse: "She played another note, then another, letting the melody be softly adaptive to the changing light, to the boy's barely perceptible shifts in breathing." This attribute constrains her approach—she must modulate rather than lead—and the cost is visible in her restraint ("too much reaction might shatter this fragile emergence"). Present in setup (her cultivated voice quality), development (adaptive playing), and closure (planning adaptive future elements). The trait enables the breakthrough and reflects professional discipline with embodied cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Link" operates throughout: Mara's melody links with Thomas's humming ("creating a duet"), her therapeutic approach links past to present via the keepsake, and she links wonder across generations. The linking action during the eclipse is causally essential—"she let her melody link with his humming, weaving around it without dominating"—and directly enables his speech. The action shapes the climactic turn and appears in the ending reflection ("link with his humming"). Removing this specific action would require substantial restructuring. Strong causal presence and closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The eclipse is signaled in the opening line ("Today marked the solar eclipse"), structures the entire session timing, creates the liminal sensory conditions that enable breakthrough, and dominates the climactic beat. Its mechanics matter: totality's approach, corona visibility, temperature drop, bird silence, and strange light all contribute to the transformative moment. The eclipse isn't merely backdrop—it provides the specific environmental pressure that Mara leverages therapeutically. Removing it would collapse the story's causal logic. Present in setup, development, and climax with high specificity and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Sage Ridge is mentioned in the opening and closing, providing geographic anchor and tonal atmosphere through pine density and remote location. The garden with sage plants supplies the eclipse-viewing location and releases "sharp perfume." However, the ridge itself doesn't constrain choices or alter tactics—the session could occur in any quiet outdoor therapeutic space. The sage plants provide sensory detail but don't participate in the breakthrough. Present in setup and closure frame, functional in development, but replaceable with similar remote settings.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Beneath the hush of dreaming roots" appears once as atmospheric descriptor ("that's how her grandmother had described this time of day") but doesn't function as a timeframe that structures action. The eclipse provides the actual temporal constraint (twenty-minute countdown to totality). The phrase evokes mood but doesn't track time, tighten decisions, or shape the pacing of events. Ornamental rather than mechanical. Single mention without causal pressure or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Nurturing lifelong wonder drives Mara's career choice, location selection, eclipse session design, and future planning. The motivation is dramatized through the keepsake (past anxiety about her daughter), Thomas's breakthrough (present achievement), and session planning (future commitment). Friction appears in her doubt ("when doubt crept in") and cautious response to success. The motivation shapes multiple beats and participates in closure. However, the want doesn't conflict sharply with competing needs—it flows smoothly through the narrative without forcing trade-offs between wonder-nurturing and other values.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Cautious exuberance" is named explicitly once ("Mara's heart surged with cautious exuberance") and embodied in her controlled reaction to Thomas's humming—the restraint that prevents "shattering this fragile emergence." The tone modulates from opening doubt, through eclipse anticipation, to breakthrough restraint, to closing planning confidence. However, the tone stays within a narrow bandwidth of gentle professionalism; it never charges the final image with heightened pressure or risk. Present and coherent but ultimately static in its careful register, missing opportunities for tonal shift that would mark real cost.</comment>
