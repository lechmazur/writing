<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to rehabilitate her great-grandfather's memory is clear and drives her choices, but internal contradiction remains thin—her idealism never genuinely conflicts with doubt or fear in a way that complicates action. The "nervously confident" attribute is asserted twice but never embodied through micro-choices that reveal competing impulses acting simultaneously. Dr. Kao functions primarily as a sounding board rather than applying independent pressure that forces Mira to adapt her stance. The final choice to descend feels inevitable from the opening rather than earned through on-page struggle that forecloses a safer path.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly within the first paragraph. The piece establishes a causal chain—journals reveal codes, codes point to a "wound-door" beneath the station, Mira decides to investigate—but the escalation is largely expository conversation rather than dramatized obstacles that narrow options. Closure reads as Charged Poise: Mira and Dr. Kao step toward the airlock with stakes crystallized, but the cost remains prospective rather than paid on the page, weakening the felt consequence. The drive lens is Causal with ambition toward Accumulative (coded stanzas, copper nail motif), but the hybrid execution doesn't fully cohere—reversals are absent and the tightening is mostly a single decision to act.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The experimental weather station and its impossible atmospheric phenomena (violet clouds, upward snow, sub-zero temperatures) are vivid and voice-filtered through Mira's professional lens. The copper nail is handled twice and carries symbolic weight, but it doesn't constrain a tactical choice or alter the final move. Spatial choreography is clean—desk, window, airlock progression—and the "broken weather" motif charges the setting's strangeness, supporting the wound-door premise without becoming mere backdrop.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—proving reversible exile and vindicating her great-grandfather—is signaled early and remains coherent. However, the story delivers no meaningful on-page reversal or tightening: Mira begins determined to investigate and ends stepping through the airlock without encountering resistance, misunderstanding, or a choice that forecloses another path. Dr. Kao's shift from skepticism to cooperation occurs off-camera between dialogue beats, deflating potential friction. The cost of descent is prospective rather than paid in the text, leaving pressure legible but unescalated.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—exile, belonging, and the courage to step sideways out of catastrophe—emerges through the journals, the copper nail tradition, and the wound-door motif without overt moralizing. The coded stanzas and "boundaries between being and unbeing" risk abstraction but are anchored by Mira's personal stake in rehabilitating her ancestor. The final image ("the strange, singing cold") offers a non-literal answer that reweights the station's phenomena as threshold rather than threat, though the conceptual cost could be sharper on the page.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and voice carries a speculative, academic texture appropriate to Mira's profession ("spongey dread," "wound-doors," "the world's membrane weakens"). Dialogue pursues goals—Mira persuading, Dr. Kao probing—and carries subtext in Kao's "nervously confident" observation and the final "someone should document this properly." Filter verbs ("watching," "observing") are acceptable within the reflective register. Minor slips: "the ancestor she'd barely known had led her to something else entirely" leans expository when the journals themselves are the active agent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is generally high, but several beats suffer from expository summary where scene pressure would land harder: "Everyone thinks he abandoned his family" and the stanza-description paragraph read like backstory dumps rather than discoveries under stress. The phrase "spongey dread" appears once without embodiment in action or perception. Minor template cadence in the dialogue tags: "Mira said," "Dr. Kao observed," "Mira's voice carried." No loops or metaphor muddles in peak beats, and the closing line ("strange, singing cold") recharges the atmospheric motif cleanly.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Reversible exile" and "wound-doors" offer a fresh speculative angle, and the coded-journal inheritance avoids pure convenience by rooting discovery in Mira's professional skill. The combination of climate collapse, impossible weather, and voluntary disappearance synthesizes familiar post-apocalyptic and portal-fantasy elements into a coherent premise. However, the emotional arc—idealistic descendant seeks ancestor's truth—follows a well-worn template, and the story does not transform it through a non-obvious moral calculus or unexpected cost. The final move (descent into the wound-door) feels more like a beginning than a synthesis that reweights prior material in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira's idealism drives her volunteer posting and her decision to investigate, shaping two beats (decoding journals, choosing to descend). Her trait is present in dialogue ("to honor what he discovered") and final action, but her choices don't narrow options through on-page friction—she begins intent and ends intent without a reversal that tests her commitment. The idealism is more thematic claim than embodied struggle with cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>The copper nail appears in three beats: opening touch, mid-story explanation (coffin tradition, keeping the dead from wandering), and pocket-check before descent. Its symbolic weight (reversing exile, honoring the ancestor) is clear, but it never constrains a choice or alters a tactic—Mira doesn't use it, and its presence in the airlock beat is gestural rather than causal. The meaning remains stable rather than reweighted at closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Reversible exile" is the story's conceptual spine, seeded in the opening (jet stream exile, ancestor's disappearance), developed through the coded stanzas and wound-door explanation, and enacted in the closing descent. The concept shapes Mira's goal and the station's function as threshold, but the mechanics remain abstract—exile is discussed more than dramatized, and no on-page choice hinges on understanding what "reversible" entails versus permanent departure. Strong thematic presence; weaker causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Nervously confident" is named twice (once by Dr. Kao, once in the final paragraph) but never embodied in contradictory micro-actions or choices under pressure. The trait could describe Mira's state, but the text doesn't show simultaneous caution and boldness competing in a decision that alters tactics or reveals cost. Label-only mention without visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Question" (to question everything we assume about permanence and exile) is embedded in Mira's dialogue and drives her interpretive stance toward the journals and her decision to investigate. It's thematically present and motivates her final move, but the act of questioning itself doesn't create a major turn—Mira begins questioning her ancestor's reputation and ends acting on that questioning without an on-page beat where questioning a specific assumption changes her options or costs her something immediate.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The coded stanzas appear in three beats: arrival in cargo drop, Mira's decoding work, and the map with copper symbols that locates the wound-door beneath the station. The method is signaled early, matters to the plot (Mira's unique skill unlocks the location), and shapes her choice to descend. However, the decoding itself is summarized rather than dramatized—no on-page struggle with ambiguous notation that forces a risky interpretation. Functional and causal but not irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The experimental weather station is present in the opening anchor, supplies the impossible phenomena that make metaphysics plausible, and houses the wound-door beneath it, directly enabling the closure beat. The violet clouds, singing auroras, and sub-zero readings are filtered through Mira's professional lens and pressure her worldview. The station's isolation mirrors the exile theme, and its instrumentation ("evening chorus of warnings") charges the final descent without resolving the conflict for her.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>The jet stream shift is the inciting event that strands Mira at the station for three months, creating the situational pressure and extended access to the journals. The timeframe is signaled in the opening line and contextualizes the impossible weather, but it doesn't tighten decisions in the present action—no ticking clock, no impending extraction, no deadline that narrows Mira's window to investigate. Setup function strong; escalation function weak.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mira's desire to rehabilitate her great-grandfather's memory is dramatized in the coffin-nail salvage, her volunteer posting, and her final assertion ("he was brave in a way no one understood"). The motivation is conflicted with "spongey dread" and idealism versus fear, but the friction remains in assertion rather than on-page choice—she never confronts a moment where honoring him costs her safety or credibility in a visible trade-off. Present across beats; cost underplayed.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Spongey dread" is named once and evoked through the impossible weather, the coffin nail, and the threshold imagery, creating a coherent unease that modulates from reflective dread (journals, ancestor's fate) to active dread (descent into the wound-door). The tone charges the final image ("strange, singing cold"), but "spongey" as a descriptor is asserted rather than built through cumulative sensory or syntactic pressure—rhythm and diction don't degrade or thicken to embody the quality. Thematic coherence; insufficient embodiment for higher bands.</comment>
