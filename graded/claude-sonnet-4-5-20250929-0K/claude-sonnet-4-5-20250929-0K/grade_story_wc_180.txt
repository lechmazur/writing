<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marta's interiority is concrete and character-particular throughout, with embodied contradiction in her belief that "progress meant leaving things behind" while unconsciously keeping the grandmother's grinding stone. The reconciliation moment earns its weight through specific craft detail rather than therapy-speak. Internal conflict shows simultaneous impulses: wanting to modernize while mourning the loss of tradition. The daughter Lena remains somewhat thin—her anger is asserted more than dramatized in contradictory action—but her role as pressure source functions adequately.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal with strong Accumulative undertones; the piece teaches its pattern early (cathedral-as-metaphor, ribbon as talisman) and pays it off at closure. Orientation anchors clearly by the second paragraph (Marta, cathedral with apple trees, post-breach). The closure unit is a clean Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant): mother and daughter's joined hands over the grinding stone reweight the "deciduous vows" concept with visible cost—Marta's admission of failure and the forfeiture of her corporate path. One meaningful tightening occurs when Marta discovers the grandmother's stone in her bag, narrowing options toward the teaching reconciliation. Cost is legible in the line "We'll start our own practice. No contracts, just the work"—a clear economic and reputational price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard fusion is vivid and purposeful: "apple trees grew wild through the nave, their branches threading between ancient rafters" establishes both visual specificity and thematic ground. The grinding stone (micro-setting object) constrains the final teaching choice and charges the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean: broken window → orchard undergrowth → ladder → platforms → final shared workspace. The setting subtly mirrors internal states (abandoned consecrated space finding new life) without overt symbolism, and sensory detail stays selective rather than catalog-like.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—bridging the generational rift and reclaiming craft wisdom—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when Marta finds the grandmother's stone, forcing a values choice. The reversal (Lena invites her, revealing she's been trying to learn alone) narrows options and raises relational cost. Agency is clear: Marta's choice to teach again forecloses the corporate path with on-page economic consequence ("No contracts, just the work"). Pressure coheres under the Causal lens; the breach's penalty clause creates concrete loss that the ending decision accepts rather than solves.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the grinding-stone demonstration and the cathedral's adaptive growth rather than from authorial assertion. "Deciduous vows" is initially misunderstood by Marta as permission to break promises, then reframed by Lena as "the core persists while the expression changes"—a non-literal answer earned through on-page action. The final image (blossoms falling on joined hands) reweights the ribbon and the craft without stating a moral. Subtext operates in Lena's flat "You came" and in the oilcloth-wrapped stone that Marta "thought lost"—both gestures carry more weight than their surface declares. One minor slip: "Sometimes wisdom arrives accidentally" borders on stating the theme, though it's saved by being filtered through Marta's POV as in-scene reflection.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and tightly focused through Marta's perceptual signature: she notices craft details (the grinding stone's angle, the quartz's needs) and interprets through family history. Psychic distance modulates purposefully, tightening during the teaching demonstration. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven: Lena's "Deciduous vows aren't about breaking promises, are they?" pursues understanding rather than exposition. Diction stays within Marta's lexicon (quartz-eye mender's concrete vocabulary, not academic abstraction). One minor filter-verb cluster in the opening paragraph ("had called," "had sworn," "had signed") slightly dulls immediacy, though the effect is brief and doesn't touch closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings show strong variety. Information density is high: most lines do double duty (e.g., "The blue silk had faded to grey over the years" establishes time passage and Marta's care simultaneously). One paraphrase loop appears mid-story: the explanation of "deciduous vows" is stated by the narrator, then restated by Lena in dialogue, covering the same conceptual ground. Minor scaffold in "endearingly feisty even in anger" reads as authorial label rather than embodied trait. The final image is strong and concrete, avoiding summary. No clarity issues; grammar and pronoun references remain clean throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard fusion offers a fresh spatial premise, and the craft of quartz-lens grinding provides occupational specificity that avoids cliché. The "deciduous vows" concept is distinctive and well-integrated. However, the estranged-parent-reconciliation arc follows a recognizable template (breach → symbolic meeting ground → shared task → forgiveness), transformed primarily through the craft detail rather than a non-obvious emotional calculus. The piece commits fully to its premise and executes at a high level within its structure. Risk-taking is moderate: the lyric cathedral setting and the metaphor-rich frame elevate but don't radically subvert expectations.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marta (quartz-eye mender) is present in all beats. Her choices create key turns: deciding to climb the ladder, choosing to demonstrate the craft when she finds the stone, and committing to "start our own practice" with visible economic cost. The character's profession shapes her perceptual signature (noticing grinding angles, quartz's needs) and the closure action (teaching the craft). Specificity is high; removing this exact occupation would break the story's thematic and causal logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The daughter's hair ribbon appears in three beats: opening (tied around wrist, establishing Marta's devotion), mid-story (Marta touches it while reflecting on her mother's phrase), and closure (flutters against her wrist during the teaching moment). The ribbon's meaning evolves from talisman of loss to emblem of promise kept. However, it does not constrain a choice or supply tactical resources; its role is primarily symbolic resonance. Solid lyric reprise that reweights the stake, but the ribbon remains passive rather than causally active.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>"Deciduous vows" is introduced early, misunderstood by Marta (as permission to break promises), then reframed by Lena in dialogue ("the core persists while the expression changes"), directly altering Marta's understanding and enabling the reconciliation. The concept shapes the central stake: whether adaptation means abandonment or transformation. It appears in at least three beats (opening reflection, Lena's question, Marta's realization) and charges the final image of craft teaching as a new form of the old promise. The concept is indispensable to both plot logic and thematic closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"Endearingly feisty" is asserted by the narrator ("Only Lena would phrase it that way, endearingly feisty even in anger") but not demonstrated through on-page action or speech pattern. Lena's dialogue is direct but not notably feisty; her flat "You came" and patient explanation read as reserved rather than spirited. The trait exists as label without visible behavioral cost or constraint. Present but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>"Persist" operates as both action and concept throughout. The cathedral's trees "persisted" after abandonment (early signal), Marta's kept ribbon shows her persistence in devotion, Lena has been persisting in trying to learn the craft alone, and the closure decision ("We'll start our own practice") enacts persistence despite economic loss. The action drives at least three beats and is causally essential to the reconciliation: without mutual persistence (Lena inviting, Marta climbing, both committing to the new practice), the breach would remain. The word and concept are indispensable to the story's logic and final image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The forgotten bag contents (grandmother's grinding stone) are signaled early ("the same satchel she'd carried for thirty years"), discovered at the midpoint turn ("Out of habit, she rummaged through it"), and immediately enable the teaching demonstration that resolves the breach. The mechanics matter: Marta "thought it lost in the workshop seizure," making its presence a concrete surprise that narrows options toward reconciliation. The method is causally active in two beats (discovery, demonstration) and shapes the closure action. Strong integration; the exact object's history and survival are necessary for the emotional and practical resolution.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The cathedral-orchard setting is introduced in the opening beat, pressures Marta's approach (she must "climb through the broken window," then ascend a ladder into the canopy), supplies the workspace platforms where reconciliation occurs, and charges the final image (apple blossoms falling on joined hands). Lena explicitly uses the setting as metaphor ("Somewhere that adapts… It didn't honor some rigid contract. It just found another way"), linking space to theme. The lush undergrowth and rafters constrain movement and create the elevated, liminal meeting ground essential to the story's emotional and physical logic. Indispensable across setup, middle, and closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "after the breach of contract" timeframe is established early and supplies the inciting wound: Marta lost "her workshop, her tools, her reputation" and Lena "stopped coming by after that." This past event tightens present stakes (economic ruin, estrangement) and makes the reconciliation costly (they must start over "with no contracts"). However, the timeframe itself does not impose a live clock or deadline pressure within the present scene. The breach's consequences persist and shape tactics, but elapsed time since the breach is vague. Functional across beats, essential to motivation, but not a dynamic constraint in the present action.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"To bridge generational wisdom" is the dominant stake, introduced in Marta's opening vow ("to pass down the family craft to Lena") and her breach of it (selling to the corporation). Lena's invitation and partial self-teaching dramatize the friction between want (reconnection) and cost (Marta's pride, Lena's disappointment). The reconciliation scene enacts the bridging through hands-on teaching, and the closure decision ("We'll start our own practice") commits both to the generational transmission with economic sacrifice. The motivation is contradictory (Marta wanted progress but also continuity), conflicted across three beats, and essential to the story's causal and emotional arc.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Accidental wisdom" is established early (Marta climbs "without thinking," grabs the bag "out of habit") and modulates through the story: the grandmother's stone appears by chance, Marta's insight arrives through touch rather than planned speech. The tone coheres across turns—no heavy-handed moralizing, discoveries feel stumbled-upon—and charges the final image: "Sometimes wisdom arrives accidentally… sometimes you climb through a window and find that what you sought to teach, you first needed to relearn." The tonal choice shapes narrative voice (reflective but not didactic) and supports the theme of adaptive rather than rigid learning. The ending line makes the tone explicit, which is a minor liability, but the execution throughout is consistent and purposeful.</comment>
