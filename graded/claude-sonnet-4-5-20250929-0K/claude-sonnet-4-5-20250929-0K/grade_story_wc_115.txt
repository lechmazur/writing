<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus exhibits consistent goal pursuit through the tunnel exploration and call interpretation, with embodied alertness ("drowsy alertness that came from three consecutive nights"). His interior reasoning feels character-specific when decoding patterns, but the move from observation to the final understanding feels more narrated than dramatically earned—he "understood" rather than arriving through a micro-choice under pressure. The final climb back lacks visible cost or foreclosed path; he simply documents and leaves, which undercuts the sense of transformation or renunciation.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly in the opening paragraph. The piece reads under an Accumulative/Textural lens: Marcus collects calls, traces names, maps confessions across five nights, building density toward the final valve-turn that "lightens" the shadows. Closure arrives as Conceptual Repricing—the factory ghost shift reweighted as "psychic impressions" of collective guilt—with conceptual cost legible in "until every family found the courage to speak directly." The shift-change sound offers a resonant final image. One deduction: the causality of Marcus's valve-turning producing the lightening effect is asserted rather than motivated by prior mechanics.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The abandoned mill and tunnel are vividly anchored with sensory specifics—ceramic beads worn smooth, dripping darkness, rotting railroad ties, water hammering in pipes. The beaded valve wheels recur and charge the final understanding, constraining Marcus's path and supplying the documentary trail he seeks. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. However, the shift from observation to supernatural payoff (shadows pausing, workers "clocking out") lacks grounding in the physical mechanics established earlier, creating a slight tonal leap rather than an inevitable environmental constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding the weight of swallowed truth—is signaled early and pursued consistently through mapping confessions to architecture. Pressure accumulates via the caller's breaking confession and Marcus's deepening interpretation. The valve-turning produces a tightening when "the shadows paused," narrowing options toward documentation and departure. Cost is conceptually legible in the unfinished work ("until every family found the courage"). However, the protagonist's agency at closure is primarily observational; he documents rather than risks or renounces, which keeps the felt price modest for this length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges cleanly from concrete particulars: beaded valve wheels as prayers/markers, frantic radio calls as secondhand confession, and the metaphor of "swallowed truth" pressing shadows into stone. The ending offers a non-literal answer—Marcus's documentation can't complete the release, only the families' direct speech can—without moralizing. The image of workers "finally clocking out" resonates as both literal ghost-shift closure and thematic repricing of generational guilt. No overt thesis statements mar the final paragraph.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Marcus with a perceptual signature rooted in his "religiously skeptical" lens—he interprets the ghost shift as "psychic impressions" rather than supernatural. Diction is controlled and voice-specific ("squatted at the edge of town like a rusted monument"). The radio-caller dialogue feels natural and goal-driven, carrying subtext about family complicity. One slip: the phrase "drowsy alertness" appears twice in identical form, and late-story constructions like "psychic impressions, the weight of collective guilt pressed into stone and steel and water" drift slightly into abstraction under peak pressure, though they remain legible.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most lines advance setting, character reasoning, or thematic charge. The opening valve-wheel description and the recurring beaded-wheel motif carry specificity without clutter. Two deductions: the phrase "drowsy alertness" recurs identically in paragraphs one and nine without reweighting, a mild paraphrase loop. More significantly, the closure paragraph stacks abstract constructions ("psychic impressions," "weight of collective guilt pressed into stone and steel and water") that slightly dull immediacy when concrete image would sharpen the beat. No major artifacts obscure causality.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The synthesis of radio-psychic-hotline confessions with industrial archaeology and beaded valve wheels as folk-memorial markers feels specific and non-obvious. The "religiously skeptical" frame transforms the ghost-story trope into cultural-guilt cartography, and the Tommy Reeves thread braids historical crime with present ritual. The ending's restraint—Marcus documents but cannot complete the work—avoids the tidy-resolution trap. However, the ghost-workers-as-unprocessed-guilt premise, while executed with care, echoes familiar therapeutic metaphor; the piece transforms rather than fully reinvents the haunted-factory template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Marcus is introduced early as the mill explorer, pursues the tunnel quest across multiple beats, and his documentation/departure choice shapes the ending. However, his exploration reads more as methodical observation than reckless action—he listens, photographs, turns valves carefully. The "reckless" attribute is asserted in the setup but not dramatized through a high-risk choice with visible cost, keeping the character's causal pressure functional but not indispensable to the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The beaded valve wheel appears in the opening beat (ceramic segments), recurs decorated with "blue and white beads arranged like rosary prayers" in the tunnel, and returns as a set ("more valve wheels, each decorated with beads in different colors") that Marcus turns to produce the shadow-lightening effect. The wheels function as both physical tool and symbolic marker, shaping Marcus's documentary method and charging the closure. Specificity and causal linkage are strong, though the mechanics of valve-turning producing supernatural effect remain under-motivated.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The factory ghost shift is named early, discussed through caller testimony, and dramatized when Marcus hears "footsteps on metal, the distant clang of lunch pails, voices discussing production quotas." It reappears at closure when "the tunnel filled with the sound of a shift change, workers finally clocking out." The concept shapes Marcus's interpretive stakes and supplies the thematic repricing. However, the ghost shift functions more as atmospheric metaphor than tactical constraint—Marcus observes it rather than negotiating with it, keeping it shy of indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Marcus's "religiously skeptical" stance is stated once in his reframing of the ghost shift as "psychic impressions" rather than supernatural. The label clarifies his interpretive lens but does not constrain an on-page choice with visible cost—he could reach the same documentary conclusion without this trait. No beat shows him rejecting a supernatural explanation under pressure or paying a price for skepticism, leaving the attribute functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Appraise" appears explicitly when Marcus "learned to appraise the mill's mysteries through these frantic calls" and implicitly throughout as he maps confessions to architecture and photographs valve wheels. The action frames his method across multiple beats and culminates in "his documentation complete." However, the specific verb "appraise" (evaluate worth/quality) could swap for "decode," "map," or "interpret" with minimal narrative impact, as the story's turns depend on the mapping activity rather than the appraisal frame itself.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The method is signaled in paragraph two ("Marcus had learned to appraise the mill's mysteries through these frantic calls"), demonstrated when he "leaned closer to his phone" during the Tommy Reeves confession, and returns at closure when "Another caller, another confession" prompts his final understanding. The radio-psychic calls supply the evidence trail that enables his documentation and thematic repricing. The mechanics matter across three beats and shape his tactics, though the "interpreting" action itself is largely passive listening rather than active decoding with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The abandoned train tunnel is anchored early, provides the spatial path Marcus follows, supplies the valve wheels and acoustic environment for the ghost-shift sounds, and contains him during the key confession beat. The setting's darkness and dripping water modulate pressure, and the tunnel's connection to the rail line matters to the historical dumping. However, the tunnel functions more as evocative backdrop than active constraint—no choice hinges on tunnel-specific features (collapse risk, dead-end, flooded passage) that would make this exact setting indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "during the hush that follows a sudden confession" appears at the structural midpoint when the caller's line goes dead and Marcus sees the moving shadows. That beat crystallizes his interpretive leap and leads to the valve-turning sequence. The hush creates a brief window of heightened perception. However, the story spans five nights of listening and one tunnel descent; the "hush" moment, while vivid, occupies only one paragraph and does not tighten later tactics or impose a countdown, keeping it shapely but not structurally indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The motivation "to find the weight of a swallowed truth" is stated late (final third: "he'd found what he came for: the weight of a swallowed truth") and implied throughout Marcus's five nights of call-listening and tunnel mapping. It drives his documentation goal and supplies the thematic frame for closure. However, the phrase appears more as thematic summary than dramatized want-versus-cost friction—Marcus pursues the mystery methodically without visible sacrifice, internal conflict, or competing desire, keeping the motivation present but not充电d with struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Drowsy alertness" is named twice (opening: "he felt the drowsy alertness that came from three consecutive nights chasing rumors"; late: "The tunnel's air grew thick with drowsy alertness") and modulates the liminal atmosphere when Marcus perceives the ghost shift. The tone charges the in-between state where "truth becomes visible" and supports the accumulative, dream-logic design. However, the exact phrase recurs without evolution, and surrounding paragraphs shift into straightforward thriller clarity, so the tone threads through rather than governing every turn, keeping it shapely but not indispensable to the final image.</comment>
