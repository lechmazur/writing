<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The artist's interiority shows some embodied emotion ("hollowed, scraped clean of purpose") and the decision to complete the card spiral under physical threat demonstrates agency under pressure. However, the central transformation—from painting rejected portraits to "portraits of the spaces between"—arrives as an epiphanic leap rather than through contradictory impulses acting in scene. The backstory about rejected commissions establishes motive but remains expository; micro-choices during the card arrangement lack visible internal friction or cost that would earn the shift.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The story teaches its pattern early (fragmented reality, splintered objects, geometric shards) and closure lands as Conceptual Repricing: the final realization that "fragmentation was the human condition" reweights the premise with conceptual cost (she must abandon direct portraiture). Orientation anchors (lighthouse library, seventeen flights, artist fleeing rejection) arrive cleanly within the first ~100 words. One meaningful deepening occurs when the walls contract in response to card placement, tightening pressure until the pattern completes and "the walls reversed." The cost is legible in her empty hands and the redesigned vision, though the mechanism—why completing the spiral stops the contraction—remains more asserted than causally motivated.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The circular lighthouse library with contracting walls functions as micro-setting that constrains choice: the room physically compresses as she works, creating spatial urgency that charges the card-laying sequence. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (salt-crusted windows, beam rotation, book spines forming impossible geometry) and filtered through the artist's perception. The spiral card pattern on the dusty table becomes a spatial anchor for the climax, and the beam "carving through" the completed mandala charges the final image with light/shadow interplay that mirrors the thematic negotiation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (artist seeking purpose after serial rejection) is signaled early and tightens when the walls begin contracting, forcing a decision under physical threat. The escalation is driven by her agency—each card placement accelerates the room's compression—creating a meaningful pressure point. However, the resolution mechanism (completing the spiral stops the walls and grants "authentic sight") feels more symbolic than tactically earned; the stakes shift from survival to epistemological insight without a visible tradeoff. The cost is felt in her empty hands and abandoned medium, meeting the Accumulative lens requirement, though the causal link between spiral completion and wall reversal remains thin.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—that fragmentation is the authentic human structure, not an aberration—emerges through concrete particulars (rejected shadow-portraits, broken box, contracting geometry) rather than abstraction. The final image offers a resonant answer: she will paint "spaces between" rather than people, a non-literal response to the opening question about mirrors and truth. The burning cards imprinting on her vision is a strong thematic closure. Minor penalty: "luminescent ache" appears three times, the final instance ("luminescent ache made visible") edging toward self-conscious poetics that slightly undercuts the earned resonance.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable with a distinct perceptual signature (artist's eye for geometry, light, composition). The rhetorical questions function as stylized interiority consistent with someone interrogating their artistic crisis. Voice modulates appropriately under pressure (shorter syntax as walls contract). Two frictions: filter verbs occasionally dull immediacy ("She understood now," "she saw it whole") when unmediated perception would sharpen the beat, and the elevated register ("transmuted into divination," "architecture of authentic sight") sometimes drifts beyond the POV's established idiom during peak pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is generally controlled with purposeful rhythm and vivid imagery ("hinges splintered like driftwood," "books pressed closer... geometry that shouldn't exist"). Information density is high; most lines advance atmosphere or pressure. However, several paraphrase loops appear: the walls contracting is stated three separate times in near-synonym variants ("pressed closer," "contract further," "compressed further, now barely ten feet across"), and "fragmented reality" is restated as "reality itself had cracked," "fragmentation was the human condition," and "fragmented reality showed its honest face." Figurative density in the climax passage (luminescent, spiral tightening, mandala, blazed, gentle impossible flame) approaches overwriting without a taught pattern to justify the accumulation. These loops and density clusters appear in non-closure beats, so the −0.8 non-closure accumulation cap applies.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—artist whose truthful portraits are rejected finds tarot cards depicting those subjects in a contracting lighthouse—offers a fresh synthesis of creative crisis and spatial threat. The transformation from portraitist to painter of negative space is a non-obvious thematic pivot. However, the "artist whose work reveals uncomfortable truths" core is a familiar template, and the piece does not fully transform it through occupational specificity (no mention of technique, materials, or the actual practice of painting) or concrete lived detail that would make this artist's crisis irreplaceable. The lighthouse-as-threshold and contracting-walls mechanism feel more symbolic convenience than integrated world logic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The crestfallen portrait artist is present throughout (setup), chooses to lay out the cards under pressure (development), and her transformation shapes the ending (payoff). Her rejection crisis drives the inciting climb and her decision to complete the spiral despite contracting walls is a key turn. However, passivity predominates: she "discovered," "felt," "understood," "saw"; the major revelation arrives to her rather than through an active choice with visible friction. The transformation to painting "spaces between" is declared in the final descent rather than tested on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The broken tarot card box appears in the opening beat (setup), its warmth and break lines are handled mid-story ("traced the cracked box, following its break lines like reading palms"), and it is left glowing at the end (payoff). Its splintered state mirrors the fragmentation theme and the cards it contained drive the spiral arrangement that resolves the crisis. Strong causal involvement across three beats and closure linkage. Minor friction: the box itself becomes passive after spilling the cards; the cards do the work while the box recedes to symbolic backdrop.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Fragmented reality is signaled early ("reality itself had cracked along invisible fault lines"), shapes the room's impossible geometry that forces the climax, and is explicitly repriced in the resolution ("reality wasn't fragmenting—she was seeing its true structure"). The concept constrains her tactics (must arrange fragments into pattern) and redefines her artistic mission (paint the gaps). It appears in stakes, action, and thematic closure with high specificity. Strong integration across all three gates with causal and conceptual pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Three rhetorical questions appear on the page, all in the artist's voice, establishing a pattern of self-interrogation that fits her crisis. They bracket key beats: opening ("Why do mirrors lie?"), middle ("What questions am I supposed to answer?"), and near-climax ("Isn't art supposed to comfort?"). However, they function more as stylistic texture than constraint; removing them would not alter her choices or the outcome. They characterize her reflective mode but do not enable or block action with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The action "redesign" appears explicitly ("redesign their scattered chaos into meaning," "her vision had been redesigned") and the card-arrangement sequence is the climactic turn that stops the walls and unlocks her new sight. Early setup (she "began laying out the cards"), development (each placement contracts the room further, raising stakes), and payoff (completion triggers wall reversal and burning truth-imprint). The spiral mandala is the mechanism of closure. Strong causal role, though the why of the redesign's power remains more symbolic than procedurally legible.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The method "by untangling threads" appears once in a single sentence ("Her fingers moved by untangling threads—not physical ones, but the narrative strands connecting each card to its subject..."). It is asserted at the climax but not demonstrated through prior attempts or mechanics; we see card placement but not the untangling process itself. The phrase arrives late (final third) and reads more as metaphorical summary than a technique that shaped her tactics. Functional mention without causal development.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The forgotten library inside a lighthouse is anchored in the opening (setup), supplies the contracting walls that force the climax (development), and houses the glowing aftermath (payoff). The circular room's geometry and the lighthouse beam's rotation are active elements: the beam "carved through" the spiral at the resolution, and the walls' contraction directly escalates pressure. The seventeen-flight climb and salt-crusted windows add specificity. The setting constrains choice (nowhere to flee), supplies resources (the cards, the table), and charges the final image (light/shadow negotiation). High integration across all beats with irreplaceable spatial logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"When the walls close in" is signaled as both literal and metaphorical timeframe. The walls begin contracting after card placement starts, accelerate ("contracted another foot," "now barely ten feet across"), and stop "trembling at the edge of crushing her" when the pattern completes, creating a live spatial clock. The grandmother's saying establishes the phrase early. However, elapsed time remains vague (no sense of minutes or urgency beyond spatial compression), and the timeframe is spatial proxy rather than temporal pressure. Two gates (setup via grandmother, payoff when walls stop) with moderate causal involvement.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The motivation "to descend into necessary darkness" is stated explicitly mid-story ("This wasn't punishment—it was invitation. To descend into necessary darkness meant accepting..."). It characterizes her final understanding and the downward journey at dawn, but it is not established as a conflicted want earlier; she climbs seeking "refuge," and the descent-as-acceptance arrives as insight rather than a friction between competing desires. The phrase appears late (second half) and functions more as thematic gloss than a motive tested through choices with visible cost. Told rather than dramatized through want/fear tension.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Luminescent ache" appears in the opening paragraph and twice in the climax/resolution ("heart luminescent with terrible understanding," "luminescent ache made visible"), creating a clear tonal through-line. The phrase is unusual and specific, charging the emotional register with a blend of pain and illumination that fits the light/darkness negotiation. Tone modulates with pressure (shorter syntax during contraction) while maintaining the ache-and-light texture. The final image (truths "imprinted on her retinas, her fingertips, her understanding") sustains the tone's embodied, visual-emotional fusion. Strong coherence and closure linkage.</comment>
