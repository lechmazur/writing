<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Miren's professional expertise is embodied through tool handling and repair decisions. Her motivation—learning repair rhythm—is dramatized through the gear-selection sequence and the acceptance of imperfection at closure. Internal contradiction emerges in her choice of an irregular meteor gear, accepting "imperfect" over "perfect" with visible cost to world stability. The reflection on her grandmother and the broader meditation on beauty-in-fracture risks lengthening without adding new pressure, but micro-choices (heating the pick, filing the gear) keep interiority anchored.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a situational accent—pressure builds through layered images (frozen books, infinite mirrors, rusted gears) and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration when the mechanism resumes with syncopated rhythm. Orientation anchors (library, dawn, fifth eclipse) land early. The closure—accepting imperfect repair as beauty—lands on the page with conceptual cost (world mechanisms remain fragile, other eclipses will come). One tightening: the discovery of the missing third gear forces improvisation. Causality is clean; the prophecy scraps motivate descent, the gears' condition dictates repair sequence, and the final turn reweights "perfection."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The frozen library, spiral stairs, and Hall of Mirrors constrain movement and frame choices (Miren must descend, work between mirrors). The toolkit—meteor gears, heated pick—functions as micro-setting that enables the repair. Sensory specificity (ice reflecting ice, orange rust, brass clasp click) is selective and POV-filtered. The final image of ocean waves "like gear teeth meshing with the sky" charges closure by extending the repair motif into the world. No occupation-depth penalty at this length; "lunar-eclipse locksmith" and "temporal mechanic" are plausible within the established fantasy frame.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: restore celestial rhythm before fractures worsen. One meaningful tightening when the third gear is missing, forcing improvisation with the Perseids gear. Agency is clear—Miren selects, files, and fits the irregular gear, accepting syncopation over perfection. The cost is conceptual and legible: "rhythm was imperfect, slightly syncopated, but alive," foreclosing ideal repair and leaving future eclipses vulnerable. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens; each rusted gear and the warped housing escalate difficulty. No antagonist required; the mechanism's decay supplies resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme—beauty and function through fracture, repair as translation—emerges from concrete actions (filing the meteor gear, accepting syncopation) and images (driftwood, infinite reflections, gear teeth/ocean waves). The prophecy scraps promise "someone would remember how to listen," paid off when Miren matches "broken rhythms with patient hands." The final image reweights prior material: imperfect repair as viable answer, "time, like moonlight, could be coaxed back into beauty." No overt moralizing; the ending trusts image and earned consequence. Subtext operates in silence (mechanism's "steady tick") and implication (other mechanisms wait, carrying forward fragility).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with consistent perceptual signature: Miren notices "gear teeth meshing," "orange moss" rust, mechanical particulars. Diction remains controlled—"temporal mechanic," "clockmaker's gear assortment"—without register drift. Interiority anchors in present stimuli (frosted window, toolkit clasp). No dialogue; no penalty. Rhythm modulates: longer lyric passages during descent and reflection, shorter beats during gear work ("The first gear slipped into place with a satisfying click"). One minor template risk in "She'd come to learn" construction, but voice texture—specific metaphors (driftwood, shed skin), technical vocabulary—holds distinctly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance setting, action, or theme. Figurative language is purposeful and coherent: "shed skin" for prophecy, "orange moss" for rust, "gear teeth meshing with the sky." Sentence rhythm varies (short action beats, longer descriptive passages). Minor paraphrase risk in the driftwood/beauty-in-decay passage, where "beautiful in its decay" slightly echoes prior "bleached by time and circumstance," but the restatement adds thematic weight rather than looping. No filter-verb stacks or template cadence runs in high-pressure beats. Proofreading clean; no pronoun drift or tense inconsistency.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Lunar-eclipse locksmith" and celestial-mechanism repair offer a specific, non-obvious synthesis. The Hall of Mirrors as repair site and the meteor-gear toolkit are fresh particulars. Emotional truth—accepting imperfection, carrying forward fragility—avoids template resolution. Risk: the driftwood metaphor and "beauty in decay" theme echo familiar lyric territory without fully transforming it; the final ocean/gear-teeth image is vivid but borders on expected poetic closure. The piece commits fully to its premise and follows implications (other eclipses will come, rhythm remains imperfect), lifting it above median derivative work.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Miren appears in setup (opening paragraph), drives all middle beats (descent, diagnosis, gear selection, filing, installation), and her acceptance of imperfection ("perhaps perfection wasn't the point") crystallizes at closure. Her choices—heating the pick, filing the Perseids gear, fitting the irregular piece—create the key turn. Early signal, causal pressure across beats, closure linkage, and irreplaceability all present.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Toolkit uncapped early ("Miren uncapped her toolkit, the brass clasp clicking"). Used in three distinct beats: gear selection, heating the pick, filing the Perseids gear. The meteor-origin detail ("cut from fallen meteors, their metal remembering the vacuum of space") constrains choice—only these gears can serve. Returns at closure when Miren packs tools and commits to future repairs. Causal pressure, closure linkage, and specificity all strong.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Hall of Mirrors is the descent destination (middle), houses the master mechanism (stakes object), and creates "infinite recession" that frames the repair work. The mirrors reflect infinite Mirens during installation, charging the moment. Present at closure indirectly (mechanism continues its "infinite watch"). Constrains spatial movement and intensifies the repair's symbolic weight. Setup, development, and payoff gates met; causal pressure moderate (location matters but could be another mystical chamber).</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Hauntingly bright" describes the mechanism's glow in two beats: initial discovery ("hauntingly bright against the dimness") and intensification after repair ("hauntingly bright glow intensified"). The trait signals the mechanism's vitality and lunar connection, enabling Miren to locate it. Cost is indirect—brightness confirms success but also underscores fragility. Setup and payoff present; middle use is descriptive rather than action-constraining. Moderate causal role.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Uncap" occurs early ("Miren uncapped her toolkit") and initiates the repair sequence. The act is brief but pivotal—without opening the toolkit, no gear selection or filing follows. Swappability risk (could be "opened"), but "uncap" paired with "brass clasp clicking" adds specific embodiment. Present in setup, drives middle action, implicit at closure when toolkit is packed. Functional across beats but not maximally irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Prophecy scraps appear in setup ("scraps of prophecy hidden in a library's corner") and motivate Miren's investigation ("she'd been piecing together why the eclipses multiplied"). The method constrains her path—scraps "pointed here: to the Hall of Mirrors." Not revisited at closure; mechanics remain abstract (margin notes, star-chart corrections). Setup and development gates met; closure participation absent. Functional but secondary to toolkit and gears.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Frozen library frames all action: ice-hewn shelves, crystallized books, frosted window (setup), spiral stairs and Hall of Mirrors (middle), final exit to clouds/oceans (closure). The setting pressures choices—books too frozen to turn, mirrors create infinite recession, architecture provides descent path. Cloudbank position ("suspended between cloudbanks," "clouds below parted") charges the ending image. Setup, development, payoff all strong; causal pressure moderate (repair could occur elsewhere, but verticality and suspension add thematic weight).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Soft hush of a distant morning" appears once in setup, establishing atmosphere. Time is tracked loosely—dawn arrives, eclipse completes retreat—but does not tighten tactics. No clock pressure during repair sequence; Miren works without urgency. Closure references "morning" again when she steps outside. Present at setup and payoff but does not constrain middle action. Ornamental more than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"To learn the rhythm of repair" is stated explicitly ("She'd come to learn the rhythm of repair") and dramatized through gear selection, filing, and acceptance of syncopation. Motivation drives all middle action and culminates in "perhaps perfection wasn't the point." Internal friction emerges between ideal repair (perfect gear) and available means (irregular Perseids gear). Cost visible: she accepts imperfection. Setup, development, closure all engaged; causal pressure strong.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Driftwood nostalgia" (established via "reminded her of driftwood—something once vital, now bleached by time and circumstance, beautiful in its decay") is coherent through turns: melancholy at library's decline, acceptance of mechanism's imperfection, bittersweet closure ("time, like moonlight, could be coaxed back into beauty"). Tone modulates with pressure—lyric during descent, focused during repair, expansive at ending—without breaking. Charges final image (ocean waves, carrying tools forward). Setup, development, payoff all present.</comment>
