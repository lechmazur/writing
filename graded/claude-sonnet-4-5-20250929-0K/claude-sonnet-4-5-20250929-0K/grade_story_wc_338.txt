<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maren's interior work is concrete and embodied through her methodical cataloging, perceptive eye, and hands-on fresco examination. The protagonist's motivation—interpreting silence with empathy—drives choices with visible cost (leaving vault doors open, committing to step through the unknown), and her shift from preservation to active inquiry is earned. Minor weakness: internal contradiction could be sharper; her "shielded openness" is told more than dramatized in micro-choices under pressure. No therapy-speak, and the final renunciation (opening doors, stepping into the gap) forecloses the path of sealed preservation with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (Maren, vault, rain, cataloging work) within the opening lines. The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: pressure builds through discovery of the shifted stone, recognition of the question-mark cracks, and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Maren leaves doors open and commits to the unknown, reweighting her stance from preserver to interpreter with visible cost (abandoning sealed certainty). The closure lands on the page with conceptual and opportunity cost: she steps away from the safety of locked documentation toward an unanswered question. One meaningful deepening (realizing the vault asks rather than declares) tightens stakes and alters her trajectory under the chosen lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The rain-scoured vault is vividly anchored with selective, purposeful detail (curved ceiling, echoing drops, faded fresco, southern wall collapse). The fresco and its shifted stone constrain Maren's choices and charge the final image—she must physically return to the henge gap. Sensory hierarchy reflects professional priorities (ochre, ash, fresco quadrants, fine cracks). Micro-setting qualifies: the vault's architecture and the fresco itself function as both object and setting, driving discovery and the closure decision. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>One dominant stake (interpreting the vault's silence/whispered question) is signaled early and coheres throughout. Pressure tightens through discovery (shifted stone), deepens with recognition (cracks form a question mark), and culminates in a credible tightening: Maren must abandon sealed preservation and step into the unknown gap. The protagonist's agency drives escalation—her choice to reopen, compare footage, measure angles, and finally leave doors open forecloses the prior path with visible cost (risk, uncertainty, professional vulnerability). One meaningful pressure point alters tactics and options under the Accumulative lens; coincidence does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: silence as language, maps that tear between known/unknown, questions rather than answers. The vault-as-asking rather than cursed is earned through Maren's concrete observation (shifted stone, question-mark cracks) and her disciplined interpretation. The final image—stepping through the torn map into the gap—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. Subtext operates in gesture and implication ("shielded openness," leaving doors open). One potential slip: "methodically marking where knowledge ended and mystery began" edges toward abstraction, but the fresco work and henge gap anchor it in specifics. No Thematic Echo penalties; prompt language is dramatized, not restated.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable and clean; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct and professional: Maren notices angles, fault lines, cartographic tears, cross-references survey maps. Diction is controlled and purposeful, balancing technical precision with atmospheric texture. Psychic distance modulates intentionally (zooming into fresco quadrant, tracing cracks with her finger). Filter verbs are minimal and voice-motivated. One minor register drift: "shielded openness that had served her well in delicate restoration work" feels slightly expository, but the phrase is brief and does not recur. Prose rhythm reflects the character's methodical mind without becoming mechanical.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; opening anchors voice and stakes cleanly. Information density is high—most lines advance discovery, atmosphere, or stakes without padding. No paraphrase loops or template cadence runs detected. Minor scaffold: "She understood then what the vault was trying to show her" slightly tells what the following lines dramatize, and "Some silences, she now understood, weren't meant to be preserved behind locked doors" edges toward thematic summary. These slip into expository territory but do not obscure causality or dull the closure beat. Figurative language (rain as whispered prayers, map tearing, question mark in cracks) is purposeful and coherent. No filter-verb stacks or mixed metaphors in peak beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The premise—comparing silent archival footage across decades to detect a self-updating fresco—offers a fresh synthesis of detective work, cartography, and the supernatural. The vault-as-questioner rather than haunted/cursed transforms a familiar trope. Specific professional detail (cataloging methods, survey maps, angle measurement) grounds the concept. The turn from preservation to interpretation and the commitment to step into the unknown gap feel inevitable in hindsight, earned by Maren's methodical curiosity and the vault's concrete evidence. Mild derivative risk (archaeological mystery + supernatural map), but the specificity of the method (silent video comparison, shifted fresco stone, question-mark cracks) and the emotional calculus (empathy over fear, openness over sealing) lift it above template. No close echoes of famous lines detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's perceptive framing is present from the opening (cataloging, framing fragments, trained cartographic eye). Her observation of the shifted stone and question-mark cracks drives key turns: realizing the fresco updates itself, understanding it asks rather than declares, and deciding to leave doors open and return to the henge gap. Her choices alter tactics and foreclose the prior path (sealed preservation). Present in setup, middle discovery beats, and closure decision. Causal pressure is clear; the final choice traces directly to her perceptive work. Strong integration, though her profession is established more than the attribute "perceptive map framer" is tested under stress.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ancient henge is signaled early (opening fresco image), reappears in the shifted stone discovery, and is reweighted at closure when Maren commits to standing in the missing-stone gap. The henge's physical absence (the torn gap) and its painted representation (the rotated stone pointing to that gap) constrain her final choice and charge the ending image. Three distinct beats: initial fresco description, cross-reference with survey maps, and closure commitment to visit the gap. Causal pressure is strong—the henge's missing stone becomes the story's central mystery and Maren's destination. Cost linkage: her decision to step through the unknown is tied to the henge gap.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The whispered chapel (vault as a place of whispered devotion, silence as language) shapes stakes and atmosphere throughout. The vault's silence and its history of whispers frame Maren's interpretive goal and her realization that silence is a question. The concept constrains her method (patient translation) and enables the closure choice (leaving doors open, interpreting rather than sealing). Present in setup (chapel whispers, rumor), middle (silence as language requiring translation), and payoff (vault asking, not declaring). Moderate causal pressure—more thematic anchor than tactical constraint, but it reweights her final stance. Could score higher if the chapel's "whispered" quality imposed a visible cost or forced a trade-off on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Methodically curious" is signaled early (three years cataloging, careful equipment setup, precise angle measurement) and enables key actions: systematic comparison of footage, zooming into the fresco quadrant, measuring the stone's rotation, cross-referencing survey maps. The trait constrains her approach (patience, thoroughness) and shapes the discovery beats. Present in setup, middle, and implied in the closure commitment to further investigation. Minor friction: the label "methodically curious" is not explicitly tested against an opposing pressure (e.g., urgency vs. patience); the trait enables without visible trade-off on the page. Functional but one step shy of indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Reopen" is the story's inciting action and central conceit: Maren is here "to reopen what everyone else had sealed shut." This choice drives the entire narrative—without reopening the vault, no discovery, no comparison, no realization, no closure. The action is signaled in the opening third, shapes the middle beats (unpacking equipment, comparing footage, examining the fresco), and culminates in leaving the vault doors open at the end—a literal and symbolic continuation of reopening. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. The element is irreplaceable; swapping "reopen" for "visit" or "inspect" would fundamentally alter the story's stakes and meaning.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The method—comparing silent video footage from decades apart—is signaled early ("comparison method had come to her during a sleepless night") and its mechanics matter: two monitors, simultaneous playback, zooming into the eastern quadrant, measuring the shifted stone's angle. The method enables the key discovery (the rotated stone) and constrains Maren's tactics (systematic visual comparison, precise measurement). Present in setup (equipment, monitors), middle (zooming, measuring), and implicit in closure (her commitment to return is grounded in what the comparison revealed). High causal pressure and irreplaceability—without this specific method, the mystery remains unsolved. Minor gap: the 1987 footage's origin and Maren's access to it are not justified on the page.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The rain-scoured fresco vault provides the story's physical and conceptual arena. Rain echoes through the curved ceiling (opening line), the southern wall collapse is referenced, and the fresco itself is the site of discovery. The vault's sealed/reopened state shapes stakes and Maren's closure choice (leaving doors open). Spatial choreography is clean (northern wall fresco, eastern quadrant, southern wall damage). The environment constrains choices (sealed history, moisture threatening preservation) and charges the final image (open doors vs. locked preservation). Three gates met; strong causal and atmospheric pressure. Could score slightly higher if the vault's physical features (e.g., moisture, collapse risk) imposed a tactical cost during the discovery beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "at the spot where a map tears, dividing known from unknown" operates more as thematic framing than a tactical constraint. The phrase appears literally (fresco gaps, torn henge circle, the missing stone) and metaphorically (Maren's shift from known to unknown). It shapes the conceptual stakes and charges the closure image (stepping through the torn map). Present in setup (deteriorating map fragments), middle (gap in the henge circle), and payoff (stepping into the unknown gap). Moderate integration: the "tear" reweights meaning but does not tighten decisions on the page through a live clock or deadline. Swappable with "threshold" or "boundary" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Maren's desire to interpret silence with empathy is dramatized through her rejection of the curse narrative, her patient cataloging work, her methodical comparison method, and her realization that the vault asks rather than declares. The motivation is signaled early (she "knew better" than to accept the curse story) and drives the closure choice (leaving doors open, committing to answer the question). Present in setup, middle (empathy over fear, patience over haste), and payoff (answering with curiosity). Moderate friction: "shielded openness" and "empathy" are told more than tested against an opposing pressure. The motivation enables choices but does not face a visible on-page cost or trade-off that forces Maren to sacrifice an alternative want.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"Shielded openness" is named explicitly ("adopting the shielded openness that had served her well in delicate restoration work") and modulates through the narrative: Maren's guarded approach to the vault (methodical setup, careful measurement) balanced with her vulnerability to truly see (recognizing the question, leaving doors open). The tone is coherent and charges the final image (open doors, stepping into the unknown). Present in setup (careful unpacking), middle (guarded measurement, vulnerable recognition), and payoff (open stance). Moderate integration: the phrase "shielded openness" is told once and then enacted, but the tension between shielded and open is not dramatized through a visible choice where one costs the other. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>
