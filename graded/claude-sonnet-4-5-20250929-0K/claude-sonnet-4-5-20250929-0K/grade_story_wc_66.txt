<question>1</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Elena's motivation is clear and consistent—transcribing the broadcast to wake dormant stories in dust—but her interiority lacks embodied contradiction under pressure. The moment she touches the dust particles and "heard a voice...whispering a fragment" reads as straightforward discovery without internal conflict or cost. Her "smile" at the end and the declarative "she—diligent copyist, patient listener—had learned to read the language written in absence itself" tilts toward self-congratulatory summary rather than a difficult choice that forecloses a path. The decision to "distribute it sheet by sheet" is stated intent, not dramatized action with visible tradeoff.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who (Elena), where (ember alcove), and what (waiting for pirate broadcast) within the opening paragraphs. The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: the broadcast fragments accumulate, Elena decodes them, and the final image of luminous dust reconfigures the story famine premise. However, the closure moment—Elena smiling and beginning to transcribe the method—lands as a plan rather than a Decisive Change or Resonant Reconfiguration with felt cost on the page. The ending tells us "The story famine was ending" without showing a visible price paid or a path foreclosed; the cost remains conceptual and asserted rather than dramatized in the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The ember alcove, mist-pressed window, shortwave radio glow, and luminous dust particles create a coherent sensory environment filtered through Elena's professional focus. The mist beginning to glow and dust particles vibrating to the broadcast frequency constrain her discovery action. However, spatial choreography within the alcove remains generic—"held her breath," "stood, moving closer," "returned to her desk"—without tactile detail of how she navigates the space under pressure. The recurring ember/glow motif charges the final image of "dust dancing luminous around her head," elevating the score despite minimal room choreography.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The dominant stake—ending the story famine by decoding the pirate broadcast—is signaled early and remains coherent. One tightening occurs when Elena discovers the broadcast is "secretly luminous" and learns to translate the glowing patterns, narrowing her method. The final beat where she touches dust particles and they "split open like a seed" offering story fragments represents a reversal from passive listening to active method. However, this discovery arrives without visible cost or tradeoff; no option is foreclosed, no price paid. The escalation reads as problem-and-solution rather than pressure that forces difficult choice.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the premise that narratives can be preserved in physical particles and awakened through specific frequencies—a concrete metaphor for cultural memory and transmission. The pirate broadcast's instruction-as-song and Elena's role as translator/distributor integrate concept with action. However, the ending's direct thematic statement—"teaching dust its ancient purpose"—and the summary "The story famine was ending, one particle at a time" convert resonance into assertion. The final image of luminous dust dancing around her head offers visual charge, but the accompanying narration ("she...had learned to read the language written in absence itself") explains rather than implies.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and controlled throughout, with Elena's professional lens (copyist, notation) filtering perception. Diction stays consistent with her character—"measure of Brahms," "manuscript pages," "one careful notation at a time"—without register drift. However, peak moments rely on filter verbs and summary: "She understood her true purpose now" and "Elena believed those particles retained memory" tell rather than dramatize realization. The phrase "thistled calm" appears as narrator description rather than Elena's idiom. Perceptual signature is present but not distinct enough to feel indelible; the voice reads competent but not singular.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear with purposeful rhythm variation and selective sensory detail. The opening "fingers ached as she transcribed the final measure" and "mist pressed against the narrow window like a living thing" demonstrate strong concrete imagery. However, several template cadences and paraphrase loops appear: "Tonight, like most nights, she waited" immediately before "The pirate broadcast always came at odd hours"; "not quite peaceful, not quite dangerous" formula; and the final paragraph's repetitive "one [X] at a time" structure. The phrase "story-seeds sleep in the smallest grains" and "teach them the tongue of before" in the broadcast feel more like thematic placeholders than Elena's specific discovery. Stock metaphor "like smoke through fingers" and the closing "one careful notation at a time" echo the opening without reweighting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The premise of a "story famine" and narratives preserved in dust particles offers a fresh metaphorical frame, and the pirate broadcast as instruction-through-song is a non-obvious synthesis. However, the emotional arc—patient listener discovers method, will share knowledge to save city—follows a familiar savior-archetype template without transformation through specific cost or moral calculus. The "secretly luminous" attribute and dust-as-memory conceit are evocative but remain surface novelty; removing them and substituting a more conventional medium (books, recordings) would not fundamentally alter Elena's discovery-and-distribution arc. The piece commits to its premise but does not follow implications into difficult territory or earn its resolution through prior constraint.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>Elena as "diligent copyist" frames her professional skill and patience in the opening and closing beats. Her choice to "transcrib[e] not music but the process itself" and decision to "distribute it sheet by sheet" turn on her copyist identity. However, these choices are stated intentions rather than dramatized actions with visible cost; the story ends with her picking up her pen rather than showing the distribution or its friction. Present across setup, middle discovery, and ending plan, but the causal pressure is modest—her role could be replaced by "diligent scholar" or "patient researcher" without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The shortwave radio appears in the setup ("glowed amber"), middle ("radio crackled," voice emerged), and ending ("radio's glow intensified...then faded back"). The dial's amber glow creates a visual anchor and the radio's frequency-cloaking mechanics matter to the pirate's elusiveness. However, the radio functions primarily as a passive receiver; Elena does not manipulate the dial or adjust frequencies to solve a problem. The "glow intensified...as if acknowledging her understanding" anthropomorphizes it without her agency. Present across three beats with reweighted meaning at closure, but the object does not constrain a choice or enable a tactic under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The pirate broadcast drives the central mystery, provides the luminous fragments Elena decodes, and delivers the method "via elusive song lyrics" that she translates into instructions. It shapes her nightly waiting ritual, her discovery of luminosity, and her final transcription goal. The broadcast's cloaked transmission and refusal to be located by authorities establish stakes. The moment it "shifted" to a childhood melody and the dust began to glow marks the story's key turn. The concept appears in setup, middle discovery, and ending acknowledgment, and removing it would collapse the plot entirely.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Secretly luminous" defines the broadcast's core mystery and enables Elena's discovery method—she learns to see phosphorescent trails "in darkness" that reveal symbols to translate. This attribute is signaled in the setup ("discovered something the authorities hadn't"), demonstrated in the middle when she sees patterns, and paid off when "thousands of dust particles suspended in the air, each one luminescent" respond to the broadcast. However, the trait does not impose a visible cost or tradeoff; darkness is not shown to limit her other activities or force a difficult choice. The luminosity solves rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Cloak" appears once in "the signal cloaked itself in static and misdirection, never transmitting from the same place twice." This describes the broadcast's elusiveness but is not an action Elena or another character performs on the page. The pirate's self-cloaking prevents authorities from locating the source, establishing stakes, but Elena does not use cloaking to solve a problem or face a cost tied to it. The term functions as attributed property rather than a dramatized action with consequences. Present in setup only, no middle or closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Elusive song lyrics" are the pirate's primary method of instruction, signaled when Elena "kept it tuned to the empty spaces between stations, listening for what shouldn't be there." The broadcast's fragments—"dust remembers what fingers forget," "story-seeds sleep in the smallest grains"—are transcribed and decoded across the middle beats. Elena's realization that "the pirate broadcast had been teaching her the method all along, via those elusive song lyrics that seemed nonsensical until you understood they were instructions" articulates payoff. The lyrics shape her listening tactic, her translation work, and her final transcription goal. Mechanics matter throughout; removing this method would require a different discovery path entirely.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The "ember alcove tucked behind the concert hall" with "mist pressed against the narrow window" anchors Elena's workspace and creates atmospheric texture. The "embers in her small hearth pulsed in rhythm with the radio's signal," linking environment to the broadcast. However, the alcove does not constrain her choices—she could perform the same discovery in any quiet room with a radio. The setting provides mood ("thistled calm," "mist curling") but does not supply resources or obstacles that alter tactics. Present in setup and ending reprise, with one middle beat (embers pulsing), but the space remains postcard description rather than a micro-setting that pressures action.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"After the story famine—those three years when all the city's narratives dried up" establishes the inciting event and the urgency of Elena's work. The timeframe is referenced in setup, middle ("from before the famine"), and ending ("The story famine was ending"). However, the "after" framing does not create a ticking clock or tighten decisions within the present scene; Elena's nightly waiting is a ritual without immediate deadline pressure. The famine provides motive and stakes but does not track elapsed time or force a time-constrained choice on the page. Present across beats with thematic weight, but the temporal constraint is historical rather than active.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"To teach dust to tell stories" is articulated as Elena's "motivation, her calling" in the middle section and drives her final action: "transcribing not music but the process itself" to "distribute it sheet by sheet." The desire is consistent across setup (waiting for the broadcast), middle (decoding luminous patterns), and ending (writing the method). However, the motivation is declared rather than dramatized through conflicting wants or visible cost—Elena never hesitates, doubts, or sacrifices another goal to pursue this one. The friction between her stated purpose and any competing need or fear is absent. Desire shapes the arc but lacks embodied contradiction under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Thistled calm" appears once as descriptor: "the thistled calm that always accompanied these transmissions—not quite peaceful, not quite dangerous, but something thorned and delicate simultaneously." This phrase captures a mood of poised tension, but the tone does not modulate across the story's beats. The prose maintains a steady, lyrical register from the opening "fingers ached" through the discovery ("held her breath") to the ending smile without significant pressure-driven shifts. The tone supports the concept but remains static rather than charging the final image with a felt tonal reconfiguration. Present in setup and thematically consistent, but does not evolve to reflect escalation or closure cost.</comment>
