<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's sensory gift is embodied through concrete perception (temperature gradients, vibrations, taste of air molecules) and drives her actions. Internal contradiction appears when she weighs infinite variations against retrieving her sister, showing genuine ambiguity. The final choice to delay demonstrates renunciation with felt cost ("tasted like goodbye"), though the decision itself remains off-page. Mira's presence is filtered through sensory signature rather than direct interaction, maintaining POV discipline.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph. The lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: sensory details and parallel-universe layers build density until the sister's message crystallizes the stake. Closure operates as Charged Poise—Kael places the shard down and defers the choice, but the final image ("tasted like goodbye") reweights all prior material with undeniable emotional cost. The seventeen-minute hum provides rhythm but doesn't tighten options on the page; the escalation is contemplative deepening rather than causal narrowing.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The repair bay is anchored early with rust, ozone, metal ribs, and emergency lighting. The shard constrains the narrative by enabling perception of parallel worlds, and the eastern airlock serves as the charged site of Mira's disappearance. Sensory hierarchy reflects Kael's gift—she notices temperature gradients and molecular taste—creating a distinct perceptual filter. The workbench and shard's physical handling ground abstract concepts in tactile action.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—retrieve sister versus preserve infinite variations—is signaled by the three-cycle discovery and deepens through the convergence revelation. One meaningful tightening occurs when Mira explains the cascade risk, forcing Kael to weigh one universe against all others. The protagonist's agency is contemplative rather than decisive on the page; the cost is felt in the final image but the choice itself is deferred to "tomorrow," landing as Charged Poise rather than executed decision.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the shard's mechanics and the sister's sacrifice: love measured against existence, individual retrieval versus infinite variation. "Some truths, once discovered, demanded impossible choices" risks direct statement but is earned by prior imagery. The final line ("tasted like goodbye") offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The green shard shifts from key to burden across beats, charging the closure without symbolic convenience.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Kael throughout. Perceptual signature is distinct—sensory mapping vocabulary ("temperature gradients blooming like flowers," "taste of copper") stays consistent under pressure. Dialogue with Mira carries subtext (the static and distance underscore separation) and advances plot by revealing the convergence. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at peak moments. No head-hopping; Mira's form is filtered through Kael's sensation rather than accessed directly.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies naturally; no template cadence. Information density is high—most lines advance character, world rules, or emotional state. "Cathedral of metal ribs" and "translucent pages in an infinite book" are clear, purposeful metaphors. Minor scaffold appears in "This was her gift and her curse" (slightly generic framing) and "cyclically spontaneous as heartbeats that skip" (register wobble). The final paragraph's short declarations create effective cadence. Clarity and momentum hold throughout.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sensory cartographer + dimensional fold navigation offers a fresh synthesis of familiar SF tropes. The seventeen-minute rhythm and "weaving between worlds" through sensation rather than technology distinguishes the premise. Mira's distributed sacrifice across timelines to prevent collapse is non-obvious. The transformation test holds—swapping names would lose the sensory-mapping specificity. Risk-taking in the contemplative, open closure elevates without obscuring stakes.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's sensory mapping creates the discovery (shard wedged in dimensional folds), enables navigation between universes, and shapes the final choice to defer. Her ability appears in setup, drives the middle communion with Mira, and charges the ending when she catalogs "every detail, every possibility." The cost—sitting with impossible weight—traces directly to her perceptual gift.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The shard is handled in at least three beats: initial placement on workbench, the seventeen-minute hum cycle explanation, picking it up to bridge realities, and the deliberate final placement. It shifts from discovery to key to burden. Its hum constrains the narrative rhythm and its edges "bite her palm," grounding abstract mechanics in tactile cost. Closure hinges on her decision to set it down.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Weaving between worlds structures the entire plot: Kael's gift allows dimensional perception, the shard enables traversal, and the climax requires choosing between collapsing or preserving parallel timelines. The concept shapes tactics (when to use the shard, how to reach Mira) and the central dilemma. Removal would eliminate both the sister's sacrifice logic and Kael's impossible choice.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Cyclically spontaneous" is present in the seventeen-minute hum pattern, which provides rhythm and frames when Kael can access other universes. The pattern enables her navigation attempts and creates a constraint (must wait for the cycle). However, the spontaneity aspect—unpredictability within the cycle—doesn't visibly alter tactics; the specifics remain reliable rather than uncertain, limiting the trait's friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Mira's act of redirecting the convergence is the inciting absence (seven years ago) and the revealed climax. The redirect explains her disappearance, creates the distributed-across-universes state, and presents Kael's impossible choice. Every major turn traces to this action: the shard's existence, the parallel-universe access, and the love-versus-existence dilemma. Removal collapses the plot.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Navigation through parallel universes is signaled early (dimensional folds, translucent pages metaphor) and its mechanics—sensory layering, tasting/hearing across realities—shape Kael's attempts to reach Mira. The method's cost (concentration, the seventeen-minute wait) and its limits (Mira flickers, distance persists) pressure the middle and ending. Removal would strip the story's core mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The abandoned repair bay anchors setup with rust, ozone, and emergency lighting. The eastern airlock is the charged site of Mira's vanishing and the communion location. The workbench holds the shard, grounding abstract mechanics. The bay's abandonment contrasts with alternate-universe activity, reinforcing the parallel-worlds premise. Micro-setting (shard on bench, airlock threshold) alters tactical positioning across beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Murmur of half-remembered dreams" appears as a descriptor for parallel universes and frames their quality (translucent, layered, almost-recognized voices). It colors tone and imagery but doesn't function as a temporal constraint or clock. The seventeen-minute cycle provides actual time pressure; the dreamlike quality is atmospheric. The element shapes perception more than tactics, landing it in functional but replaceable range.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>Discovering the withheld truth—why Mira disappeared—drives Kael's three-cycle investigation and the climax communion. The motivation is dramatized through her sensory probing, the question "Why?", and Mira's revelation of the convergence sacrifice. The final weight ("love measured against existence itself") is the discovered truth's cost, directly shaping the deferred choice. Friction between wanting Mira back and preserving infinite lives is acute.</comment>
