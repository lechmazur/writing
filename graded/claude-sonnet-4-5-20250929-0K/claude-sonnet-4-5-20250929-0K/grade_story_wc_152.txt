<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mirelle's core motivation (listening to unheard stories) is well-established and her eccentric-embroiderer disguise creates consistent tactical choices. However, her competence feels unearned—three months of passive listening yields complete intelligence without visible struggle or error. The final prayer "Let someone understand" lands with appropriate vulnerability, but the journey there lacks the contradictory impulses or meaningful miscalculation that would elevate character work into the 8+ range. Internal conflict is more declared than dramatized in micro-choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Causal with strong accumulative texture. Orientation anchors cleanly (cobalt observatory, Mirelle, autumn, pre-coup timeframe by paragraph three). The closure—Mirelle completing her embroidered intelligence report and delivering it to Tomas—constitutes a Decisive Change with felt cost (she abandons safety, trusts one ally, whispers a prayer of uncertainty). The escalation from observation to decipherment to physical delivery is motivated. Deduction: the conspiracy's mechanics (eternal flame as carrier signal, three factions, Archive Vault target) arrive via exposition rather than dramatized discovery, weakening causal texture in the middle third (−0.6).</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory, copper dome, bronze candle housing, and autumn wind establish vivid atmosphere. The eternal flame constrains Mirelle's decoding work and times military movements, participating in closure when it "brightened again as dawn passed." Spatial choreography (workstation, southern window, courtyard, library) tracks cleanly. However, much setting detail (tarnished dome, velvet, bronze housing) decorates without altering tactics. The observatory's professional systems (astronomical work, military occupation) remain generic; we never see how the space's actual function pressures her choices beyond providing cover.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: prevent conspirators from rewriting astronomical history by warning the right person before the coup. The eternal flame's morning flicker provides one meaningful tightening (confirming "today"), and the supply trucks' arrival escalates urgency. Yet Mirelle faces no tactical dilemma or visible tradeoff—she completes her embroidery, walks to the library, and knocks. No option is foreclosed with on-page cost; her prayer of uncertainty feels like atmospheric humility rather than earned doubt from a tested choice. Vas's approach creates momentary tension but dissolves without consequence.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of "wisdom disguised as foolishness" and "unheard stories trapped in echoed silence" emerges organically from Mirelle's methods and the eternal flame's secret carrier signal. The adjacent-possibilities embroidery—three branching futures—offers a non-literal thematic image. However, the final prayer "Let someone understand" edges toward stating the theme rather than embodying it, and the piece announces its own cleverness ("disguised wisdom as foolishness, people stopped asking dangerous questions"). The Archive Vault reveal (contradicting official cosmology) adds thematic weight but arrives via exposition in paragraph twelve, not dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mirelle's perceptual signature (listening, embroidering, playing roles) remains consistent and distinct. Free indirect style is clean; psychic distance stable. Commander Vas's brief dialogue ("Still playing with your stitchery, old woman?") and Mirelle's cackle show subtext and goal-driven performance. Prose texture fits the intelligence-gathering frame: "adjacent possibilities," "galaxy chart disguised as decorative nonsense," "echoed silence." Minor slip: "She had been listening for three months now, not to the stars but to the unheard stories trapped in echoed silence between official declarations" front-loads theme in narrator register rather than letting perception do the work (−0.2). No head-hopping; voice holds under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Information density is high; sentences advance character, world, or pressure. Rhythm varies purposefully. However, template artifacts cluster: "She had been listening...," "She pulled her needle through again...," "She set down...," "She returned...," "She embroidered..." (six consecutive paragraph openings with identical subject-verb stem in the middle section). "Echoed silence" recurs four times, tipping from motif into synonym loop. The phrase "adjacent possibilities" is used twice but never concretely defined, reading as clever placeholder. Figurative language ("autumn wind howled," "history prepared to bend") in the final beats feels elevated but earned. Deductions: template cadence −0.6, echo loop −0.4, total −1.0.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The embroidery-as-intelligence-report premise offers a fresh synthesis, and the eternal flame as encrypted carrier signal is inventive. However, the conspiracy-thriller frame (military factions, secret vault, coup timing) follows familiar scaffolding. Mirelle's method (listening, decoding, embroidering) is told more than shown; we never see her make a decoding choice or误判. The "three branching futures" and "adjacent possibilities" concepts are announced but not dramatized in action. Transformation test: swap embroidery for another covert recording method (coded music, false accounting ledgers) and the emotional arc remains unchanged, suggesting the freshness is more ornamental than structural.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mirelle appears in every beat, drives the observation-to-action arc, completes the embroidery, and chooses to deliver it to Tomas. Her decision to approach the library (final paragraph) alters tactics and forecloses safety. The "galaxy-chart embroiderer" identity is essential to her method and disguise, shaping multiple beats and the closure image ("clutched her embroidery closer"). Cost is present: she abandons passive observation and trusts one ally with visible vulnerability ("whispered her prayer").</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The eternal flame appears in four beats: initial mention (paragraph six), the dawn flicker discovery (paragraph eight), the escalation marker (paragraph ten: "The eternal flame dimmed. Dawn, precisely on schedule"), and closure (paragraph eighteen: "The eternal flame brightened again as dawn passed, its secret message complete"). It enables Mirelle's decoding (carrier signal for encrypted communications) and times the coup. However, the flame's mechanics are exposition-heavy; we never see Mirelle interact with it physically or make a choice because of it beyond confirming timing. Reweighted meaning at closure is present but subtle.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The conspiracy concept frames the entire narrative: Mirelle decodes factions (Korthan, Vas, nameless third), discovers the Archive Vault target, and acts to warn someone. It shapes her stakes (prevent rewriting of astronomical history) and tactics (covert embroidery, disguised wisdom). Present across setup, middle, and ending. However, the unraveling is told rather than dramatized—Mirelle's three months of listening yield complete understanding via summary. We never see her make a deduction, test a hypothesis, or recover from a misread. The concept drives plot but not on-page choices under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Disguises wisdom as foolishness" is introduced early (paragraph four: "Her reputation as the observatory's eccentric embroiderer protected her better than any armor"), demonstrated when Vas dismisses her work (paragraph three: "Madness"), and enables her covert recording. The trait constrains her method (must maintain the eccentric performance) and protects her from scrutiny. Cost is implied: she must endure condescension and isolation. However, the disguise faces no on-page test where it might fail or force a tradeoff; Vas walks away without suspicion, and no beat requires her to choose between dropping the act and preserving her work.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Synchronize" appears explicitly twice: the eternal flame is "synchronized to the planet's rotation" (paragraph six) and Mirelle "began working faster, synchronizing her stitches with the pattern she had slowly decoded" (paragraph twelve). The action connects her embroidery method to the flame's encrypted timing and shapes her final rush to complete the work. However, the mechanics of synchronization are vague—what does it mean to synchronize stitches with a decoded pattern? The action is central to her method but not irreplaceable; "decode and record" would function similarly. Present in middle and ending, but the causal role is atmospheric more than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Adjacent possibilities" is introduced in paragraph eleven ("charting what she called adjacent possibilities—the futures that might unfold depending on whose conspiracy succeeded") and referenced in the final third ("her embroidery contained a complete intelligence report" showing "three branching futures"). The method describes her embroidery's content but does not shape her on-page attempts or create a choice point. It could be replaced with "scenario mapping" or "contingency charting" without structural change. Late first appearance (beyond midpoint), summary-only use, and swappability all cap the score. Missing setup and development gates.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The cobalt observatory is present throughout: copper dome (opening line), workstation, southern window overlooking the courtyard (paragraph ten), corridors (paragraphs seventeen and nineteen), and astronomical library (final beat). The autumn wind bookends the piece and pressures the mood. The observatory's dual function (scientific autonomy vs. militarization) frames the political stakes, and the Archive Vault beneath it is the conspirators' true target. The setting enables Mirelle's cover (eccentric embroiderer among astronomers) and supplies the library as her delivery destination. However, the observatory's professional systems (telescopes, star charts, daily routines) remain generic; the space could be any infiltrated institution without breaking the plot.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Before the coup" is established in paragraph nine ("Today marked the final day before the coup") and tightens urgency when the eternal flame dims at dawn ("So it would be today," paragraph eleven) and supply trucks arrive (paragraph ten). The timeframe drives Mirelle's decision to complete and deliver her embroidery immediately rather than gather more intelligence. The coup functions as a live clock that narrows her window and forces the final move. Cost is present: she acts on incomplete certainty ("Let someone understand"). The temporal constraint is essential to escalation and closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>"To listen for unheard stories" is introduced in paragraph five ("She had been listening for three months now, not to the stars but to the unheard stories trapped in echoed silence between official declarations") and motivates her surveillance method. The desire recurs in the final line ("one old woman listening to the unheard stories written in flames and stars and the silent spaces between official truths"). However, the motivation is told more than dramatized in conflicted choices. We never see Mirelle weigh the cost of listening (isolation, risk) against stopping, nor does she face friction between her desire to understand and the pressure to act before understanding is complete. The motivation frames her work but does not create on-page struggle.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Echoed silence" recurs throughout: title concept, paragraph five ("unheard stories trapped in echoed silence"), paragraph nineteen ("echoed silence before it opened"), and the final line ("silent spaces between official truths"). The tone of quiet observation and withheld revelation is coherent and modulates with escalating urgency (Vas's footsteps, supply trucks, boots thundering). The autumn wind and cobalt-shadowed courtyard maintain atmospheric consistency. However, the tone risks sameness—emotional pressure remains meditative even during the climactic rush. The final image ("whispered her prayer") charges the silence but the modulation across beats is subtle rather than dynamic, fitting situational more than causal escalation.</comment>
