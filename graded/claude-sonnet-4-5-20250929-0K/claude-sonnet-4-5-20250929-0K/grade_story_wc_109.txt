<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The oracle's "obsession with endings" is told rather than embodied in contradictory choices under pressure. Her actions (arriving, reading silences, drawing the map) follow a smooth professional arc without internal friction or cost. The commander remains a receptacle for her wisdom rather than a character with competing motives. No micro-choices reveal a hierarchy of values with visible trade-offs on the page.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: the oracle arrives, catalogs three silences, and delivers a map-as-gift. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (the commander "beginning to understand" how to navigate by absence), but the cost remains conceptual and abstract rather than viscerally felt on the page. The final line "something like navigation began" gestures toward agency without demonstrating a foreclosed path or visible price. Orientation is clean; the lens holds.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The storm-tossed ridge fort, sodden robes, and flaking booklet anchor place and texture early. The fort's "ambered hush" and "marbled quiet" recur to establish tone, but the setting does not constrain a tactical choice or alter the oracle's options. The final darkness is atmospheric rather than a lived spatial pressure that forces adaptation on the page.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake (mapping the endless night) is signaled early and drives the oracle's gift. However, the story lacks a meaningful tightening or reversal that narrows options; the oracle arrives competent and remains so. The commander's transition from doubt to understanding is told ("beginning to understand") rather than dramatized through a visible cost or foreclosed alternative. Pressure accumulates texturally but does not escalate causally.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme (navigation by absence, silence as landmark) emerges organically from the oracle's method and the fort's crisis. The map made of absences is a strong non-literal answer to the central question. The final image ("when you're ready to speak again, you'll know the night has ended") reweights prior material without overt moralizing. However, the conceptual elegance slightly outpaces the on-page emotional stakes, keeping the resonance more cerebral than felt.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on the commander with brief oracle-focused passages. The oracle's voice ("I will retell it, but by summarizing silence") carries a distinct idiom. Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven; the commander's sparse lines reveal his need without exposition. Psychic distance is controlled, though the oracle's interiority remains largely opaque, which reads intentional given her role.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully, and the prose is largely clean. However, several phrases drift toward elevated register without clear POV motivation: "relief marbled with doubt," "topology of hope deferred," "ambered hush...marbled quiet" recur as decorative motifs rather than functional pressure. The phrase "ambered hush" and its synonym "marbled quiet" form a paraphrase loop across paragraphs. Template cadence appears in the three-silence catalog structure without variation in syntax. These patterns accumulate to −0.8 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The premise (oracle who reads silences, map of absence) offers a fresh synthesis of familiar oracular material. The three-silence structure and the silence-as-landmark conceit are specific and non-obvious. However, the execution leans on the concept's elegance rather than transforming it through character friction or an earned turn. The oracle arrives competent and departs unchanged; the synthesis feels intellectual rather than inevitable in hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The pebble-shore oracle is present throughout and drives the central action (interpreting silences, drawing the map). She appears early, constrains the middle beat (explaining the three silences), and delivers the closure gift. However, her choices are professional competencies rather than decisions under friction; she never faces a cost or trade-off tied to her role. Her obsession with endings is told but does not narrow her options on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The flaking gold leaf booklet appears in the opening (guards recognize it), is set down on the table, opened to reveal sparse notations, and closed before the oracle departs. It recurs across three beats and its contents (catalogues of silence) matter to the method. However, it remains a static prop; its flaking is decorative rather than a constraint, and it does not return with reweighted meaning at closure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Ambered hush" and its synonym "marbled quiet" appear as atmospheric descriptors but do not shape stakes or tactics. The hush is a consequence of catastrophe rather than a constraint the characters navigate against. It deepens tone but remains ornamental; the story would function identically if the fort were simply "silent."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Mildly obsessed with endings" is introduced early and motivates the oracle's professional focus (seeking conclusions, the final breath). However, it functions as a character label rather than a trait that constrains an on-page choice or imposes a visible trade-off. It colors her worldview but does not alter tactics or generate friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Retell" is signaled early ("I will retell it"), shapes the middle beat (the oracle recounts the three silences), and enables the map-drawing at closure. The action is specific to the oracle's method and irreplaceable; the story hinges on her capacity to retell by summarizing silence. However, the retelling itself is smooth narration without a reversal or complication tied to the act.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"By summarizing silence" is announced early ("I will retell it, but by summarizing silence"), demonstrated in the three-silence catalog, and enables the final map of absences. The method is specific and mechanically integrated; the oracle's booklet of "notations of what went unsaid" makes the method concrete. It shapes the middle beat and charges the closure. However, the method does not encounter resistance or impose a cost on the oracle.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The storm-tossed ridge fort is introduced early, provides spatial grounding (gates, corridors, map room), and houses the action. The fort's isolation and the drowned roads establish why the map is needed. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters the outcome; it functions as backdrop rather than active pressure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The timeframe ("when only one star remains") is established in the opening line, recurs at closure ("the last star guttered and went dark"), and brackets the narrative. The dimming star creates urgency and charges the final image of darkness. However, time does not tighten decisions; the oracle's arrival and gift proceed without a deadline that alters her tactics.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The commander's need ("Can you map it? Can you show us where to go when the darkness is complete?") is dramatized in dialogue and drives the request. The oracle fulfills this desire by drawing the map. However, the motivation remains told rather than tested; the commander does not face a trade-off or friction between this want and a competing fear or cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Marbled hush" (and its near-synonym "ambered hush") recurs across opening, middle, and closure to establish tone. The tone modulates subtly (from "ambered" to "marbled" to "total") as darkness deepens. It coheres through the narrative arc and charges the final image of "new darkness." However, the tone remains static rather than shifting under pressure; it is maintained rather than transformed by events.</comment>
