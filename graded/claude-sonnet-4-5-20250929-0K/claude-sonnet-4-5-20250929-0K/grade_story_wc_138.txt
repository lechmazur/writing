<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Cassius's interiority is concrete and dimensionally specific; his three-thousand-year boredom drives the opening pursuit clearly. Naia's motives land with embodied cost—her "suffocating" half-life and tears refracting into prisms ground her final choice. The relationship crucible forces Cassius into recognition ("finally understood what he'd lost"), and his pivot to tearing dimensions apart again shows earned character momentum. Minor slip: Naia's shift from accusation to confession feels slightly compressed; one more micro-choice in her approach would tighten causality.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors by line 2 (who, where, when). Drive lens reads Causal: fragment arrival → spatial mutiny → Naia's ritual → dimensional tear → Cassius's new plan forms a clean because/therefore chain. Closure is Decisive Change with visible cost: Naia vanishes permanently, Cassius loses her, and his final turn ("began plotting how to tear the dimensions apart again") forecloses reconciliation and commits him to an obsessive new path. Cost is legible on the page in "empty except for one bored immortal who finally understood what he'd lost." One meaningful tightening occurs when Naia reveals she brought the fragment, narrowing Cassius's options from observer to participant too late.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Prismatic escondite, magnetic fields as visible serpents, and auroras warping into "impossible geometries" create vivid, POV-filtered sensory anchors. The fragment on the obsidian desk and the storm's crescendo constrain the ritual's timing and Cassius's ability to intervene. Spatial choreography is clean: Naia moves from doorway to window, fragment sinks into her sternum, dimensions tear. The environment charges the final image—storm passes, escondite stands empty—reinforcing Cassius's isolation. Minor: the escondite's interior layout (desk, doorway, window relation) could be slightly sharper in the middle beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Cassius's drive to solve the mystery vs. Naia's need to escape half-life) is signaled early and tightens when Naia reveals she brought the fragment. The storm's peak creates a time-bound pressure point that forecloses intervention. Naia's agency—pressing the fragment to her chest and stepping into the gap—drives the climax; Cassius's reactive position ("Tell me what you find") and subsequent plotting show earned transformation under pressure. Cost is visible: Naia vanishes, Cassius loses her permanently, and his final choice to repeat the cycle demonstrates a felt price. One meaningful deepening: "maybe some goodbyes are meant to be final" reweights the dominant mystery-chase with relational cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Theme emerges from particulars: immortality as endless waiting vs. mortality's finality, curiosity as both curse and compulsion. The fragment and dimensional mutiny serve as concrete vehicles rather than abstract symbols. Naia's line "You're bored because you can't discover anything truly new anymore" and her final step into the gap offer a non-literal answer to the core question—whether knowledge or connection matters more. The closing image (Cassius plotting to tear dimensions again) resists tidy morals and shows he's learned nothing, charging the ending with irony. Minor: "after goodbye" phrase in the motivation element risks slight on-the-nose phrasing, though it's mostly earned by context.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited through Cassius; perceptual signature (dimensionally aware, seeing equations in light, magnetic fields as serpents) is distinct and consistent. Dialogue carries subtext—Naia's "You always do" and "At least let me satisfy both our curiosities" pursue goals (permission, closure) while wounding. Psychic distance tightens appropriately at the climax. Two slips lower the score: "hushed thunder quality she'd perfected over centuries" tells rather than shows voice texture, and "understanding blooming like poison" is a stock metaphor that doesn't match Cassius's sensory idiom established elsewhere (crystalline, magnetic, prismatic). Both occur in mid-beats, not at closure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, several prose artifacts accumulate: "feeling the magnetic fields writhe like serpents" and "understanding blooming like poison" are stock metaphors; "hushed thunder quality she'd perfected" is filter-heavy telling; "gesturing at the equations hovering in light" buries the vivid detail in a gerund clause. Template cadence appears in the opening: "He had lived... until the fragment arrived. The cursed amulet piece sat... pulsing with a rhythm." Paraphrase loop: "the fragment wasn't merely cursed. It was a key" restates without added pressure. These artifacts don't touch closure but spread across the first half, triggering −0.8 per the Non-closure Accumulation Cap. No loops in the final third; closure image is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The core synthesis—immortal boredom solved not by discovery but by loss—feels earned in hindsight. The spatial-mutiny mechanic and dimensional revolt offer a fresh angle on the escape-death premise. Specificity (prismatic escondite, dimensional awareness, magnetic storms as visible phenomena) anchors the fantastical elements. However, the bored-immortal and the half-turned companion leaving are both well-worn tropes; transformation here is partial rather than radical. Naia's ritual and the fragment as key show ingenuity, but the emotional arc (companion seeks death, immortal regrets too late) follows a familiar template. The final turn—Cassius plotting to repeat rather than grow—adds a darker, less-redemptive inflection that lifts originality slightly.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Cassius (bored immortal) is present throughout and his choice to let Naia go, then plot to tear dimensions again, creates the key final turn. Setup: first line. Development: his realization she brought the fragment narrows options. Payoff: "began plotting how to tear the dimensions apart again" closes the arc. His dimensional awareness enables observation but his reactive stance (unable to stop Naia) and final obsessive pivot show causal pressure and cost. Swappability friction: another immortal archetype could fill the role with minor edits, capping the score.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Fragment appears in beat 1 (on the desk, pulsing), beat 2 (Naia lifts it, curse marks crawl), and beat 3 (pressed to her chest, sinks into sternum, enables dimensional crossing). Setup early, development through Naia's reveal, payoff as the mechanism of her escape. Causal pressure: it creates the spatial mutiny that opens the gap. Cost: Naia uses it to vanish permanently. Minor swappability: another cursed object could substitute with modest rewrites, and it doesn't reappear or reweight in Cassius's final image.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Spatial mutiny (dimensions revolting, refusing ordained positions) is introduced in beat 1 ("mutiny occurring within the fabric itself"), developed in beat 2 (Naia explains dimensions tearing during storm peak), and payoff at climax (dimensions tear, creating the gap Naia enters). It shapes stakes (enables Naia's escape, denies Cassius intervention) and tactics (must occur during storm crescendo). Cost: the mutiny's one-time window forecloses Cassius's chance to act. The concept is irreplaceable—removing it breaks the escape mechanism and the closure image of dimensions "settling into sullen compliance."</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Dimensionally aware is introduced early ("Cassius was dimensionally aware—a curse in itself") and enables him to see the fragment bleeding between realities and perceive what lies beyond during the tear. Setup and payoff present; development weak—it grants observation but doesn't constrain a choice or create visible cost. He sees "something else entirely" in the gap, but this doesn't alter his final action. The trait is mostly told-as-attribute rather than demonstrated through a specific choice or tradeoff under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Intrigue appears obliquely: Naia's concealment (bringing the fragment, planning the ritual) and Cassius's late realization. Setup: fragment's arrival is mysterious. Development: "You brought it here" reveal. Payoff: intrigue resolved but doesn't drive the climax—Naia's escape is direct action, not a plot twist. The intrigue element is functional but replaceable; a straightforward confrontation could substitute with minor edits. It does not constrain the ending or reweight the final image. Late first appearance of the intrigue mechanism (past midpoint) and summary-only handling lower the score.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Magnetic fields (through the stone, visible in storm, Naia's form weaving into magnetic currents) appear in beat 1 (opening line), beat 2 (cascading through walls), and beat 3 (Naia unravels into threads woven into magnetic currents at closure). Setup early, mechanics signaled (storm intensifies magnetic fields, dimensional tear occurs via these currents), payoff in final image. The method shapes the ritual's medium and charges Naia's dissolution visually. Modest friction: the mechanics are more atmospheric than constraining—Naia's choice would read similarly via another storm phenomenon.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Prismatic escondite is present throughout (opening line, shields against storm, prismatic walls fragment Naia's shadow, final image "stood empty"). Setup immediate, micro-setting (the desk, doorway, window) stages the confrontation. The escondite's isolation and storm-shielding create the controlled environment for the ritual, and its emptiness charges the ending image. Payoff: "the prismatic escondite stood empty except for one bored immortal" reweights the space with loss. Friction: the setting is more container than constraint—the scene could occur in another isolated structure with modest adjustments.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Solar storm is introduced in para 1 ("solar storm intensified"), developed as the enabling condition ("during the storm's peak, there will be a moment—a gap"), and payoff when "storm reached its crescendo" triggers the dimensional tear. Time constraint is live and tracked: the storm's peak is a one-time window that tightens Cassius's options (too late to intervene) and enables Naia's escape. Setup early, causal pressure high, closure linkage strong ("Then the storm passed, the dimensions settled"). The timeframe is irreplaceable—removing it breaks the escape mechanism and the urgency. Cost: the narrow window forecloses Cassius's agency.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Naia's motivation (to discover what happens after goodbye) is seeded early ("I've found a way to die properly"), dramatized in her explanation ("let me discover what happens after goodbye"), and enacted in her final step into the gap. Friction between want (escape, discovery) and cost (leaving Cassius, permanent unknown) is embodied in her tears and "Maybe some goodbyes are meant to be final." Cassius's secondary motivation (boredom, chasing mysteries) mirrors and contrasts hers, creating relational pressure. Both motivations shape the climax and charge the ending. The motivation is specific and irreplaceable—swapping it would require reworking the entire conflict.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Tone of "hushed thunder" is present in Naia's voice quality ("hushed thunder quality she'd perfected"), the storm's magnetic cascade, and the quiet-yet-charged final beats (Cassius's whisper, Naia's tears, the silent escondite). Tone modulates from eerie curiosity (opening) to relational tension (dialogue) to awed finality (dimensional tear and aftermath). The "hushed thunder" idiom threads through but is stated once rather than woven texturally into syntax and rhythm. Payoff: the closing silence ("In the silence that followed") and Cassius's quiet resolve echo the hushed-yet-powerful register. Friction: tone is somewhat told (the label "hushed thunder quality") rather than fully embodied in cadence across beats.</comment>
