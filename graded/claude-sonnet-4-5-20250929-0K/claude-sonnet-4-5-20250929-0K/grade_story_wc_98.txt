<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Kima's interior conflict between skepticism and belief is embodied through concrete choices (holding the seed, recording dreams, kneeling to plant). The sister Prem functions primarily as a sounding board but applies immediate pressure through the monsoon deadline. Kima's final pivot from "certain knowledge" to "luminous doubt" is earned by the dream sequence, though the dreams themselves arrive as summary rather than dramatized pressure. Minor slip: the phrase "empirically whimsical method" reads as meta-commentary rather than character thought.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (Kima, ridge, pre-monsoon). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: dream fragments build density, Prem's arrival deepens the stakes, and the planting act crystallizes Kima's stance shift with visible cost (forfeiting verification for possibility). Closure is Charged Poise—the seed is planted, the monsoon looms, and the final image ("three days to discover what grows when faith and verification finally bloom together") reconfigures the opening tension with undeniable pressure. Cost is legible: she has abandoned her oath's certainty for an unproven leap.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The crimson ridge functions as a seasonal calendar and frames urgency (monsoon arrival). The seed's physical weight ("like a tiny sun") and the soil's texture during planting ground the key choice. The ridge "hums" at closure, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (standing among blooms, settling on stone, kneeling). Minor limitation: the mainland and its pull on the young remain abstract, reducing the setting's constraint on present choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: plant the seed and risk losing it, or refuse and lose collective memory forever. The monsoon deadline tightens pressure across the piece. Prem's question ("true dreams or wishful ones?") deepens Kima's internal conflict and narrows options. The planting forecloses verification—Kima trades her role's certainty for "luminous doubt" with visible cost. One meaningful tightening (the three-day countdown) drives escalation under the Accumulative lens.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme (the boundary between truth and wish, memory and faith) emerges through Kima's dream testing and her final stance that "truth and wish aren't always opposites." The seed and ridge function thematically without overt statement. The closing image ("what grows when faith and verification finally bloom together") reweights the premise without moralizing. Minor slip: "luminous doubt" and "empirically whimsical" feel prompt-adjacent in their construction, though the piece dramatizes the concepts through action.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable; distance tightens during Kima's reflection on dreams. Kima's perceptual signature (reality checker's skepticism layered with aching belief) is consistent. Dialogue between Kima and Prem carries distinct voices—Prem's pragmatism versus Kima's reflective complexity. Minor slip: the phrase "luminous doubt of pre-dawn hours" reads as elevated diction that hovers near the edge of the established register. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts are purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentences vary in rhythm and structure; information density is high (each paragraph advances Kima's choice or deepens stakes). Minor scaffold: "She had been testing the claim through interpreted dreams" frontloads exposition; the dreams themselves arrive as summary list rather than immediate scene. The phrase "empirically whimsical method available to her" reads as meta-commentary scaffolding. Clarity and propulsion are strong through the planting beat. No loops or contradictions in the closure unit.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The premise (seed containing genetic memory, reality checker facing faith) is recognizable from speculative-fiction templates, but the piece particularizes it through Kima's dream-testing protocol and the ridge-as-calendar detail. The emotional arc (skepticism to luminous doubt) is specific to Kima's vocational identity. Transformation test: the plot could function with different names/places without major revision, suggesting moderate freshness. The "luminous doubt" framing offers a non-obvious angle on the faith-versus-proof dilemma, lifting the piece above pure template execution.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kima's role as reality checker frames her initial skepticism, drives the dream-testing sequence (middle beat), and charges the planting choice at closure when she abandons verification for "luminous doubt." Her vocational oath creates the core friction. The character trait is causally active across all three gates and the final act would collapse without this exact role.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The seed appears in paragraph one (held between fingers, "weight like a tiny sun"), drives the dream-test middle sequence (held against chest nightly), and is planted at closure with visible cost (forfeiting proof). Its physical handling in multiple beats and its return at the ending with reweighted meaning (from object-to-verify to "possibility itself") make it indispensable. The story's logic requires this exact object.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Collective memory is the seed's promised function (paragraph two), motivates Kima's dream testing (third beat), and drives the planting choice when she sees the young forgetting prayers and textile patterns. It shapes on-page tactics (the week of dream recording) and charges the closure ("waken what we've forgotten"). The concept is causally active and alters options, though it remains one step abstracted from immediate scene pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>"Empirically whimsical" appears as a label for Kima's dream method but does not constrain a discrete choice with visible cost beyond the general testing frame. The trait colors her approach (testing via dreams rather than refusing outright) but reads more as thematic description than a friction that narrows options. Present in setup and middle, but its mechanics do not drive a turn. Swappable with "experimental" or "unorthodox" without major structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Waken" is the seed's function (awakening collective memory) and drives Kima's testing and planting sequence. The final line ("trusted that the coming rains would waken whatever truth lay sleeping") charges the closure image with this exact verb. The action is signaled early, returns at closure, and the story's logic depends on this specific promise. Removing "waken" would require reframing the seed's entire purpose.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Interpreted dreams are Kima's chosen verification method (paragraph three), shape her nightly ritual over a week (middle beat), and inform her final choice when she recalls the dreams' sensation of connection. The method's mechanics (holding the seed, recording visions) matter on the page. Minor limitation: the dreams arrive as summary rather than immediate dramatization, reducing their pressure. Still, the method is causally essential and present across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The ancient ridge frames the opening image (crimson flowers as seasonal calendar), provides the planting site at closure, and constrains choice through the monsoon countdown. The soil's texture during planting and the ridge's hum charge the final beat. The setting is signaled early, alters tactics (the deadline), and participates in closure. The ridge's calendar function (ancestors planted it to track seasons) adds specificity that makes it irreplaceable.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The three-day monsoon deadline is introduced early (Prem: "The monsoon comes in three days"), tightens Kima's decision (middle beat: "Either plant it or don't"), and charges the final line ("Three days to discover what grows"). Time is tracked on the page, narrows options, and the closure image depends on this exact clock. The timeframe is causally active and indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Kima's desire to protect cultural memory drives her oath as reality checker (paragraph one), motivates her dream testing (to verify the elders' claim), and underlies her planting choice when she reflects on the young ones forgetting prayers and patterns. The motivation is dramatized through her internal conflict (protect via skepticism or via faith) and tested at closure with visible cost (abandoning verification). Friction between desire and method is legible and shapes the final act.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Luminous doubt" is named explicitly in the pre-dawn reflection and charges the final image ("when faith and verification finally bloom together"). Tone modulates from Kima's initial skepticism through layered belief (dreams) to the planting act's poised ambiguity. The phrase appears at setup and closure, reweighting the opening tension. Minor limitation: the label is stated rather than purely embodied, but the tone's progression supports escalation and the ending depends on this exact emotional register.</comment>
