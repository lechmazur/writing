<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maricel's consciousness under anesthesia provides clear POV filter and embodied experience. Interior voice is distinct and reflective without therapy-speak; the translator's professional habit of witnessing meaning before dissolution shapes her perceptual signature. The decision to investigate after waking is earned by prior causality—three weeks carrying the coral, the child's encrypted message, her understanding of truth's danger—and forecloses the passive path with visible professional and personal risk. Micro-choices (fighting the anesthetic, gripping the coral) reveal hierarchy of values under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands via Charged Poise: Maricel's commitment to translate silence into speech is crystallized in the final image, holding the coral fragment while under anesthesia, with the cost visible (physical danger, professional risk in a conflict zone where "truth was dangerous"). Accumulative lens holds throughout: the coral's meaning deepens from decorative fragment → child's recognition → teacher's hidden truth → structural metaphor for patient truth-building. Orientation anchors quickly (hospital, Mindanao, translator, post-injury). Single transition from present awareness to deepening reflection fits scope and teaches the pattern early.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Setting provides functional constraint: the mist-filled atrium frames the anesthetic haze and isolation, while the former-hotel-now-hospital signals the makeshift infrastructure of conflict zones. The coral fragment as micro-setting object recurs with shifting weight and charges the final image directly. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (throbbing arm, medication bloom, mist texture). Minor gap: the bombed school and village geography remain somewhat abstract, serving as backstory anchor rather than spatial pressure on present choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether to pursue dangerous truth or maintain survival silence—is signaled early and tightens when Maricel decrypts the message. Accumulative pressure: the child's encrypted warning + recognition of the teacher's sacrifice + understanding that "truth was dangerous here" narrows options to a binary with visible cost. The resolution ("Tomorrow, when she woke, she would go") is protagonist-driven renunciation of safety, earned by her translator's ethos and three weeks of prior witness. One meaningful deepening (coral's channels = hidden truth) sufficient for length.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through coral's structural metaphor: patient deposits of truth building passage through convolutions, contrasted with "fluid kind that let everyone maintain their shared anxieties." The piece resists tidy resolution—"truth wouldn't fix anything quickly, might not fix anything at all"—while honoring complexity without false equivalence. Final image (hand closed around fragment) offers resonant answer to whether meaning can survive fog and violence, earned through specifics (encrypted notes, teacher's death, children's dangerous knowledge). "Lotus-hearted knowledge" phrase borders on decorative but the ache is embodied in prior beats.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV distance stable; narrative certainty matches focalizer's drugged state with appropriate perceptual compression ("peculiar clarity that comes just before thinking becomes impossible"). Diction reflects professional idiom ("navigate," "decrypt," "translate between silence and speech") without jarring register drift. Perceptual signature—translator parsing meaning in all contexts—is consistent and distinct. One minor slip: "shrewdly innocent" in line describing her mental quality reads slightly external/diagnostic rather than fully embodied, though the concept is dramatized in prior reflection about children's devastating questions.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies appropriately; sentence openings diversify. Information density high: most lines advance character understanding, coral symbolism, or stakes. Figurative language concentrated but serves closure (silk scarf mist, labyrinthine conversations, polyps building from seawater). Minor template cadence in middle section: "The coordinates pointed...The brain coral's chambers...Maricel understood..." uses parallel declarative stems across three beats. Opening and closing lines anchor effectively. No paraphrase loops; proofreading clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Coral-as-structural-metaphor for hidden truth in conflict zones offers specific synthesis of object, profession, and theme. The child's encryption game (half-Tagalog, half-English, number substitution) provides fresh procedural detail that grounds the discovery. Translator-under-anesthesia frame transforms familiar "uncover dangerous secret" premise through the liminal consciousness and professional lens. Slight derivative pressure: conflict-zone truth-seeking and children-as-moral-witnesses are well-worn; the piece elevates through voice and coral specificity but does not fully escape the template's gravitational field.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maricel's professional identity shapes all key observations and decisions: parsing encrypted notes, understanding why Imelda hid truth, committing to translate silence into speech. Present in setup (translator of grieving parents/peacekeepers), development (decryption skill), and payoff (decision to go to coordinates). Causal pressure moderate: her skills enable the discovery, her ethos drives the choice, but the actual translation/mediation work remains largely backstory rather than on-page action under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Fragment introduced early ("kept...for three weeks"), returns in middle beat (Imelda's recognition, "B-R-A-I-N C-O-R-A-L" decryption), handled physically at closure ("fingers around the coral fragment, feeling its ancient convolutions"), and structurally charges the theme (polyps building truth deposits). Beat involvement: three distinct—initial carrying, decryption trigger, final grip. Causal work: enables recognition of teacher's hiding place, shifts from decorative curiosity to key evidence. High irreplaceability: intricate channels = labyrinthine meaning is specific to brain coral morphology.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Shared anxieties" phrase appears once explicitly ("mutual absolution," "everyone maintain their shared anxieties") and implicitly structures the conflict (both sides blame other, peacekeepers and parents grieve, truth threatens consensus fog). Shapes stakes moderately: Maricel's choice to pursue truth directly confronts the collective comfort of ambiguity. Present in thematic layer and final reflection but doesn't constrain on-page tactics; functions more as diagnosis of situation than active pressure point that narrows options in a specific beat.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Shrewdly innocent" introduced mid-story as trait learned from children ("ability to see clearly while appearing to understand nothing"). Constrains one choice: fighting anesthetic to decode message despite appearing passive under sedation. Label-only presentation reduces score; the trait is asserted more than dramatized through contradictory impulses acting simultaneously. Imelda's question example ("Why do they shoot if they're both sad?") illustrates the concept better than Maricel's own on-page actions. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Unknot" verb introduced early in mental action ("Her mind...worked to unknot the message") and structures the key turn: decryption of B-R-A-I-N C-O-R-A-L coordinates redefines the coral from curiosity to evidence, shifts stakes from passive recovery to active investigation. Present in setup (translator parsing meaning), development (literal decryption under anesthesia), payoff (understanding "truth with a specific shape"). Causal: without successful unknotting, no coordinates, no decision to investigate. Moderately replaceable—"decode" or "decipher" could substitute with minor tonal shift.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Child's cast with smudged purple marker notes introduced early; encryption pattern (half-Tagalog, half-English, number substitution) provides specific mechanics that matter—game the village kids played, not arbitrary code. Shapes one major beat: decryption reveals coordinates and "Uncle buried truth here." Present in setup (cast decorated by village children), development (decoding under anesthesia), implicit in payoff (coordinates determine tomorrow's action). Moderate causal pressure; the method enables discovery but doesn't constrain multiple choices. Swappability moderate: a hidden note could replace cast-encryption with structural edits.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mist-curling atrium with glass ceiling appears in opening and closing, creates atmospheric frame for anesthetic haze. Former hotel detail signals conflict-zone improvisation. Setting provides symbolic resonance (fog = obscured truth) and sensory anchor but limited tactical constraint—the choice to investigate coordinates occurs mentally, not shaped by physical environment. Micro-setting credit: recovery bed position and anesthetic administration pressure the timeframe but don't alter Maricel's available moves. Postcard-description risk mitigated by thematic coherence; still trends descriptive over functional.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Anesthetic progression provides clear timeframe: "begin its slow bloom" → "softened the world's edges" → "pulling harder" → "won" structures the narrative clock and creates urgency for decryption. Time directly constrains tactics: Maricel must decode before consciousness fades, fighting the medication's pressure. Present in all three sections and shapes the central dramatic question (can she solve it before sedation wins?). Tightens one key choice effectively. Moderate ceiling: the "tomorrow, when she woke" decision occurs after time pressure resolves; clock matters mid-story but doesn't shape the climactic commitment.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>4.7</grade><comment>"Graft new meaning onto old wounds" phrase introduced late in reflection about conflict dynamics ("everyone grafted new meaning onto old wounds without ever cleaning them properly"). Functions as thematic diagnosis rather than character-specific desire that drives on-page choices. Maricel's actual motivations—translator's duty to witness, commitment to children's truth, rejection of convenient narratives—are dramatized earlier and more concretely. The "graft" metaphor articulates the problem she opposes, not the want she pursues. Present in middle third, absent from setup and payoff beats. Told-only; no friction between this want and costs in specific choices.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Lotus-hearted" phrase appears once near closure ("lotus-hearted knowledge that truth wouldn't fix anything quickly"). Tone of reflective ache—gentle, patient sorrow balanced with determination—is coherent throughout: fighting anesthetic to witness, understanding children's clarity, accepting that truth "might not fix anything at all." Modulates appropriately: sensory softness (mist, twilight) frames harder realizations (truth is dangerous, wounds fester). Tone charges final image effectively (hand closed, holding tight, patient deposits). Single exotic modifier ("lotus-hearted") borders on ornamental; the ache is better embodied in "heart ached" line and coral-patience metaphor than in the compound adjective itself.</comment>
