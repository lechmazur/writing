<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Kael's journey from isolation to integration is clearly motivated, and her choice to create the sculpture emerges from established traits. The final moment "finally understanding that belonging wasn't about disappearing into the webs of kinship, but about adding your own thread" reads as diagnostic label-speak that flattens what the sculpture already dramatized. Internal contradiction is present (wanting connection but unable to cross into the arbor) but the resolution feels slightly over-explained rather than purely embodied. Minor embodiment issue: "tears streaming down her face" is functional but borders on cliché in the climactic beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece operates under a Causal lens: Kael's isolation → mystery tags → shared search → sculpture reveal → integration. Orientation is clean by the second paragraph. The closure is a Decisive Change with felt cost (three years of isolation ended, vulnerability exposed). One meaningful tightening occurs when the trail leads to the marsh and the sculpture is revealed, narrowing options and forcing Kael's confession. The cost is visible on the page ("I didn't know how to graft myself onto community"), though the final paragraph's thematic summary softens the closure's dramatic charge slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard, obsidian arbor, and marsh reeds are vividly rendered with purposeful specificity ("bark that felt like frozen starlight"). The marsh constrains Kael's work and provides the material for her integration gesture, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. However, the setting functions more as atmospheric backdrop than as a force that dynamically constrains mid-story choices; the reeds enable the solution but don't pressure tactics during the search itself.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Kael's need to belong—is signaled early and tightens meaningfully when she must reveal herself as the artist. The shared search creates escalating intimacy that raises the cost of exposure. Agency is clear: Kael's choice to create the tags and sculpture, then to confess, forecloses her previous isolation with visible cost (vulnerability, tears, "I didn't know how"). The seven-day structure provides a clear intensification arc. One micro-turn when Kael speaks up at the arbor gathering shifts her from observer to participant.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The theme of belonging through contribution rather than assimilation emerges through concrete particulars (the sculpture, the tags, the names woven together). The final paragraph, however, becomes explicitly thematic: "belonging wasn't about disappearing into the webs of kinship, but about adding your own thread" states the moral rather than allowing the image to resonate. The marsh-sculpture and obsidian arbor as twins ("like lungs breathing light") is a strong non-literal answer, but the immediately following articulation undercuts its power. Diagnostic label-speak in the final paragraph ("finally understanding that belonging wasn't about...") triggers penalty.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV control is stable throughout; Kael's focalization remains consistent. The prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("prayer frozen in glass," "luminescent longing") that fits the world and emotional register. Distance modulates appropriately, tightening during the reveal. Dialogue, when present, is naturalistic and goal-driven (Siora's excitement, Kael's hesitant contribution). Minor issue: "boldly sympathetic" as an interior descriptor feels slightly imposed rather than organically shown through gesture, though the listening and teaching behaviors earn it.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies effectively, and figurative language is generally purposeful ("bark that felt like frozen starlight," "webs of kinship"). Information density is high. However, "luminescent longing" in paragraph three and "luminescent ache" as the required tone element both appear with similar construction, creating mild ornamental repetition. The final paragraph contains template phrasing: "no longer at its edge but woven into its very heart, finally understanding that belonging wasn't about..." stacks explanatory clauses that reduce propulsion. No major loops, but the closure beat could tighten by one sentence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The mystery-tag frame is recognizable (community searches for anonymous artist who is revealed to be the protagonist), but the marsh-reed sculptor's medium and the crystalline orchard setting provide fresh specificity. The emotional truth—creating art to communicate when words fail—resonates beyond the prompt elements. The turn (Kael is the artist) is earned in hindsight through her expertise and outsider status. However, the core premise follows a familiar arc of isolated artist finding belonging through revealed vulnerability, and the final thematic articulation reduces some of the piece's daring.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kael's choices drive all major turns: creating the tags, teaching others, revealing herself. Her decisions alter tactics throughout (speaking up at the arbor, joining the search, confessing) and the closure depends entirely on her creative and emotional risk. Present from the opening and causally active in setup, development, and payoff with clear cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The obsidian arbor appears in three beats: evening gatherings, the final paragraph installation, and as the model for Kael's sculpture. It represents the community's heart and shapes Kael's spatial relationship to belonging (standing outside its shadow, then within its embrace). However, it is not handled or used; it remains a symbolic landmark rather than a tool or constraint that alters tactics. The reweighting at closure (twin structures as "lungs breathing light") is poetic but doesn't demonstrably narrow options or generate cost.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Webs of kinship" shapes the dominant stake: Kael's inability to weave into these webs drives her isolation and her creative solution. The concept appears in paragraph two, recurs through the search dynamic, and is directly addressed at closure ("weaving into the pattern"). It alters options by defining what belonging means and what Kael must do to achieve it. However, much of its work is thematic and metaphorical rather than generating on-page tactical constraints or visible costs during the middle beats.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Boldly sympathetic" is labeled once ("found herself boldly sympathetic to each person's theories") and demonstrated through teaching Maren and Pico. It enables Kael's shift from observer to participant, a necessary step toward integration. However, the trait does not constrain or create visible cost; it facilitates connection without trade-off. The adverb "boldly" signals effort but the scene doesn't dramatize internal resistance or price for this sympathy.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Dedicate" drives the major turn: Kael dedicates herself to collective searching rather than solitary work, which leads to her integration. The shift is signaled explicitly ("began to dedicate herself not to solving the mystery alone, but to the collective joy") and causally necessary—without it, the community would not have reason to accept her sculpture as gift rather than intrusion. The action appears mid-story, shapes the search dynamic, and directly enables the closure confession.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The shared search structures the entire middle section: discovering tags, mapping progression, teaching pattern-reading, following the trail to the marsh. Its mechanics matter (directional flow, knot meanings, seven-day ritual) and shape multiple beats. The method is signaled early (paragraph four), drives collaboration, and leads directly to the sculpture reveal. Removing it would collapse the story's escalation and Kael's path to vulnerability. The search itself is the crucible for her gradual integration.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The crystalline orchard and crater provide vivid atmosphere and house the key locations (arbor, marsh, trees). The marsh supplies materials and becomes the sculpture site, linking setting to closure. However, the setting mostly enables action rather than constraining it; Kael could search elsewhere with minor adjustments. The orchard's perch "at the edge" mirrors Kael's position but doesn't dynamically pressure her choices during the middle beats. Present throughout, functional, but not indispensable to the story's causal logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Beyond the murmur of lost languages" appears once as poetic description in the opening and is not developed as a temporal constraint or pressure. The seven-day search provides a clearer timeframe that shapes the ritual, but "beyond the murmur of lost languages" itself doesn't function as a clock or alter tactics. It enriches tone and setting but remains ornamental to the plot. Not causally active; swappable with any lyric time-phrase.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The motivation to "graft oneself onto community" is dramatized throughout: Kael's three years at the edges, her inability to cross into the arbor, her creative solution, and her confession ("I didn't know how to graft myself onto community"). It drives every major choice and the final cost (exposing vulnerability). The language of grafting recurs with specificity (weaving, webs, threads) and directly shapes the sculpture's design. Conflict between desire and method creates friction across all beats.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Luminescent longing" (paragraph three) and implicit ache throughout establish the tone. The prose modulates appropriately: lyric and expansive in the orchard descriptions, tightening during the reveal, softening into collective warmth at closure. The tone charges the final image ("lungs breathing light," Kael singing back). However, "luminescent" appears twice in similar constructions, creating mild ornamental repetition. Coherent and purposeful, but not entirely indispensable; adjacent tones (wistful yearning, crystalline hope) could serve similarly.</comment>
