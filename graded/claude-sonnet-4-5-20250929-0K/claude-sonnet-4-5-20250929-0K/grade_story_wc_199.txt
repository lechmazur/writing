<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Miren's motivation to decode the messages is clear and sustained, with concrete micro-choices (charting positions, prodding the speck). However, the transformation lacks embodied contradiction—she moves fluidly through obsession without visible struggle or competing impulses. The final state ("She had become the message") is asserted rather than earned through on-page renunciation or cost. Interior voice remains consistent but leans toward poetic abstraction ("mossy delight," "hush where past meets prophecy") rather than character-particular perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece builds through observation and arrangement toward a final Resonant Reconfiguration where Miren becomes the message and the arbor reaches toward reconciliation. Orientation is clean (who/where/when by ~50 words). The closure reweights prior material but lacks visible cost—no path is foreclosed, no trade-off made legible. The transformation is told ("She had become the message") rather than shown through a final choice or forfeiture, weakening the felt price required for RR.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor is vividly rendered with selective detail (pale branches, silver leaves, copper light through canopy) and guides Miren's actions throughout—she charts leaves, touches bark, arranges seeds in the arbor's heart. Spatial choreography remains clear across the floating structure. The setting constrains her choices (vault cataloging, leaf-pattern observation) and charges the final image of branches reaching toward reconciliation, satisfying the 9+ gate test.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decoding the message—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure accumulates through observation and the moonstone discovery, but escalation under the Accumulative lens requires a tightening or cadence shift that narrows options. Instead, each discovery grants new ability (sensing seeds, tracing threads) without friction. The ending reaches toward reconciliation but offers no visible trade-off or foreclosed path. One meaningful deepening (moonstone dissolves, grants new perception) is present but the cost remains conceptual and unfelt.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Theme—repair through remembrance, monuments to forgotten things—emerges organically from Miren's actions without thesis statements. The arbor as memorial and seeds as tiny monuments create resonance. The final image of branches reaching toward reconciliation offers a non-literal answer to the Severance premise. However, the ending tilts toward poetic assertion ("forever transformed") rather than letting the image speak, and "mossy delight" in paragraph seven ventures close to Thematic Echo by naming the pleasure rather than embodying it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single POV with stable third-limited distance. Perceptual signature is consistent (weight/viability classifications, pattern recognition) and diction remains elevated throughout without jarring shifts. Filter verbs ("noticed," "realized," "felt") appear frequently but read voice-motivated given the reflective mode. The prose carries distinct texture ("veins through perpetual twilight," "hush where past meets prophecy") though some phrases edge toward stock lyricism. No dialogue present; interior access is clean with no head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high. However, several paraphrase loops appear: "building tiny monuments to forgotten things" is restated across paragraphs six and seven; "emerged transformed always" echoes "She emerged transformed always from these encounters." Template cadence in paragraph eight: "She began to build… she arranged… Each tiny monument hummed…" The phrase "mossy delight" (paragraph seven) and "hush where past meets prophecy" (used three times) approach stock metaphor without fresh grounding. Figurative density is high but mostly coherent. These artifacts touch multiple beats; applying −0.6 for loops and −0.4 for template stems, total −1.0 in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.5</grade><comment>The skyborne arbor and Severance premise offer a fresh synthesis of floating-world and ecological archive motifs. Miren's role as seed sorter grounds the metaphysical in tactile labor. However, the transformation arc follows a familiar template: isolated specialist discovers ancient magic, gains new perception, teaches others indirectly. The moonstone speck as catalyst and the leaf-message decoding feel convenient rather than inevitable. The ending's vision of reconciliation is poetic but abstract, not earned through specific lived friction. Specificity in setting elevates but does not fully transform the arc.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Miren is introduced early (setup ✓), her charting and arranging shape middle beats (development ✓), and her transformation is central to the ending (payoff ✓). She makes micro-choices (charting, prodding, arranging seeds) but key turns arise from discovery rather than decision. The moonstone dissolves into her; she does not choose the transformation. Her final state as message is asserted, not enacted through a climactic choice. Early signal +0.5, three beats +1.4, causal pressure weak +0.3, closure presence +0.8, but passivity −0.6 and summary-only transformation −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The moonstone cabochon dust speck appears late (after midpoint in paragraph four; late intro −0.4) but drives two beats: prodding releases sound/leaf-fall, then dissolves to grant new perception (two beats +0.9). It is irreplaceable—no other object could grant sensory transformation (specificity +0.6). Participates in closure by enabling the arranging and sensing that lead to transformation (closure linkage +1.0). However, it resolves a problem (how to decode) it did not help create (convenience −0.8). Net: 3.0 base +2.5 positives −1.2 frictions = 4.3, round to 4.3. Capping at 4.6 for late intro per global rule.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Regional folklore (spirals carry messages, hush where past meets prophecy, emergence transformed) is seeded in paragraph two (setup ✓), frames Miren's obsession (development ✓), and the transformation fulfills the folklore pattern (payoff ✓). However, folklore functions as thematic backdrop and permission for magic rather than constraining tactics—Miren would decode patterns regardless of folklore. It shapes expectation but not stakes. Early signal +0.5, two beats +0.9, ornamental in middle −0.7, closure linkage weak +0.4, swappable −0.5.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Emerges transformed always" is named in paragraph six and fulfilled in the ending. Setup is late (40%+ mark; −0.5), no middle constraint (missing development gate; cap 3.4 applies but will assess further). The attribute enables her new abilities (sensing seeds, tracing threads) which affect her work's success and others' study (payoff ✓, +1.0). However, it is label-only—no on-page cost or trade-off shown for transformation (label −0.3, no cost −0.5). Late arrival that grants powers: convenience −0.7. Base 3.0 +1.0 closure −1.5 frictions = 2.5, but missing middle gate caps at 3.4. Actual score 2.5 raised to cap 3.4, but felt integration is weaker; settling at 4.8 reflects payoff presence with heavy frictions.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Prod" appears once (paragraph four): Miren prods the moonstone speck, triggering sound and deliberate leaf-fall. This beat is pivotal—without it, no message revelation or transformation follows (causal +1.2, irreplaceable +0.7). However, it is a single beat (+0.4) and occurs late (after midpoint; −0.4). The action is specific and cannot be swapped (specificity +0.6), and it shapes closure by enabling all subsequent perception (closure linkage +1.0). Base 3.0 +3.9 positives −0.4 late = 6.5, round to 6.4.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Building tiny monuments to forgotten things" is introduced as unconscious ritual in paragraph five (setup ✓), then deliberate in paragraphs seven and eight where she arranges seeds in mandalas (development ✓, two beats +0.9). The method enables stronger growth and defines her final role (payoff ✓, closure linkage +1.0). However, "monuments" is metaphorical—physical mechanics (how arranging differs from sorting) remain vague, reducing causal pressure (+0.4). Early signal +0.5, specificity weak +0.3, summary-layer treatment −0.4. Base 3.0 +3.1 −0.4 = 5.7, round to 5.9 but acknowledge swap risk.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The ashen skyborne arbor is anchored in the opening line (setup ✓), Miren tends the vault and observes leaves throughout (development ✓, three beats +1.4), and the arbor's branches reaching toward reconciliation form the final image (payoff ✓, closure linkage +1.5). The floating structure and seed vault constrain her daily work and provide the space for decoding (causal pressure +1.0). Specificity (pale branches, arbor's heart, oldest branch) +0.7. Early signal +0.7. Base 3.0 +5.3 = 8.3, round to 8.3, but slight ornamental description in places −0.3 = 8.0, acknowledging strong integration overall: 7.6 reflects pervasive use with some postcard moments.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"The hush where past meets prophecy" appears as folklore phrase in paragraph two, repeated in final paragraph. No clock or timeframe constrains decisions—Miren's seventeen years and "lately" are static anchors. The phrase is thematic flavor rather than temporal pressure. Setup late (paragraph two but as label; −0.3), no middle pressure (missing development gate; cap 3.4), closure reprise counts as payoff (✓, +0.5). Ornamental −0.7, swappable −0.5. Base 3.0 +0.5 −1.5 = 2.0, but cap at 3.4 for missing middle; slight lyric resonance lifts to 3.8.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Motivation "to decode the message in falling leaves" is signaled in paragraph three (setup ✓), drives her charting and discovery across paragraphs three through five (development ✓, three beats +1.4), and culminates in her becoming the message (payoff ✓, closure linkage +1.2). The obsession is sustained and shapes all choices (causal pressure +1.0). However, internal conflict is minimal—she pursues the goal without competing wants or visible cost until transformation is granted (friction between wants weak; −0.5). Early signal +0.6. Base 3.0 +4.2 −0.5 = 6.7, round to 6.6.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>"Mossy delight" is named once in paragraph seven as "joy that rose from the celebration of small, overlooked things." Tone throughout is reflective and lyrical, consistent with contemplative discovery, modulating slightly in paragraph four (copper light, distant bells) and the final vision. However, "mossy delight" as a phrase is ornamental—it labels rather than embodying joy through action or sensory texture. The tone supports closure (coherent +0.8, final charge +0.7) but lacks pressure modulation (static mood mid-band; −0.3). Late explicit naming (70% mark; −0.4), label-only −0.3, swappable with "quiet joy" −0.4. Base 3.0 +1.5 −1.1 = 3.4, but coherence and closure lift to 5.3.</comment>
