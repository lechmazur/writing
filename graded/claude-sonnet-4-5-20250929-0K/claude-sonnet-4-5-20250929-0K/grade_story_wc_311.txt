<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's interiority is concrete and her predecessor's voice emerges through the recordings with distinct texture. The choice to walk away from Daniel is motivated by her vision of the future, though the decision itself happens off-page in summary ("last week"). Internal contradiction appears in the tension between her surge of joy and her disciplined refusal, embodied through the crystallized-memory image. Minor deduction for the peak choice occurring in backstory rather than present action.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered reflection, the atlas-page motif, and parallel sacrifice stories converging on naming the fear. Closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Mira names her grief and accepts the echo's weight, foreclosing the path back to Daniel with felt cost. Orientation anchors (Mira, observatory, dusk, post-recordings discovery) land cleanly by ~10% of text. The meaningful deepening occurs when she reframes sacrifice as love rather than cowardice, reweighting her choice. One substantive issue: the climactic decision (leaving Daniel) occurred off-page "last week," so the present-tense closure crystallizes understanding rather than enacting a new choice—this is valid under RR but lowers causal sharpness slightly.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The observatory's scattered light through the cracked telescope lens charges both the sea-monster page and the final image, functioning as micro-setting that reweights meaning. Spatial anchors (observation platform, brass tubes, domed ceiling, stone floor) remain stable and the prism detail returns at closure. The atlas page as tactile object (traced, held to light, tucked next to heart) constrains Mira's attention and charges the ending. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her grief without catalog.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: whether to name and bear the grief or remain trapped in nameless dread. The tightening occurs when Mira moves from hearing her predecessor's echo to applying his lesson, reframing her choice and foreclosing retreat with visible emotional cost. Agency is renunciation (walking away from Daniel) whose price—loneliness, the jewel of "perfect grief"—is legible on the page. The decision itself happened off-page, so present escalation is conceptual deepening rather than plot-driven narrowing, which fits the Accumulative lens but slightly reduces forward pressure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme emerges through the sea-monster motif (naming fear to make it bearable), the parallel sacrifices across centuries, and the final image's non-literal answer: carrying the atlas page becomes carrying mapped grief. No explicit thesis statement; the predecessor's whisper "The hardest mercy is the one we show ourselves" arrives as embedded dialogue rather than authorial summary. The ending reweights prior material—sacrifice/cowardice and love/fear binaries collapse into acceptance—with resonance built from the observatory particulars and the echo structure. The crystallized-memory image risks slight abstraction but remains tied to the kiss and the walk into darkness.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Single-POV third limited with stable psychic distance and a perceptual signature rooted in grief and reaper detachment ("distant intimacy"). Diction is controlled and voice-particular: "jewel of perfect grief," "echo of understanding." Free indirect style is clean. Two minor slips: "if she still possessed such a thing" reads slightly hedged, and "the terrible weight of mercy" in paragraph one risks abstraction, though both remain within the established register. No dialogue on the page to evaluate. Elision of Daniel's discovery scene is purposeful, compressing backstory to foreground present reflection.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies and information density is high—most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., "Medieval cartographers had drawn them to give names to nameless fears..." delivers world detail, thematic setup, and Mira's projection simultaneously). No loops or template cadence. Two minor friction points: "she understood that impulse now" is a small tell after effective showing, and "the echo of his sacrifice lived in these walls" borders on abstraction though it's immediately grounded by the recordings detail. Figurative language (sea monsters, jewel of grief, scattered light) is dense but coherent and purposeful, avoiding muddle. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The reaper-love premise is familiar but transformed through the atlas-page particulars, the observatory setting, and the choice to name grief rather than erase it. The medieval-cartographers analogy and scattered-light-as-fractured-understanding motif feel specific to this voice. The parallel structure (predecessor's recordings echo Mira's choice) risks predictability but earns resonance through the irreversible-loneliness cost and the final acceptance image. Fresh inflection: reframing the walk-away as an act of naming rather than fleeing. Avoids safety-hedging by refusing reunion or redemption.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's choice to walk away from Daniel drives the story's thematic core, though it occurred off-page "last week." On-page, her micro-choices are reflective: tracing the atlas page, studying recordings, naming her fear. The decision to carry the sea monsters forward and accept the echo is an Earned Stasis moment with visible cost (foreclosing return to Daniel, accepting centuries of loneliness). Setup ~5%, middle reflection ~40%, closure participation strong. Causal pressure is present but attenuated by the off-page climax. Specific cost: loneliness and the "jewel of perfect grief."</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The atlas page appears in at least four beats: discovery, tracing at dusk, holding to light (sea monsters cast shadows), tucking next to heart at closure. It reweights across beats—from artifact to mirror of fear to talisman of named grief. Early signal (paragraph one). Closure linkage strong: "carry her sea monsters" charges the final image. Causal pressure moderate: it focuses Mira's reflection but does not enable or constrain a distinct physical choice. Irreplaceability high: the sea-monsters-as-named-fears motif is specific and thematic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The echo of sacrifice shapes the entire narrative arc: Mira discovers her predecessor's recordings (echo across centuries), recognizes the parallel in her own choice, and accepts that the echo "would have to be enough." The concept drives both the thematic question and the closure (Earned Stasis rooted in cyclical sacrifice). Early signal (title of recordings section ~15%). Middle: "some sacrifices never stopped echoing" articulates the cost. Closure: "felt the echo of his understanding reach across centuries." The echo constrains Mira's options—she cannot escape the pattern—and the cost (perpetual loneliness) is undeniable. Irreplaceability and causal pressure both high.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The predecessor's voice "whispering phrases she could no longer quite recall" and "words nearly forgotten, nearly lost" at closure establish the forgotten-echo motif. It appears early (~8%) and returns in the final paragraph, reweighting from loss to partial recovery. However, the trait does not constrain an on-page choice with visible cost—Mira listens but does not act differently because phrases are forgotten. Lyric reprise qualifies for mid-band under the allowance, but lack of causal pressure and swappability (could be "fading" or "distant" phrases) limit the score. Two touches across opening and close, thematic resonance present but no distinct beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Crystallize the memory" is the off-page action that locked Mira's choice: she "kissed him and crystallized the memory—pressed it into something hard and permanent inside herself, a jewel of perfect grief." The action is causally central (it forecloses return to Daniel and charges the closure image of carrying grief). Setup implicit in "last week" summary (~30%), closure participation strong ("jewel" image recurs conceptually). However, the action is summarized rather than dramatized on the page, which lowers beat involvement. Irreplaceability moderate—"froze" or "sealed" could substitute with minor tonal shift. Specific cost clear: transformation of intimacy into Distance and permanent loneliness.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Through scattered light filtering through the telescope's prism, she saw the truth her predecessor had understood." The method appears mid-story (~45%) and again at closure when "scattered light" frames her realization and the sea-monster shadows. It enables the thematic insight (fractured light = fractured understanding made bearable) but does not shape tactics or prior attempts. Two beats: mid-revelation and closure image. Causal pressure low—insight could occur via another stimulus. Closure linkage moderate: the method charges the final image but is not indispensable to it. Lyric resonance present; swappability moderate.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The ancient observatory at dusk anchors the entire narrative. Setting details constrain and charge: brass speaking tubes carry the predecessor's voice (creating the echo motif), the cracked telescope lens produces scattered light (enabling the insight method), the observation platform holds the atlas page, and dusk's dying light makes the sea monsters "writhe." Early signal (paragraph two, ~12%). The environment participates in at least three beats and is inseparable from closure—"extinguished the observatory's lights and stepped into the gathering dark" crystallizes her choice to carry grief forward. Spatial choreography clear. Irreplaceability high: the optical and acoustic properties are weight-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The timeframe "after discovering those recordings" is established early (~15%) and provides causal setup: Mira came to the observatory seeking answers, heard her name in the predecessor's voice, learned of his three-hundred-year loneliness. However, the timeframe does not create urgency or tighten decisions—no live clock pressures her. The phrase "last week" locates Daniel's departure but does not alter present tactics. Two-gate presence (setup, implied in closure context) but no middle development where time narrows options. Functional but replaceable; "after the loss" or "following the choice" could substitute.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The motivation to give names to nameless fears is dramatized through Mira's engagement with the atlas page and her final realization: "if she named it—if she called it sacrifice instead of cowardice, if she called it love instead of fear—perhaps the echo would become bearable." Early signal via the cartographers' motif (~25%). The desire is conflicted—naming requires accepting the cost (loneliness) without escape—and drives the closure choice to carry the sea monsters forward. Friction between want (bearable grief) and cost (no return to Daniel) is legible. Two beats: cartographer reflection and final naming act. Causal pressure moderate to strong; irreplaceability high.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Distant intimacy is established early through the predecessor's voice ("careful, distant way—as if he'd known she would one day inherit not just his scythe, but his loneliness") and sustained throughout: Mira's reflection is both emotionally close (embodied grief, contradictory impulses) and temporally/relationally distanced (events "last week," centuries-long echo, "speaking across time to no one and everyone"). The tone modulates subtly under pressure—coolness at the opening warms slightly during the Daniel memory, then re-distances at closure ("stepped into the gathering dark"). Coherence across turns is strong, and the tone charges the final image: intimate grief held at arm's length. Rhythm and diction support without breaking.</comment>
