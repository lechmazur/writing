<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is clear and sustained across the narrative: she orchestrates collective recovery through her chalk messages. Her interiority remains surface-level, though—"she wouldn't watch it happen again" asserts rather than embodies contradiction. The final exchange with Kessa lands cleanly but arrives without earned internal cost; Mara's choices feel mission-driven rather than conflicted. Embodiment is minimal; the ectoplasmic finger moment is vivid, but emotional states are mostly declared.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (ghost, orchard planet, blight crisis) arrive promptly. The closure unit is a Resonant Reconfiguration—Mara moves from solitary orchestrator to shared architect ("now, finally, she wasn't doing it alone")—with felt cost in her continued labor and the community's fragile interdependence. The causal lens holds: her messages prompt exchanges, exchanges rebuild trust, trust enables collective action. One meaningful tightening occurs when Joren and Elissa publicly commit. Cost is visible in the "brambled hope" and ongoing work, though the final beat's emotional price feels mild.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The floating rock arches and orchard twilight establish a distinct setting early, and the deserted sidewalks from a prior failed colony add texture. However, setting functions primarily as backdrop; the arches frame views but do not constrain choices. The chalk on packed earth vs. crumbling pavement is a nice detail, yet spatial choreography across the settlement remains vague. The butterfly garden bell recurs purposefully, charging the ending, which lifts the score slightly. The orchard blight is declared but not sensorially rendered during key beats.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—community survival versus fragmentation—is signaled early and sustained. Pressure escalates when the first tentative exchanges begin, then deepens when Joren announces collective reconsideration. The protagonist's agency (Mara's nightly chalk work) directly drives each turn. Visible cost appears in "slow recovery" and the acknowledgment of ongoing work, though the final image's price is more conceptual than visceral. One clear tightening (settlers moving from hoarding to sharing) satisfies the length expectation, and coincidence does not resolve.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Theme—interdependence and collective resilience—emerges organically from Mara's orchestration and the settlers' gradual reunion. The nebula line ("sometimes respite isn't a place…") borders on overt thematic statement but is anchored in the concrete image of the western arch. Subtext operates in the unsigned chalk messages and the settlers' tentative trust. The final bell-ringing offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question without moralizing. The closing sentence risks slight sermonizing ("there was still so much work to do") but remains grounded in character motive.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable throughout, filtered through Mara's three-hundred-year perspective. Perceptual signature is consistent: she observes with patient, mission-driven clarity. Dialogue (Joren, Elissa, Kessa) feels natural and goal-driven, with distinct idiom per speaker. The line "brambled hope" in narration reads as purposeful diction, matching Mara's seasoned voice. Psychic distance is controlled; no head-hopping. Filter verbs ("watched," "admiring") appear but do not dull immediacy. The prose carries a consistent, measured texture appropriate to a ghost with centuries of experience.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high—most lines advance character, plot, or atmosphere. The opening paragraph sets voice and stakes cleanly. Minor scaffold appears: "she drifted… she manifested… she moved" follows a repetitive stem pattern in the early middle, and "because" is used three times in Mara's final speech, creating slight redundancy. The metaphor "brambled hope" is vivid and consistent. Clarity is strong; no loops or muddles touch the closure beat. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The ghost-as-community-organizer premise offers a fresh inflection on the "stranger unites fractured settlers" template. The unsigned chalk messages provide a specific, grounded method that feels earned. The floating rock arches and orchard planet add texture but remain decorative rather than integral to the turn. Emotional truth—tentative rebuilding after crisis—rings authentic. The transformation test is borderline: the core arc could function with different names and places, though the chalk/ghost combination adds modest specificity. Risk-taking is moderate; the piece commits to its premise without bold structural or perspectival leaps.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's altruistic choices (manifesting to ring the bell, writing chalk messages, orchestrating exchanges) create every key turn. She is present across all three gates: setup (opening paragraphs), development (nightly messages that prompt exchanges), and payoff (final scene where she acknowledges shared work). Causally indispensable; without her agency, the plot collapses. Her ghosthood enables unique tactics (ectoplasmic chalk-writing, centuries of patience). Visible cost: continued labor and the acknowledgment that recovery is slow and incomplete. Strong beat involvement and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The butterfly garden watering bell appears in two distinct beats: Mara rings it at dawn to announce her presence (setup), and Kessa rings it twice at the ending (payoff). Its return charges the final image with community acknowledgment. No middle development—it does not constrain a choice between the two uses. The bell's reprise reweights meaning (solitary signal becomes collective call), satisfying the lyric-resonance allowance. Swappability is low; the bell's brass chime and garden association fit the tone. Closure linkage is strong, lifting the score into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The "nebula of respite" appears only in one line near the ending: "a cosmic cloud of gas and dust where new stars were born." It is mentioned as a visual detail and then used metaphorically in Mara's speech ("sometimes respite isn't a place…"). The concept does not shape stakes or tactics on the page; it functions as thematic echo rather than causal driver. Setup and development gates are missing; it arrives late (final third) and does not constrain choices. The metaphorical link to "respite" is clear but ornamental. Cap at 4.6 for late introduction; functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Strangely trustworthy" is attributed to the chalk messages: "something in the messages felt strangely trustworthy—not because of what they said, but because they asked for nothing except connection." This trait enables the settlers' first exchanges (one key turn). Setup is present (messages appear early), and development occurs (exchanges begin), but closure participation is indirect—the trait is not revisited in the ending. The attribute is label-described rather than dramatized through embodied cost. Functional and causal in one beat, but swappable with "reassuring" or "genuine." Mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Reexamine" appears in Joren's pivotal announcement: "I think we should reexamine how we've been handling this crisis." This action is the turning point where collective effort becomes explicit policy. Setup is implicit (settlers have been fragmenting), development is this exact beat (the reexamination prompts shared recovery), and payoff follows (cooperative work resumes). The action is not swappable—replacing "reexamine" with "change" or "fix" would lose the reflective, self-critical tone that matches the story's theme. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The method—messages chalked onto deserted sidewalks at dawn—is signaled early and its mechanics matter throughout. Mara writes seventeen messages in the first round, each mapping resources and needs. The method shapes multiple beats: it prompts the first exchanges, grows more complex over two weeks, and is referenced in Mara's final line ("already planning tomorrow's messages"). Setup, development, and payoff gates are all met. The method is irreplaceable; the specificity of dawn, chalk, deserted sidewalks, and anonymity drives the settlers' trust. High causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The orchard planet with floating rock arches is introduced early and provides atmospheric texture. The orchards supply the blight crisis (dominant stake), and the arches frame visual moments (nebula above the western arch). However, the arches do not constrain choices or supply resources that affect outcome—they are postcard description. The orchards' silver leaves and the valley floors establish spatial grounding but remain backdrop. Setup is strong, development is weak (no middle choice shaped by setting), and payoff is indirect (arches frame the sky in the ending). Functional but not essential.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The timeframe "after strangers become family" anchors the story's premise: settlers had bonded, then fractured under the blight. This history is told in the opening paragraphs and motivates Mara's intervention. The timeframe does not tighten decisions or tactics on the page—there is no live clock. The two-week span of message-writing is mentioned but does not create urgency. Setup is clear (opening summary), but development and payoff are absent. The timeframe is functional context but replaceable with "after years of shared labor" or similar phrasing. Mid-low band.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Mara's motivation to orchestrate collective effort is dramatized in every beat: ringing the bell, writing messages, observing exchanges, planning future messages. The desire is tested when she must persist nightly despite slow progress. Setup (opening declaration), development (repeated message-writing across weeks), and payoff (final acknowledgment of shared work) are all present. The motivation is irreplaceable—removing it collapses the plot. Friction between her want (community survival) and cost (ongoing solitary labor that becomes shared burden) is visible. Strong causal pressure and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The tone "brambled hope" is explicitly named in Joren's announcement: "His voice carried the brambled hope of someone who'd lost faith and found it again, scarred but genuine." The phrase captures the story's mix of fragility and resilience. Tone is coherent through turns—tentative exchanges, slow recovery, ongoing work—and modulates with pressure (from despair to guarded optimism). Setup is implicit in the blight crisis, development is the tonal midpoint (Joren's speech), and payoff is the cautious final image (bell ringing, more work ahead). The tone charges the ending but is not causally indispensable; a near-synonym like "fragile optimism" could replace it.</comment>
