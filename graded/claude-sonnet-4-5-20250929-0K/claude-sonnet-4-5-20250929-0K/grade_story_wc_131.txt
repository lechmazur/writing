<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Miriam's interiority is specific and embodied through the smell-memory trigger and her patient methodology. However, her motivation to "matter" and achieve "visibility" is stated rather than dramatized through contradictory impulses under pressure. The final satisfaction feels too complete—no visible cost or foreclosed path accompanies her transformation into "keeper of sense memories." The character arc lands as wish fulfillment rather than earned stasis with sacrifice.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly (library, dawn, Miriam). The piece follows an Accumulative lens with a Resonant Reconfiguration attempted at closure (Miriam achieves visibility through preservation). However, the cost remains conceptual and asserted rather than felt on the page—no specific renunciation or trade-off is dramatized. The graduate student's gratitude and Miriam's satisfaction read as external validation without visible price. The "weeks" summary compresses what should be pivotal beats, flattening the final turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The library's shadowed stacks, pipe chases, and crawl spaces are vivid and purposeful, shaping Miriam's movements and discoveries. The "sapphire hush" recurs with atmospheric consistency. The tape reels' smell (iron oxide, aged acetate) triggers memory and constrains her choice to surface them. Spatial choreography through maintenance access and mechanical rooms remains clear throughout.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—Miriam's need to matter—is signaled early but never tightens into a choice that forecloses options. The power outage triggers discovery, but coincidence initiates rather than complicates. The weeks-long donation sequence summarizes rather than dramatizes escalation. No visible trade-off or risk accompanies her decision to surface the tapes; the resolution grants her exactly what she wants without cost.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The sense-memory theme (voices reaching across distance, preservation as connection) emerges organically from the tape reels and cassette-player flashback. The final image of Miriam as "keeper of sense memories" attempts resonance but tips into on-the-nose articulation: "translating iron oxide and acetate into belonging" explicates rather than trusts the prior particulars. The graduate student's whispered thanks offers emotional closure but no complexity or counter-reading.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with distinct perceptual filtering (Miriam's methodical attention, scent-triggered memory). The prose voice is consistent and controlled. However, "She had been trying for so long to understand how to matter" and "keeper of sense memories" drift into abstract, thesis-like phrasing that feels authored rather than lived. Psychic distance tightens appropriately during the grandmother flashback and loosens for the donation reveal without head-hopping.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; information density is high in the discovery beats. Minor scaffold appears: "She needed only to watch" + "She needed only" constructs a template stem. The phrase "sapphire hush" recurs three times, functioning as motif but risking ornament. "Achieved visibility—not as a body taking up space, but as a presence that preserved" over-explains the metaphor already enacted. No loops obscure causality or closure, keeping penalties moderate.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>The crawl-space dweller rescuing institutional memory offers a fresh angle on invisibility and preservation. However, the emotional arc follows a familiar template: marginalized figure discovers purpose through secret good deeds and receives validation. The weeks-long summary and frictionless success deflate risk. The final image ("that was enough") gestures toward earned wisdom but the prior beats haven't charged it with ambiguity or cost, leaving the originality more conceptual than executed.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Miriam's choices (descending, gathering reels, leaving donations) create the story's forward motion. She initiates discovery and decides to surface the tapes without external pressure forcing the choice. However, her decisions feel uncontested—no visible cost or tactical constraint shapes her actions. Present across all major beats and essential to closure, but her agency operates without friction.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The tape reels appear in discovery (Margaret Chen's reel held "like scripture"), trigger the smell-memory flashback, and drive the donation sequence. The object's fragility and sensory specificity (iron oxide, aged acetate) matter. However, handling occurs primarily in one extended beat; the reels are gathered and then summarized across weeks rather than returned with reweighted meaning in a distinct later scene. Strong setup and closure linkage, moderate middle development.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Sense memory is dramatized through the tape-smell flashback (grandmother's cassette player, connection across distance) and shapes Miriam's stake (voices preserved = mattering). The concept informs her motivation and charges the thematic closure. However, it does not constrain tactical choices or force trade-offs on the page—Miriam enacts preservation without competing costs or failures tied to memory's mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Kindly methodical" appears in the opening line and describes her headlamp movements and systematic cache-building. The trait characterizes her approach but does not enable or constrain a specific choice with visible cost. It remains label-adjacent rather than dramatized through a trade-off (e.g., methodical patience causing her to miss a time-sensitive opportunity).</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Caching is established early (books, blanket, tinned food) and expanded when Miriam caches the rescued reels in her crawl space. The action recurs and shapes her preservation work. However, the cache itself does not create a key turn or introduce a cost—it facilitates her goal without complication. Present across beats and consistent with character, but functionally it could be replaced with "storing" or "hiding" without altering stakes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Uncovering in pipe chases is signaled early (Miriam descends through maintenance access, discovers the mechanical room) and recurs ("worked in the renewed darkness," "continued her methodical work"). The method shapes her access to forgotten materials and her invisibility. However, the mechanics are summarized rather than pressured—no pipe-chase hazard or discovery risk alters her tactics. Present in setup and middle; contributes to closure frame.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The shadowed library at dawn anchors orientation and mood. The power outage triggers the heating-system whine that leads Miriam deeper. The crawl space and pipe chases constrain her movements and preserve her invisibility, shaping both her discovery and her donation strategy (the vent allows her to watch unseen). The setting pressures choices and supplies the discovery mechanism. Present in opening, middle exploration, and final image ("shadowed library").</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The power outage at dawn initiates the heating-system malfunction and Miriam's descent. Emergency generators kick in by noon, marking elapsed time. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—Miriam works across "weeks" in summary without a deadline or escalating urgency. The flicker recurs in the final line as atmospheric closure but does not constrain tactics. Setup and reprise present; middle pressure absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Miriam's desire to matter and become visible is stated early ("trying for so long to understand how to matter") and drives her choice to surface the tapes. The graduate student's gratitude and Miriam's realization enact the fulfillment. However, the motivation is told more than dramatized—no on-page friction between wanting visibility and fearing exposure, or between competing visions of mattering. Present across arc; conflicted execution weak.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Sapphire hush" appears three times (opening, midpoint return to darkness, final dawn) and establishes a consistent atmospheric register. The tone remains quiet and contemplative throughout, modulating slightly when Miriam feels the chest-unlock and witnesses the librarian's reverence. However, the tone does not shift under pressure or charge the final image with new emotional weight—it sustains one mood rather than deepening it. Coherent and purposeful; limited range.</comment>
