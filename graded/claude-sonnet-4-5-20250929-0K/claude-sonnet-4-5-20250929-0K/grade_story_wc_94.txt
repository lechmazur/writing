<question>1</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Mara's interior is concrete and charged with contradictory impulses—both angry and still, silenced yet screaming. Her ritual with the timer and the deliberate discipline of twenty-minute intervals embody her resistance without therapy-speak. However, her motivations and choices trend toward witness and documentation rather than decisions that narrow options; she observes and endures more than she acts under fresh pressure. The final choice to keep writing feels inevitable from the opening rather than a path foreclosed by fresh cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the storm, timer ritual, and poem-as-contraband motifs layer to reweight Mara's stance from wounded exile to active archive. Orientation anchors promptly (observatory, three months post-incident, poet under censorship). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—she chooses to remain at her post, mapping scars—but the cost is conceptual rather than felt on the page; no live option is visibly foreclosed in the final beats, only a reaffirmation of prior commitment. The piece teaches its pattern early and holds the lens, but the ending restates rather than tightens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The observatory perched above the cloudline—copper dome, lightning, thin air—constrains Mara's choices by enabling clarity and isolation. The darkroom timer is handled twice (salvaged artifact, wound repeatedly) and charges the closure rhythm. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: "electrical veins split the sky," "storm-kissed wonder," air "too pure to corrupt." The micro-setting (timer, sealed envelope, notebook) functions as world enough for this single-scene vigil.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: Mara seeks to map collective wounds and continue resistance after censorship. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens—storm imagery, timer ritual, contraband distribution—but does not tighten or narrow options; she performs the same vigil at the start and end. No reversal or fresh cost forecloses a path; the storm moves on, she remains, and the final image reaffirms rather than alters. One meaningful deepening is visible (the recognition of determination, not hope), but escalation is lateral rather than compressive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—resistance through documentation, silence transformed into testimony—emerges organically from the timer ritual, contraband poems, and cartography-of-scars metaphor. The final image ("keeping vigil over the spaces between what was said and what was true") reweights prior material without stating a moral. Subtext operates in the storm's "furiously tranquil" contradictions mirroring Mara's internal state. Minor thematic echo present: "making longitude and latitude from loss, turning silence itself into testimony" leans close to articulating the thesis, though it remains in scene context rather than authorial intrusion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>POV is stable third-close on Mara; perceptual signature is distinct (storm as moral landscape, cartography metaphors, poetic compression). Diction is elevated but remains anchored to Mara's role as poet: "rarefy," "conspiracy of whispers," "longitude and latitude from loss." Psychic distance modulates purposefully—tighter under the storm's illumination, wider during reflective passages. Some elevated phrasing ("storm-kissed wonder," "naked machinery of power") flirts with over-writing but stays voice-motivated. No dialogue present; internal voice is coherent throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "electrical veins," "cartography of scars," "rarefied truth," "conspiracy of whispers," "broken promise city." In peak beats (the storm paragraphs, closure vigil), nearly every sentence carries metaphor without clear pattern-teaching or fresh pressure; this risks overwriting. Template cadence appears in the timer-ritual framing: "Twenty minutes of watching. Twenty minutes of writing…" recurs without variation. Minor paraphrase loop: "she was still here, still breathing, still witness" and "remained at her post, keeping vigil" restate endurance without added charge. Information density is solid elsewhere; no hard causality breaks, but the figurative load blunts momentum in the final third.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The censored-poet-in-exile premise is familiar; transformation arises through the specific ritual (darkroom timer as resistance metronome, bus-timetable dead drop) and the cartography-of-scars conceit. The observatory setting and storm-as-mirror are vivid but not wholly fresh. Emotional specificity—"not hope exactly, but its cousin. Determination, maybe"—avoids generic templates. The timer device and sealed-envelope method offer memorable particulars, but the emotional arc (wounded → enduring witness) follows a recognizable path. No bold structural risk; the piece commits fully to its lyric vigil mode without retreat.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mara's role as censored poet frames the premise and motivates the vigil. She makes micro-choices (winding the timer, folding the poem, planning tomorrow's drop) but no key turn emerges from fresh decision under pressure; she continues a ritual established before the story opens. Present in setup, middle reflection, and closure, but her choices reaffirm rather than alter.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The darkroom timer appears in three beats: salvaged from grandmother's funeral, used to measure vigils, wound again at closure. It structures Mara's resistance rhythm and charges the final image ("ticked on, measuring out her resistance"). The object is handled on the page and its mechanics (twenty-minute intervals) constrain her tactics. Removing it would collapse the ritual's specificity, though the vigil itself could survive with a generic clock.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"A vigil in pause" is named once via the therapist's label and thematically echoed in the timer-structured intervals. The concept shapes tone and pacing but does not create a specific on-page choice or narrow options; Mara's vigil proceeds without conflict between pausing and acting. Present as thematic frame, but not causal.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Furiously tranquil" is attributed to the storm and explicitly mirrored in Mara's state: "Rage and peace existed simultaneously in those clouds… She was both angry and still, wounded and healing, silenced and screaming." Label-only in both applications; no on-page action demonstrates the contradiction constraining or enabling a choice. Present in middle reflection but ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Rarefy" appears once: "Her words had to rarefy now, become essential as oxygen at high altitude." The concept shapes her method (distilled truth, no decoration) and justifies the poem's compression, but no turn traces directly to this action. Thematic and method-shaping, but not plot-driving. Swappable with "distill" or "purify" without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.3</grade><comment>The sealed envelope wedged in the bus timetable is seeded early (tomorrow's plan) and described at closure setup ("folded the poem carefully… wedge it into the old bus timetable at the terminal downtown"). The underground network's mechanics are sketched but not tested on the page. Method is signaled and shapes the contraband premise, but the act occurs off-page tomorrow. One beat of preparation, no middle use, no closure participation beyond mention.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory above clouds provides isolation, thin air that mirrors rarefied truth, and the cloudline vantage that enables witness. Lightning dictates her writing rhythm ("wrote in those bright flashes"). The setting supplies both resource (altitude, clarity) and pressure (isolation, exposure). Present in setup, middle storm beats, and closure image; removing it would collapse the premise. The gap in clouds revealing the city below is a key visual turn.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"When masks slip" is anchored to the inciting incident three months prior (the night her defiance was seen and she was labeled UNRELIABLE). The timeframe contextualizes her exile but does not tighten decisions in the present; tonight's vigil unfolds without a live clock. Setup only; no middle or closure pressure from the temporal marker.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The cartography-of-scars motivation is dramatized: "Every censored word was a landmark. Every disappeared person was a canyon carved by grief." It drives her nightly ritual and the poem-writing beats. However, the desire is stated rather than tested by conflicting costs; no friction arises between mapping scars and another want. Present in setup reflection, middle documentation, and closure ("patient mapmaking"), but never conflicted on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Storm-kissed wonder" appears once in the final third: "Storm-kissed wonder filled her as she wrote, the strange beauty of surviving what should have destroyed you." The tone coheres across the piece—awe mixed with defiance, lyric intensity under pressure. The storm imagery modulates from electrical fury to sliding east, and the tone shifts from wounded to determined. The final image ("storm moved on, but Mara remained") charges the tone with endurance, though the phrase itself is more label than embodied sensation.</comment>
