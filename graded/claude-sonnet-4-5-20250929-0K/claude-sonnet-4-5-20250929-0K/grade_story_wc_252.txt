<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's interior voice shows distinct texture ("brutal tenderness of denying yourself") and embodied contradiction when facing the choice. Kael's wound-concealing swagger and his final tearing admission "I'm not my father" feel earned. However, the epiphany moment—"understanding blooming like bioluminescence"—tips into stock metaphor, and the final decision arrives without sufficient prior cost: neither character's obligations receive on-page friction that would make "detaching together" painful in real time. The transformation reads declared more than dramatized.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Orientation is clean by ~60 words (dock, Mira, dawn, cargo). The piece establishes a Situational lens: pressure accumulates through the scrimshaw discovery, Kael's revelation, and the whale's call, crystallizing in the joint decision to sail. Closure is Charged Poise—the final image ("Show me how to sail") reconfigures their prior servitude with undeniable pressure. However, cost remains more asserted than shown: Mira's "phantom weight of obligations" is named but not tested on the page, and the whale's summons arrives as external convenience rather than earned causality. The ending feels posed rather than paid.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe is vivid ("dawn painted... in shades of copper and pearl") and returns at the ending to anchor the choice spatially. Mira's calloused hands and the scrimshaw's grooves supply tactile detail that charges key beats. The dock's physical labor shapes Mira's identity and the weight she must shed. The whale's call vibrates "through the dock pilings and into their bones," integrating sound into spatial pressure. Minor slip: "sublittoral fringe" is ecologically specific (the zone between high and low tide) but the text uses it more as atmospheric label than constraint—no tidal mechanics affect the choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—freedom from servitude versus obligation—is signaled early and tightens when the whale calls. The scrimshaw functions as a pressure object, and Kael's confession ("The water calls me, Mira") forces Mira's decision. However, escalation is largely emotional assertion rather than tactical narrowing: Mira's obligations are named but never dramatized as a live counter-pull that she must work against. The final choice feels like mutual permission rather than a trade-off with visible cost. One meaningful tightening is present, but cost clarity is weak.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Theme—freedom through self-acceptance—emerges from the scrimshaw map, the whale's call, and the characters' parallel struggles. The final image ("Show me how to sail") gestures toward transformation without moralizing. However, the piece leans on prompt-adjacent phrasing: "freedom in embracing what you really are" and "terrible, beautiful liberation of finally embracing their true nature" echo workshop clichés. The disappearing island functions more as metaphor than earned particulars. The ending avoids sermon but also avoids a non-literal answer; the question is resolved tidily rather than reweighted.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mira's perceptual signature is strong: "brutal tenderness," "balletic," "phantom weight" give her voice texture. Dialogue carries subtext—Kael's "That's mine" conceals longing, and Mira's "Pirates don't own things" tests him. Free indirect style is clean. However, elevated diction at peak moments ("understanding blooming like bioluminescence," "negotiated their ancient border") drifts above dock-worker register without voice motivation. Kael's interior access remains shallow compared to Mira's, but since the piece holds her POV throughout, this is appropriate. One minor filter-verb stack in the opening paragraph ("had always been," "had learned") is acceptable for scene-setting.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and sentence openings avoid template runs. Information density is high in the scrimshaw discovery beat. However, the piece carries pervasive overwriting: "impossible coastlines," "electric with vulnerability," "blooming like bioluminescence," "desperate hope," "terrible, beautiful liberation" stack figurative language without pattern-teaching or payoff. The final paragraph loops thematically: "finally ready to be found" paraphrases "finally embracing their true nature" from two lines prior. The opening line is strong, but the closing image is diluted by summary ("already feeling... already beginning") rather than a single sharp action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The combination of scrimshaw map, disappearing island, and whale's call is specific, but the emotional arc—two people trapped by duty find mutual permission to leave—follows a widely used template. The "Tide Dancer" nickname and the Treaty of Tides backstory add texture, but neither alters the core stakes. The ending's synthesis (joint departure toward self-acceptance) feels predetermined rather than surprising in hindsight. No fresh inflection reweights prior material; the story executes its premise cleanly but does not transform it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>Mira discovers the scrimshaw, recognizes its significance, and makes the final choice to sail. However, her agency is largely reactive: Kael initiates revelation, the whale calls externally, and her decision arrives as acceptance rather than costly turning point. She shapes two beats (discovery, closure) but does not drive escalation.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The scrimshaw appears in three beats: discovery (wedged between crates), Kael's claim, and the joint decision (hands joined on the bone). Its map and grooves supply tactile detail, and "unlocks things" reprises at closure when Mira understands its function. It enables the final choice but does not constrain prior tactics; cost is tied to the decision, not the object's mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>The disappearing island is mentioned in exposition ("a place that surfaced once in a generation") and returns as metaphor at the ending ("waiting, and they were finally ready"). It does not shape on-page tactics or narrow options; it functions as thematic destination rather than active stake. No middle beat tests its mechanics or cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>"Unlocks guarded hearts" is attributed to the scrimshaw and echoed when Mira sees Kael's "guarded heart finally cracking open." It labels the theme but does not constrain action: the whale's call and Kael's confession do the work. The trait is ornamental.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Detach" is named twice—once when Mira says "We detach together, or not at all," and once when she feels "the dock's grip loosening." It frames the closure choice and reprises with reweighted meaning. However, the action itself (leaving) is not dramatized; we see decision, not departure. It shapes the final image but does not drive middle escalation.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The whale's call appears in two beats: first as "sound... rising from depths," then closer and "patient and insistent." It triggers the final decision and supplies the method ("by the call"). However, it arrives as external convenience rather than earned summons; no prior beat establishes why it calls now or how the characters must respond. It shapes closure but not tactics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The sublittoral fringe is named three times: opening description, mid-scene anchor ("where land and sea negotiated"), and closure grounding. It supplies vivid sensory detail and micro-setting pressure (dock work, tidal zone). The scrimshaw is found "wedged between two crates," and the dock's physical demand shapes Mira's servitude. It constrains identity and charges the final image of departure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"After violence becomes impossible" appears once in exposition ("after the Treaty of Tides, when the warring nations had finally exhausted themselves into peace"). It establishes backstory but does not tighten present decisions or create a live clock. The timeframe is static context, not a shaping constraint.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Freedom is dramatized in Kael's confession ("I'm supposed to sail... not rot among ledgers") and Mira's recognition of "the brutal tenderness of denying yourself." The desire drives the closure choice. However, "embracing one's true nature" is told in near-prompt language at the ending, diluting friction. The want is clear, but the cost of pursuing it remains more asserted than tested on the page.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Combative tenderness" is embodied in "Pirates don't own things" paired with "desperate hope," and in "fierce and gentle" at the decision. The tone modulates: Mira's efficient grace at opening, Kael's defensive rawness mid-scene, and the final "terrible, beautiful liberation." However, the ending tilts lyric-soft without sustaining the combative edge; the tone charges the middle beats but flattens at closure.</comment>
