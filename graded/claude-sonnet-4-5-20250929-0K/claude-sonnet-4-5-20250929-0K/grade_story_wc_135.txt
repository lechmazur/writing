<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marina's reactive vision is embodied through concrete micro-choices (the valve, the staggered viewing intervals, walking away from reunions toward the archive). Interior contradiction surfaces in her simultaneous hope and guardedness, her need to measure emotional exposure in ten-second doses. The final walk with Thomas earns a shift from solitary archivist to bridge-builder, and the cost—seventeen years of lonely attention—is visible. Thomas remains somewhat thin, but his trembling acceptance of the valve and request to see the archive apply enough pressure to test Marina's stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The story teaches an Accumulative/Textural lens: Marina's reactive cataloging accumulates meaning until the valve transaction reweights her archive from burden to bridge. Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The closure—Marina leading Thomas to the archive and recognizing "the harder work"—lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): her solitary waiting transforms into active reconnection with visible emotional cost (seventeen years of absence-mapping now shifts to helping the returned). One tightening deepens the dominant stake: her reactive instinct leads her to Thomas, and the valve exchange narrows her role from passive recorder to active participant.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Ivory Harbor's rain-darkened planks steaming in returning sun and white stones gleaming anchor the setting with sensory specificity and filtered through Marina's archivist attention. The valve—"wedged between cobblestones"—functions as micro-setting that constraints her final choice: she kept it because it mattered, and offering it to Thomas becomes the bridge. The archive building itself charges the final image as the door opens and "seventeen years of careful attention spilled out into the light." Spatial choreography (pier, crowd, walking up from harbor) tracks cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—whether Marina's cataloging of absences will matter when the exiled return—is signaled early and tightens when she spots Thomas and realizes "why she'd kept the valve." Her choice to approach him and offer the fragment forecloses her solitary observer role with visible cost: she must now engage directly, teach the returned to see themselves in preserved fragments. The staggered-interval viewing method shows her managing overwhelming presence after years of absence, adding tactical texture. One meaningful deepening: the valve transaction transforms her understanding of her own work from monument to empty spaces into a bridge for the returned.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—whether careful attention to what's lost can restore meaning for those who return—emerges through Marina's archive practice and the valve exchange without thesis statement. The final image (archive door opening, seventeen years spilling into light) offers a resonant answer: preservation enables reconnection, and the cost is the archivist's isolation. "To hearten those who returned" articulates purpose but follows from concrete action. The shift from mapping absences to teaching recognition deepens the thematic question. No overt moralizing; the harder work ahead remains open.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Single-POV focalization is stable and controlled; Marina's perceptual signature filters everything through reactive archival attention (the valve "seemed to matter," staggered viewing intervals). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven when present; Thomas's "I thought everything would be gone" and Marina's "Nothing's gone" advance plot and carry subtext about erasure and preservation. Interior diction stays consistent and character-particular ("monument to empty spaces," "navigated absences"). Narrative distance modulates purposefully: close during the valve exchange, wider during the reunion panorama. No head-hopping or filter-verb excess.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no template cadence or paraphrase loops detected. Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (setting, interiority, and motif work). "The rain had left everything clean and bright, the white stones of the harbor gleaming like promises kept" threads sensory detail with thematic charge without overwriting. One small scaffold: "she realized as she spoke" is a mild filter, but voice-motivated. No figurative muddle, pronoun confusion, or temporal drift. Opening and closing lines anchor voice and stakes cleanly. Zero text-artifact issues that obscure cause/effect or dull closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The premise—an archivist cataloging what the exiled left behind for seventeen years—offers a fresh angle on return narratives by centering the one who stayed and watched. The valve as talisman and the reactive vision trait particularize Marina's methodology beyond generic record-keeping. The staggered-interval viewing technique feels earned from her character rather than decorative. Emotional specificity (measuring reunion in ten-second doses, recognizing Thomas through shared careful attention) avoids generic reunion templates. The transformation test passes: swapping names/places would lose the archive's specificity and the herald's trumpet valve's symbolic charge.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marina (ocean-spray archivist) is present throughout; her choices to catalog fragments, keep the valve, approach Thomas, and offer the valve create the story's key turns. Her decision to walk him to the archive and her realization that preservation enables reconnection drive the closure. The trait shapes stakes and tactics on every page; removing this exact character would collapse the story's logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The herald's trumpet valve appears in three beats: discovery ("found wedged between cobblestones three summers ago"), talisman in her pocket during the return, and the exchange with Thomas. Its mechanics—a broken piece of the instrument that should have announced their return—charge the irony and earn the closure moment. Thomas's trembling acceptance reweights its meaning from private talisman to bridge. Removal would break the causal chain that connects Marina to Thomas and the story's thematic payoff.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Navigated absences frames Marina's methodology ("monument to empty spaces, to navigated absences—the careful charting of what was no longer there") and shapes her dominant stake. The concept constrains her choices: she cannot predict what will matter, so she trains herself to recognize significance reactively. The closure reweights this practice from mapping absences to helping the returned recognize themselves in fragments, a shift from passive navigation to active reconnection with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Reactively visionary is seeded early ("learned to work reactively rather than proactively," "trained herself to recognize significance in the moment it appeared") and enables the key turn: spotting Thomas and understanding why she kept the valve. The trait's cost—loneliness, inability to explain why objects matter—is visible. However, the middle beats rely more on the archive practice than on reactive vision constraining a specific choice, keeping it mid-range.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Hearten appears late but as the explicit realization that redefines Marina's seventeen-year project: "To hearten those who returned. To show them that the seventeen years hadn't erased them." The action shapes the closure directly—her choice to walk Thomas to the archive and teach him to see his significance in preserved fragments. The verb's introduction at ~60% and its transformation of prior cataloging into future work earn it strong integration despite late arrival.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Staggered intervals is seeded early (viewing the reunion "in measured doses—ten seconds... then looking away... then ten more seconds") and explained as survival tactic ("the only way she could bear the intensity"). It reappears in the archive description ("some I kept in staggered intervals—couldn't process it all at once"). The method shapes her approach to overwhelming presence and absence, constraining her choices. Removal would lose the specific texture of her coping mechanism, though the core plot would survive.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Ivory Harbor appears in the title and opening, with rain-darkened planks steaming and white stones gleaming. The "after rain" state anchors the moment of return visually. The harbor supplies the spatial anchor for the reunion and Marina's departure with Thomas. However, the setting functions more as backdrop than active constraint; the archive building does more tactical work at closure. The rain's cleansing effect supports tone but doesn't alter a key choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>After the exile ends provides the inciting pressure: "The exile ended on a Tuesday, seventeen years after the last ship had vanished." The timeframe tightens Marina's decision to approach Thomas immediately rather than wait, and the seventeen-year span charges every mention of her archive work with accumulated cost. The temporal anchor shapes stakes throughout and reappears in the closing image ("seventeen years of careful attention spilled out into the light"), directly participating in closure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>To compile fragments into meaning is Marina's explicit motivation, seeded early ("cataloging what the exiled had left behind") and tested throughout. The valve exchange dramatizes this drive: she offers a literal fragment to Thomas, then reveals "seventeen years of boxes." Her realization that the purpose is "to hearten those who returned" deepens the motivation with visible cost (her isolation). The friction between solitary compilation and active reconnection drives the final choice.</comment>
