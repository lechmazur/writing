<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's core motivation is clear and her choice to mount the exhibition earns the ending, but much remains told rather than enacted—her grandmother's teachings are summarized, her work process with the paintings is compressed into a single paragraph, and the interior contradictions that drive transformation feel muted. The child/grandmother frame at the end gestures at embodied stakes but does not dramatize a moment of genuine struggle or renunciation. Emotional progression reads clean but lacks the layered contradiction that would lift it above competent execution.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: the market's repurposed materials, the vendor's reveal, and Mira's documentation accumulate density toward the final exhibition and its charged reprise of the child observer. Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the exhibition on the platforms reweights overlooked histories, and the closing image of the girl learning to see "between things" crystallizes the thematic transfer with undeniable cost (time compressed, past/present conflated). The causal chain from fragment purchase to hidden-portrait revelation to public display is legible, though much happens in summary between acquisition and exhibition. One persistent constraint—needing the lens to see hidden layers—shapes Mira's tactics and the final image's charge.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The alchemist's market is rendered with vivid, repurposed detail (tenement floors, factory-loom cables) and Mira's use of the lens fragment transforms her perception on the page, fulfilling the micro-setting standard. Spatial choreography is clear across market visit, studio work, and final exhibition; the lighthouse fragment constrains her method and charges the closure image by splitting sunset into "colors that named all the spaces between." Sensory selection (curved glass, impossible colors, open-air platforms) reflects urgency and integrates with action. The setting actively guides choice and amplifies the thematic resonance without overt symbolism.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—honoring overlooked histories before they vanish—is signaled early and tightens when Mira receives the lens fragment, revealing hidden portraits and narrowing her method. The escalation is primarily Accumulative: density of discovered faces and the vendor's instruction reshape Mira's documentary work into a public exhibition. Agency is present (purchase, documentation, exhibition) but much of the transformation happens in summary ("She began to document them…"), reducing the felt immediacy of the escalation. One visible cost exists: Mira returns alone, no longer a child, and the exhibition is her renunciation of passivity, though the price of that stance is more implied than enacted on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the fragment's function, the repurposed market, and the layered paintings: translation as honoring the between-space rather than conversion. The vendor's line "unfasten your assumptions about what translation means" risks didacticism but is quickly grounded in Mira's lens-work and the specific hidden faces. The closing image—child and grandmother, past and present collapsed, light casting rainbows across forgotten names—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without stating a moral. No overt thematic echo in the final paragraph; complexity is maintained through the paintings' refusal to be fully resolved, leaving the act of seeing as the ongoing work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited on Mira with controlled psychic distance; no head-hopping. The vendor's direct address ("You're looking for…") and Mira's interior reflection interweave cleanly. Diction remains within Mira's register—translator's vocabulary, metaphors of layering and seeing—though the vendor's exposition about the lighthouse keeper trends slightly mechanical. Dialogue carries subtext (the vendor's knowledge of Mira's grandmother) and advances plot by providing the fragment and its instruction. Perceptual signature is consistent: Mira notices overlapping realities, repurposed materials, hidden details. Free indirect style is clean, tense is stable, and the prose rhythm modulates appropriately between market visit and studio discovery.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with strong propulsion and varied syntax. Information density is high in the market and lens-reveal beats. Two paraphrase loops appear: the vendor's explanation of the lighthouse keeper's view repeats the paintings' layered-city concept, and the final paragraph cycles through "between things" twice within three sentences. Template cadence in the exhibition paragraph ("she began to document… the paintings became… these were") stacks three parallel constructions without variation. Figurative language (splitting light, compressed time) serves the closure without overwriting. No major grammatical issues or filter-verb stacks. The loops and cadence run merit a modest deduction but do not obscure causality or dull the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The frame—translator seeking meaning through a magical-realist market—synthesizes familiar elements (overlooked histories, repurposed objects, layered art) with the specific lens-fragment mechanism and Mira's documentary method. The lighthouse keeper detail and the market's construction from condemned tenements add texture, but the emotional arc (alone now, honoring grandmother's teaching, public exhibition) follows a well-worn template without a sharp, non-obvious inflection. The lens as both literal tool and thematic vehicle is apt but not transformative. Risk-taking is modest; the ending's compression of time and the girl-observing-girl frame offer some freshness without fundamentally reweighting prior material in an unexpected way.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Mira as between-worlds translator frames her search and shapes the vendor interaction, but her key choices—purchasing the fragment, documenting portraits, mounting the exhibition—are summarized rather than dramatized in decision beats. Present in setup and closure; middle choices exist but lack on-page friction or trade-off moments that would elevate causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The lighthouse lens fragment is handled in three beats: vendor exchange (purchase with backstory), studio use (reveals hidden portraits), and exhibition mounting (splits sunset, charges final image). Its specific property—revealing what light shows—is irreplaceable and constrains Mira's method. Early signal, middle enablement, closure participation all present with visible causal work. Could score higher if the studio beat dramatized a choice or cost tied to using it.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Anchors of intuition" appears in the vendor's instruction and is enacted when Mira uses the fragment to ground hidden portraits in specific human detail. The concept shapes her documentary method and the exhibition's stakes (making history real). Present in setup via vendor dialogue, developed through lens-work, and reprise in closure when "anchoring them at last in memory." Functional role in one major beat (lens revelation) and thematic closure, but could be swapped for a similar grounding metaphor without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Elusively tangible" describes Mira's search object in the opening but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page action with cost. The vendor identifies what Mira seeks without Mira articulating the elusive quality in a choice. Label-only mention; the fragment itself (tangible) and the hidden portraits (elusive until revealed) enact the concept without the attribute driving a trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.7</grade><comment>"Unfasten" is voiced by the vendor as instruction and thematically enacted when Mira shifts from seeking conversion to honoring the between-space. It shapes her interpretive stance and the exhibition's framing but does not generate a dramatized turn with visible cost. Present in middle beat and resonant at closure via the child learning to "see between things," yet the action itself is more conceptual pivot than irreplaceable physical or tactical choice.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Hidden details in paintings are signaled in the opening (paintings with layered city views) and become Mira's method once the lens reveals them in the studio beat. The method enables her documentary work and supplies the exhibition's content. Present by end of first third, constrains middle action (lens-work), and shapes closure (forgotten names made visible). One distinct middle beat and closure linkage; could score higher if the discovery moment dramatized a choice or obstacle tied to the method's mechanics.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The alchemist's market is established early with vivid repurposed detail (platforms from tenement floors, bridge cables from factory looms), supplies the vendor and the fragment, and returns as the exhibition site where the final image occurs. The setting's layered construction mirrors the paintings' themes and provides spatial resources (open-air platforms visible from below). Three-gate presence with thematic resonance; could reach 7+ if the market's height or specific spatial feature constrained a mid-story choice beyond backdrop.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The timeframe "between childhood and now" structures the narrative: Mira recalls childhood visits with her grandmother, returns alone as an adult, and the closing image collapses past/present when the young girl mirrors Mira's earlier self. Time is signaled early, shapes Mira's loss and solitary agency, and charges the closure via compression ("time compress—childhood and now"). No live clock or deadline tightens tactics in the middle, but the temporal span provides felt cost (grandmother gone, Mira now the guide) and reweights the final image with generational transfer.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Mira's motivation to honor overlooked histories is stated early, dramatized through her search for the fragment and her lens-work revealing hidden portraits, and culminates in the public exhibition. The desire drives her vendor interaction, studio documentation, and closure choice. Friction exists between the abstract goal and the need for a physical anchor, and the vendor interaction enacts that tension. Present across setup, middle beat (lens purchase and use), and closure (exhibition as fulfillment). Could score higher if the motivation faced on-page conflict or competing desire with visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Tone of "eternal instant" is invoked explicitly in the vendor's instruction ("that eternal instant where meaning hovers") and recurs in the closing image ("all languages speaking at once in that eternal instant"). The tone modulates from reflective market visit to focused studio work to charged exhibition scene, and the final compression of time embodies the concept. Coherent through turns and charges the closure, but the explicit label in both vendor dialogue and final paragraph reduces subtlety. Thematic resonance is strong; tonal execution is competent but leans toward declaration rather than pure atmospheric effect.</comment>
