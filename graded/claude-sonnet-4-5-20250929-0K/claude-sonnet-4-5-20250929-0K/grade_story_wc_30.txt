<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maris is embodied through tactile anchors (bamboo creel, smelting forge) and her fisherman-to-keeper transformation is motivated. The visitor's arc from uncertainty to recognition reads cleanly, though her shift feels somewhat quick. Interior contradiction appears lightly in Maris's dual impulse to preserve what's gone while accepting the loop, but the visitor's choice to keep the scroll lacks visible cost or foreclosed path. Embodied emotion is present ("something shifted in her expression") but the ending smile trends toward resolution without complication.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece anchors who/where/when by the opening paragraph; drive lens is Accumulative/Textural (moon phases, rotating shelves, migrating-fish mobile build pattern and cadence toward the visitor's recognition). Closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the visitor's choice to keep the scroll and her laugh at "tomorrow" crystallize her stance shift with felt cost implied in the renunciation of forward-looking habit. One meaningful deepening occurs when Maris offers the scroll, reweighting the library's function from preservation to active wonder. Cost is conceptual—accepting the endless today—rather than a decisive forfeiture, which keeps the ending in mid-to-high band.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The tidal atrium is vividly realized: glass ceiling, catwalks over seawater channels, geothermal forge, and titan-gear mechanisms all constrain Maris's work and charge the closure (moonlight silvering water, mobile turning). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Maris's priorities (gear clicks, molten metal, scroll texture). The mobile of metal fish functions as micro-setting, recurring in the visitor's mesmerized gaze and the final image where it "swam its ancient, ever-new pattern," directly supporting the migrating-identities theme and the ending's resonance.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake is signaled early: preserving wonder in the endless today. Pressure coheres through the visitor's arrival and her need to remember who she was trying to become, deepening when Maris offers the scroll and the titan-gears reveal navigation/astronomy/architecture texts—a tightening moment that narrows the visitor's confusion into recognition. The visitor's choice to keep the scroll is agency (renunciation of forward-looking habit), though the cost is conceptual rather than a visible trade-off. No explicit antagonist; the temporal loop complicates but does not resolve through luck.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (wonder survives within routine by accepting contradictions) emerges organically from the library's mechanics, the fish mobile, and Maris's origin story without meta-commentary. The scroll's "weight, texture" and the woman's laugh at "tomorrow" offer a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question. Recurrence is purposeful: the bamboo creel shifts from fisherman's tool to scroll holder, and the metal fish charge the final image by embodying migrating identities. The ending avoids moralizing; the visitor's smile and Maris's "whenever today feels right" land with quiet earned wisdom rooted in particulars.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV anchored in Maris; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is clear: tactile focus (gear clicks, bamboo weave, molten metal), filtered through her fisherman-turned-keeper lens. Diction is controlled and lyric without straining ("serenity of winter sunlight filtering through ice"), though some constructions trend ornamental ("that particular peace of winter sun on snow—cold, clear, and somehow warm enough"). Dialogue is minimal, functional, goal-driven; the visitor's "I can't remember" and final laugh advance plot and carry subtext. Distance is stable; no filter-verb stacks or unmotivated register shifts.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual breath. Information density is high in the opening (atrium, gears, moon, seawater channels). Minor scaffold appears: "The titan-gear library was her answer" tells rather than shows the answer through action, and "something essential leaked away: the capacity for wonder" summarizes the world's change in abstract terms. The final image ("ancient, ever-new pattern through the unchanging air") recharges prior material cleanly. No paraphrase loops or template cadence; clarity and propulsion are sustained.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Core premise (library that rotates collections by moon phase in a world where tomorrow disappeared) is specific and non-obvious. The titan-gear mechanism and smelting of identity documents into metal fish are fresh particulars that avoid trope convenience. The visitor's arc and Maris's dual role (fisherman/keeper) synthesize familiar post-apocalyptic wonder-loss with tactile, embodied choices. Risk is present in the accumulative structure and the quiet ending, which heightens stakes without gimmickry. Transformation test: the plot and arc depend on this exact library, this loop, these metal fish; swapping names/places would break coherence.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maris's choice to offer the scroll and gesture to the creel (first third), her explanation of the library's purpose (middle), and her final reply ("whenever today feels right") shape all three beats and the ending's cadence. The smelting decision appears early and drives the mobile's presence at closure. Two gates clearly met (setup, payoff); middle development is present in her dialogue with the visitor. Causal pressure is moderate; her choices enable the visitor's recognition but do not narrow her own options with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The creel appears in paragraph four ("touched its familiar weave, remembering morning fog") and returns when Maris gestures to it, now holding scrolls, prompting the visitor's choice. Two distinct beats; reweighted meaning (fish → scrolls, past → present). Setup and payoff gates met; middle development is light (the creel enables the scroll choice but does not constrain Maris's tactics under pressure). Specificity is strong (bamboo weave, fisherman origin), but the creel could be swapped for another repurposed tool without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Migrating identities frame the library's purpose in paragraph five, drive the smelting action (melting identity cards into fish), and charge the closure image ("migrating now, moving through the same day differently each time" and the mobile's final turn). Present in all three gates with high specificity: the metal fish embody the concept literally and visually. Causal pressure is strong; the concept constrains Maris's design choices and enables the visitor's recognition. Removing it would collapse the story's thematic and visual logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Moon phases control the titan-gear rotation (setup in paragraph one), trigger tonight's counterclockwise reveal (middle beat), and recur in the mobile's formation shifts and the final moonlight image. Three gates met with causal work: the attribute constrains which manuscripts appear and charges the ending's visual rhythm. Specificity is high (three-quarters full, waxing); cost is conceptual (the library's mechanics depend on lunar cycles). Swapping for another cyclical trigger would require rewriting the gear mechanism and closure image.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Smelting identity documents appears early (paragraph six), drives the creation of metal fish for the mobile (middle), and the mobile's presence charges the closure image where it "swam its ancient, ever-new pattern." Three gates met; the action is irreplaceable (melting documents into fish encodes the migrating-identities concept). Causal pressure is strong: without smelting, the mobile and its resonance at closure collapse. Cost is visible (transforming forward-looking promises into static objects that move collectively).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Accepting contradictions is stated explicitly in paragraph five ("By accepting contradictions—that people needed both constancy and change") and demonstrated through the library's design (predictable cycles yielding unexpected combinations). The visitor's arc enacts the method: she holds the scroll without reading it, and the random shelf reveal resonates. Setup and payoff gates met; middle beat is implicit in the gear rotation. Causal work is moderate; the method shapes Maris's design choices but does not constrain a high-pressure decision with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The tidal atrium anchors all action, supplies the geothermal forge for smelting, and the catwalks over seawater channels create spatial specificity. The glass ceiling reveals the moon, triggering gear rotation; the water channels carry "memory" and silver with moonlight in the final image. Three gates met with high causal pressure: the setting enables the library's mechanics and charges closure. Removing the atrium would require a wholesale redesign of the story's spatial and thematic logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The temporal collapse ("after that impossible Thursday when the next day simply failed to arrive") frames the entire world and Maris's library mission. It shapes stakes (preserving wonder in routine) and the visitor's need ("I can't remember who I was trying to become"). Present in setup and payoff (the visitor's laugh at "tomorrow"); middle pressure is light (the loop is backdrop, not a tightening constraint). Specificity is strong, but the timeframe does not alter tactics in a single on-page choice. Swapping for another static-time premise would preserve most story logic.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Preserving wonder is stated in paragraph five and dramatized through Maris's library design, the smelting of documents, and her dialogue with the visitor. The visitor's recognition and choice to keep the scroll enact the motivation's payoff. Three gates met; causal work is moderate (the desire drives Maris's actions but does not face a contradictory want with visible cost on the page). Friction is conceptual (wonder vs. suffocating routine) rather than a dramatized trade-off that forecloses a path.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Wintersun serenity is embodied in the opening's "serenity of winter sunlight filtering through ice" and Maris's economical movements, sustained through the visitor's uncertain steps and Maris's patient replies, and charged in the final image ("that particular peace of winter sun on snow—cold, clear, and somehow warm enough"). Tone modulates subtly with the visitor's shift from uncertainty to recognition without breaking coherence. The descriptor is voice-specific and supports the ending's quiet resonance, though the closing simile trends toward over-articulation.</comment>
