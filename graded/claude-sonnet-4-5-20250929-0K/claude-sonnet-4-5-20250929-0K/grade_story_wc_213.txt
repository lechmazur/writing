<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mara's motivation is concrete and embodied—her choice to override the automated system follows from seven years of sensory training. Her hands-on expertise and resistance to false alarms ground her decision at the climax. Internal contradiction is minimal; she is competent but the rope's vibration provides genuine discovery rather than convenient omniscience. The backstory (seven years, eleven deaths) primes her present stance without flattening momentum, and the final beat earns her quiet validation with visible cost (cracked buttresses, sustained effort).</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Causal with Accumulative texture. Orientation anchors (Mara, sanctuary, Mount Kelspar, storm-testing role) arrive within the first 150 words. The inciting pressure (rope vibration before instruments register) tightens into a manual override decision that narrows options, then escalates to the storm's physical assault. Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mara's method is validated, the valley survives, and she releases the rope with quiet authority—visible cost in the cracked buttresses and her sustained ringing throughout the storm. One meaningful tightening (override → bell → storm) with felt consequence on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The windblown sanctuary, hemp rope texture, altitude ("two miles above"), and cathedral architecture ground the setting early. The rope itself functions as micro-setting: its vibration constrains Mara's choice (she overrides the digital system because the rope "knew"). Sensory detail is filtered through her expertise (barometric pressure, atmospheric rivers, "solstice hush"). The final image—rope settling into stillness—charges closure by embodying her patient vigilance. Environment actively shapes the climactic decision.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake (valley safety vs. board approval of automated systems) is signaled early. One meaningful tightening: rope vibration → instruments lag → manual override → storm validates her judgment. Agency is decision (she "made the switch") with visible cost (cracked buttresses, board scrutiny deferred but present). The convergence event escalates from sensor failure to horizontal tornado threat, and Mara's sustained ringing through the assault forecloses the path of passive compliance. No coincidental resolution; her earned expertise drives the turn.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme (listening vs. automated noise, old technology vs. modern systems, human judgment in the age of algorithms) emerges through concrete action—Mara's hands on the rope, the digital monitors lagging. The final image (rope settling, "waiting for the next time the mountain would speak") offers a non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in "the board could review their data later"—quiet defiance rather than stated triumph. The solstice hush and her method of "credibly curious investigation" interweave to resist the false-alarm complacency without thesis statements.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>Third-person limited, stable distance, with perceptual signature in "microclimate variations," "atmospheric rivers collided," and tactile focus (rope texture, vibration). Diction remains consistent and voice-motivated; no head-hopping. Brief reflection ("They didn't understand what she'd discovered") anchors in the present via the rope and tilts the override choice. Psychic distance tightens during the storm sequence ("Mara held the rope throughout") without filter clutter. The prose reflects her expertise (barometric pressure drop, old bell pattern) and calm under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance character, setting, or stakes. Sentence variety supports rhythm ("The rope trembled. Not the rough jerk... but a deep thrumming"). Minor scaffold: "her motivation had always been to favor listening over noise" could be leaner; "the kind that spawned the deadly horizontal tornadoes that had killed eleven people five winters ago" carries slight exposition drag. No loops or metaphor muddle at closure. Opening and closing lines anchor and resolve cleanly. Propulsion is steady through the storm sequence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The premise (manual bell-ringer vs. automated storm siren) is a familiar human-vs-algorithm setup, but the rope-as-seismograph angle and the sanctuary's positioning where "atmospheric rivers collided" add specificity. The "three long, three short, three long" SOS pattern and the solstice timing bring texture. Transformation test: plot and arc rely on this exact mountain, rope, and learned vibration frequency; swapping names would lose the cathedral founders' intentional placement. Not groundbreaking, but the synthesis of old bell tower, microclimate expertise, and quiet defiance feels earned rather than template.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Mara appears in every beat. Her choice to override the automatic system (middle) and her sustained ringing during the storm (climax) are key turns driven by her role. Early signal (first paragraph), middle choice (override), closure participation (releases the rope, validated). Causal pressure: her manual judgment narrows the valley's risk. Visible cost: cracked buttresses, board scrutiny deferred. The "humble" descriptor is label-only in the opening but her restraint (resist false alarms) is dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The rope is handled in setup (texture, bleached hemp), development (vibration she detects before instruments), climax (she pulls it in the old pattern), and closure (settles into stillness). It is irreplaceable: the vibration is the discovery, the pull is the agency, the stillness is the resolution. Early signal, causal pressure (override keyed to rope's trembling), closure linkage (final image). Visible cost tied to it (her hands, sustained effort, cracked buttresses from the storm she warned against). Two gates would cap ~6.0; three gates plus strong beat involvement and closure charge push higher.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Zero hour" is the moment the new detection system goes live ("Today marked zero hour for the new detection system"). It shapes the stakes: Mara must prove her unorthodox methods or be proven a fool. The override choice is framed by this test window. Present in setup (second paragraph), implicit in the middle override (vindication vs. failure), and resolved at closure ("the board could review their data later"). Two gates clearly met, third (closure participation) is implied but not explicit in the final image. Swappability: moderate—could be "trial day" without major edits, but the urgency and framing depend on it.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Credibly curious investigation" is mentioned once (fourth paragraph) as a descriptor of her past method, not dramatized in the present scene. No on-page action is shown to be constrained or enabled by this trait during the story's window; her override choice stems from sensory expertise (rope vibration), not curiosity. Label-only in the single mention. Missing setup in action, missing middle beat involvement, missing closure participation. Present as backstory flavor but does not meet the two-gate threshold for ≥6.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"She made the switch then, overriding the automatic systems and routing control to manual." This action is the story's hinge: it redefines options (manual bell vs. automated sirens), escalates stakes (board scrutiny vs. valley safety), and enables the climax (ringing the bell). Early preparation (instruments vs. rope), middle execution (override), closure consequence (valley intact, board deferred). Swappability test: removing or replacing this action collapses the protagonist's agency and the human-judgment theme. Causal pressure and closure linkage are strong. Visible cost: she assumes responsibility and risk.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Tracking microclimate variations" is referenced in paragraph two as her learned skill and again when instruments show "barometric pressure dropping faster than the models predicted." The method is signaled early and its mechanics (watching patterns, reading the rope) enable the override choice. Two beats: her expertise grounds the decision, and the lagging instruments validate her. Missing strong closure participation—the final image focuses on the rope's stillness, not the tracking method itself. Swappability: moderate; could be "reading wind patterns" with minor edits. Two gates met, causal role in middle, but not indispensable at closure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The sanctuary is introduced in paragraph two ("perched on Mount Kelspar's eastern face," "two miles above the valley"), shapes Mara's expertise (microclimate observation point), and pressures the climax ("the storm hit the sanctuary with enough force to crack two of the buttresses"). Early signal, middle constraint (altitude and atmospheric collision enable her method), closure cost (physical damage). Swappability: replacing with a generic "mountaintop station" would lose the cathedral founders' intentional positioning and the rope's historical function. Spatial choreography is clear; the setting alters tactics and outcome.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After the glue dries" becomes "after the epoxy had finally cured" in paragraph three, marking the new detection system's readiness. The timeframe sets up "zero hour" but does not create a live ticking clock during the storm sequence. Setup gate met (paragraph three), but no middle beat where drying time constrains a choice, and no closure participation. The storm's twenty-minute duration is tracked, but that is event time, not the "after the glue dries" element. Swappability: high—could be "after repairs were complete" with no structural loss. Two-gate threshold not clearly met; missing development and payoff.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"To favor listening over noise" is dramatized in paragraph five ("her motivation had always been to favor listening over noise, to resist the modern impulse to broadcast warnings at every minor fluctuation") and enacted in her override choice (ignoring the digital delay, trusting the rope's vibration). The motivation is present in setup, drives the middle decision (manual bell vs. automated sirens), and charges the closure image ("she had listened, and in listening, had heard what needed to be heard"). Friction between board pressure and her method creates cost. Not label-only; the choice and sustained ringing embody it. Three gates met, causal role strong.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"Solstice hush" is named in paragraph five ("the mountain retained that peculiar solstice hush, a quality of silence that seemed to amplify subtle sounds") and modulates into the storm's violence then returns implicitly in the final stillness ("silence returned to the sanctuary"). Tone is coherent through the turns: quiet observation, rising tension, violent assault, earned calm. The hush "amplifies subtle sounds" (rope vibration) and supports Mara's listening method. Closure linkage: the rope "settl[ing] into stillness once more" mirrors the opening motionlessness and recharges the hush. Tone shifts purposefully with pressure and the final image is charged by the return to quiet.</comment>
