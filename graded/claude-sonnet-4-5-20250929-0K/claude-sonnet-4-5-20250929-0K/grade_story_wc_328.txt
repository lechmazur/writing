<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maya's trajectory from clinical detachment to openness carries embodied detail: "her clinical detachment crack like ice," the trembling hand at the phone. The climactic choice—pocketing the arrowhead and asking if the returned come back—shows contradictory impulses (career vs. cosmic possibility) acting simultaneously. Backstory regarding Voss anchors present decisions, but "bitterness began to metamorphose" tilts toward label-speak rather than showing internal friction through micro-choices. The final question forecloses the investigative path with felt cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a situational accent. The phone revelation deepens Maya's stance, and the arrowhead functions as a constraint that crystallizes the choice. Closure reads as Charged Poise: Maya's question and arrowhead pocket reweight her investigative mission with undeniable pressure, though the emotional cost is more implied than viscerally rendered. Orientation is swift (underground garden, Maya's role by paragraph two). One meaningful tightening occurs when Voss's laugh resolves the decade-long grief into an actionable stance.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The underground garden constrains choice: bioluminescent mushrooms, ghost orchids, herbs glowing with moonlight create a coherent reality where natural law bends. The arrowhead's gravitational playfulness (tugs upward) directly charges the closure image. Spatial choreography is clear (stairs, phone on wall, moss), and the setting's defiance of sunlight mirrors Maya's shift from skepticism. No occupation-level herbalism detail is needed at this length; the garden's impossible biology suffices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: whether to expose or join the phenomenon. The phone voices and Voss's laugh deepen pressure, and Maya's question narrows options with visible cost (career vs. transformation). One clear tightening: the arrowhead's offering reframes the investigation as an invitation. Coincidence (Voss's laugh on the phone) complicates without resolving; Maya still must choose. The stakes remain coherent under the accumulative lens, though the escalation is more conceptual than tactile.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme—whether the incomprehensible is predation or transcendence—emerges through the arrowhead, phone, and underground garden rather than statement. Maya's shift from "fortress of skepticism" to "love letter written in the language of the incomprehensible" offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Old Marrow's line "what if it's hunting a better version of us" seeds ambiguity without false equivalence. The final image (arrowhead tugging upward, something impossible blooming) reweights the opening bitterness with earned wonder.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Maya; no head-hopping. Diction is mostly controlled ("frostbitten hope incarnate," "voices...not quite human, not quite wind"), though "cosmic absurdity" and "cognitive contamination" veer toward abstraction in a peak beat. Old Marrow's dialogue carries distinct idiom ("crackling like autumn leaves"). Filter verbs ("thought of," "felt") appear but remain voice-motivated. Narrative distance tightens appropriately as Maya's certainty fractures. Minor: "gravitationally playful artifacts" reads slightly over-wrought for the POV's present stress level.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and most sentences advance character or atmosphere. "Winter killed everything it touched. Down here, life persisted..." creates effective contrast. However, paraphrase loops appear: "bitterness...transformed her into this" followed by "bitterness began to metamorphose" restates within two paragraphs. "Gravitationally playful" recurs without added pressure. Template stem "She thought of" opens two adjacent late-stage sentences. No muddy metaphors; proofreading is clean. Information density is strong in the phone-call beat but thins in the Voss reflection.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The herbalist's underground garden as liminal research site offers a fresh synthesis; "harmony untamed" and gravitationally playful artifacts avoid stock cryptid tropes. The phone as conduit for dimensional voices transforms a mundane object into story-specific tech. Maya's arc—investigator into potential convert—risks familiarity but the frostbitten-hope tone and the arrowhead's tactile pull (tugs upward) keep it grounded. The Voss connection (mentor lost, voice returns) elevates personal stakes beyond template "researcher discovers truth." No close echoes of famous scenes; the piece commits fully to its premise.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya is present throughout and her undercover role frames the stakes. She makes two key decisions: lifting the phone receiver (middle) and pocketing the arrowhead while asking the final question (closure). Her cryptid-research mandate creates the central tension. Her choice alters tactics from exposure to participation. Setup strong, middle and closure participation clear, causal pressure evident.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The arrowhead appears in two distinct beats: Old Marrow examining it mid-story and Maya pocketing it at closure. Its impossible placement (no moss disturbance) and upward tug demonstrate gravitational playfulness. It functions as an offering/warning that reweights Maya's investigative frame into a choice point. Causal pressure: the arrowhead forces the "choose" question. The closure image depends on its presence. Introduced ~30% through; early signal would lift score further.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Harmony untamed" is named in paragraph two and recurs as "the harmony" in the phone voices and Old Marrow's tea scene. It frames the returned ones' transformation and charges Maya's shift from bitterness to wonder. However, it functions primarily as thematic label; no on-page action directly enacts "harmony" as a constraint or tactical resource. The concept shapes stakes (join vs. expose) but does not alter a specific choice's mechanics. Payoff in closure is thematic presence rather than causal pivot.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Gravitational playfulness is demonstrated twice: arrowhead's impossible moss placement and the upward tug Maya feels. These moments constrain interpretation (artifacts defy physics) and enable the final choice (the tug signals invitation). The trait alters one on-page action—Maya's decision to pocket the arrowhead is informed by its playful pull. Setup in paragraph four, payoff at closure. Specificity is high (upward pull, sideways rest in air). Cost connection: the trait marks the boundary between investigator and participant.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Metamorphose" recurs across four beats: the missing undergo it, Maya's bitterness begins to metamorphose, the returned ones report nightly transformation, and the final line signals "something impossible began to bloom." The term defines the core transformation and Maya's arc mirrors it. However, "metamorphose" functions more as motif than decisive action; swapping it for "transform" or "change" would not break plot logic. The ending's bloom image enacts metamorphosis symbolically but not as a physical event that alters tactics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The phone is introduced mid-story (~40%), then used immediately: Maya lifts the receiver, hears static-laden confessions, and recognizes Voss's laugh—all on the page. The method shapes the key reversal (grief into invitation). Its mechanics matter: "old cordless," "mounted on wall," "static washed over her." The phone enables rather than resolves; it delivers information that changes Maya's stance. Setup, development, and closure participation all present. Late signal (not in first third) and slight reliance on convenience (why now?) prevent higher score.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The underground garden frames the entire scene, appears in six beats (descent, bioluminescent glow, moss/arrowhead, ghost orchids, glowing herbs, final bloom), and constrains choice by creating a space where natural law bends. The garden's defiance of sunlight mirrors Maya's thematic question. Spatial choreography (stairs, phone on wall, terrariums) is coherent. The setting enables the ending: "something impossible began to bloom" depends on the garden's reality. Micro-setting (moss, phone placement) alters tactics. Causal pressure, closure linkage, irreplaceability all strong.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The timeframe is established in paragraph two: "Three months ago, the missing had returned." It primes Maya's investigation and anchors the returned ones' ongoing transformation. However, time does not tighten decisions; no clock or urgency tracks across beats. The "after" functions as backstory anchor rather than live pressure. Setup present, but no middle or closure escalation tied to elapsed time. The ending does not hinge on temporal constraint. Functional but replaceable with minor edits ("during the returns" vs. "after").</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Maya's desire to turn bitterness into a cosmic joke is stated explicitly in the final third: "turning that decade of bitterness into the cosmic joke it had always deserved to be: a love letter written in the language of the incomprehensible." It drives the climactic choice (pocket arrowhead, ask the question). Friction is present: career vs. transformation, skepticism vs. wonder. However, the motivation is articulated more than dramatized; earlier beats show bitterness (Voss's loss) but not the "cosmic joke" frame until late. Setup weak, payoff strong. Cost visible in foreclosed investigative path.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Frostbitten hope operates throughout: "frostbitten hope incarnate" (Old Marrow's smile), "breath misting," "frozen earth," "winter killed everything it touched" paired with underground life and blooming impossibility. Tone modulates with pressure—clinical at opening, cracking at the phone beat, tentative wonder at closure. The final image ("something impossible began to bloom") charges the oxymoron with earned weight. Coherent through turns, specificity high (frost/bloom contrast), and tone shapes the ending's emotional register. No static mood; the hope grows warmer as frost imagery recedes.</comment>
