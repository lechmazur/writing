<question>1</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maren's role as leeward tide prophet is established with concrete interior and embodied action; her interpretive method through the copper-wire trees shows character-particular perception. Motivation is clear—transforming obstacles into instruments—and her decisive command to adjust ballast under pressure is earned. However, the interiority occasionally drifts toward exposition ("This was her instrument, built over five years...") without immediate pressure, and the final moment lacks visible personal cost or contradiction; her success feels assured rather than hard-won.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Closure achieves a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Maren's faith in the backwards-flowing current is validated, the orchard survives, and the final image of "copper-wound trees singing their impossible truth" reweights prior material. Drive lens is Causal with strong Accumulative/Textural accent: cloud patterns trigger interpretation, which triggers ballast adjustment, which enables survival. Orientation anchors who/where/when early. One meaningful tightening occurs when the vortex opens and the orchard drifts perpendicular. Cost is conceptual—trust in counterintuitive currents—but the personal or relational price to Maren remains abstract; pointing to an exact sentence where *she* pays a felt cost is difficult, limiting higher reach.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The floating orchard, copper-wrapped trees, and driftwood platform are vividly particular and integrated into action throughout. The blue hour frames perception and urgency. The leeward current and fractal clouds constrain Maren's choices and charge the closure image. Spatial choreography is clear—Maren moves between trees, Deren mobilizes crews, the orchard tilts. Sensory detail is filtered through Maren's professional focus. The xylophone mallet and copper wire function as micro-setting tools that enable her method, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake—survival of the orchard's twenty-seven families—is signaled early and sustained. One meaningful tightening occurs when the vortex forms and Maren must act on her counterintuitive reading within an hour. Her decision to trust the leeward tide and command the ballast shift is agency-driven and narrows options. However, the escalation is single-step: diagnosis → command → success. No reversal or complication tests her interpretation; Deren's hesitation dissolves instantly. The resolution feels ordained rather than contested, and the visible cost at closure is atmospheric rather than personal or relational.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme—transforming obstacles into instruments—emerges through concrete particulars: rising seas teach leeward tides, driftwood becomes foundation, apple trees become oracles. The final image of "backwards-flowing faith and the resonance of copper-wound trees" offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Subtext operates in Maren's restless experimentation and the community's dependence. However, the thematic statement "Every obstacle became an instrument if you understood its resonance" is too explicit, approaching a thesis claim rather than letting the image carry weight. The piece edges toward articulating its own meaning rather than trusting dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and clean throughout; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is distinct—Maren notices cloud fractals, resonance patterns, and backwards currents through her prophet's lens. Diction is controlled and voice-particular: "sketched resonance," "dubbing," "restless euphony" create a consistent idiom. Dialogue is sparse but functional; Deren's brief exchange advances plot and establishes professional trust. The brief reflection on her drowned home anchors present purpose without derailing momentum. Psychic distance remains consistent. No filter-verb stacks or register drift in peak beats.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and propulsive with strong concrete nouns ("xylophone mallet," "copper wire," "driftwood platform"). Sentence rhythm varies purposefully. However, several lines drift toward purple ornament: "restless euphony," "sketched resonance," "acoustic patterns translating to nautical truth" cluster in the middle third, elevating diction without always advancing immediacy. Minor paraphrase loop: "Every obstacle became an instrument" is stated twice in close proximity (middle and near-end). The figurative density in non-peak beats (blue hour description, fractal metaphors) occasionally prioritizes texture over momentum. No major artifacts touch closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The floating orchard, leeward tide prophecy via copper-wire xylophone trees, and fractal cloud-reading offer a fresh synthesis of climate-fiction survival and synesthetic divination. The premise is specific and committed throughout. The transformation of rising seas into navigational wisdom and driftwood debris into infrastructure shows genuine conceptual follow-through. However, the emotional arc—Maren interprets, commands, succeeds—lacks a non-obvious complication or moral calculus that would test her method or faith. The resolution feels structurally inevitable rather than dramatically earned, and the "backwards-flowing faith" motif, while poetic, edges toward allegorical convenience.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Maren is present throughout, frames the problem in paragraph two, interprets cloud patterns across multiple beats, makes the pivotal ballast-adjustment decision that saves the orchard, and appears in the final image. Her choices create the key turn (trusting leeward currents) and drive closure. Early signal, beat involvement (diagnosis, playing trees, commanding action), causal pressure, and closure linkage all present. Cost is conceptual (counterintuitive trust) rather than personal sacrifice, capping slightly below indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The xylophone mallet is introduced early (paragraph two), used in multiple beats (striking trees to build chords, mapping cloud formations), and returns in the penultimate paragraph with emotional charge ("carved from her grandmother's banister in the drowned house"). It enables Maren's method and is irreplaceable as a tactile link to her past. However, it does not constrain a choice or create visible cost; it is a tool that works as intended. Lyric resonance (early seed → charged reprise) lifts it into mid-band, but lack of friction or trade-off limits higher reach.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Sketched resonance" appears early as Maren's interpretive framework, recurs in the middle ("the sketched resonance that built in her mind"), and shapes her tactic of matching tree notes to cloud fractals. It enables her prophetic method and participates in closure ("the resonance of copper-wound trees singing their impossible truth"). However, the concept remains abstract—a metaphor for her process rather than a concrete constraint or trade-off. It functions thematically more than causally, and its mechanics are asserted rather than tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Maren's ability to interpret cloud movements drives the inciting problem (fractal patterns spell catastrophe), her diagnosis of the vortex location, and the ballast-adjustment solution. Present in opening, middle interpretation beats, and implicit in closure success. The trait constrains action (only she can read the signs) and enables survival. However, no visible cost or trade-off is tied to the interpretation itself; her reading is correct and uncontested. The attribute is essential but does not generate friction or deepening choice.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Dub" appears as a verb describing how notes propagate across the copper network ("dubbing itself across the orchard's infrastructure," "dubbing another sequence"). It recurs in two middle beats but does not create a major turn; the propagation is mechanical and successful. The action could be replaced with "broadcast," "transmit," or "spread" without structural loss. Present and functional, but not irreplaceable or causally pivotal to closure.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Fractal generating" is signaled early (clouds form fractal patterns, paragraph two) and explicitly named in the middle ("Her method required fractal generating—each note spawning harmonics that spawned their own descendants"). It shapes Maren's interpretive tactic and appears in the closure image ("clouds' fractal pattern dissolved"). However, the mechanics remain ornamental; the story does not dramatize how fractal recursion alters her choices or creates cost. The method is described more than tested, trending mid-band for setup and thematic presence without causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The orchard afloat is present from the opening line, anchors all spatial action (Maren moves among trees, crews adjust ballast, the platform tilts), supplies the resource network (copper-wrapped trunks trailing into the sea), and participates decisively in closure (the orchard drifts perpendicular via ballast shift). It constrains tactics (must read currents to survive) and charges the final image. Early signal, beat involvement, causal pressure, and closure linkage all strong. Indispensable to story logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"The blue hour" is introduced early (paragraph one), recurs in the middle ("The blue hour deepened, that liminal time when her interpretations came clearest"), and brackets the final moment ("In the blue hour's final moments"). It tightens urgency (Maren has "perhaps an hour") and shapes perceptual clarity. However, elapsed time is not tracked beat-by-beat, and the clock does not force a visible trade-off or escalate pressure beyond the initial framing. Lyric reprise and atmospheric coherence present; live ticking constraint absent.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Maren's motivation—"to turn obstacles into instruments"—is dramatized through her five-year construction of the copper-wire network, her active interpretation of the clouds, and her decisive ballast command. Stated explicitly in the middle ("Every obstacle became an instrument if you understood its resonance") and enacted at closure. However, the desire is never conflicted or tested; no friction between wanting to trust the method and fearing failure. The motivation drives action but lacks internal cost or ambivalence, capping below exceptional.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Restless euphony" is named explicitly in the middle and final paragraphs, describing the escalating urgency of the tree-song and its resolution to silence. Tone remains coherent—liminal, urgent, faith-driven—and modulates from diagnosis to command to relief. The phrase charges the final image. However, "euphony" suggests harmony, which tensions slightly with "restless"; the tonal effect is more declarative than felt. Tone is present and purposeful but not dynamically layered across pressure shifts.</comment>
