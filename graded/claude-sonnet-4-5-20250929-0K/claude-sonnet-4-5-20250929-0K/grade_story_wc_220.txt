<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Calder's motivation to decode the cylinders is clear and his transformation from resignation to purpose is earned through the discovery. Mercy functions more as witness than agent; her nose-work creates the inciting turn but thereafter she observes rather than decides. The interiority leans toward abstract philosophizing ("distance is what killed us") rather than embodied contradiction under pressure. The final choice to organize the settlement feels sudden—no on-page resistance or cost dramatizes what Calder surrenders or risks by sharing the coordinates.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural with a Conceptual Repricing at closure—the woman's voice reframes distance as fear given measurement, and the settlement's collective movement answers the thematic question. Orientation anchors (bloodhound, Calder, scrapyard, post-war) land early. The cylinder discovery at midpoint deepens stakes and the decoding sequence tightens pressure through Calder's seven plays and frantic sketching. Closure reconfigures the wasteland's isolation into connection via the final image of collective feet translating distance; cost is oblique (the settlement's prior solitude) but the conceptual repricing is legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The scrapyard settlement is vivid ("iron cancer, breathing steam and rust") and the "wild hush" establishes a coherent sensory world. The preserved leaf and cylinder reader anchor Calder's workspace with purposeful detail. The wasteland's cracked earth and half-buried bunker supply the discovery that drives the plot. Spatial choreography is clean: Mercy leads three miles out, they return, Calder decodes at his bench, the settlement wakes. The leaf's veins "like roads connecting" charges the final image when Calder clips it to his pack, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting constraining choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: decoding the cylinder to find resources and restore connection. The discovery of the bunker (Mercy's nose catches "something old and urgent") is a solid reversal that narrows Calder's options to the riddle. The woman's voice explaining that "the riddle isn't in the words, but in the listening" and the rhythm-between-words encoding deepens the challenge with a meaningful tightening. Calder's seven plays and decoding six locations demonstrate agency under pressure. The settlement's collective movement at dawn closes with visible cost (ending their solitary isolation), though the transition from Calder's solitary decode to mass organization is compressed and the on-page friction or resistance is minimal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—distance as illusion, closeness as a choice to read hidden maps—emerges organically from the cylinder's message and is charged by the leaf's branching veins and the settlement's transformation. The woman's line "distance had always been an illusion, how the space between people was just fear given measurement" risks thematic echo but is embedded in the discovery beat and reweighted by Calder's tears and the subsequent action. The final image of "hundreds of feet moving together, translating the wasteland's isolation into connection" offers a resonant, non-literal answer without overt moralizing. The motif of "translation" (bodies→voices→distance→closeness) recurs purposefully and constrains the ending without becoming a checklist.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV via Calder is stable; Mercy's interior is filtered through Calder's perception ("her body remembered the work") without head-hopping. Diction is distinctive: "intuitively descriptive quality," "tinted revelations," "wild hush," "grooves worn into earth." The woman's recorded voice carries subtext ("the riddle isn't in the words, but in the listening") and advances plot. Calder's dialogue to Mercy ("Distance is what killed us") is character-specific and stakes-driven. Minor slips: "her spirit had retired from it" and "the sound of hundreds of feet moving together" edge toward elevated register that slightly exceeds the established voice, and the phrase "choosing to read the maps hidden in silence" in the final line borders on thematic summary.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high ("breathing steam and rust," "tinted revelations poured from his speaker in waves of static and voice"). Figurative language is purposeful: the leaf's veins "branching like roads," the scrapyard "like iron cancer." Paraphrase loop: "We were trackers once, weren't we, girl? You found bodies, and I found voices in the dead grooves of history" restates prior material without new pressure, costing −0.2. Template cadence in the middle paragraphs ("He kept it," "He brought it," "He played it") creates mild repetition. The phrase "tinted revelations" appears only in narration, not earned through scene image. The final beat "grooves worn into earth by those who had always known" stacks metaphor without sharp clarity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of bloodhound-as-tracker, phonograph cylinders encoding maps, and post-apocalyptic resource-finding is specific and non-obvious. The transformation of "distance" from geographic fact to emotional construct through the riddle's rhythm-as-map is fresh. The leaf motif (veins as roads) charges the ending without feeling ornamental. Risk: the piece commits to a lyric, reflective pace in a post-apocalyptic frame without retreating to action-thriller beats. However, the cylinder-as-treasure-map and lone-decoder-saves-community beats are familiar genre moves, and the settlement's instant collective action at dawn ("People emerged… maps in hand, whispering to neighbors") compresses what could be a more ambiguous, friction-filled turn.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mercy is present throughout and her nose-work creates the inciting discovery of the bunker, a key causal turn. She is named and described in the opening and closing, satisfying setup and payoff. However, after leading Calder to the bunker she becomes observer rather than decision-maker; her "retirement" means she does not drive the decoding or settlement organization. The final line "her nose already seeking the next discovery" reprises her trait but does not constrain the closure choice. She enables one beat (discovery) but does not shape the ending's stakes or cost.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The leaf is introduced early (first day with Calder), appears on the shelf beside the cylinder reader, and is studied by Calder ("picked up the wax-preserved leaf, studying how its veins branched like roads connecting") at a pivotal moment. It is clipped to his pack in the penultimate beat, reprising it at closure. The leaf's "veins like roads" metaphor charges the theme of connection. However, the leaf does not constrain a choice or impose cost; it functions as thematic ornament rather than tactical pressure. Two beats (introduction, reprise) and purposeful symbolic return elevate it to mid-band, but lack of causal pressure or irreplaceability caps it below 7.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Tinted revelations" appears once in narration ("tinted revelations poured from his speaker") but is not dramatized through image or action—what makes them "tinted" is never shown. The concept does not shape tactics or constrain choices; the cylinder's content (rhythm-encoded coordinates) drives the stakes, not the "tinting" of revelation. The phrase reads as a thematic label rather than an operational element. Present in the middle third, it scores as ornamental mention without causal work.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Intuitively descriptive" is attributed to Calder's voice ("His voice carried that intuitively descriptive quality") and shapes his ability to "read landscapes of loss" and decode the cylinder's rhythm. It is signaled early and enables the key decoding action. However, the trait is told rather than shown through distinct speech or perception; Calder's actual dialogue ("Distance is what killed us") is philosophical but not demonstrably more intuitive or descriptive than generic speech. The trait enables one beat (decoding) but does not constrain a later choice or impose visible cost. Functional but replaceable with "perceptive" or "insightful."</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The riddle—"the riddle isn't in the words, but in the listening," with locations encoded in rhythm between words—is introduced at the discovery beat, drives Calder's seven plays and frantic sketching, and shapes the ending (six decoded locations, settlement mobilization). Calder's realization ("Maybe now we find the paths between us again") ties the riddle's solution to the thematic closure. The riddle is irreplaceable; swapping it for a simple map or list would collapse the story's central tension and the thematic link between silence, distance, and translation. Present in setup (cylinder discovery), development (decoding sequence), and payoff (coordinates spreading), with visible cost (Calder's tears, the settlement's prior isolation ending).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The method is signaled early ("pulling phonograph cylinders from the debris and coaxing secrets from their grooves") and its mechanics matter: Calder's cylinder reader, the marked symbols, the seven plays to decode rhythm-as-map. The method enables the key discovery and decoding beats. However, the phrase "reading secret texts in the grooves" is slightly more ornate than what appears on the page (the woman's voice is heard, not "read" as text). The method is specific and shapes two beats (discovery, decoding) and the ending, but "reading" versus "listening" introduces a minor swappability. Strong integration with closure linkage, but the descriptor mismatch and the fact that any hidden-message medium could serve lowers irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The scrapyard settlement is introduced early ("sprawled across the cracked wasteland like iron cancer, breathing steam and rust") and supplies the social context (people in solitary shelters, whispering) that the ending transforms. The "wild hush" and metal-bones imagery establish tone. The settlement's spatial layout (workbenches, shelters, metal sheets for messages) enables the closure action (coordinates spreading, people emerging). The wasteland pressures survival (resource scarcity) and Calder's three-mile walk to the bunker. However, the scrapyard itself does not constrain a tactical choice or impose a cost; it is backdrop. Present in setup, development (Mercy's walk out, return), and payoff (settlement wakes), but more atmospheric than causal.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The timeframe "after the last resource war" is signaled early ("after the resource wars scorched everything green") and establishes stakes (scarcity, lost world). The three-year gap since Mercy's last body and "three years before the world ended" anchor the present. However, the timeframe does not tighten decisions—there is no live clock or urgency tied to the war's aftermath. The discovery and decoding unfold at Calder's pace with no time pressure. The timeframe is context, not constraint. Present in setup and thematically relevant, but does not shape tactics or escalation.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The motivation "to translate distance into closeness" is Calder's explicit lesson ("We forgot how to translate distance into closeness") and shapes his entire arc: collecting cylinders to find voices, decoding the woman's message, organizing the settlement. The motivation is dramatized in his weeping at the recording, his seven plays and sketching, and his final speech to Mercy ("Maybe now we find the paths between us again"). The ending—hundreds of feet "translating the wasteland's isolation into connection"—directly fulfills and reprises the motivation. Friction exists (his prior resignation versus new purpose) and cost is visible (ending solitary existence). The motivation drives beats and charges closure, though the settlement's instant collective buy-in compresses potential resistance.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Wild hush" is introduced early ("The settlement existed in a wild hush, that peculiar silence of wind moving through metal bones") and modulates: whispers, Calder's weeping, static and voice from the speaker, then transformation into "something else entirely: the sound of hundreds of feet moving together." The tone coheres through turns and charges the ending by breaking into purposeful noise. However, "wild hush" as a phrase appears twice and then vanishes; the final image's "sound of hundreds of feet" contrasts the hush but does not explicitly reprise the "wild" quality. The tone shapes atmosphere and closure but is not irreplaceable—"eerie quiet" or "haunted silence" could substitute with minor edits.</comment>
