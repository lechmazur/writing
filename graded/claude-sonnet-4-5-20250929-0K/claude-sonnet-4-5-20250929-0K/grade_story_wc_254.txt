<question>1</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Meris is present and motivated, but her interiority is largely declaration rather than contradictory impulse under pressure. "The tremor of certainty" and "visceral knowledge" read as label-only claims rather than embodied contradiction. The final stance—striding through boundaries—feels asserted rather than earned through on-page cost or renunciation that forecloses a visible path. Kael exists only to deliver exposition and has no independent pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—quartz hum, blue light, frozen lake imagery accumulate toward the final resonance of "poetry began remembering how to breathe." Orientation is clear by ~100 words. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise): the colonnade awakens, other poets approach, boundaries dissolve. However, the cost is asserted ("they can't un-dissolve") rather than demonstrated through a concrete forfeiture or trade-off on the page, weakening the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The cobalt atrium, quartz colonnade, and frozen lake are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (blue shadows, humming frequencies, wind-drawn patterns). The quartz pillars constrain Meris's interaction—she must approach with reverence, place her palm, compose through intention—and the final image is charged by the atrium's patient hum. Micro-setting is effectively deployed at this length.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: reclaim cloud-shadow poetry after seven years of prohibition. One tightening occurs when Meris begins to compose and the colonnade amplifies, yet no on-page opposition or complication tests her choice. Kael's warning ("they'll try to ban it again") is deflected without visible cost. Under the Accumulative lens, pressure deepens via imagery and presence, but the escalation lacks a felt price that narrows options.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Theme—language as fluid aesthetic experience versus fixed authoritarian meaning—emerges organically through the quartz mechanics and Meris's refusal to paraphrase. The final image of poetry "remembering how to breathe" offers a resonant, non-literal answer. However, the penultimate paragraph edges into thesis statement ("once people remember that meaning can be fluid...that knowledge becomes permanent"), pulling the reader toward declaration rather than inference.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and the prose carries a distinct lyric texture ("lantern-moth circling flame," "verse-shadows"). Register occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction ("quantum states of meaning," "transformation's logic") that feels imposed rather than emerging from Meris's lived perception. Kael's brief dialogue is serviceable but his voice is indistinct from Meris's narration. No head-hopping; psychic distance is controlled.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Figurative density is high throughout: "cloud-shadow poet," "lantern-moth hush," "verse-shadows," "frequencies woven like invisible threads." While atmospheric, this creates sluggishness in key beats; the reader must decode metaphor rather than track action. Paraphrase loop in mid-story: "translation into fixed meaning destroys the very thing that makes it alive" closely echoes the setup. Template cadence: "She placed...she could...she moved...she watched" across multiple paragraphs. Apply −0.6 for density and loop issues in Q7.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>The "poet returns after authoritarian ban" premise is familiar; the quartz-colonnade mechanic and "cloud-shadow" label offer surface freshness but function as window dressing rather than transforming the arc. Meris's journey—approach, touch pillar, begin composing—follows a predictable restoration path without complication or moral calculus. The transformation test fails: swap "quartz colonnade" for "ancient library" or "forbidden temple" and the emotional arc remains unchanged.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Meris (cloud-shadow poet) is present throughout and makes the decision to compose at the colonnade. However, her choice is uncontested; no reversal or complication arises from it. She observes, declares intent, and acts without visible cost. Setup and closure participation are present; middle development involves declaration more than constrained decision.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The humming quartz colonnade appears early, Meris touches it mid-story, and it pulses with agreement at the end. It enables her composition by amplifying thought into frequency. However, its unique properties (humming, frequency translation) do not constrain her choice or create friction; it is a facilitator without cost. Three beats, closure linkage, but limited causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>"A tremor of certainty" appears twice as an internal sensation ("tremor of certainty passed through her bones," "came again, stronger now"). It signals Meris's confidence but does not shape her tactics or create a choice. It functions as label-only interiority rather than a concept that alters options or stakes. Setup and closure mention, no middle development.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.1</grade><comment>"Aesthetically driven" is claimed in narration ("perpetual transformation, aesthetically driven") and implied by the contrast with utilitarian control. Yet no on-page action is constrained or enabled by this trait with visible cost. Meris chooses beauty over utility, but the story does not dramatize a tradeoff where aesthetic priority forecloses another path. Theme-level presence without action-level cost.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>2.9</grade><comment>"Paraphrase" appears in Kael's question and Meris's reply: "Paraphrase would kill it." This moment articulates the theme but does not create a turn; Meris rejects paraphrase without consequence. The action is passive refusal rather than an active choice that redefines options. Present in dialogue, absent from the story's causal spine.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.6</grade><comment>"Through dissolving boundaries" is signaled early ("dissolving the boundaries between intention and interpretation") and reprised at closure ("boundaries once thought sacred were already dissolving"). Meris's composition act relies on this method: she shapes intention into quartz frequencies that bypass fixed language. Setup, development (composition), and closure participation are present, but the mechanics remain abstract; no specific constraint or cost is tied to boundary-dissolution versus another method.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>The cobalt atrium by a frozen lake provides vivid sensory grounding (blue shadows, cracked ice, wind patterns). The atrium houses the colonnade and the frozen lake's stillness mirrors the ending's "eternal stillness." The setting constrains Meris's action (she must enter the sealed atrium, approach the pillars) and charges the final image. Setup, middle presence, and closure linkage; causal pressure is moderate (access rather than tactical constraint).</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"After the ban lifts" frames the premise and Meris is "the first to return" three days post-lifting. Time motivates her arrival but does not tighten decisions; no clock pressure or deadline alters her tactics. The seven-year prohibition is backstory that primes stakes but does not shape present action. Setup and thematic grounding, minimal tactical pressure.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"To stride through boundaries once thought sacred" is spoken by Meris and echoed in the final paragraph ("strode through them without looking back"). Her desire drives the scene choice (return to the atrium, compose) but faces no friction or competing want. The motivation is present and shapes action, yet the absence of cost or internal conflict limits its integration. Setup, action linkage, closure reprise; low friction.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Lantern-moth hush" appears as a descriptor ("lantern-moth circling flame," "lantern-moth hush of that sacred space") and the prose maintains a quiet, reverent register throughout. Tone is coherent and modulates subtly (humming intensifies, tremor strengthens) without breaking into discord. The final image sustains the hush ("ancient, patient song"). Setup, stable presence, and closure linkage; tone charges the ending without dynamic shift under pressure.</comment>
