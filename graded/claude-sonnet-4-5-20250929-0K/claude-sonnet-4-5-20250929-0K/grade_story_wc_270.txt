<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Naja's arc from insurgent to bridge-builder is clear, and her contradictory impulses—resistance versus evolution—act simultaneously when she chooses to unseal the embryo despite uncertainty. Her embodied experience in the hot springs and the sensory weight of the spores sinking into her skin ground key beats. However, the transformation's internal cost remains abstract; we see her gain communion with plants but the text skips the visceral price of hosting alien genetic material, and the final paragraph's confident stride ("already sensing which survivors carried the genetic potential") reads as immediate mastery rather than earned struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Causal lens inferred and held: Naja's decoding → descent → unsealing → transformation drives the sequence with motivated links. The closure is a Decisive Change with visible transformation (spores in blood, expanded awareness), and the before/after is legible—she moves from solitary receptor to active teacher. Orientation anchors arrive promptly (volcanic hot springs, grandmother Naja, tattered kite). The weakness: cost at closure feels understated. The spores dissolve into her skin "immediately" and she emerges already confident about whom to teach next, compressing what should be a high-stakes biological integration into a smooth ascent without on-page friction or doubt in the final beat.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The volcanic hot springs constrain choice—Naja soaks there for meditation, finds the kite in mineral-crusted rocks, and descends to the off-limits cavern at dawn to avoid crews. Bioluminescent fungi, iron-tasting air, and amber "grown rather than mined" layer specific, non-generic textures. The cavern's "unstable geology" restriction adds pressure. Spatial choreography is clear throughout (springs → rocks → cavern heart → emergence). The hot springs return in the final image ("steamed around her as she emerged"), charging the closure by framing her new role within the geography that enabled discovery.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: Naja seeks "a way to evolve tradition with intent rather than let it fossilize or die," and the plants' whispers escalate urgency by pointing toward "something old, something sealed, something waiting." The kite decoding (four days of cross-reference work) tightens options and her dawn descent under Authority restrictions raises external risk. The unsealing itself is a peak choice with visible consequence (transformation, expanded awareness). However, the resolution unfolds without friction—no painful adaptation, no narrative cost for integrating alien DNA—and Naja's immediate confidence about teaching others flattens what should be a high-stakes biological gamble into a smooth win.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme of tradition-as-evolution emerges from Naja's insurgent history, her resistance to the Authority's erasure mandates, and her final synthesis of "old blessing-songs with new words of her own invention." The embryo as genetic bridge literalizes symbiosis without overt thesis statements. The kite's fulfilled purpose and Naja walking toward camps "with spores golden in her blood and whispers green in her mind" offer a resonant image that reweights reconstruction as ecological integration. Minor slip: "implanted destiny" and "blueprint for a new symbiosis" veer toward prompt echo, and the phrase "not through domination but through integration" tilts close to thesis.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Single POV with stable third-limited distance; Naja's perceptual filter is consistent (mineral-crusted rocks, sulfurous waters, iron-tasting air). The prose modulates under pressure: "The amber grew warm, then soft, then liquid" accelerates cadence at the unsealing. Diction mostly stays within her register—insurgent grandmother, ceremony-keeper—though "accidentally telepathic" and "genetic bridge their ancestors had prepared" feel slightly clinical for her voice. No dialogue present. The final paragraph's syntax shifts to declarative confidence ("already sensing which survivors carried the genetic potential") without the hesitation or embodied uncertainty her earlier interiority established.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is generally high ("the sulfurous waters during her morning meditation, did she notice the strange script winding along its length"). Minor loops: "something old, something sealed, something waiting" is purposeful parallelism, but the plants' overlapping voices and crescendo lack a distinct payoff image. The final paragraph stacks declarative certainties without syntactic variety: "already sensing… The kite's tail fluttered… Tradition had evolved… Naja walked…" creates a steady drumbeat rather than modulating closure rhythm. One paraphrase slip: "neither wholly plant nor wholly human" and "not through domination but through integration" use similar balanced negation without added pressure. No severe artifacts, but closure propulsion softens.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The combination—insurgent grandmother, plant telepathy, genetic embryo in amber, kite-as-map—synthesizes familiar SFF tropes (chosen-one artifact, ecological symbiosis) with specific volcanic-province texture and post-war reconstruction stakes. The kite's cryptic script and bioluminescent cavern offer memorable particulars. Weaknesses: "implanted destiny" and "blueprint for symbiosis" lean on template SF language, and the smooth transformation (spores sink in, powers activate, no cost) follows a common uplift/chosen-one arc without meaningful subversion. The ending's confident didacticism ("she would ensure it honored what grew beneath") reduces moral complexity to a clear mission statement rather than earned ambiguity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Present from the opening; her history as insurgent and tradition-keeper frames all choices. She decodes the script (middle beat) and descends to unseal the embryo (climax beat), both decisions narrowing options and foreclosing her prior solitary path. The final beat shows her walking toward camps to teach others, a direct consequence of her choice to unseal. Her role as "bridge-builder" charges the closure image. Cost is visible: she now carries alien biology and a teaching burden. High integration, though the transformation's friction is muted on the page.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Setup: plants speak of "something waiting" early; amber appears at cavern heart mid-story. Development: Naja reads its script, places hands on it, speaks decoded words—multiple beats of interaction. Payoff: the embryo dissolves into spores that sink into her skin, triggering transformation and charging the final image ("spores golden in her blood"). The amber's properties (grown not mined, covered in script) are specific and irreplaceable. Strong causal and closure linkage. Minor cap: the object's key moment (unsealing) could be swapped for another vessel type with modest edits, so not fully indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Setup: "implanted destiny" is named outright in the cavern scene ("the implanted destiny her people had forgotten"). Development: the concept justifies the embryo's existence and Naja's genetic compatibility. Payoff: her transformation and mission to teach others enact the destiny. However, the concept is told rather than dramatized—text explains it directly ("a genetic bridge their ancestors had prepared") without showing how destiny constrains present choices or creates tactical friction. It shapes theme more than on-page pressure, landing it mid-band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Setup: plant whispers begin after ceasefire and grow clearer, signaled early. Development: plants guide Naja to medicinal roots and warn of contaminated soil (one functional beat), then lean closer and crescendo as she decodes the kite (second beat). Payoff: her telepathy expands massively after transformation, enabling her teaching mission. The trait constrains her socially (she tells no one, fearing Authority scientists and superstition). Cost is present but implicit. Two beats plus closure participation, though middle-beat choices could be stronger.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Setup: plants whisper of something sealed, priming the need to unseal. Development: decoding and descent build toward the action. Payoff: unsealing triggers transformation and defines the ending—spores enter her blood, awareness expands, and she gains the tool to evolve tradition. The action is irreplaceable; swapping it would collapse the genetic-bridge logic. The unsealing scene ("she placed her hands on the amber, speaking the decoded words") is the story's pivot and charges the final image with its consequence. Essential across beats and ending.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Setup: kite with strange script found early, noticed during meditation. Development: Naja spends four days decoding it via astronomical charts and seed-blessing incantations (one extended beat). Payoff: the decoded message provides map and key, enabling descent and unsealing; the kite's tail flutters in final image, "its message delivered, its purpose complete." The method is specific (cryptic script on kite tail), but the actual decoding mechanics remain abstract—no on-page struggle with symbols or false leads. Two gates met; method shapes one major choice but could be replaced with another puzzle type.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Setup: volcanic hot springs anchor the opening and provide the meditation space where Naja notices the script. Development: the springs' mineral-crusted rocks hide the kite; the oldest spring's off-limits status (unstable geology) adds risk and guides Naja's dawn timing to avoid crews. Payoff: the hot springs steam around her as she emerges transformed, charging the final image and literalizing her role as conduit between thermal earth and human reconstruction. The setting supplies resources (rocks, restricted cavern), pressures choice (Authority restriction), and recharges at closure. Essential across beats.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Setup: "reconstruction had brought many changes" and the Authority's mandate anchor the timeframe early. Development: the ceasefire marks when plant whispers began; reconstruction crews sleep at dawn, timing Naja's descent. Payoff: Naja walks toward construction camps in the final image, her new powers positioned to redirect reconstruction. The timeframe provides social context (post-war, Authority control) that justifies her secrecy and sharpens her mission. However, time does not tighten choices beat-to-beat—no countdown or urgent clock. It frames rather than pressures, landing it in the functional band with lyric closure credit.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Setup: "she sought something more nuanced—a way to evolve tradition with intent rather than let it fossilize or die" frames her goal explicitly. Development: her thirty-year insurgency (hiding texts, teaching ceremonies in secret) and her current resistance to Authority mandates dramatize the friction between preservation and erasure. Payoff: unsealing and speaking "old blessing-songs with new words of her own invention" enact the evolution; the final image shows her carrying the evolved gift toward survivors. The motivation is clear and conflicted (Authority pressure versus stagnation risk), though some articulation leans tell-heavy.</comment>
