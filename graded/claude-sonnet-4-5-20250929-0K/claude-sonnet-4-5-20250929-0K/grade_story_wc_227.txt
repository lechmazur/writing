<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's oxygen-debt urgency and grandmother's kintsugi philosophy ground her choices in embodied pressure and inherited values. The final descent shows earned transformation through specific action rather than epiphany. However, interiority occasionally slips into therapeutic abstraction ("meaning crystallized like gold in broken places") and the leap to full certainty ("newly certain of her purpose") arrives too cleanly after one contact point. The contradictory impulses of doubt versus desperate hope are present but could act more simultaneously in the peak moment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors quickly (underwater workshop, acid sea, time pressure). The kintsugi trigger at the 45th pockmark provides a clear reversal that reweights Maya's task from searching to systematic mapping, and the cost—repeated breath-hold dives across generations—is legible on the page. Drive lens reads as Causal-Situational Hybrid: the charm-contact unlocks a map, which then reconfigures her existential stance. The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise shifting toward Earned Stasis for generational work), though the final paragraph's summary mode ("she would map every pockmark") slightly dilutes immediacy.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The acid sea, grinding gears, sulfur air, and dissolving workshops create visceral constraint that narrows Maya's window to thirty-second intervals. The statue's pockmarks function as micro-setting, physically guiding her search and later supplying the map. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: burning lungs dominate during submersion, golden light and memory-quilting emerge at the trigger. The porthole glimpse of dissolved rigging charges the stakes without catalog detail. The workshop tilts with wave impacts, affecting her grip—environment actively pressures choice and charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—decoding the statue to transmute the acid sea—is signaled early and tightens when oxygen debt mounts. The 45th pockmark alignment provides a meaningful reversal that narrows Maya's task to patient, generational mapping with visible cost (repeated dangerous dives). Agency is clear: her choice to return despite depleted lungs forecloses retreat. However, the golden-light reveal solves the riddle quickly, and the mechanics of how "intentions" transmute the sea remain abstract, which softens the tangible price of each future dive.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Kintsugi as honoring-and-transforming-damage emerges through the grandmother's deathbed lesson, the charm's physical alignment, and the statue's luminous scars. The theme resists tidy reversal—Maya accepts generational labor rather than instant salvation—and the final image (beginning patient work "one luminous scar at a time") reweights prior desperation without stating a moral. Minor friction: "meaning crystallized like gold in broken places" and "dire enchantment between drowning and breathing" tip toward overt thematic statement. The "quilting together memories" metaphor is told rather than fully dramatized through enacted memory-pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with Maya's perceptual filter (gears "groaning," air "reeking," charm as inherited text). Diction modulates under oxygen stress: short clauses in the surfacing beat, longer reflective syntax when the statue speaks through memory. The grandmother's quoted whisper provides idiom distinct from narration. Minor register drift: "dire enchantment," "quilting together," and "patient intervals" feel elevated beyond Maya's immediate voice during peak pressure. No head-hopping; psychic distance shifts are purposeful.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and information density is high in the opening (groaning workshop, thirty seconds, burning lungs anchor urgency and constraint). The 45th-pockmark beat is clean and propulsive. However, the final paragraph leans into summary mode ("she would map," "teach others," "transform their world") rather than concrete next action, and several lines recycle abstract phrasing: "meaning conjured from the edge of oblivion" echoes "meaning crystallized like gold," and "quilting together memories" appears twice without added pressure. Stock metaphor "veins of precious metal" and "seared her throat" are functional but unearned specificity.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The acid-sea apocalypse and breath-hold civilization offer a vivid frame, and kintsugi applied to world-repair rather than personal healing is a fresh angle. The grandmother's charm as intention-carrier rather than magic key adds specificity. However, the core pattern—mentor's fatal quest, inherited talisman, ancient artifact, protagonist completes the mission—follows a familiar template. The golden-light unlock and map revelation arrive without friction or false leads, reducing surprise. The ending commits fully to generational labor, which adds thematic integrity, but the synthesis feels more competent than startling.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya chooses to press the charm at multiple pockmarks despite mounting oxygen debt, surfaces when forced, then descends again "newly certain"—three distinct decisions that alter tactics and commit her to generational work. Her uncertainty is embodied in trembling fingers and slipping grip, and the final descent forecloses retreat. Setup and development are clear; closure linkage is strong (her return begins the patient mapping). Slight swappability: another character could perform similar moves with minor edits, though her inherited knowledge is specific.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The koi charm appears in beat one (dangling from belt, etched formulas), beat two (pressed against pockmarks 1–45, triggering golden light), and beat three (pressed against "the next pockmark" in final lines). It enables the kintsugi reaction through its embedded intentions and reappears at closure with reweighted function (from search tool to systematic key). Early signal is strong. Minor friction: the charm's mechanics—how "intentions" encoded in metal unlock statue-memory—remain abstract, softening its irreplaceability; a talisman with different symbolic cargo might serve similarly.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Kintsugi as repair-with-gold frames the grandmother's lesson and manifests visibly when golden light fills the statue's pockmarks, redefining damage as map. It shapes Maya's final choice to honor each wound rather than erase the sea instantly. Setup (grandmother's deathbed), development (the 45th-pockmark trigger), and payoff (beginning patient work) are present. However, the concept is more thematic resonance than tactical constraint—Maya does not face a false choice to reverse damage versus honor it on the page. The mechanics of "intentions" remain told rather than tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Quilts memories together" appears twice: once as label ("kintsugi intentions, they called it") and again when the statue "quilting together memories" into the charm. The attribute is described but not dramatized—we do not see Maya struggle to assemble fragmented memories or choose which to encode. It primes the closure thematically (generational transmission) but does not constrain an on-page action with visible cost. Present in setup and payoff as metaphor; missing middle development as embodied trait.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Maya narrates the kintsugi reaction internally ("This is how you transmute loss") and commits to "narrate" the patient work ahead, but on-page narration is limited to her interior voice during the memory-trigger. The action as specified—explicit storytelling or instruction—does not occur in scene; the final paragraph summarizes future teaching rather than showing it. If "narrate" is read broadly as making-sense-of, it threads through her decoding attempts and final understanding, scoring mid-band. As literal telling-to-others, it is setup only (implied future action), capping lower.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The method is signaled early (statue rescued from depths, pockmarks as "star chart of decay"), tested across beats (Maya tries pockmarks 1–44 without result), and delivers at closure (45th pockmark aligns, triggering the map). The matching mechanics matter: the charm's tail-fin curve must fit the crater's shape, and the resulting map corresponds to transmutation locations. This specificity makes the method irreplaceable and causally active. Early signal, beat involvement (search failure → success), and closure linkage are all strong. Slight deduction: the 45th-try success feels convenient without prior false-positive friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The workshop floating on acid sea supplies immediate constraint (thirty-second breath windows, porthole view of dissolved workshops, tilting from wave strikes) that forces Maya's rhythm and raises cost. Gears grinding and the hatch provide choreography for her surfacing choice. The setting is not postcard—it actively narrows options and embodies civilization's fragility. Early anchor, beat involvement (tilt affects grip, hatch escape), and closure linkage (workshop gears "sang a different rhythm" synchronized with statue's pulse, charging the final image). The acid itself never directly threatens the workshop on the page, slightly softening immediacy.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The thirty-second breath window is announced in the opening line and enforced when Maya's vision darkens and she kicks toward the hatch. Time pressure compels her to surface mid-discovery, then shapes her commitment to repeated dives. The timeframe reappears in the premise statement ("everything happened between breaths held underwater") and charges the closure (patient work "breath by held breath"). However, the forty-five pockmark attempts are not timed on the page—we do not feel each second ticking—and the final descent elides duration, softening the clock's grip in the ending beat.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Maya's need to "conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion" is declared on the page and dramatized through her return to the mentor's fatal task despite oxygen debt. The golden-light moment reframes meaning as honoring wounds rather than erasing them, creating thematic friction. However, the motivation is more premise than conflicted choice—Maya never weighs meaning-making against survival or faces a scene partner who challenges its worth. Setup and payoff are present; middle friction (want versus cost in a live decision) is muted. The desire drives persistence but does not fork tactics.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>Tone blends peril (acid swells, burning lungs, mentor's death) with wonder (golden light, memory-quilting, luminous map) throughout, and modulates when the statue "speaks" through feeling rather than words—enchantment entering dire constraint. The final image ("luminous scar") fuses both registers, charging closure. Minor unevenness: "dire enchantment" is named on the page rather than sustained purely through image, and the summary-mode ending ("she would map... teach... transform") flattens urgency slightly. Coherent and purposeful overall, with effective modulation at the trigger beat.</comment>
