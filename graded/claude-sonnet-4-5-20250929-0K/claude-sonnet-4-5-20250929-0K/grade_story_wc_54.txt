<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lena's interiority is concrete and job-specific—her engineer's eye traces water stains and drainage patterns with embodied attention. The final choice to send the proposal is earned by the night's escalating perception, and her pocketing the sextant piece carries visible cost (staking reputation on a likely-rejected vision). Minor slip: her supervisor's voice and the carnival's "melancholy romance" edge toward generic phrasing, and the shift from despair to optimism compresses slightly in the drafting sequence without friction.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands as Charged Poise: Lena sends the proposal knowing rejection is likely, and the final image ("already seeing green where there was only gray") reweights the terminal's decay into potential with undeniable pressure. The inferred lens is Accumulative/Textural—density increases through overlaid blueprints, thermal scans, and the sextant's navigational metaphor, culminating in a cadence shift that charges hope with on-page cost (professional risk, attachment to a doomed structure). Orientation is clean by paragraph two. One constraint shapes tactics: the existing water-damage infrastructure enables her hydroponic vision, foreclosing demolition as the only option.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The terminal's architecture—dome, concourse, kiosks, drainage conduits—constrains Lena's redesign and charges the final image: "green where there was only gray" gains specificity from prior gate-areas-as-gardens and crystalline windows. Sensory detail is selective and job-filtered (thermal scans, mineral deposits, cotton-candy stains). The sextant piece and water stains function as micro-setting, recurring with reweighted meaning. Spatial choreography remains coherent across the atrium, upper concourse, and bookstore.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The dominant stake—resurrect the terminal or catalog its demolition—is signaled in paragraph two and tightens when Lena sees the water damage maps a shadow infrastructure. Her agency is decision (drafting the proposal, sending it despite likely rejection) with visible cost: professional credibility and emotional attachment to a structure slated for teardown. One meaningful deepening occurs when blueprints overlay thermal scans, narrowing her options to metamorphosis. Minor gap: the carnival's prior "redirection" is told rather than shown, slightly weakening the pressure model.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Theme emerges through water's redirected flow, the sextant's navigation metaphor, and the terminal's "maze of intentions"—all charging the question of whether decay can become generative rather than terminal. The final image (green/gray, voices/echo) offers a non-literal answer: hope is an equation built from scavenged instruments and shadow infrastructure, not demolition. Subtext operates in Lena's pocketing the sextant (claiming explorer identity) and her night-long drafting (staking self against institutional inertia). No overt thesis statement; the carnival's brief resurrection primes without explaining.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV is stable third-limited with engineer-specific perceptual signature: "functionally creative in the way only desperate optimism allowed," thermal scans, drainage blueprints. Psychic distance tightens during the drafting sequence, and diction remains within Lena's professional lexicon (conduits, hydroponic, calibrated markings). Minor slips: "melancholy romance" and "ghost rivers of purpose" edge toward elevated register during reflection, and the phrase "stoic around her" briefly externalizes the terminal's stance in a way that blurs filter use.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high: the sextant, water stains, and blueprints each do multiple jobs (object, constraint, metaphor). Rhythm modulates well from survey task to night-long drafting. Two line-level issues lower the score: "functionally creative in the way only desperate optimism allowed" is a telling summary rather than shown action, and "ghost rivers of purpose" plus "maze of intentions" risk metaphor stack in adjacent paragraphs. Sentence openings vary, and no loops or template cadence appear.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of water-damage-as-infrastructure and the sextant's celestial navigation is specific and non-obvious, earning the premise through Lena's engineer lens rather than metaphor alone. The transformation of abandonment into generative decay avoids the stock "nature reclaims" arc by centering human redesign. Risk-taking (hydroponic gates, crystalline art, condensation turbines) heightens stakes without obscuring clarity. Minor limitation: the carnival's role as prior "redirector" is generic, and the proposal's likely rejection is asserted rather than dramatized through supervisor memory or prior friction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Lena (civil engineer intern, though "intern" is not explicitly stated—she's surveying for a demolition company) drives two key beats: recognizing the shadow infrastructure and drafting the metamorphosis proposal. Her choice to send the email despite likely rejection alters tactics and forecloses safe compliance. The sextant extraction and night-long work are on-page decisions with visible cost. Setup is immediate (paragraph one), development occurs in the overlay beat, and payoff shapes the ending. Swappability is low: her engineer training enables the thermal-scan insight.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The sextant piece appears in three beats: extraction from the kiosk (paragraph five), sitting beside her laptop during drafting (paragraph twelve), and pocketed at the end (paragraph fifteen). It charges the final image by linking celestial navigation to Lena's own bearing-finding through decay. Specificity is high: "brass arc with calibrated markings" and "measuring angles between celestial bodies and horizons" are irreplaceable details that enable the metaphor. Setup is mid-story (paragraph five), development is the drafting juxtaposition, and payoff is the pocketing gesture with cost (claiming explorer identity against institutional refusal).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>"Maze of intentions" is introduced in paragraph six and shapes tactics: Lena reads the terminal's original passenger-flow design as a template for redirection rather than demolition. The concept recurs when she proposes rewiring departure pathways toward arrival, directly altering her proposal's structure. It appears in closure: "walked through the maze one more time, already seeing green." Setup is early (paragraph six), development constrains the hydroponic redesign (paragraphs ten–eleven), and payoff reweights the final image. The concept is indispensable: removing it would collapse the redirection logic.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Functionally creative in the way only desperate optimism allowed" is labeled in paragraph ten but demonstrated on the page through the night-long drafting and the decision to overlay blueprints with thermal scans. The trait enables the metamorphosis proposal and constrains her to work within decay rather than against it. Setup is mid-story (paragraph ten), development is the drafting sequence, and payoff is the sent email despite likely rejection. Minor gap: the phrase itself is a telling summary rather than purely shown action, lowering irreplaceability slightly.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Resurrect" appears explicitly in paragraph eight ("The carnival had redirected the terminal's dormant energy one last time, resurrecting it briefly") and drives the major turn: Lena shifts from demolition survey to metamorphosis proposal. The action redefines her options (demolition vs. resurrection through decay) and shapes the ending's stakes (whether the terminal "would fall or rise"). Setup is early (paragraph eight), development is the drafting of the resurrection plan, and payoff charges the final image. The action is indispensable and causally active across beats.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Redirected flows" is signaled in paragraph nine ("water damage wasn't random...new pathways") and determines the method: Lena's proposal uses existing water infiltration to drive hydroponics, turbines, and crystalline art. The mechanics matter—thermal scans, condensation, mineral deposits—and are demonstrated on the page in paragraphs ten–eleven. Setup is paragraph nine, development is the blueprint overlay and garden/turbine plan, and payoff is the sent proposal's core logic. Swappability is low: the method is tied to the terminal's specific decay state.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The abandoned terminal pressures every choice: its decay enables the shadow infrastructure, its dome provides light and fracture points, its gate areas become garden sites, and its demolition contract is the clock ticking against Lena's proposal. The setting supplies resources (water paths, conduits, bookstore mushrooms, crystalline windows) and constraints (cracked marble, pitted glass, signed contract). Setup is immediate (paragraph one), development is the infrastructure discovery and drafting, and payoff charges the final image ("stoic around her, waiting"). The setting is indispensable: no generic abandoned building would provide the same causal texture.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The carnival's three-day-ago departure frames the timeline and establishes the terminal's abandonment, but the timeframe does not tighten decisions on the page—Lena's night-long drafting is mentioned but not tracked, and no deadline beyond the implicit demolition contract pressures her moves. Setup is immediate (paragraph one), development is the cotton-candy stains as prior-event evidence, and payoff is the dawn anchor in paragraph fourteen. The element is present and causal (post-carnival = true abandonment) but does not function as a live clock that alters tactics within the single night.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Puzzle out new equations for hope" is dramatized through Lena's night-long drafting, the sextant-as-navigation metaphor, and the final email attachment ("these new equations for hope pieced together from brass instruments and water stains"). The desire is conflicted: she knows the supervisor will likely reject it, yet sends anyway. Setup is implicit in her survey task (paragraph two), development is the drafting sequence and equation work, and payoff is the sent proposal with visible cost (professional risk, attachment to a doomed plan). The motivation drives the central choice and charges the ending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.0</grade><comment>"Stoic wonder" is coherent across beats: Lena's engineer calm ("surveying structural integrity") coexists with her awe at the sextant, shadow infrastructure, and starlight through the dome. Tone modulates under pressure—tightens during the blueprint overlay, softens during the sextant reflection—and charges the final image: "The terminal stood stoic around her...already seeing green where there was only gray." Setup is immediate (starlight "silent and indifferent"), development is the wonder at evolved pathways and crystalline patterns, and payoff is the stoic/wonder synthesis in the closing lines. The tone is indispensable to the ending's effect.</comment>
