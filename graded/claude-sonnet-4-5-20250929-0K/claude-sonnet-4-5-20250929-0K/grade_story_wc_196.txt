<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Miriam's interiority is concrete and embodied ("chest tightened," the physical handling of the button), and her renunciation of personal wholeness in favor of archival witness is earned through prior causality. The backstory regarding Thomas is efficient and anchors her emotional stance without flattening present pressure. Minor slip: the final reflection ("Her own heart remained broken, perhaps always would") edges toward summary-label rather than embodied contradiction, but the archival micro-choices (cross-referencing, contacting the historical society) redeem agency with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: dust patterns → hidden file → letters → adoption record → decision to reunite the archive. Orientation anchors (file room, archivist role, 1867–1875 reorganization) land clearly by the second paragraph. The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Miriam cannot reunite Samuel and Isaiah across time, but her archival act—cross-referencing and notifying the historical society—forecloses personal resolution in favor of public witness, with the cost made explicit in "her own heart remained broken." One meaningful deepening (discovery → documentation) suffices for this length, and the closure lands on the page with felt cost.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The file room is vividly rendered (paper decay, metal shelves, afternoon light, dust patterns as "accidental archives") and constrains Miriam's discovery through physical proximity and archival taxonomy. The dust patterns function as micro-setting that drives the inciting search. The 1867–1875 post-emancipation county placement center adds historical texture without slowing momentum. The button, letters, and adoption papers are handled on the page and charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for setting as constraint.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—whether unknown histories can be recovered and honored—is signaled early and tightens through the discovery sequence. The filing clerk's arbitrary decision (S vs. P) is a clear constraint that Miriam's cross-referencing choice forecloses, with visible cost: she cannot reunite the living but can prevent future erasure. One meaningful tightening (the adoption record reveals Isaiah lived, yet Samuel never found him) narrows options and forces the archival stance. The price is legible: her personal brokenness persists while she tends others' hopes.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme (the persistence of love and witness across erasure) emerges from the dust patterns, the button, Samuel's faithful letters, and Miriam's cross-referencing act, not from overt statement. The ending offers a non-literal answer: tending small hopes is a meaningful vocation even when personal wholeness is lost, and the archival act ensures both Samuel's love and Isaiah's life "matter" without moralizing. The button as evidence and the cross-reference note are particulars that resist abstraction. Minor slip: "These unknown histories deserved to be magnified, spoken, remembered" edges toward thematic echo, but it's embedded in action (contacting the historical society) rather than replacing scene pressure.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited focalization remains stable and tightly bound to Miriam's archival perception ("dust rise in a thin column," "faint pathways like rivers on a map"). Diction is controlled and character-specific (archivist's lexicon: "manila folders," "emancipation cases," "cross-references"). Psychic distance modulates purposefully from close interiority ("chest tightened") to reflective summary in the final beat. No dialogue is present, so that bullet is not applicable. The prose rhythm accelerates during the discovery sequence and breathes at closure, supporting pressure without head-hopping or filter stacks.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Line-level craft is strong: "forgotten promises," "chaotic years after the war," "the gulf of decades" are specific and propulsive. Information density is high (each paragraph advances discovery or stakes). Minor loop: "These unknown histories deserved to be magnified, spoken, remembered" restates the theme without added pressure (−0.2). The final beat "She could still bear witness. That would be enough" edges toward summary, but the prior archival actions (cross-referencing, historical society contact) provide concrete grounding. No filter stacks or template cadence; sentence openings vary naturally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-emancipation archival work, dust-pattern discovery, and contemporary grief is specific and non-obvious. The filing-system irony (S vs. P) is fresh and inevitable in hindsight. The frame (broken-hearted archivist finds separated father/son across time) avoids cliché through historical specificity (freedman soldier, Union button, county placement center) and the choice to foreground archival witness rather than reunion fantasy. Risk is moderate: the structure is linear and the emotional arc familiar, though the accumulative lens and period detail elevate originality.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Miriam's archival choices drive two key beats: the decision to follow the dust trail and the final cross-referencing act that forecloses personal closure in favor of public witness. Her broken-hearted state anchors motivation and the renunciation (she cannot heal but can tend others' hopes) carries visible cost. Early signal (paragraph one), middle development (discovery sequence), and closure participation (cross-reference decision) satisfy all three gates with causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The button appears in three beats: initial discovery, identification as Samuel's proof/credential, and final placement in the new file as evidence. It functions as Samuel's material love token and Miriam's physical link to his persistence, constraining her archival act (she must preserve it) and charging the closure ("pressed the button between her fingers, feeling its weight"). Early signal, causal pressure (enables the reunification of the archive), and closure linkage all present; irreplaceability high (no other object carries Samuel's proof).</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Unknown histories shape stakes throughout: emancipation cases, Samuel's lost search, Isaiah's life trajectory, and Miriam's decision to make the connection visible. The concept is dramatized (not merely thematic) through the filing-system irony and the cross-referencing act that alters future searchability. Early signal (paragraph two: "other people's beginnings and endings"), middle development (discovery of the separated archive), and closure participation (historical society contact) all present. Causal pressure: the concept forecloses reunion fantasy and mandates archival witness.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Tactfully hopeful" is embodied in the cross-referencing act (ensuring no future searcher misses the connection) and the decision to contact the historical society, both of which balance hope (making the story public) with tact (respecting the irreversible loss). The trait constrains her final stance: she does not force a tidy resolution but ensures the archive is whole. Setup is implicit (her eleven-year tenure suggests method), development is the discovery sequence, and payoff is the archival decision. Mid-band: the trait is demonstrated but not tested under competing pressures or visible tradeoffs.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Unfurl" is the physical act that reveals the adoption record and redefines options: Isaiah's life trajectory was documented, yet Samuel never knew. The action appears in one key beat (midpoint discovery) and directly enables the closure decision (cross-referencing the separated files). Causal pressure is high (without unfurling, the resolution remains invisible), and the action is irreplaceable (no other verb captures the deliberate unfolding of creased documents). Setup is implicit (handling fragile files), development is the discovery, and closure linkage is strong (the knowledge gained drives the archival act).</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The dust patterns are signaled early (paragraph three: "patterns emerged where air currents had moved"), guide the discovery (paragraph four: "Following one pale trail, her hand found a file"), and are reprised thematically at closure ("dust patterns had led her here, through accumulated time and neglect"). The method is specific and shapes the search trajectory, though it does not recur in the final beat. Two gates (setup, development) are clearly met; closure participation is thematic rather than tactical, limiting high-band eligibility. Causal role is solid (dust → discovery → archival decision).</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>The file room constrains discovery (metal shelves, lower shelves, dust accumulation, filing taxonomy S vs. P) and provides the resources (adoption record, letters, button) that enable closure. Setting is signaled in the opening line and remains active throughout: the physical act of reorganizing 1867–1875 files creates the discovery opportunity, and the archival tools (cross-references, historical society contact) are setting-specific. All three gates met with high causal pressure and irreplaceability (no other setting supplies both the problem and the solution). The room is not merely backdrop but engine.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The post-emancipation timeframe (1867–1875) is signaled early and provides the historical stakes: freedman Samuel's search, county placement practices, and the filing-system irony. The temporal gulf (Samuel's death decades before Miriam's discovery) generates the story's central cost (no reunion possible) and forces the archival stance. Early signal, middle development (the adoption record from 1869 is the key reversal), and closure participation (the timeframe underwrites the "gulf of decades" that shapes the ending) all present. Causal pressure: the historical distance mandates witness over reunion.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Miriam's desire to magnify small kindnesses is dramatized through the discovery sequence (noting the teacher's letter, the Suttons' updates, the clerk's preservations) and drives the closure decision: creating a unified file, placing the button as evidence, and contacting the historical society. The motivation is conflicted with visible cost (she cannot repair her own heart but can tend others' hopes). Early signal (paragraph two: "other people's beginnings and endings"), middle development (recognizing prior kindnesses embedded in the files), and closure participation (the archival act as magnification) all present. Friction between want (to reunite) and reality (cannot) deepens the ending.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Tone is contemplative and elegiac throughout, modulating from archival observation ("paper decay and forgotten promises") to quiet grief ("her own heart remained broken") without tonal rupture. The tone charges the final image: Miriam's witness is offered without triumph or sentimentality, maintaining the "examined unknown" register. Early signal (opening line), consistent modulation under discovery pressure (the tone tightens but does not break into melodrama), and closure coherence (the ending sustains contemplation) all present. The tone is purposeful but does not shift dramatically to reweight the stake, limiting high-band reach.</comment>
