<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Mara's interiority is concrete and distinctive—copper-and-starlight synesthesia, the bright darkness behind her eyelids—and her arc from oracle to wonderer is earned through on-page confrontation. The transformation choice at the end ("Teach me") feels motivated by the accumulated cost of prophecies that "diminished everything." Minor slip: the pilgrim-as-emissary feels more like a catalyst device than a fully embodied character, though his function as unseen-force representative is clear. Internal contradiction (knowing vs. mystery) drives her final renunciation with visible cost.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Closure lands cleanly as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Mara renounces foresight, opening her eyes "to a world she finally couldn't read," forecloses her oracle identity with felt cost. Drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: density builds through sensory metaphor (copper/starlight, bright darkness), pattern breaks when the pearl shows "nothing," and the cave's "new song—steadily unpredictable" reweights her stake. Orientation anchors (cave, Mara, pilgrim arrival) land cleanly in the opening paragraph. One meaningful deepening suffices at this length; causality holds under the lens.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The crystalline cave is not mere backdrop: its acoustic web maps prophecy, overlapping shadows become "doors," the exploding pearl scatters stolen futures, and the cave "sang her into something new" at closure. Sensory hierarchy fits the clairvoyant POV (she tastes frequencies, reads formations). Spatial choreography remains clear across meditation alcove and Singing Chamber. The cave's music shifting into "unfamiliar patterns" constrains Mara's certainty and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate criterion for Q3, but minor ornamental passages (bioluminescent moss) prevent full elevation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake (Mara's clairvoyant mastery vs. essential mystery) signals early and tightens when the pearl shows "nothing," forcing her from knower to wonderer. The pilgrim's revelation—"every prophecy...prevented...genuine wonder"—reweights the cost of her gift, and her whispered "Teach me" forecloses the oracle path with visible consequence. Agency is clear: she chooses transformation. One meaningful deepening (her doubt → the pearl's negation → her request) suffices under the Accumulative lens. No multiple reversals required. Cost is legible: she loses foresight and gains unknowing beauty.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Theme (mystery vs. revelation, wonder magnified through protection rather than exposure) emerges from concrete images: the pearl that shows darkness, prophecies as stolen wonder, the "new song" that resists prediction. Final image—"a world she finally couldn't read, and it was beautiful"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. Subtext operates through the pilgrim's steady-unpredictable voice and shadows as doors. Minor slip: "magnify everyday magic not by revealing it but by protecting its essential mystery" edges toward thesis statement in the penultimate paragraph, though it remains integrated with action (shadows embracing, cave singing her into transformation).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Third-person limited holds steady; Mara's perceptual signature (synesthesia, shadow-reading, acoustic mapping) is distinct and consistent. Voice modulates purposefully: lyric density in scene-setting, sharper clarity at confrontation. Dialogue feels goal-driven ("I didn't come seeking clarity" reversal) and advances plot. Minor register drift: "authentic surprise, genuine wonder, the everyday magic of an unknown future" in the pilgrim's speech reads slightly expository for a character who is an emissary of unseen forces—phrasing tilts toward thematic summary rather than idiomatic speech under pressure. Psychic distance remains controlled throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies; figurative density ("shadows grew teeth," "bright darkness") supports atmosphere without overwhelming clarity. Information density is high: most lines do double work (e.g., "boot-strike sending discordant ripples" advances both plot and sonic motif). Minor issues: "stalactite hummed a different prophecy, every mineral vein traced probability's path" edges toward list-like parallelism; "desperate hope all seekers wore like ill-fitting clothes" is vivid but slightly stock. No paraphrase loops or template cadence. The final line—"it was beautiful"—lands cleanly without scaffold. Propulsion remains strong across beats.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Premise (clairvoyant who learns the cost of knowing) transforms familiar oracle-regret material through specific world logic: acoustic prophecy, overlapping-shadow mechanics, the pearl as future-mirror. The pilgrim-as-emissary and "bright darkness" oxymoron add non-obvious angles. Turn feels earned in hindsight: Mara's gift was always theft of wonder, and the shadows she mapped finally teach her what she couldn't see. Synthesis of sensory particulars (taste of copper/starlight, shadows with geometry, the cave's song) anchors universals. Risk-taking in lyric compression and paradox heightens stakes without obscuring clarity; +0.3 within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mara (clairvoyant who didn't see it coming) is present throughout, signals early (opening paragraph), and her blindness to "what mattered most" drives the central irony. Development: her doubt when the cave's music shifts (middle beat) and her inability to read the pearl constrain her certainty. Closure: she chooses transformation ("Teach me"), opens her eyes unable to read the future—decisive renunciation. Cost is visible: loss of foresight, gain of wonder. Causal pressure across three beats (doubt, pearl negation, request). The character's specific failure (seeing births/deaths but not her own need for mystery) is irreplaceable. Two gates met strongly (setup, payoff); middle beat is present but less forceful.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Cave pearl appears in paragraph five (setup within first third), anchors the Singing Chamber confrontation (middle beat: spins impossibly fast, shows "nothing"), and explodes into "infinite droplets, each one a future she'd stolen" at closure (payoff). Development: the pearl's negation forces Mara's realization. Closure linkage strong: the explosion visualizes stolen wonder and triggers her transformation. Specificity: "size of a child's fist," "rotates endlessly in...updraft," "capturing every possible future" are unique properties. Three gates met; cost tied to element (explosion = loss of foresight). Causal pressure clear. Could score higher with more tactile handling across beats.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Unseen forces (core concept) frame the story: Mara reads them through shadows and formations (setup), the pilgrim identifies himself as their emissary (middle: "unseen forces she'd spent years trying to map"), and at closure the shadows "overlapped around her like embracing hands" as she serves mystery rather than revelation. Development: forces shift from mapped objects to active agents that confront her. Payoff: they transform her from oracle to student. Causal role in two beats (pilgrim's revelation, shadow embrace). Cost connection: her prior mapping "diminished everything"; now she protects mystery. Specificity moderate: the concept operates through shadows and song but could be swapped for "hidden powers" with minor edits. Three gates met.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Steadily unpredictable" (attribute) applies to the pilgrim's voice (paragraph three: "rising when it should fall, soft where strength was expected") and recurs when the cave sings "a new song—steadily unpredictable, never repeating, impossible to anticipate" near closure. Setup clear, closure reprise reweights predictability as virtue rather than flaw. Development: the trait marks the pilgrim as emissary of forces that resist Mara's mapping. Cost connection weak: the attribute describes but does not directly constrain an on-page choice. Two gates (setup, payoff); middle gate absent. Lyric resonance present but not causal pressure. Swappable with "erratic" or "chaotic" without major loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Inhabit" (action) is essential: Mara has "inhabited this crystalline labyrinth for three years" (setup, paragraph one), the pilgrim tells her "You inhabit this space between knowing and mystery" (middle, reframes her dwelling as moral position), and her future role is to "inhabit" wonder differently—"magnify everyday magic...by protecting its essential mystery" (closure implication). Three beats; the verb shifts from literal residence to metaphysical stance. Development: inhabiting "between knowing and mystery" becomes the problem and solution. Causal pressure: her long inhabitation created the prophecy-theft; her new inhabitation will protect mystery. Irreplaceable: swap "live in" and the metaphysical hinge weakens. Cost visible: she must inhabit unknowing. All three gates strong.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>"Through overlapping shadows" (method) is seeded early: "overlapping shadows from three crystal columns created a space of pure perception" (meditation alcove, paragraph two), escalates when shadows "moved wrong, overlapping in configurations that violated the cave's geometry" (middle, paragraph four), and at closure "shadows overlapped around her like embracing hands" to transform her. Three beats; mechanics matter (overlapping = violating geometry = transformation gateway). Development: shadow mechanics shift from tool to agent. Payoff strong: shadows as active force in her rebirth. Specificity high: "Two shadows became three, three became one, one became impossible angles" is irreplaceable. Cost connection: the method that once gave her sight now teaches her blindness. All three gates met.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Musical crystal cave (setting) is indispensable: the cave "sang in frequencies Mara could taste," its "acoustic web" maps prophecy, disrupted footsteps send "discordant ripples," the pearl is housed in the Singing Chamber, and at closure the cave "sang her into something new." Setup immediate (paragraph one), development continuous (shadows, pearl, song), payoff decisive (the cave as active transformer). Causal pressure: environment constrains her gift and enables transformation. The cave's shifting music is the first tremor of doubt (middle beat). Specificity extreme: remove crystalline acoustics and the story collapses. Cost tied to setting: her mastery of the cave's song becomes submission to its unpredictability. Environment pressures every choice and charges the final image. Three gates met strongly.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Timeframe "after the pilgrim arrives" anchors the single continuous scene (setup: "The pilgrim arrived during the blue hour"). All on-page action occurs post-arrival; no jumps. Development weak: time does not tighten decisions—action flows without a clock. Payoff: closure happens in this window but time itself does not pressure the final choice. The frame is present and consistent but essentially static: "after X arrives" is a spatial trigger, not a temporal constraint. Swappable with "during the encounter" or "in the chamber" without impact. Two gates (setup, payoff by default); middle gate (time tightening tactics) absent. Functional but replaceable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Motivation "to magnify everyday magic" is stated (paragraph six: "her gift, her purpose—to magnify everyday magic"), tested when the pilgrim reveals she's "diminished everything" by explaining away wonder (middle beat), and reframed at closure: she will "magnify everyday magic not by revealing it but by protecting its essential mystery." Three beats; the desire remains but the method inverts. Development: friction between stated purpose and actual effect drives her transformation. Cost visible: she must renounce revelation to serve her true purpose. Causal pressure strong. Minor weakness: initial phrasing reads slightly prompt-like ("magnify everyday magic"), reducing organic voice. Three gates met; cost connection clear.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Bright darkness" (tone/oxymoron) recurs purposefully: meditation alcove shadows are "somehow brighter than the bioluminescent moss" (setup, paragraph two), the pearl shows "bright darkness, somehow luminous in its negation" (middle, paragraph seven), and closure delivers "darkness behind her eyelids burned bright with possibility" (final beat). Three appearances; tone coherent and modulates with pressure—brightness increases as Mara's certainty dissolves. Payoff strong: the paradox charges the final image. Specificity high: the exact contradiction (bright/dark) is irreplaceable and tracks her transformation from light-as-knowing to dark-as-wonder. Cost connection clear: brightness now signals mystery, not clarity. Three gates met; causal role in closure.</comment>
