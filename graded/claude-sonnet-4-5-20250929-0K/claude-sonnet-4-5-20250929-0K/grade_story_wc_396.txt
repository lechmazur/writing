<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's interior life is concrete and embodied—shadows "like oil on water," hands shaking from absorbed anger—but her final shift from absorbing darkness to helping families "see themselves in the breath before choice" arrives through a montage of mirror-visions rather than a dramatized struggle with contradictory impulses. The seven-year tenure and "courageous anomaly" status tell more than they show; we never witness her wrestling with burnout or doubt in scene. The families' hatred over Astrid is explained rather than felt through Maren's lived friction with their specific grief.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors clearly: Maren, lighthouse orchard, today, after a failed mediation. The piece reads under an Accumulative/Textural lens—density builds through the mirror-fragment revelations, culminating in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise variant) where Maren "understands finally how to translate pain into recognition" and the shadows gain "starlight." Cost is present but oblique: she has spent hours among the mirrors and her shadows have changed texture, yet the exact price of this new method and what she has foreclosed remain implied rather than viscerally legible on the page. The closure reweights her gift without a decisive physical act or visible forfeiture.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard above ice floes is vivid and specific, and the vintage store mirrors constrain Maren's breakthrough—she must enter this room she's avoided to unlock the new method. Micro-setting (mirrors, fragment, apple trees) charges the final image when blossoms reflect "two families remembering how to choose." Spatial choreography inside the lighthouse is coherent, and the ice-crack below threads through as atmospheric grounding. The mirrors cross the 9+ gate by enabling the core choice and charging closure, but the orchard itself remains largely postcard backdrop after the opening.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—finding a way to resolve the Voss-Henriksen feud when standard methods fail—is signaled early and tightens when Maren enters the mirror room. The fragment acting as prism and the revelation of Astrid's centrality deepen understanding and narrow options (she now knows the thread to pull). However, escalation is cerebral: Maren moves between mirrors and understanding "slowly assembles"; there is no on-page reversal where a tactic fails or a cost forces a trade-off. Agency is renunciation of Thomas's future-seeing in favor of showing hinge-point empathy, but the families' actual conflict and Maren's confrontation with them occur off-page, leaving the peak pressure moment summarized rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme—choosing empathy over inherited rage, seeing the "weighted breath before reply" where cruelty or kindness emerge—arises from concrete images (mirrors, fragment, apple blossoms) without overt thesis. The contrast between Thomas's shattered foresight and Maren's reconstructed purpose is elegant and earned. The final image of apple blossoms reflecting "two families remembering how to choose" offers a resonant, non-literal answer. Minor slip: "reconstitute what Thomas had broken—not the crystal ball itself, but its purpose" edges toward explaining the theme rather than letting the mirrors and fragment do the work alone.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single third-person limited POV remains stable; no head-hopping. Diction is controlled and evocative ("shadow-laced," "weighted breath," "starlight"), and narrative distance modulates appropriately—zooming into Maren's hands shaking, pulling back for the mirror montage. Perceptual signature is present: Maren notices "emotional architecture" and "hinge points," reflecting her peacekeeper lens. The phrase "calmly intuitive" appears as a label in the mirror sequence ("Maren moved between mirrors, calmly intuitive") rather than being shown through a micro-choice under pressure, a brief filter-verb slip that dulls immediacy at a key beat.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is clear and rhythmically varied, with strong imagery ("shadows clung to her like oil on water," "understanding slowly assembling like ice forming on water"). Information density is high; most lines advance character, atmosphere, or plot. Two minor artifacts: "She was what the coastal towns called a shadow-laced peacekeeper" opens with a was-construction that slightly delays entry, and the mirror sequence includes a brief template run ("She held… She moved… She began…") across three consecutive sentences. No loops or major scaffold; propulsion is smooth except for the summarized mirror montage, which compresses key discoveries into telling rather than showing.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The synthesis of peacekeeper gift, broken crystal fragment, and vintage mirrors is specific and non-obvious; the premise transforms the "magic mirror" trope through emotional architecture rather than literal prophecy. The detail of Thomas's note ("when you can see everyone's futures, you forget they have choices") and Maren's counter-method (showing people the breath before choice) feel fresh and earned in hindsight. The apple orchard above ice floes is vivid and purposeful. Minor proximity check: the shadow-laced absorption and the fragment-as-prism both evoke familiar fantasy/speculative templates, but the lighthouse setting and the Astrid revelation ground the execution in particular human grief rather than generic magic.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Maren's decision to enter the mirror room and her shift from absorbing darkness to helping families see hinge-point empathy are key turns. However, her choices inside the lighthouse are largely cerebral and summarized ("understanding slowly assembling"); the confrontation with the families happens off-page. Present across all three gates (setup, middle mirror work, ending), but peak agency is reflected rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The fragment is introduced early (carried for three years, reminder of Thomas), used functionally in the mirror room (prism scattering light to reveal hinge points), and charges the final image ("caught the last light, scattering it toward the sea"). Appears in at least three distinct beats with evolving meaning. The specific property—acting as prism—is irreplaceable and enables the breakthrough; swapping for a generic "magic stone" would require structural rewrites.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Courageous anomaly" is stated early (seven years, guild proud and suspicious) and frames Maren's capacity to attempt the new method, but it functions more as background credential than on-page constraint. The concept does not visibly alter her tactics under pressure—she does not wrestle with the cost of anomaly status or face a choice between endurance and collapse. Present thematically but not causally integrated into middle pressure or closure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Calmly intuitive" appears as a label in the mirror sequence ("Maren moved between mirrors, calmly intuitive, letting her gift work in this new way") but does not constrain or enable a specific on-page choice with visible cost. The trait describes her method rather than forcing a tradeoff—she does not sacrifice speed for accuracy or risk misreading. Functional but replaceable; removing the phrase would not break the scene's logic.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Reconstitute" is named explicitly ("Maren began to reconstitute what Thomas had broken—not the crystal ball itself, but its purpose") and drives the thematic turn from foresight to empathy-mapping. However, the action occurs largely in summary; we do not see Maren's hands or micro-moves as she reconstitutes, only the result (shadows shot through with starlight). Present in setup and closure, but middle dramatization is thin. Swapping for "reframe" or "reimagine" would not require structural changes.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Vintage store mirrors are signaled early (room Maren avoided since childhood), enable the breakthrough (fragment scatters light across mirrored surfaces to reveal hinge moments), and appear in the closure image (blossoms reflecting families). The mechanics matter: each mirror holds decades of reflected moments, and the fragment acts as prism. Present across all three gates; the method is irreplaceable—removing the mirrors would collapse the breakthrough logic.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The lighthouse orchard is anchored early with vivid detail (apple trees above ice floes, rocky soil, shifting ice below) and supplies the mirror room that enables Maren's discovery. The orchard pressures the opening mood (impossible growth, isolation) and charges the final image (blossoms opening above ice). However, the setting does not constrain middle tactics or force a tactical choice; Maren could have the mirror revelation elsewhere with minor edits. Present and atmospheric, but not indispensable to the closure's causal logic.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Weighted breath before reply" is the story's conceptual center—Maren discovers that in the mirrors she can see "that space where people chose cruelty or kindness." The timeframe shapes the thematic lens and appears in the final image ("two families remembering how to choose"). However, it does not tighten on-page decisions; Maren spends "hours among the mirrors" without a live clock that alters her moves. Present and thematically resonant but not a pressure device.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Maren's desire to "translate pain into recognition" and "map empathy onto action" is dramatized through her entry into the mirror room and her discovery of the hinge-point method. The motivation drives the ending's charge (knowing what she'll say to both families). However, friction between want and cost is muted—we do not see her wrestle with the risk of this new method or face a moment where empathy might fail. Present across beats and shapes closure, but internal conflict is underplayed.</comment>
