<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Vera's interiority is concrete and embodied—"gripped reality loosely, like holding water" and the parasol's worn ivory tip ground her shift. Her choice to postpone the clinic consultation feels earned through three days of volunteering that demonstrate her need to understand rather than flee. The grandmother's parasol backstory risks exposition but pivots to present choice ("I thought it was about survival, but maybe it was about knowing when to let go"). Minor weakness: the final realization ("the change wasn't death calling, but life insisting") edges toward label-speak, though it's rooted in prior concrete listening.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates pressure through Vera's voluntary immersion in disaster relief work, listening to "the particular frequency of places approaching their final season." The closure—postponing consultation and staying through seasons—constitutes Earned Stasis with visible cost (she forgoes medical answers to remain present). The cost is legible: she trades resolution for sustained attention, and the parasol's tip wears smoother as she "tested her own hollow spaces." One meaningful deepening occurs when she moves from seeking permission to understanding "the approach itself was part of the song."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The drift-ice marina is specific and purposeful: "slabs of drift ice that never quite melted" and the frozen channel supply the journey that delivers key dialogue with Dr. Henriksen. The parasol functions as micro-setting, its ivory tip used to test floorboards in backstory and worn smooth by present grip, constraining her search for "hollow spaces." Sensory economy is strong—salt, diesel, polar dusk—filtered through Vera's changed perception. The three villages visited accumulate the hum motif without postcard drift.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake: understanding the hum of approaching endings rather than seeking medical closure. The postponement of Thursday's consultation is a meaningful tightening that forecloses the path of easy answers. Pressure coheres through accumulative listening across villages and seasons, and the final choice—to stay and volunteer—carries visible cost (she gives up medical resolution, wears down the parasol tip through sustained presence). Under the Accumulative lens, one deepening suffices: her shift from terror to "solace...windborne and clean" reweights the stake.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: the parasol's dual uses (hiding/letting go), the hum beneath sounds, villages approaching final seasons juxtaposed with children playing on ice. The line "The endings don't erase what came before" avoids abstraction by anchoring in Dr. Henriksen's patients and on-page observation. The final image—parasol tip worn smoother, hollow spaces searched not for hiding but for presence—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. Minor slip: "life insisting she finally, fully, listen" edges toward thesis statement, though it grows from prior sensory work.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Single POV with consistent psychic distance and a distinct perceptual signature: Vera notices frequencies, translucence, dissolution. The prose modulates purposefully—"fold in patience" and "windborne and clean" carry lyric compression that fits her altered state. Dialogue is sparse and goal-driven; Dr. Henriksen's lines serve pressure without explaining theme. Minor register drift: "the particular gentleness she'd grown to recognize in people who worked at the intersection of compassion and death" reads slightly clinical for her voice, though it's brief and the surrounding texture recovers.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally, and information density is high—most lines do double work (parasol as survival tool and letting-go symbol, ice damage as literal and thematic). No paraphrase loops detected. Mild scaffold: "Now she gripped reality loosely" and "The world had become translucent, provisional" restate the same shift across adjacent sentences in paragraph two, costing ~−0.2. One figurative string in the opening (salt/diesel, boats creaking, drift ice) risks density but remains purposeful and embodied. The final line ("life insisting she finally, fully, listen") uses an adverb stack that slightly dulls propulsion.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>The synthesis of post-anesthesia shift, disaster relief volunteering, and heirloom parasol as metric for presence is specific and non-obvious. The grandmother's Warsaw backstory (testing floorboards for hiding places vs. letting go) transforms a stock symbol through concrete dual use. Risk: the piece commits to accumulative texture and quiet closure in a literary market that often demands decisive change. The "hum of approaching endings" avoids generic death-awareness by anchoring in villages, boats, buildings with specific frequencies. Minor proximity concern: "everything, inevitably, beautifully, drifted toward its dissolution" echoes poetic abstraction common in literary climate fiction, though the parasol's worn tip grounds it.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Vera arrives seeking consultation at a euthanasia clinic (implied by "Dr. Henriksen's clinic...intersection of compassion and death") but her decision to volunteer rather than consult, then postpone Thursday's appointment, creates two beats. She's present but her role as euthanasia tourist is more framing premise than active driver—her choices center on understanding the hum, not the euthanasia decision itself. The element signals setup and middle choice but doesn't causally shape closure; she stays to volunteer, not to pursue or reject assisted death on the page. Swappability: the story would function with "grief counseling" or "palliative care" with minor edits.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Parasol appears in three beats: arrival (setup), boat journey (Warsaw backstory and dual-use reveal), and final paragraph (tip worn smoother by searching hollow spaces). The ivory tip's wear is concrete and tracks causally. The object reweights at closure—originally a survival/hiding tool, it becomes a metric for presence and courage. Cost: the physical wearing signals sustained engagement. Cap consideration: the parasol drives conversation and final image but doesn't narrow a middle choice with mechanical consequence; its work is largely symbolic reconfiguration rather than causal pressure on tactics.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"A fold in patience" is named on-page ("The work demanded a fold in patience—that peculiar quality of waiting without expectation") and enacted through three days of sorting supplies and learning village names. It shapes one key turn: her willingness to stay through seasons without resolution. The phrase itself is lyric and specific, charging the waiting with purposeful texture. Middle development: sorting medications and listing emergency contacts embody patience as active holding. Closure: staying through summer and autumn demonstrates the fold's cost. Slight swappability: "sustained attention" or "endurance" could replace with edits, but the spatial metaphor (fold) is more specific.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"Grips reality loosely, like holding water" is established early and embodied: "The world had become translucent, provisional. She could see through the surface of things to their eventual dissolution." The trait enables her to hear frequencies and complicates her medical choice—she seeks understanding, not cure. It constrains the middle: she can perceive endings in villages and boats, which informs her decision to stay. Closure: the attribute charges her final stance (remaining present while everything drifts). Cost: seeing dissolution risks paralysis, yet she chooses engagement. One visible tradeoff: she forgoes clinic resolution to honor the loosened grip.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Trawl" appears as concrete action: "helped trawl through donation shipments, organizing supplies." It drives the middle development—three days of sorting medications and learning village names build the "fold in patience" and expose her to the hum across communities. The action enables the boat journey (supply run) where key dialogue occurs. Closure linkage: the trawling through donations mirrors her internal search ("trawling her own hollow spaces" is implicit in the final image). Irreplaceability: moderate—"sort" or "organize" could substitute, but "trawl" carries connotations of searching/sifting that echo the thematic work.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Disaster relief volunteering is signaled early (Dr. Henriksen sorting thermal blankets, coordinating aid for fishing communities) and structures the middle: three days organizing supplies, then a supply run across the frozen channel to three villages. The method matters—it places Vera among "places approaching their final season" and provides access to the frequencies she seeks. Closure: she stays through seasons continuing to volunteer, and the method's mechanics (waiting without expectation, holding space for continuation and cessation) directly enable the "fold in patience." The volunteering is the tactical means by which she learns, not ornamental backdrop.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Drift-ice marina is anchored early (salt/diesel, boats creaking, drift ice that never melts) and supplies resources: the frozen channel necessitates the boat journey, and the remote northern harbor houses Dr. Henriksen's converted-lighthouse clinic. The ice damage is "catastrophic," raising the stakes for the communities Vera serves. The setting pressures choices—she must cross dangerous ice to deliver supplies, and the polar dusk and frozen expanse provide the sensory ground for "windborne and clean" solace. Closure: the marina is named in the final paragraph as the place she stays "through summer, then autumn," cementing it as the locus of her transformation. The drift ice's refusal to melt mirrors her sustained, patient presence.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Timeframe is anchored: "she had woken six months ago fundamentally changed." The six-month gap before northern arrival is backstory, but the present action unfolds over "three days" of volunteering, "the fourth morning" boat trip, and then "through summer, then autumn" in the final paragraph. The timeframe tightens decisions—she postpones "Thursday's consultation," a concrete near-future anchor. The seasonal arc (dawn arrival → polar dusk → summer/autumn) charges the closure, showing sustained cost. The "after waking up changed" premise drives her search but doesn't impose a live clock that alters moment-to-moment tactics; it's more causal origin than present tightener.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Motivation is dramatized immediately: "she needed to understand what she was hearing: that low frequency hum beneath everyday sounds." The desire drives all choices—volunteering to be near the clinic yet delaying consultation, accompanying the supply run to listen to villages, and postponing Thursday to stay and learn. Friction: the safer path (medical answers) competes with the riskier stance (remaining present with endings). Cost: she wears down the parasol tip and forgoes resolution. The final line ("the change wasn't death calling, but life insisting she finally, fully, listen") names the shift, but it's earned by prior concrete listening across boats, buildings, and bodies. The motivation braids want (understand the hum) and fear (dissolution) throughout.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tone is coherent and purposeful: the opening's "salt and diesel" mingles practical and elegiac, and "windborne and clean" recurs to describe the solace in endings. The tone modulates with pressure—early uncertainty ("gripped reality loosely") gives way to "something windborne and clean" after the boat journey, then firms into sustained presence in the closing paragraph. The polar setting and disaster relief context support the tone's balance of loss and calm. The phrase "windborne solace" itself appears once but charges the final image: her staying through seasons embodies the tone's promise. Minor risk: "inevitably, beautifully, drifted" in the final paragraph could tip into sentimentality, but the parasol's worn tip and hollow-space search anchor it.</comment>
