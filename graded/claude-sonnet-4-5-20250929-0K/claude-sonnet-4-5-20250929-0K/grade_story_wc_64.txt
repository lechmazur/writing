<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marta's motivation is clear and her progression from chess defeat to decoding her grandmother's archive is causally sound. Her interior voice remains consistent—"blithe about death" is embodied through her humming and marigold-planting, and the shift to investigative focus feels earned. The grandmother remains an off-page presence whose choices are inferred, not dramatized, which limits relationship pressure. Minor deduction: the final paragraph's "understanding's cold light" edges toward label-speak, though it's quickly grounded in the concrete plan to visit seven graves.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (who, where, when) arrive cleanly within the opening paragraph. The structure follows a single continuous scene (tournament hall exit → silo investigation) with clear causal progression: chess loss prompts reexamination of symbols, leading to coordinate discovery and tomorrow's plan. Closure reads as Charged Poise—Marta crystallizes her next move with visible cost (the recognition that her grandmother preserved hidden truths, reweighting the tapestry and sovereign case). The inferred lens is Causal with Accumulative texture; the ending reconfigures prior material without requiring a dramatic physical turn.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The cobalt silo is vividly anchored ("blue paint peeling in spirals," "velveteen" darkness, broken roof revealing stars) and functions as more than backdrop—it provides a private workspace for Marta's decoding effort. The cemetery and its iron gates, the tapestry's tactile presence on concrete, and the camping lantern all ground the scene in specific sensory detail. The silo's interior constraints (darkness, floor space) shape the unfolding investigation. Minor gap: the transition from car to silo interior is compressed; we don't see her enter or set up, slightly weakening spatial choreography.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—discovering what the tapestry's symbols mean and why her grandmother encoded them—is signaled early and tightens through Marta's methodical attempts (historical ciphers, cemetery symbolism, botanical codes all fail). The chess-match insight ("see the shape of intentions") provides the key reversal that unlocks the coordinates, narrowing options and altering knowledge. The cost is conceptual and relational: learning that her grandmother lived a hidden archive of corrected identities reweights Marta's inheritance and her own role as cemetery gardener. One meaningful deepening with clear agency and a felt shift in understanding.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the interplay of chess strategy (seeing intentions beneath moves), cemetery work (the dead "tenderly organized," the living "untraceable and wild"), and the grandmother's covert recordkeeping. The tapestry and sovereign case serve as concrete anchors rather than allegorical tokens. The final image—"uncharted echoes close, waiting for someone blithe enough to listen"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer to the central question of how to honor hidden truths. The piece resists moralizing; Marta's resolve to visit the seven graves leaves purpose and consequence open yet charged.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and apt, filtering detail through Marta's professional and personal lens (marigolds, headstones, chess tactics). Perceptual signature is consistent: she notices border patterns, grave markings, and symbolic sequences. Diction stays character-bound with occasional elevated touches ("velveteen gloom," "frayed threads of ink") that feel voice-motivated rather than intrusive. Minor slip: "understanding's cold light" in the penultimate paragraph briefly veers toward abstract summary, though it recovers quickly with the concrete plan. No dialogue appears; interiority and narrative distance remain clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and rhythmic, with strong opening and closing images. Information density is high—most sentences advance plot, character, or atmosphere. Minor issues: "velveteen gloom" is used twice (opening of silo investigation and closing paragraph), creating a small loop; the phrase "tenderly organized" appears in both the living/dead reflection and the grandmother's archive description, functioning as a thematic thread but risking echo. The chess-match framing and tapestry investigation are woven efficiently. Sentence openings vary and no major template cadence or filter-verb stacks appear. Deduction for modest repetition that slightly dulls momentum without obscuring closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of chess strategy insight applied to cemetery recordkeeping and textile decoding is specific and non-obvious. The grandmother-as-archivist premise transforms the "hidden family secret" trope through concrete occupational detail (groundskeeper notebooks, grave markings, tapestry border as cipher). The piece commits fully to its conceptual stakes—truth preservation through material culture—without retreating into genre safety. Risk-taking is moderate: the structure is linear and the ending, while open, follows expected contours. The combination feels fresh within its frame, though the cemetery-gardener-discovers-family-mystery premise has lineage in literary fiction.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marta's role as cemetery gardener is established early and her "blithe" attitude is embodied (humming, planting marigolds). The occupation frames her understanding of death and organization, directly motivating her approach to decoding. Her professional knowledge (notebooks, grave diagrams) enables the middle turn. The trait appears in the opening reflection and is reprised in the penultimate paragraph ("blithe enough to listen"), charging the closure. Two beats of causal involvement plus closure linkage, with visible cost in the reweighting of her inheritance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The sovereign case appears twice: first as inherited object containing coins and letter, second when Marta opens it to study the letter during the silo investigation. Its presence provides the letter that yields coordinates, enabling the decoding breakthrough. The case itself is described but not handled in ways that constrain choice—it's the letter inside that does causal work. Functional but the container remains slightly ornamental compared to its contents. Two-beat presence with middle causal involvement but not indispensable; a folded letter alone could serve.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Uncharted echoes" is introduced as the grandmother's archive of incorrectly recorded lives and drives the central mystery. The concept shapes Marta's stakes (discovering what was preserved and why) and her tactics (treating symbols as coordinates rather than cipher). It reappears in the closing image ("uncharted echoes close, waiting"), reweighting the silo and tapestry as vessels of hidden truth. Three-beat involvement: setup in grandmother's notebooks, middle revelation of seven graves, closure charge in final line. Cost is conceptual—Marta inherits both knowledge and responsibility.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Tenderly organized" describes both the cemetery's official arrangement and the grandmother's covert archive. The trait appears twice: the living/dead reflection and the penultimate paragraph linking grandmother's lightness to hidden precision. It functions thematically more than causally—it doesn't constrain an on-page choice but does frame Marta's recognition of her grandmother's dual life. Lyric reprise that reweights meaning but lacks middle development or visible action cost. Setup and closure presence, modest thematic charge.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Untangle" is signaled early ("she needed to untangle something") and drives the entire silo investigation. The action manifests concretely: Marta spreads the tapestry, aligns the letter, counts symbols, traces border patterns, and discovers coordinates. The untangling process produces the story's key reversal (symbols as coordinates, not cipher) and leads directly to the ending plan. Three beats: stated need, enacted methodology, result that redefines options. The specific mechanics matter; a generic "solve" would not capture the textile-specific unraveling. Strong causal pressure with closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The method is introduced early (tapestry border symbols, grandmother's notebooks) and recurs throughout the silo scene. Marta's decoding attempts are shown on the page: she tries ciphers, then shifts to spatial reading, aligns letter fragments with border wear, counts repetitions, and discovers coordinates. The frayed-threads detail links letter deterioration to tapestry age, providing the breakthrough. Three beats with concrete mechanics that shape her investigative tactics. The method is specific and irreplaceable—removing the tapestry-border mechanism would break the plot. Strong integration with closure participation.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The cobalt silo is vividly rendered (blue paint spirals, broken roof, velveteen darkness, concrete floor) and provides the private workspace necessary for Marta's investigation. It appears in four beats: opening image, interior investigation scene, moment of understanding, closing frame. The setting enables the action but doesn't constrain choices in ways that alter tactics—Marta could decode elsewhere. The silo's qualities (isolated, dark, open to stars) charge the atmosphere and final image without applying pressure. Strong atmospheric presence with closure participation but modest causal force.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>The timeframe is established in the opening line and bookended in the closing paragraph ("The chess clock had run down, but the game was just beginning"). The chess match loss occurs "an hour ago," anchoring the night drive and silo investigation in immediate aftermath. Time doesn't tighten decisions—Marta works at her own pace with no deadline pressure. The framing functions as metaphorical structure (strategic patience learned from defeat applied to decoding) rather than as a constraint that alters tactics. Setup and thematic reprise present, but no middle tightening or live clock that forces choices.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marta's desire to "discover the shape of intentions" is dramatized through her chess-match reflection and decoding breakthrough. The motivation is conflicted: she's failed at chess by missing her opponent's strategy, which drives her reexamination of the tapestry symbols. Her shift from seeking "what the symbols meant" to "the shape of intentions behind them" produces the coordinates insight. The desire appears in three beats (chess loss, methodological pivot, grandmother's intentions understood) and incurs conceptual cost—recognizing her grandmother's hidden life and her own inherited responsibility. Strong causal involvement with closure charge.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Velveteen gloom" is introduced when Marta enters the silo and reprised in the closing paragraph, framing the investigation. The tone is consistent—soft darkness, melancholy, quiet intensity—and modulates appropriately (chess defeat somber, decoding focused, ending charged with discovery). The descriptor does double duty: tactile (velveteen's soft-smothering texture) and atmospheric (gloom as obscured truth). The tone charges the final image by linking physical darkness to hidden knowledge now approaching light. Setup and closure participation with coherent modulation; the tone is integral to the piece's mood but not irreplaceable—similar atmospheric language could serve.</comment>
