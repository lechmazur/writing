<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Sarielle's motivation to preserve her language is clear and rooted in cultural loss, but her choices feel predetermined rather than pressured. The copper veins function as marker rather than internal contradiction. The final walk-away reads as acceptance but lacks visible cost—her fingers are "worn smooth" yet this foreclosure carries more poetic assertion than embodied consequence. Interiority remains atmospheric rather than character-particular under stress.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece accumulates sensory translation beats (diamond to sound, texture to echo, motion to language) and lands a Resonant Reconfiguration—Sarielle walks away, her language now embedded in the canyon's perpetual song. Orientation anchors quickly (storyteller, canyon, diamond). Cost is present but oblique: worn fingers and dimmed veins suggest depletion, and the walk-away forecloses her physical presence, but the final image celebrates perpetuity more than loss. One meaningful deepening occurs when the birds respond to her touch-generated sound, tightening the translation loop.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The bone towers constrain her translation method—she reads their texture to generate sound—and the canyon's endless echoes function as amplifier and archive, directly enabling closure. Sensory detail (rough marrow, smooth polish, sharp calcium edges) is specific and filtered through her tactile focus. The diamond's interaction with light and bone charges the final perpetual-song image. Spatial choreography remains clear across her nocturnal work.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Dominant stake: preserve the Velathi language in comprehensible form. Pressure deepens when the birds respond to her sound-echoes, proving the translation works. Agency is present—she chooses to walk away after completing the work—but the climactic night of translation unfolds without setback or tactical shift, reducing escalation texture. Cost is signaled (worn fingers, departure) yet the perpetual success of the echoes softens the trade-off. One meaningful tightening when sound, light, and motion converge.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme—transformation as preservation, translation across sensory modes—emerges organically from the diamond's flaw and Sarielle's tactile method. The final image (canyon singing forever via texture-to-sound) offers a non-literal answer to "how does a dead language survive?" without moralizing. The "sensation of meaning itself, rough and smooth and sharp and true" risks abstraction but connects to prior concrete textures. Subtext operates in her quiet departure and the irony that a "cursed" diamond enables perpetual voice.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with consistent psychic distance. Perceptual signature is tactile and pattern-focused: "copper-veined hands," "fingers read the bone's story," birds as "murmurations" of language. Diction remains elevated but voice-coherent ("quietly articulate in a tongue no ear could hear"). No head-hopping. Elision of the translation night's duration is purposeful compression that serves accumulative momentum. Free indirect style is clean throughout.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; figurative density is high but mostly coherent (diamond's flaw as "frozen scream" and "tunnel of echoes"). Sentence openings vary. One minor loop: "The diamond was her last hope" / "The diamond grew hot" / "She set the diamond"—functional anchor but template-adjacent. Information density is strong; lines multi-task (e.g., copper veins mark lineage and warm with use). No major clarity issues. Propulsion slows slightly during the description of Velathi grammar patterns, but recovers at closure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of tactile language, flawed-diamond acoustics, and avian murmuration as translation medium is specific and non-obvious. The transformation of "curse" into preservation tool is earned. Emotional specificity in the quiet departure and perpetual-echo closure avoids sentimentality. Risk is present in the non-standard grammar system and accumulative structure. However, the "last speaker walks away after magical translation succeeds" frame echoes familiar elegiac-fantasy templates; the piece elevates through sensory particularity rather than premise novelty.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Sarielle's choices drive key beats: she brings the diamond to the towers, experiments with light refraction, translates texture into sound through the night, and walks away. Setup early; middle development spans the translation discovery; closure participation is the departure that leaves the work active. Causal pressure is moderate—her actions enable the outcome, but no significant friction or cost-driven pivot occurs mid-process.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The flawed diamond appears early, is handled across multiple beats (held to sun, pressed to bone, grows hot during translation), and its flaw—the "tunnel of echoes"—mechanically enables the texture-to-sound conversion central to closure. It is present in the final image by proxy (the perpetual echoes it created) and shapes the ending's meaning. Swappability is low; the specific flaw property is irreplaceable. Strong causal and closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The "tunnel of echoes" is named as the diamond's flaw and functions mechanically to convert touch into acoustic form. It appears early and directly enables the translation method. Middle development: the echoes respond to her sound and weave them together. Closure: the canyon becomes a perpetual echo archive. Causal role is clear, though the concept operates more as mechanism than stake-shaping constraint—it solves rather than pressures.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Quietly articulate" is seeded early ("quietly articulate in a tongue no ear could hear") and thematically reprised in the ending's paradox of silent touch made audible. However, the trait functions as descriptor rather than constraint—it does not force a visible trade-off or limit her choices on the page. Present and thematically coherent, but swappable with "silent eloquence" or similar without altering plot mechanics. Lyric resonance without causal teeth.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>"Harness" is the stated action and she executes it: binding texture to sound through the diamond. Setup in her goal statement, middle development when she discovers the method, payoff when the translation succeeds and she walks away. The action is necessary to closure but slightly generic—"translate" or "convert" could substitute with minimal rewrite. Causal presence is strong; specificity is moderate. Two-gate coverage plus closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The birds are observed for weeks (setup), their spiral tightens in response to her echoes (middle development), and their pattern becomes "a visible representation of what she created" (closure participation). The method shapes the ending image and demonstrates the translation's success. Early signal and closure linkage are strong. Causal work is present but secondary—the birds validate rather than enable. Specificity is high; swappability low.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The bone towers supply the texture she reads and the surface she touches to generate sound; the canyon's "endless echoes" amplify and archive her translation. Setup immediate, middle development spans her interaction with multiple towers, closure depends on their perpetual echo property. The setting is mechanically indispensable—remove it and the plot fails. Strong causal pressure, closure linkage, and irreplaceability. Visible cost: her physical depletion from the work.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Timeframe spans backstory (language death "three winters past"), weeks of bird observation, one translation night, and the departure at dawn. Setup and closure participation are clear. Middle development is present but underspecified—"weeks" and "through the night" compress duration without tactical pressure from the clock. The language's prior death motivates urgency but does not tighten on-page decisions. Lyric reprise (death → perpetual voice) reweights the stake. Moderate causal and thematic work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Her motivation—translate texture into sound to preserve Velathi language—is seeded early, drives all major beats (diamond use, tower interaction, translation night), and is fulfilled at closure. Friction is implicit: the Velathi communicated through touch, which "no ear could hear." The story dramatizes her solving this mismatch. Cost is present (worn fingers, departure). Strong causal pressure and closure linkage. Slightly abstract phrasing ("translate texture") but operationalized on the page.</comment>

**Drive Lens**: Accumulative/Textural. The piece layers sensory translation beats (tactile → acoustic, visual pattern → linguistic meaning) and culminates in a Resonant Reconfiguration where Sarielle's departure leaves her work perpetually active. Pressure accumulates through discovery and demonstration rather than conflict; the cadence shift at dawn reweights preservation as transformation.

**Closure Type**: Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant). Sarielle walks away after embedding her language in the canyon's physics. Cost is oblique but legible: worn hands, dimmed veins, physical departure. The perpetual echoes memorialize the Velathi without requiring her presence, foreclosing her role as sole keeper.

**Global High-Band Gate Check** (Q2 ≥8.8, Q4 ≥8.2, Q7 ≥8.2 for 8.8+ eligibility): Q2=7.4, Q4=7.1, Q7=7.3. High-band entry is not achieved; individual category caps at 8.7 apply where relevant, but scores remain below that threshold on merit.
