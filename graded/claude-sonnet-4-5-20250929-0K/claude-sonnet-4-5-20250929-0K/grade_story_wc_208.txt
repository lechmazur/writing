<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Maya's motivation is concrete—hunting driftwood, seeking simplicity that scaffolds complexity—and her discovery of the lantern slide forces a micro-choice to reimagine her approach. Internal contradiction appears when she realizes reduction alone isn't enough; she must embrace transparency and layered history. The final decision to ignore GPS and "navigate by older alliances" carries conceptual cost (abandoning modern convenience) but feels more thematic declaration than embodied struggle. Interiority occasionally drifts toward label-speak ("timewoven alliances," "turbine-song of time") rather than character-particular perception under pressure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural—pressure builds through layered discovery (archway → slide → inscriptions → root-ball) with a cadence shift at closure when Maya rejects GPS navigation. Orientation anchors clearly by ~80 words (Maya, coastal service road, post-storm). The closure is a Resonant Reconfiguration (Conceptual Repricing hybrid): the final image of carrying forward "the lesson" reweights her artistic method with felt cost (rejecting technological aid, committing to older processes). One meaningful deepening occurs when the slide's palimpsest changes her understanding from reduction to transparency. Cost is conceptual and legible in the final refusal, though the physical stakes remain low throughout.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>The archway functions as micro-setting that constrains movement ("half-choked with kelp and debris") and charges the threshold metaphor at closure. Sensory detail is purposeful: "wind sang through cracks with a low, mechanical hum" filters through Maya's artist perception. The lantern slide as object-setting provides tactile discovery ("corroded brass frame," scratched inscriptions) that alters her artistic stance. The root-ball's "twisted chambers catching water and light" is specific enough to pre-visualize the sculpture, grounding the conceptual turn in physical material. Spatial choreography remains clean across the brief journey.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Dominant stake: reimagining her sculptural method to reveal rather than reduce complexity. One meaningful tightening when the slide's layered inscriptions challenge her reductive approach, forcing the conceptual pivot to transparency. The storm and impassable road create situational pressure, though consequences remain primarily internal. Agency is decision-based (venturing back into rain, hauling the root-ball, ignoring GPS) with conceptual cost visible in the final refusal. Under the Accumulative lens, the deepening suffices, but the lack of a second on-page constraint or sacrifice keeps this from higher bands.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Theme of layered history versus simplification emerges organically through the slide's palimpsest and Maya's pivot toward transparency. The closure image—"layer by transparent layer, humming with the turbine-song of time"—offers a resonant answer without moralizing. However, "timewoven alliances" reads as prompt-echo, and the final paragraph tilts toward thematic summary ("she had learned to navigate by older alliances now") rather than trusting the image alone. Subtext operates in the GPS rejection and the nested-objects vision, but the conceptual framing occasionally replaces scene pressure with assertion.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited with Maya's perceptual signature (artist's eye for "simplified forms," "storm-gifted shapes," "translucent chambers"). Diction is controlled and voice-motivated, though phrases like "turbine-hum reverie" and "timewoven alliances" drift toward elevated register that feels authorial rather than character-interior. No dialogue to assess. Psychic distance modulates purposefully between close sensory detail and reflective passages. The prose rhythm supports emotional beats, compressing during discovery and breathing during the conceptual turn. Filter verbs appear sparingly and serve clarity.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Information density is high; most sentences advance perception, discovery, or decision. Rhythm varies naturally with no template cadence. Minor scaffold appears: "She thought of her sculptures... She thought of Eleanor Strand..." creates a brief stem-repetition pattern (~mid-story) that could tighten. The final paragraph edges toward overwriting with stacked metaphor ("transparent layer, humming with the turbine-song of time itself") but remains legible. No loops or paraphrase chains. Sentence openings vary; clarity holds throughout. One stock phrase: "catching her breath" in the archway.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The palimpsest slide as catalyst for artistic pivot offers a fresh synthesis of Victorian artifact and contemporary sculpture practice. The specific coastal salvage detail (kelp-choked archway, cedar root-ball with fishing floats) grounds the concept. However, the core emotional arc—artist discovers layered meaning, revises method—follows a familiar template without strong transformation. The "rejecting GPS to follow old wisdom" closure reads as symbolic rather than urgent. Risk-taking in the accumulative structure and conceptual framing elevates within band, but the piece doesn't land a non-obvious turn that redefines prior material.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Maya (spirited driftwood sculptor) drives all key choices: entering the archway, examining the slide, venturing back into rain, hauling the root-ball, ignoring GPS. Setup immediate (first sentence), middle development (slide discovery forces pivot), payoff (final sculptural vision and navigation choice). Causal pressure across three beats. "Spirited" reads as label-only; "sculptor" does decisive work. Strong integration with visible cost at closure.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Magic lantern slide appears in setup (archway discovery), development (inscription examination forces conceptual pivot), and payoff (mentioned as potential nested object in final sculpture). Two distinct beats with causal pressure: the inscriptions reweight her artistic method. However, the slide becomes one item among several in the final vision rather than the indispensable hinge. Swappable with another Victorian artifact bearing inscriptions without major structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Timewoven alliances" framed early via the slide's inscriptions (Eleanor, James, Ruth across decades). Development occurs when Maya grasps "how artists across decades might speak to one another through their work." Payoff in final line: "navigate by older alliances." The concept shapes her artistic realization but remains thematic rather than tactical—it doesn't constrain an on-page choice with immediate cost. Present across beats but functions more as interpretive frame than dramatic pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Perpetually learning" established early ("She was perpetually learning to read landscapes this way") and demonstrated in middle beat when she learns "something new about timewoven alliances" from the slide. Payoff when she reads landscape without GPS, having learned from "makers who had worked this same threshold." The trait enables the final navigation choice but lacks visible tradeoff or cost—it's purely positive. Two beats; causal role modest; no constraint friction.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Reimagine" central to Maya's identity (first paragraph: "shapes she could reimagine into sculpture") and drives the major turn when the slide forces her to reimagine her method from reduction to transparency. Payoff in the final sculptural vision: reimagining the root-ball with nested objects. The action is irreplaceable—the story hinges on the pivot from one artistic vision to another. Causal across setup, development, and closure; visible cost in abandoning prior approach.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"Through layered meanings" seeded early (slide "layering hull over wave over sky in translucent depths") and articulated at the turn: "What if she could create pieces that revealed their own layered meanings?" Payoff in closure image: "layer by transparent layer." The method shapes the ending vision but mechanics remain abstract—how layering will constrain future work isn't demonstrated on the page. Lyric reprise reweights the stake but lacks middle-beat tactical friction.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Storm-tossed archway provides immediate physical constraint (passage "half-choked with kelp and debris"), forces entry choice, supplies the slide discovery that drives the conceptual turn, and anchors the threshold metaphor that charges closure ("worked this same threshold between chaos and form"). Setup, development (acoustics, debris field), and payoff (disappears behind her but lesson carries forward). Micro-setting alters tactics and meaning; irreplaceable hinge for the plot and theme.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"After the GPS fails" framed immediately (first sentence: "GPS blinked out") and returns at closure when it "flickered back to life" but Maya ignores it. The failure forces manual navigation and primes the final choice, but the timeframe doesn't tighten decisions—no urgency or clock pressure. Present at setup and payoff with mild causal role (enables thematic contrast old/new) but doesn't shape middle beats or escalate stakes. Functional but replaceable with other modern-tech failures.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>"To scaffold complexity with simplicity" stated explicitly early ("Her motivation had always been to scaffold complexity with simplicity") and drives the conflict when the slide challenges that philosophy. Payoff in final vision: "A complexity made legible through simple arrangement." Friction dramatized through the pivot from reduction to transparency with conceptual cost (abandoning prior method). Three beats; causal pressure; visible tradeoff. The telling is direct rather than embodied in failed attempts, which caps the score below 8.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>"Turbine-hum reverie" established early (wind through archway "with a low, mechanical hum"; "turbine's steady roar" in first sentence) and modulates through discovery beats ("The storm's rhythm pulsed around her, a turbine-hum reverie"). Payoff: "humming with the turbine-song of time itself." Coherent across turns with purposeful cadence that supports the accumulative lens. Charges the final image but tone remains static rather than escalating with pressure—no tonal shift when stakes deepen. Strong reprise but limited modulation.</comment>
