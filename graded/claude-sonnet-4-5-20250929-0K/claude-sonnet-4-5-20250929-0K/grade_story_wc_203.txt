<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marcus's interiority is character-particular—"grateful for the silence that allowed him to hear what really mattered"—and his micro-choices (climbing to investigate, promising the ghost) are motivated by established traits. However, the internal contradiction is mild; he's stopped being frightened years ago, which flattens tension. The daughter reflection ("ever since his daughter asked him why…") provides backstory that primes his drive to discover hidden things, anchoring present action. Emotions are embodied ("feeling the weightless burden"), though the final promise feels slightly easy without visible cost beyond his time.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece opens with fluorescent death, moves through ghost-guided discovery, and closes with Marcus promising to reunite the mainspring with its carousel—a Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise) where the cost is felt in his commitment and the ghost's relief. Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the second paragraph. The escalation reads as density increase: the ghost's agitation → tile discovery → the photograph's inscription → Marcus's vow. One meaningful deepening occurs when he understands the ghost's need and commits to carry it forward, reweighting the opening "weightless burden" motif. Cost is legible in his acceptance of a new obligation and the ghost's fading as release.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office is vivid and purposeful: warped counter, curling posters, water-stained tiles. The ceiling itself constrains Marcus's discovery—he must drag a rickety chair, press gently, lift the box down—micro-setting choices that alter tactics. Dust accumulation patterns (his trained eye) guide the find. The setting pressures his professional task (assess the elevator) against the ghost's urgency, and the final turn to "the broken elevator" bookends the space with purpose. Sensory hierarchy reflects his expertise: he notices "disturbance" in dust before anything decorative.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Marcus's drive to discover what ceilings hide, primed by his daughter's question and the ghost's urgency. The ghost's increasing agitation narrows his options—he investigates before assessing the elevator. One meaningful tightening occurs when he finds the mainspring and reads the inscription, which reweights his task from mere repair assessment to a promise with relational cost (reuniting object and carousel). Agency is decision and endurance: he commits to the search and the vow. Cost is visible in his acceptance of the burden and the ghost's release, though the price feels modest—no trade-off or foreclosed path beyond his time and effort.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically: "some burdens, however weightless they seemed, still needed carrying." The mainspring barrel and Celeste's story embody hidden histories that demand return to light. The final image—Marcus tucking the box under his arm, turning to the elevator, "ready to assess what could be saved and what needed letting go"—offers a resonant, non-literal answer without moralizing. The "cracks in the façade" concept threads through: discovering what's hidden overhead, revealing deeper truths. Subtext operates in the ghost's silent agitation and Marcus's natural engagement with her presence. The piece avoids thematic echo by dramatizing the burden rather than declaring it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Single POV, stable third-limited with free indirect touches: "He'd learned that buildings spoke through their mechanical voices—but also through the other presences that lingered." Perceptual signature is distinct—Marcus notices dust patterns, ventilation, his trained eye scanning acoustic tiles. His dialogue with the ghost ("The carousel… This powered it?") feels natural, goal-driven, pursuing understanding. Psychic distance tightens at closure: "she seemed almost solid, almost real." No head-hopping, no filter-verb stacks in peak beats. Voice modulates from professional observation to quiet promise without register drift. The prose reflects his mind: methodical, observant, unbothered by the supernatural.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Syntax varies purposefully: short declaratives ("Marcus set down his toolbox") to longer, nested observations ("Here, the dust lay thick and undisturbed, but there, along one tile's edge, the gray film showed disturbance"). No paraphrase loops or template cadence. Information density is high—most lines advance character, setting, or discovery. One minor scaffold: "he'd been called here because…" could tighten. The final paragraph stacks three phrases ("Some burdens… Some cracks… Some secrets…") in purposeful parallelism that charges the image. Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line resolves by action. No figurative muddle in peak beats. Propulsion is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The ghost-guide premise is familiar, but the specificity—elevator repair technician, dust accumulation analysis, a mainspring barrel for a clockwork carousel—synthesizes into a coherent whole. The emotional arc (discovering hidden history, promising to reunite it) feels earned. Transformation test: swapping names and places would weaken the circus/carousel resonance. The "weightless burden" tone and the cracks-in-façade concept integrate well, though neither is radically fresh. No proximity echoes. The piece commits fully to its premise without retreat, but the overall design hews to competent execution rather than bold risk.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marcus's profession (elevator repair technician) and ability (seeing ghosts) drive the story. He's called to assess the freight elevator, the ghost appears immediately and guides him, he follows her gesture and climbs to investigate. His trained eye (dust patterns) enables the discovery. The ghost's presence shapes his tactics and the closure vow. Setup: first paragraph. Development: ghost agitation → discovery. Payoff: promise to reunite mainspring. Early signal +0.6, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.2, closure linkage +1.4, specificity +0.6. No late penalty. Total strong positives ~5.2 over baseline 3.0.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The mainspring barrel is discovered mid-story, handled across multiple beats (lifting it down, unwrapping, examining, reading inscription, rewrapping, tucking under arm), and its meaning evolves—from hidden object to carousel heart to burden Marcus accepts. It drives the closure vow and charges the final image. Setup: second third. Development: examination beats. Payoff: central to ending. Early signal moderate −0.3, three beats +1.4, causal pressure +1.4, closure linkage +1.6, irreplaceability +0.7. Total strong positives ~5.1 over baseline 3.0.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Cracks in the façade" appears in Marcus's reflection ("cracks in the façade of normalcy that revealed deeper truths") and the final paragraph summary ("Some cracks in the façade needed exploring"). It names the thematic question but does not constrain on-page choice—Marcus would investigate the ceiling regardless. Setup: first third reflection. Development: thematic echo. Payoff: final summary. Early signal +0.5, lyric reprise +0.4, thematic coherence +0.3. Swappability −0.5 (could say "hidden layers" without loss). Total modest positives ~0.7 over baseline 3.0.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Skillfully observant" manifests in Marcus's trained eye analyzing dust accumulation patterns, noticing disturbance along the tile edge, and inferring the box's location. This observation enables the discovery and drives the plot. The trait is shown through action, not label. Setup: early reflection on his skill. Development: dust analysis beat. Payoff: enables discovery that leads to closure vow. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.1, closure linkage indirect +0.5, specificity +0.5. Total strong positives ~3.6 over baseline 3.0.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Marcus "engages" with the ghost as naturally as any client, speaking aloud to her, promising to find the carousel. This action frames his relationship with the supernatural and drives his final vow. However, "engage" is broad—he also engages with the box, the discovery process. The dialogue beats are key but could be reframed as "promise" or "acknowledge." Setup: first ghost encounter. Development: dialogue. Payoff: final promise. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, causal pressure moderate +0.7, closure linkage +1.0. Swappability −0.6 (near-synonym "interact" would fit). Total ~2.6 over baseline 3.0.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Analyzing dust accumulation patterns" is Marcus's particular skill, signaled early ("his particular skill, honed through years of analyzing ventilation systems and elevator shafts") and used in the key discovery beat: "the dust lay thick and undisturbed, but there, along one tile's edge, the gray film showed disturbance." This method enables the mainspring's discovery and drives the closure. Setup: early reflection. Development: dust analysis enables find. Payoff: discovery leads to vow. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.3, closure linkage +1.2, specificity +0.7. Total strong positives ~4.8 over baseline 3.0.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The abandoned circus ticket office provides the ceiling/tile space Marcus investigates, the rickety chair he climbs, and the context for the mainspring's hiding. The warped counter and curling posters establish abandonment. The setting constrains his tactics (must climb, press gently) and supplies the ghost's locale. Setup: second paragraph. Development: spatial choreography. Payoff: bookends with elevator mention. Early signal +0.6, two beats +0.9, micro-setting +0.8, closure linkage moderate +0.6. Total ~2.9 over baseline 3.0.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>The fluorescent lights dying opens the story and provides the "sudden quiet" Marcus is grateful for. The timeframe ("flickering for three days before they finally died") anchors the moment but does not tighten decisions—Marcus could investigate at any point. Time is not tracked as a live clock; the ghost's agitation provides urgency, not elapsed minutes. Setup: opening line. Development: static. Payoff: none. Early signal +0.6, one beat +0.4, no causal pressure, no closure linkage. Swappability −0.5 (any prompt could trigger investigation). Total ~0.5 over baseline 3.0, capped at 4.6 for missing development and payoff gates.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Marcus's motivation "to discover what ceilings hide" is dramatized in his daughter's question, his choice to follow the ghost's gesture before assessing the elevator, and his final vow. The desire is conflicted—he delays his professional task—and the cost is his new obligation. Setup: early reflection. Development: choice to climb. Payoff: vow to reunite. Early signal +0.7, two beats +0.9, causal pressure +1.0, closure linkage +1.2, cost connection +0.5. Total strong positives ~4.3 over baseline 3.0.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>"Weightless burden" recurs: the fluorescent "soft electric sigh," Marcus "feeling the weightless burden of carrying someone else's hidden history," and the final summary "some burdens, however weightless they seemed, still needed carrying." The tone is elegiac, quiet, purposeful—modulating from professional detachment to acceptance. It charges the final image (Marcus tucking the box, ready to assess). Setup: opening sigh. Development: explicit phrase mid-story. Payoff: final restatement reweights. Early signal +0.7, three beats +1.4, cadence shift +1.0, closure linkage +1.6, charged reprise +0.8. Total strong positives ~5.5 over baseline 3.0.</comment>
