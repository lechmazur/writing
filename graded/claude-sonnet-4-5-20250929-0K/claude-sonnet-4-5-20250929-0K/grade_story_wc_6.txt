<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maya's interior is anchored in embodied detail ("old shame rising and settling like the clouds overhead"), and her profession directly informs her perceptual priorities. However, her core motivation—proving that scars can sing—is declared rather than tested by competing impulses in scene; she moves through the lagoon sequence without visible internal contradiction or cost. Elena's transformation from rigid to softened reads too smoothly, lacking the friction that would make the grafting metaphor credible. The final choice (smiling acknowledgment) feels granted rather than earned by prior struggle.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Orientation is clear by ~90 words (Maya at the obsidian lagoon with her satchel and Elena). The piece follows an Accumulative/Textural lens: layered metaphors (obsidian, grafting, the drilled coin) accumulate toward the final image of black sand as "small scars...each one singing." However, the closure unit—Elena's realization and smile—lacks visible cost; the transformation is asserted ("understanding grafted itself onto grief") rather than paid for by a forfeited path or painful acknowledgment. The radio crackle offers a gesture toward stakes but doesn't force a trade-off. Closure reads as Resonant Reconfiguration by cadence shift, but the cost remains felt rather than legible on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (cool dark water, black sand drifting "like reverse stars") and the volcanic setting charges the metaphor network. The lagoon functions as more than backdrop: wading into it enacts the metaphor of suspension and survival. However, spatial choreography at the water's edge and the transition from shore to waist-deep could be sharper; we lose track of Elena's body for a beat. The setting constrains no choice—Maya and Elena move freely—so it stops short of the 9-band gate.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The dominant stake—helping Elena accept her scars—is signaled early and pursued throughout. The sequence offers one meaningful deepening (Elena's move from rigid downcast posture to wading into the water), and the layered metaphors (grafting, obsidian, the drilled coin) accumulate textural pressure. However, escalation under the Accumulative lens requires a tightening that narrows options or raises cost; here, each step (story, coin, sand ritual) adds texture without friction. Elena's final smile arrives without visible forfeit or resistance overcome on the page, so the cost remains implied rather than legible.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The theme of transformation through woundedness emerges organically from concrete particulars (grafted trees, obsidian's violent formation, the drilled coin). The metaphor network is dense and purposeful, avoiding platitude. The final image—black sand as singing scars—offers a resonant answer to "can scars be beautiful?" without stating a moral. However, the line "those scars are threads connecting our past to our future—proof we survived" edges toward thematic echo, and the phrase "unyielding compassion that mystified her colleagues" reads as authorial framing rather than dramatized evidence. The piece invites reflection but occasionally tells its theme rather than trusting the image to carry it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>POV remains stable in tight third over Maya; psychic distance is controlled. The prose carries a distinct lyric register ("kelp-drift peace," "reverse stars") that feels voice-motivated rather than imposed. Dialogue is minimal but functional, carrying subtext in Elena's whispered question and Maya's reply. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated abstraction inconsistent with Maya's firefighter pragmatism: "grafted onto my soul," "kelp-drift peace," "unyielding compassion" read more authorial than character-particular. Under peak emotional pressure (Elena's tears, the final moment), the voice maintains its lyric cadence without modulating toward urgency, which flattens the turn.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully and figurative language is dense without collapsing into muddle. Information density is high in the opening exposition (fifteen years of arson, decade of firefighting) compressed efficiently. However, several beats loop thematically without advancing pressure: the grafting metaphor is explained three times (grandmother's trees, the coin's origin, "wounds grafted into wholeness"), and "scars can sing" appears as premise, dialogue, and closing image without meaningful reweighting. The phrase "gracefully alert" is repeated verbatim in two paragraphs. Minor template cadence in the coin-reveal beat: "She opened...Inside lay...She had found..." Propulsion slows in the middle third as metaphor accumulates faster than scene pressure.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The synthesis of arsonist's daughter turned firefighter + volcanic lagoon + wound-as-song is specific and non-obvious. The drilled coin as inherited talisman carries genuine particularity. However, the emotional arc (scarred woman learns to accept her scars through ritual at a symbolic site) follows a familiar template, and the story does not transform it through unexpected friction or moral calculus. The final realization arrives smoothly rather than through resistance, which diminishes risk. The piece commits fully to its metaphor network but plays it safe in execution, avoiding the bold choices that would elevate synthesis into necessity.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Maya's identity as the arsonist's daughter firefighter frames the story and motivates her drive to prove scars can sing. She makes the key choice to bring Elena to the lagoon and orchestrates the ritual. However, her decisions within the scene (offering stories, handing over the coin, guiding the sand ritual) face no resistance or cost; she executes a plan rather than adapting under pressure. The radio crackle at the end gestures toward a firefighter's competing obligation but Maya dismisses it without consequence. Present in setup, middle action, and closure image, but causal pressure is moderate.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Black sand appears in three beats: Maya pours it through her fingers while explaining obsidian's formation, later pours it into Elena's palms, and returns as metaphor in the closing image ("each grain a small scar"). The sand enacts the metaphor of suspension and survival when Elena releases it into the water. However, it does not constrain a choice or create cost; it serves the ritual without friction. Early signal, beat involvement (×3), closure linkage, but lacks causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>Unyielding compassion is named early ("unyielding compassion that mystified her colleagues") and illustrated through Maya's patient ritual guidance. However, it functions as theme label rather than stake-shaping force. The story does not test Maya's compassion against a competing need or show a moment where compassion costs her something tangible. Present as character trait and thematic frame, but does not constrain options or generate friction on the page.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>"Gracefully alert" appears twice as direct description (once for Maya at the lagoon's edge, once when Elena closes her eyes "gracefully alert to her own transformed skin"). The first use ties to Maya's firefighter training and perceptual habits, enabling her to guide Elena safely. The second use transfers the trait to Elena at the moment of transformation, charging the closure image. However, the attribute does not constrain a choice or create visible cost; it colors perception without friction. Early signal and closure participation, but causal pressure is minimal.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Grafting appears in four distinct beats: grandmother's fruit trees as opening metaphor, Maya's explanation of wounds grafted into wholeness, the moment "understanding grafted itself onto grief" at Elena's turn, and implicit in the closing image of scars singing together. The metaphor structures the entire arc and defines the transformation Elena undergoes. The concept is signaled early, developed through layered examples, and charges the closure. However, grafting is metaphorical rather than a literal action on the page, so its causal force is conceptual. Strong beat involvement, closure linkage, and specificity; one notch below indispensable because the action remains figural.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The drilled coin appears in beat two (Maya withdraws it from her satchel, explains its origin and the grandmother's lesson about letting pain pass through), then in beat four (she places it around Elena's neck). The coin enacts the story's central metaphor (drilling through pain to string it into something wearable) and becomes the gift that marks Elena's transformation. Present in setup and closure participation (Elena touches it in the final beat), with high specificity (Korean, worn smooth, red thread) that makes it irreplaceable. However, the coin does not constrain a choice or create cost; Elena accepts it without hesitation. Causal pressure moderate; closure linkage strong.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The obsidian lagoon is introduced in the opening line, anchors every beat (path descent, water's edge conversation, wading waist-deep, sand ritual), and the volcanic glass metaphor charges the entire transformation. The setting is not mere backdrop: the act of wading into the lagoon enacts the metaphor of immersion and survival, and the black sand's suspension in water becomes the ritual's centerpiece. Early signal, continuous presence, closure participation. However, the lagoon does not constrain a choice—Maya and Elena move freely—and no environmental feature alters tactics under pressure. Strong thematic integration and closure charge, but lacks the causal pressure that would push it into the 8+ band.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>3.2</grade><comment>The migration of clouds is mentioned three times: opening scene-setting ("that brief season when weather systems moved inland"), a middle image ("clouds migrated inland, their shadows moving across the dunes"), and near the end ("as the clouds continued their migration"). The timeframe establishes atmosphere and supplies the recurring image of movement and change, but it does not tighten decisions, create urgency, or track elapsed time. The radio crackle gestures toward external clock pressure but is dismissed. Present in setup and closure paragraph, but lacks causal development or cost.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>Maya's desire to prove that scars can sing is declared in paragraph four and drives her entire mission: bringing Elena to the lagoon, offering the grafting metaphor, performing the sand ritual. The motivation is coherent and consistent. However, it is told rather than tested by competing wants or visible cost. Maya never doubts, never sacrifices an alternate path, never risks failure; she executes her compassionate plan without friction. The story illustrates the motivation but does not dramatize a moment where proving this claim costs Maya something on the page. Early signal, continuous presence, closure participation, but friction between wants and costs is minimal.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Kelp-drift peace" appears twice (once as "the kelp-drift peace of this place" when Elena arrives rigid, again when "her breathing deepened into the kelp-drift peace of this volcanic place" at her transformation). The phrase establishes a tonal signature and marks Elena's emotional shift. The tone is coherent and modulates subtly as Elena moves from resistance to acceptance. However, the tone remains largely static—calm, lyric, meditative—without sharpening under pressure or tensioning against the stakes. The final image sustains the established register rather than charging it with new urgency. Early signal, closure participation, coherent modulation, but does not escalate or reweight pressure.</comment>
