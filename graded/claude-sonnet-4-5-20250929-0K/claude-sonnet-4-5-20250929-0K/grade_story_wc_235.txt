<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Maren's interior contradiction—her professional skill at ordering others' chaos versus her inability to stabilize her own timeline—generates credible pressure. The jealousy of past selves is embodied through scrolls and recursive memory loops, though the emotional specificity occasionally drifts into diagnostic label-speak ("chronologically confused," "feral nostalgia" as named concepts rather than dramatized states). Her endurance and continued scroll-keeping reflect earned stasis, foreclosing hope of cure with visible cost. The phrase "chronologically confused—it sounded less clinical, more like a personality quirk than a curse" reads as self-aware hedging that slightly undercuts raw interiority.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Drive lens: Accumulative/Textural. The piece teaches a pattern of temporal recursion early (diagnosis, gravesite, scroll entries) and accumulates pressure through layered memory fragments that converge on the final scroll-keeping act. Orientation anchors (mountain cabin, profession, syndrome) arrive within the first 150 words. Closure lands as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Maren continues writing despite her grave discovery, accepting that "memory was just another story" with the cost visible in "outlast her confusion." One meaningful deepening occurs when she recognizes feral nostalgia as savage rather than sweet, reweighting her relationship to her past. The cost—living with foreknowledge of death and perpetual disorientation—is felt on the page.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The mountain cabin, birch bark scroll, and recurring objects (cedar box, deer sinew) constrain her choices: she isolates to manage temporal displacement, uses YouTube from the future to make ink, and the scroll's physical durability matters ("outlast her confusion"). The canyon where ashes were scattered charges the final dream image. Sensory hierarchy reflects her priorities (ink-making detail, owl call, rough-hewn table texture). However, the cabin itself remains somewhat generic—"mountain ranger cabin" and "pine forests" could anchor anywhere in temperate highlands without dialect or occupational specificity shaping a tactical choice.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake: Can Maren impose narrative order on her own fractured timeline, as she does for clients? One meaningful deepening occurs when she names "feral nostalgia" and recognizes she's jealous of, not merely missing, her past self—narrowing her emotional options from nostalgia to predatory envy. The scroll-keeping becomes endurance with cost: she writes knowing the grave awaits, foreclosing hope of escape. Agency is renunciation—she continues despite futility. The final image reweights the stake: "stories could be rewritten until the ink ran dry" charges her persistence with both defiance and exhaustion. No explicit antagonist; pressure accumulates through internal recursion and the inescapable gravesite fact.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>Theme emerges through concrete particulars: birch bark scrolls as durable counter to memory's fragility, the irony of her profession (distilling others' chaos while living in temporal soup), and the gravesite epigraph "She made sense of the senseless" functioning as both epitaph and job description. The final image—"stories could be rewritten until the ink ran dry"—offers a non-literal answer to whether memory can be mastered, accepting narrative control as provisional without moralizing. "Feral nostalgia" risks thematic echo but is dramatized through jealousy of past selves and recursive dream-watching. The phrase "jaded wonder" is named once but embodied in "exhausted amazement at reality's persistence in surprising her."</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable with close psychic distance; narrative certainty matches Maren's compromised temporal access. Perceptual signature is character-specific: she notices ink-making detail, dream chronology, and scroll materiality. Diction stays consistent ("time was soup," "pack of strangers wearing her face") with occasional register drift into abstraction ("chronologically confused" reads more clinical than lived). No dialogue appears, so those bullets do not apply. The opening elision (diagnosis details withheld briefly) is purposeful and paid off within 200 words. Rhythmic control holds under reflective pressure, though some sentences default to balanced clause structure ("She'd seen her grave and kept living. She'd forgotten her mother's face and remembered it").</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Information density is high; most lines advance character or thematic recursion. However, paraphrase loops appear: "chronologically confused" is explained immediately after naming, and "time was soup now, everything floating, nothing solid" restates the prior metaphor without added pressure. Template cadence emerges in the dream catalog: "Dreams where she could soar…Dreams where she attended…Dreams where she lived backward" across three consecutive beats. Stock metaphor: "edges curling like dried leaves" in the opening. The figurative language is controlled but occasionally stacks without pattern-teaching (birch bark ink, deer sinew, cedar box appear in quick succession as symbols of durability). No filter-verb stacks or severe artifacts touch the closure beat, keeping the final image clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The synthesis of temporal displacement syndrome with the lucid-dream-chronicler profession offers thematic irony, but the premise closely follows the "protagonist with condition becomes expert in that condition's inverse" template common in contemporary literary fiction. The gravesite discovery with matching epitaph is a well-worn speculative device. Transformation occurs through specific detail—birch bark scrolls, YouTube videos from the future, the thirty-seventh page—that grounds the familiar frame. "Feral nostalgia" as a named concept adds a fresh inflection, and the jealousy-of-past-selves angle personalizes recursive time-loop tropes. Risk-taking in the mosaic dream structure and non-linear memory presentation heightens stakes without obscuring clarity, earning modest bonus consideration within band.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>The lucid dream chronicler role frames her profession and ironic competence, appears in the middle beat (distilling clients' chaos), and shapes the ending stake (can she distill her own?). However, her on-page chronicler work is summary-only; we never see her transcribe a client's dream or make a professional choice under pressure. The role enables thematic contrast but does not drive a key turn. Present in closure participation obliquely (she continues her own transcription), but the job itself could be swapped for "therapist" or "editor" without breaking story logic.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The birch bark scroll appears in the opening line, is handled in the middle beat (she adds the thirty-seventh page), and returns in the final beat (rolled, tied, placed in the cedar box). Its durability matters: "would outlast her confusion" charges the ending. Ink-making process (bark and bittersweet berries from future YouTube) adds specificity. However, the scroll's constraint on her choices is modest—it documents rather than alters tactics. Its reweighted meaning at closure (survival beyond memory's fragility) earns it solid integration, though it remains more symbolic anchor than causal lever.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>"Feral nostalgia" is named explicitly in the middle beat and dramatized as jealousy of past selves rather than sweet longing. It shapes her emotional stance but does not narrow on-page options or alter a tactical choice. The concept appears in reflection rather than driving a decision. Present early enough (around 40% mark) and thematically coherent, but it reads more as theme label than causal force. Removing it would soften the emotional texture but leave the scroll-keeping and grave-acceptance arc intact.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Chronologically confused" is introduced early as her preferred reframe of the diagnosis. It constrains her life (she isolates in the cabin, keeps scrolls to compensate) but the trait itself is label-only on the page—we see temporal displacement effects (forgetting kisses, reliving breakups in random order) rather than the attribute enabling or blocking a specific choice. The cost is visible (social isolation, career pivot) but the trait functions as premise rather than active lever. Mid-integration: functional, but the story could name the syndrome differently without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Soar" appears in three dream beats: looking down at her younger self, watching herself at multiple ages over the canyon, and the final image ("Tonight she'd sleep and soar"). It charges the ending and recurs with reweighted meaning (from warning-giver to observer of all her selves). However, soaring is dream-only; it does not constrain waking choices or create a tactical trade-off. The action shapes thematic resonance but remains swappable with other dream-movement verbs (fly, drift, float) without breaking causality. Lyric reprise earns it modest credit.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Jealousy of past selves is signaled in the middle beat ("feral nostalgia…she was jealous of her") and dramatized through dream sequences where she watches "that Maren" on the trail. The method shapes her emotional progression from longing to envy but does not alter a waking action or choice. She continues scroll-keeping regardless of this recognition. Present in two beats (named jealousy, dream-watching) and participates in thematic closure ("envied them and pitied them equally"), but the mechanics of jealousy do not constrain her options—she could grieve or rage with similar effect.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>The mountain ranger cabin is named early and functions as refuge after the gravesite discovery. It isolates her, enabling scroll-keeping without interruption, but the cabin's specific properties (rough-hewn table, owl call outside, cedar box storage) are descriptive rather than tactical. She could chronicle from any isolated dwelling. The cabin does not supply a resource that alters outcome or pressure a choice through proximity or access. Mid-low integration: present and coherent but replaceable with "remote cottage" or "forest lookout" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>The gravesite discovery with her name and death date two years hence appears early, motivates her retreat to the cabin, and implicitly frames the ending's stakes (she writes knowing the grave awaits). The timeframe tightens her sense of futility and charges the final line ("until the ink ran dry"). However, the two-year countdown does not alter on-page tactics—she does not race against it or change behavior as it approaches. The grave functions as premise and thematic anchor more than live clock. Causal setup and closure linkage earn solid credit, but the time pressure is conceptual rather than dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>"To distill chaos into narrative" is her professional motivation, named early and dramatized through her job (clients pay to understand dreams). The desire is conflicted: she succeeds for others but fails for herself ("she who could barely keep her own timeline straight"). It shapes the dominant stake and appears in closure ("make sense of their senseless"). However, the friction between desire and cost is told more than shown—we do not see her attempt and fail to distill her own chaos in a specific on-page choice. The irony is thematic rather than tactical. Mid-integration: coherent and present in closure, but the want does not drive a key turn.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.0</grade><comment>"Jaded wonder" is named once in the middle beat ("exhausted amazement at reality's persistence in surprising her") and embodied throughout: she's seen her grave yet keeps living, knows memory is fiction yet keeps writing. Tone modulates with content—clinical detachment in the diagnosis paragraph, lyric repetition in the dream catalog, weary acceptance at closure. The final image charges tone with both defiance and resignation ("stories could be rewritten until the ink ran dry"). Coherent across turns and integral to the ending's emotional weight. Minor slip: "jaded wonder" as explicit label risks theme-stating, though the surrounding texture earns it back.</comment>
