<comment>Mira's interiority carries consistent specificity through her architectural philosophy and emotional relationship to extinction. The backstory on her thesis rejection and invented term "esoteric realist" efficiently establishes motivation. The "knot in her chest" easing at the end reads as genuine progression under pressure, though the final benediction moment risks sentiment. Internal contradiction is present but muted—her commitment to impermanence is unwavering rather than tested by a competing impulse.</comment>

<comment>Orientation anchors who/where/when cleanly by the first paragraph. The piece operates under an Accumulative/Textural lens: density builds through layered imagery (moth wing, monarchs, bamboo tower, the grotto itself) and converges in a Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant) where Mira's commitment to temporary witness crystallizes with visible emotional cost ("the knot in her chest eased slightly"). The closure image—touching the moth wing as benediction—reweights prior material and forecloses permanent monumentalizing with felt acceptance. Cost is legible on the page through the easing knot and the explicit trade-off between permanence and witness.</comment>

<grade>7.6</grade>
<comment>The grotto's impossible altitude and verdant specificity (moss, ferns, spring "from nowhere") constrain the entire action and charge the premise with wonder. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through Mira's architectural attention: bamboo joints, hemp rope, silk dissolution, "blushing stillness" at sunset. The moth wing in glass and the monarchs clustering on her tower create tactile, purpose-driven anchors. The grotto's transient legend (appearing/vanishing across decades) mirrors and supports the thematic commitment to impermanence, satisfying the 9+ gate by directly charging the final image.</comment>

<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>The dominant stake—honoring the last monarch migration through temporary witness—is signaled early and remains coherent. One meaningful tightening occurs when the monarchs arrive and cluster on her structure, validating her architectural philosophy in real time. The final image (touching the moth wing) forecloses the option of permanent monuments with visible emotional cost (knot easing). Under the Accumulative/Textural lens, this deepening is sufficient, though protagonist agency is more passive observation than active choice. No reversal or antagonistic pressure tests her commitment; the monarchs simply arrive and she crystallizes her stance.</comment>

<comment>Theme emerges organically through the tension between memory and forgetting, permanence and dissolution. The "interrupted cadence" concept (musical progression breaking expectation) is integrated as both metaphor and structural principle. The moth wing as foundation for the tower, the luna moth extinction in grandmother's time, and the final benediction create purposeful resonance without overt moralizing. The ending offers a non-literal answer—temporary structures as witness—that reweights the premise without stating a thesis. Slight penalty for one moment of thematic echo: "this was enough" risks summarizing rather than letting the image carry the weight alone.</comment>

<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Single-POV distance is stable; perceptual signature filters setting through architectural and ecological awareness ("hemp rope binding green wood," "dust-fine scales," "its orange wings catching light that seemed to blush"). Diction is elevated but consistent with an artist-narrator reflecting on extinction and impermanence. One register slip: "esoteric realist" and "Architectures of Impermanent Meaning" read slightly convenient as self-labels rather than earned through dramatized work. The phrase "blushing stillness" recurs as a tonal anchor but risks preciousness. No dialogue present; internal voice remains coherent under emotional pressure.</comment>

<comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; opening and closing images bookend with care. Information density is high in the grotto description and migration backstory. However, several lines loop conceptually: "temporary structures could carry weight that stone never would" is restated in "acknowledged an ending without pretending permanence" and again in "temporary hymns." The phrase "blushing stillness" appears twice without changed meaning. Template stems recur: "She [verb]" and "The [noun] [verb]" dominate sentence openings in the middle third. Figurative language is dense but mostly coherent; "question mark" for the tower and "living petals" for butterflies are apt. Mild overwriting in "the violence of permanent erasure or permanent enshrinement" where simpler phrasing would serve. No major artifacts touch closure, limiting deduction under the Non-closure Accumulation Cap.</comment>

<question>8</question>
<grade>6.4</grade>
<comment>The premise—artist building ephemeral monuments to overlooked extinctions in an impossible sky garden—synthesizes fresh elements (altitude, impermanence, architectural witness) into a coherent vision. The moth wing as relic and the last-generation monarchs avoid cliché through specificity. However, the core emotional arc (sensitive artist validates her rejected philosophy through natural beauty) follows a familiar template. The grotto's impossibility is asserted but not explored for causal implications or constraints. Risk-taking is present in the lyric accumulation and quiet closure, but the resolution feels preordained rather than earned through friction. Transformation test: the arc would function similarly with different endangered species and different art form, suggesting the synthesis remains mid-original.</comment>

<question>9 A</question>
<grade>5.2</grade>
<comment>Mira adjusts joints, builds the tower, sits in stillness, and touches the moth wing—all present across beats. However, these are preparatory and observational acts; her choices do not create turns. The monarchs arrive independent of her agency. She crystallizes an existing stance rather than deciding under conflicting pressure. Present in setup, middle work, and closure image, but constrained action rather than causal driver. Functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 B</question>
<grade>6.8</grade>
<comment>The moth wing appears in the opening (pressed between glass at the structure's base), is explained mid-story (Actias luna, extinct in grandmother's time), and returns in the final line as benediction object. It charges the closure image by linking personal memory to the present migration. However, it is not handled or used dynamically in multiple beats—only described and touched once. Lyric reprise with thematic reweighting, eligible for mid-6s under the allowance, but lacks causal pressure or evolving function.</comment>

<question>9 C</question>
<grade>5.8</grade>
<comment>"Interrupted cadence" is defined explicitly ("the musical term for a progression that breaks expectation, that suspends resolution") and applied to the structures' purpose. It shapes the thematic stakes by framing impermanence as intentional suspension between memory and forgetting. However, it does not alter on-page tactics or force a choice under pressure—it remains a conceptual frame rather than a mechanical constraint. Present in setup and closure participation (the structures embody it), but no middle development where it narrows options. Two gates met; strong thematic integration but limited causal role.</comment>

<question>9 D</question>
<grade>4.6</grade>
<comment>The grotto is described as "transiently rooted" in paragraph three, with moss, ferns, and a spring that "defied the altitude." Local legend says it "appeared and vanished across decades." This attribute enriches setting atmosphere and mirrors the theme of impermanence, but it does not constrain Mira's choices or enable a specific action with cost. It remains descriptive rather than mechanically active. Present in setup only; no middle development or closure participation. Cap at 4.6 for missing setup gate (introduced after opening).</comment>

<question>9 E</question>
<grade>7.3</grade>
<comment>Mira adjusts joints in the tower using "hemp rope binding green wood in an intricate knot" in paragraph three; the knot is specified as holding "for exactly one season." The knotting action is central to her architectural method and directly tied to the theme of temporary witness. Monarchs land on the knotted bamboo, validating the structure's function. The "knot in her chest" easing at the end creates a charged echo. Present in setup, middle (monarchs use it), and closure (emotional/thematic payoff). Strong causal and symbolic integration; removing knotting would require rework of the method and emotional resolution.</comment>

<question>9 F</question>
<grade>7.1</grade>
<comment>Signaled in paragraph one ("spiraling tower of bamboo and silk") and paragraph two (thesis on "Architectures of Impermanent Meaning"). Mira adjusts joints and binds rope in paragraph three; the method's mechanics—temporary materials, seasonal decay—are made explicit. The monarchs arrive and cluster on her structure, proving its function as signal/rest-stop. The method shapes the ending's meaning: "the tower did what monuments could not." Present in setup, development (building and monarchs' use), and closure (conceptual payoff). Essential to stakes and closure resonance.</comment>

<question>9 G</question>
<grade>6.7</grade>
<comment>The grotto is anchored immediately ("existed where it should not have, a pocket of verdant impossibility suspended three thousand feet above the cloud layer") and described with specific ecology (moss, ferns, spring). It provides the impossible site that justifies the story's premise and attracts the monarchs. However, it does not pressure a choice or supply a resource that alters Mira's tactics—she builds as planned. The setting is vivid and thematically resonant (transience, altitude defying logic) but functions more as stage than constraint. Present in setup and throughout, with thematic charge at closure, but lacks mechanical intervention in a choice.</comment>

<question>9 H</question>
<grade>6.9</grade>
<comment>"During the first reports of the monarch migration's final year" anchors time in paragraph two. "This would be the last generation to make the journey" frames urgency and motivates Mira's entire project. The monarchs arrive "at sunset" and "within an hour, thirty monarchs had gathered," establishing a live clock for the witness event. Time tightens emotional stakes (last chance to honor this migration) and shapes the ending's poignancy. However, no moment where the timeframe forces a tactical pivot or forecloses an option mid-scene. Present in setup, implied throughout, and essential to closure's weight, but not a mechanical constraint that alters decisions.</comment>

<question>9 I</question>
<grade>7.4</grade>
<comment>Mira's desire "to honor the forgotten migrations, the overlooked histories that left no pyramids or palaces" is stated in paragraph four and demonstrated through her architectural practice. The thesis rejection and the "knot in her chest" embody the friction between her want (recognition, validation) and her commitment (ephemeral witness). The monarchs' arrival and her final benediction dramatize the motivation's fulfillment with visible emotional cost (knot easing, acceptance of obscurity). Friction between permanent recognition and temporary witness drives the piece. Present in setup, shapes middle beats (building the tower), and resolves in closure. High integration with felt cost.</comment>

<question>9 J</question>
<grade>7.2</grade>
<comment>"Blushing stillness" appears twice: once describing the sunset moment when monarchs arrive ("she sat in the blushing stillness as darkness gathered") and again in the penultimate paragraph ("this blushing stillness, this interrupted cadence"). The tone—reverent, elegiac, suffused with quiet beauty—is coherent through rising emotion and modulates subtly as Mira moves from solitary work to shared presence with the butterflies. It charges the final image by sustaining the atmosphere of gentle closure. However, tone remains relatively static (no sharp shifts under pressure) and the phrase's repetition risks becoming label rather than lived effect. Present throughout and integral to closure's resonance, but not dynamically modulated.</comment>
