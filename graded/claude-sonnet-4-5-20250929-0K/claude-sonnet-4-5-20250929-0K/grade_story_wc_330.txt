<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The carpenter's interior landscape is established through concrete action—holding brass, singing wordlessly, testing the crown—and his motivation to see possibility in silence is dramatized through persistent rebuilding choices. However, interiority remains somewhat abstract ("space where meaning could grow like plants from cracks") without embodied contradiction or stakes that force a visible cost. The character endures and persists but never faces a choice that forecloses a path; his work proceeds smoothly without genuine struggle or mistake. The final touch of the halo fragment repeats the opening gesture without demonstrable change in his stance or options.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads as Accumulative/Textural: the piece layers sensory detail and reflection toward a final image of "quiet, persistent translation of ruin into revelation." Orientation anchors (abandoned train, carousel car, morning light) arrive early and remain stable. However, closure lacks a decisive reweighting or visible cost; the carpenter's state at the end mirrors his state at the beginning—he continues building, surrounded by the same grace and possibility. The final paragraph summarizes theme ("brokenness could sing, abandoned things were simply waiting") rather than landing a charged image that reconfigures prior material. Cost-proof test fails: no on-page sentence shows a forfeited path, a trade-off, or a felt price at closure.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The train setting is vivid and purposeful: broken carousel horses, salvaged bearings, wind bells, and the brass fragment all supply concrete resources that the carpenter uses to construct the crown. Spatial choreography is clean (interior car, center column, hanging elements), and sensory detail (misting hush, chiming bells, light patterns) is filtered through the carpenter's attention. The halo fragment constrains the design choice (it "fit perfectly where he'd left a gap"), meeting the 9+ gate criterion, but the setting otherwise provides material without forcing difficult trade-offs or altering the outcome. The oasis and cottonwood grove anchor the scene but remain descriptive rather than pressuring choices.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>The dominant stake—transforming broken carousel remnants into a sculpture that spins in wind—is signaled early and pursued consistently. However, escalation is minimal: the carpenter finds the brass fragment, solders it into place, tests the crown, and plans next steps without meaningful opposition, reversal, or cost. The experimental push succeeds immediately ("It rotated smoothly"), and no choice narrows options or risks failure. Pressure remains static rather than tightening under the Accumulative lens; the final act continues the same work rather than reweighting it. Agency is present (he chooses to incorporate the fragment) but the choice carries no visible trade-off or foreclosed path.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme—silence as possibility, brokenness as song—emerges from the carpenter's work and the train's remnants rather than direct statement. The halo fragment and wind bells function as recurring images that accumulate meaning across the piece. However, the final paragraph resorts to explicit thematic summary ("they would understand what he'd known all along: that silence wasn't empty, that brokenness could sing") rather than trusting a resonant image to carry the weight. The piece avoids moralizing but substitutes thematic echo (prompt language like "misting hush," "quiet, persistent") for earned insight. The ending asserts rather than dramatizes transformation, and the non-literal answer to the central question is diluted by over-articulation.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>POV is stable third-person limited, anchored in the carpenter's perception throughout. Voice carries a consistent lyric texture ("voices marking time in a way clocks never could," "whispering quality," "blessing") that fits the contemplative mood. Psychic distance is controlled, and no head-hopping occurs. However, diction occasionally drifts into elevated register that feels external ("translation of ruin into revelation") rather than embodied in the carpenter's working mind. The perceptual signature is present (he notices curves, joints, spirals, light) but lacks idiosyncratic bias or edge. No dialogue appears, so those bullets are waived. Purposeful compression in the lyric mode is legible and taught early, meeting the experimental tolerance.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clear and rhythmically varied, with sensory specificity ("spirals that caught light like water," "patterns of light that danced across the car's interior"). However, several passages loop thematically without advancing pressure: "silence here meant something different than emptiness" is restated multiple times, and the final paragraph recaps insights already shown. Filter verbs ("felt its vibration," "felt immediately") cluster in places but remain voice-motivated. Stock metaphors appear ("surrounded him like grace," "gleamed with reflected light") without fresh inflection. Opening and closing lines are serviceable but the closing leans on summary rather than a charged image. Information density is uneven; transit and reflection occupy more space than causal action.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The abandoned circus train and silent carpenter working with salvaged carousel parts offer a specific, visually grounded premise. The wrong-turn discovery and wind-bell timeframe add texture. However, the core emotional arc—solitary artisan finding redemptive purpose in repair—follows a familiar template without fresh inflection in stakes or moral calculus. The halo fragment is a graceful detail but its integration (it fits perfectly, sings immediately) avoids friction. The piece commits fully to its contemplative register but does not take structural or perspectival risks; choices trend toward the median and safe. Transformation test: the emotional truth could transfer to other craftsperson scenarios (potter, weaver) with minor edits, suggesting the synthesis is more polished than original.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Character present early (first paragraph), drives middle beats (finding, holding, soldering the fragment, testing the crown), and appears in the ending (touching the fragment, reaching for next piece). However, the carpenter's choices do not create reversals or force visible trade-offs; he proceeds smoothly without opposition. The "never spoke" trait is mentioned but not tested; silence does not constrain a key decision. Two gates (setup, payoff) are met; development is marginal (middle choices are additive, not pressured). Score neighborhood: functional but replaceable, as the arc could unfold with a different silent craftsperson.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Object introduced in paragraph 2, handled and observed multiple times (held to light, pressed to chest, soldered, touched at end), and participates in closure (final touch, "warmth"). It enables the crown's completion ("fit perfectly where he'd left a gap"), creating a causal turn. Setup, development, and payoff gates all met. However, the fragment's properties (spirals, singing note) are ornamental; its unique qualities do not force a difficult choice or visible cost. Elevated by beat involvement (≥3 touches) and closure linkage, but capped by swappability (another brass piece could serve with minor rewrites). Causal pressure is moderate: it completes the design but does not redefine stakes.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Concept ("misting hush") appears in opening paragraph ("misting hush of desert mornings") and returns in final paragraph ("The misting hush of morning surrounded him like grace"). However, it functions as atmospheric description rather than shaping stakes or constraining choices on the page. The carpenter's work is not altered by the hush; it provides mood, not pressure. Two gates (setup, payoff) met as a lyric reprise, but development is absent. Score: functional presence without causal work, ornamental rather than tactical.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>Attribute ("quietly persistent") is embodied in repeated actions: coming each dawn, weeks of construction, wordless singing, experimental testing, planning tomorrow's additions. Setup early (paragraph 1: "worked a carpenter who never spoke," paragraph 3: "by accident three years ago"), middle development (weeks rebuilding), and payoff (final line: "quiet, persistent translation"). However, the trait is never tested under pressure; no on-page moment forces a trade-off between persistence and another value. It describes behavior rather than constraining a choice with cost. Score: shapes one key turn (the long-term rebuilding project) but lacks friction or visible price.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Action ("sing") introduced in paragraph 6 ("He sang sometimes while he worked"), dramatized in paragraph 7 ("Today he sang to the fragment as he soldered it into place, a welcoming hymn"), and implied in the chiming crown (paragraph 8: "the whole construction began to chime"). Setup, development, and payoff gates met. Singing accompanies key work (soldering the fragment) and links thematically to the crown's music. However, the act is not pivotal; removing it would not break the story's logic or closure. The carpenter could complete the crown silently. The singing adds texture and thematic resonance but does not redefine options or force a cost. Score: shapes two beats and contributes to thematic charge, but swappable with other expressive acts.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>3.8</grade><comment>Method ("wrong turn leads to hidden oasis") is backstory, summarized in paragraph 3: "taking a wrong turn while searching for salvage wood...he'd discovered this hidden oasis." Setup present but late (paragraph 3 of 9). Development and payoff absent; the wrong turn is completed before the story's present action begins. It explains how the carpenter arrived but does not constrain present choices or participate in closure. The oasis provides setting but the discovery method itself is inert. Score: present and logically necessary as backstory, but functionally replaceable (he could have arrived via map, rumor, or deliberate search) and does not shape tactics or the final image.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Setting (abandoned circus train) introduced in opening line, supplies concrete resources throughout (carousel horses, platform panels, bearing from wheel assembly, broken windows), and frames the closure image (interior car, sculpture above). Setup, development, and payoff gates all met. The train's salvaged parts are causally essential: the crown is built from its remnants, and the bearing enables rotation. Removing the train would collapse the story's material logic. However, the train as location does not force a difficult choice or constrain the carpenter's freedom; it provides abundance rather than scarcity. Elevated by strong causal linkage (≥3 beats, closure participation, irreplaceability of salvaged parts) but lacks pressure or trade-off. Score: essential across beats and ending, high specificity, but no visible cost tied to the setting itself.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>5.1</grade><comment>Timeframe ("inside the chime of wind bells") established early (paragraph 1: "wind bells...began their delicate chiming, their voices marking time") and returns in paragraph 8 ("the whole construction began to chime...layered over the wind bells' song"). Setup and payoff gates met via lyric reprise. However, time is not tracked as a tightening constraint; the carpenter works at leisure without deadline or urgency. The bells mark duration atmospherically but do not alter tactics or force a choice. Development gate absent (no middle moment where the timeframe pressures a decision). Score: shapes the story's temporal texture and charges the final image through sonic layering, but does not function as a live clock that narrows options.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Motivation ("interpret silence as possibility") introduced in paragraph 5 ("He saw silence not as absence but as possibility") and dramatized through the rebuilding project ("Each piece of broken carousel he restored was an interpretation"). Setup, development (weeks of construction), and payoff (final paragraph: "silence wasn't empty...abandoned things were simply waiting") gates met. The desire drives the entire arc and explains the carpenter's choices. However, the motivation is declared more than conflicted; no on-page moment forces a trade-off between this vision and another want or cost. The carpenter's stance is stable from beginning to end without friction. Score: essential to the arc and present across beats, but lacks dramatized conflict or visible price; told more than tested under pressure.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Tone ("whispering gleam") established early through diction ("whispering quality," "gleamed," "faint," "delicate chiming") and sustained across the piece with consistent lyric register and sensory softness. Setup gate met. The tone modulates subtly as the crown nears completion (paragraph 8: "quietly persistent music") and charges the final image ("gleamed with reflected light," "misting hush...surrounded him like grace"). Payoff gate met. However, tone remains static in mood (contemplative, hushed) without escalation or pressure; it does not shift under stress because no stress appears. Development gate marginal. Score: coherent and purposeful, contributes to thematic resonance and closure atmosphere, but lacks dynamic range or tension that would elevate integration into the high band.</comment>
