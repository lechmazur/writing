<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Marta's motivation to decode the ghost's message is clear and sustained, with embodied choices (playing specific notes, wading to the stage, photographing evidence). Her interiority shows purposeful action under pressure—"she'd been piecing it together"—and the final promise ("I heard you") carries earned weight. However, internal contradiction is minimal; she never doubts her interpretation or fears consequences, which flattens the psychological texture. The ghost remains abstract, a communication partner rather than a force that complicates Marta's stance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (flooded pit, lanterns, three days). The drive lens reads Accumulative/Textural: clues accumulate (program stains, lantern responses, water-written confession) until the final cadence shift when Marta plays Constance's piece and the house "felt complete." Closure is Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant)—Marta's promise to "tell them" forecloses silence, and the mutual acknowledgment between musician and ghost reweights the premise with felt cost (seventy-year wait ended). One tightening occurs when the conductor's name emerges, narrowing the mystery. Cost is legible: Marta will "disrupt the official history," staking her credibility tomorrow.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The flooded opera house supplies vivid, purpose-driven detail: water at chest-deep alters acoustics ("deeper and more resonant"), lanterns flicker in dialogue, the program warps under flood damage to create new symbols. Spatial choreography is clear (pit to stage climb, water streaming from clothes). The micro-setting of water and program constrains Marta's decoding method and charges the final image when she lays the program center stage. Sensory selection reflects her musician's focus (C string note, E flat response). Minor slip: "third rung of her chair" is spatially vague (chairs don't have rungs), and the seventy-year backstory of Constance and Moretti is efficient but borders on exposition without immediate grounding cues.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake is clear: decode the ghost's message and expose the truth. Escalation occurs through the Accumulative lens: clues deepen (floating program → stain patterns → conductor's name → water-written "TELL THEM"), and each discovery narrows options until Marta commits to disruption. The tightening when "Moretti" emerges forecloses doubt about the ghost's claim. Agency is present: Marta chooses to photograph evidence and promise public revelation, with visible cost (her credibility and the seventy-year wait). However, no on-page opposition complicates her progress—lanterns always affirm, water always cooperates—so pressure remains unidirectional. The lack of a second reversal or friction point keeps this strong but shy of 8+.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from image and action: the "in-between spaces" when truth exists outside official record, and "wordless conversation" as a mode of justice for the silenced. The flooded opera house becomes a liminal crucible where water damage—destruction—creates the code that finally names the perpetrator. Marta's final act (photographing, promising) and her playing Pachelbel as acknowledgment form a resonant, non-literal answer to the question of how the forgotten are heard. No overt moralizing; "I heard you" carries thematic weight without assertion. Minor slip: "the opera house existed in its truest form—amid the hush of unstruck chords" drifts slightly abstract, though it grounds in Marta's musician perspective.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled, with Marta's perceptual signature consistent (musician's ear for notes, eye for patterns, comfort in liminal rehearsal spaces). Diction matches her expertise: "C string," "fermata," "conducting baton," "Pachelbel's Canon." Psychic distance modulates purposefully, zooming in on her tracing fingers and pulling back for the house-wide lantern blaze. Voice is distinct and maintains texture under pressure ("something she couldn't name," "wordless conversation"). No head-hopping. Minor friction: "someone—perhaps the ghost herself—had arranged flickering lanterns" introduces uncertainty about the ghost's agency that isn't fully resolved, and the phrase "lately inspired by something she couldn't name" is slightly vague for a character otherwise precise in observation.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully, and information density is high (flood context, ghost history, decoding method all woven through action). Opening line anchors voice and stakes; final line ("the opera house felt complete") resonates. Clarity is strong, with one exception: "water lapping at the third rung of her chair" (chairs lack rungs). Minor scaffold appears in adjacent lines: "She'd found it floating... its ink bleeding" and "The water damage had transformed... now a series of dots" restate transformation without added pressure. Filter-verb use is light and voice-motivated. No loops or template cadence runs. The phrase "in those in-between spaces when rehearsal ended and performance hadn't yet begun" slightly over-explains the concept already shown. Proofreading is clean.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>The premise—ghost leaves coded messages, flood creates new layer of decoding via water damage—offers a fresh synthesis of Gothic trope and environmental catalyst. Marta's musician identity shapes how she reads symbols (musical notation, fermate) rather than generic puzzle-solving. The emotional truth of waiting seventy years for acknowledgment avoids sentimentality through concrete action (lanterns, water swirls). However, the core ghost-mystery structure and the benevolent-spirit-seeking-justice frame are familiar; transformation comes through the flood mechanism and Marta's specific skill set, not a bold subversion of expectations. The ending image (lanterns dimming peacefully, house complete) is earned but not surprising. Risk-taking is moderate: the water-damage-as-code is clever but doesn't fundamentally redefine reader expectations.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Marta's role as orchestra pit musician is essential: her presence in the flooded pit, her use of cello notes to communicate with the ghost, and her musician's eye for interpreting stains as musical notation (dots, curves, fermata) all drive key beats. Setup is immediate (first line: cello, pit). Development: she plays C and E flat to elicit lantern responses, decodes the program through musical symbols. Payoff: she plays Pachelbel's Canon as the closure gesture, and the piece ends with "every lantern in the house, a full orchestra of light." Her specific skill constrains her method and charges the final image. Removing "musician" would gut the decoding logic and the resonance of the final performance.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The antique opera program is indispensable. Setup: introduced early ("floating near the conductor's podium yesterday"). Development: she traces its warped text, decodes every-third-letter patterns, sees faces/letters in stains, discovers "Moretti" beneath the soprano's name. Payoff: she lays it center stage where Constance died; water swirls around it form "TELL THEM," and she photographs it as evidence. It appears in at least four distinct beats, each time with new information that narrows her understanding. The flood's transformation of the program into code is the story's causal engine. Removing it breaks the entire decoding arc and the ghost's communication method.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>"In between spaces" is signaled early ("when rehearsal ended and performance hadn't yet begun, when the opera house existed in its truest form") and returns thematically at closure ("the ghost who'd been waiting seven decades in the in-between spaces"). It shapes Marta's motivation—she alone stays in liminal times—and the flood itself is an in-between state. However, it functions more as framing concept than on-page constraint; Marta's choices aren't visibly limited by liminality, and the final image doesn't hinge on it. The ghost's seventy-year wait in the margins is conceptually linked, but the element doesn't pressure a specific tactic or foreclose an option the way the program or flood does.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Lately inspired" appears once in the opening paragraph ("lately inspired by something she couldn't name") but doesn't recur or constrain action. It justifies her nightly returns, but the story doesn't dramatize a cost of inspiration versus, say, safety or skepticism. Her certainty is unwavering throughout; no beat shows inspiration enabling a risky choice or narrowing options. The trait is present and consistent with her behavior but functionally swappable with "compelled," "curious," or "determined." It seeds her commitment but doesn't visibly shape a turn or the final image.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>"Disrupt" is set up early ("Marta had been the only one to notice") and pays off explicitly: "Tomorrow she would disrupt the official history, would speak for the ghost." The action redefines her role from decoder to public advocate, and the cost (staking credibility against a celebrated maestro's legacy) is legible. The promise "I heard you" and the photographing beat are both disruption-in-progress. It appears in two key beats (decision to photograph, promise to tell) and the closure hinges on her commitment to disruption as the reciprocal gesture that completes the ghost's seventy-year wait. Removing it would flatten the stakes to private communion without public consequence.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Water damage is introduced early ("pages warped and stained from the flood") and is the mechanism by which the ghost's code becomes readable: ink bleeds into "swirls and symbols," stains resemble notation and fermata, and a bloom across the soprano's name reveals "Moretti." In the climax, water pooling around the program forms "TELL THEM." The method is signaled, its mechanics matter (transformation via damage), and it enables Marta's decoding. It appears in at least three beats (program discovery, margin images, water-written confession) and directly shapes the closure image. Specificity: only water damage could justify the emergence of hidden information from a seventy-year-old document. Removing it requires inventing a new decoding mechanism.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>The flooded opera house lit by lanterns is indispensable. Setup: immediate (first paragraph: "flooded orchestra pit, water lapping," "flickering lanterns along the balcony rails"). Development: water alters acoustics ("sound traveled differently through water, deeper and more resonant"), lanterns flicker in response to Marta's cello notes (dialogue mechanism), chest-deep water constrains her movement (she wades, climbs stairs "water streaming"). Payoff: all lanterns blaze when she lays the program, then dim peacefully at closure. The setting supplies the decoding method (water damage), the ghost's communication channel (lanterns), and the physical constraint that makes her choices effortful. Removing flood or lanterns breaks causality and the ghost-communication system.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Amid the hush of unstruck chords" appears as thematic descriptor ("when the opera house existed in its truest form—amid the hush of unstruck chords") but doesn't function as a ticking clock or tracked timeframe. The story notes "three days" of flooding and that Marta returns "each night," but no urgency derives from time pressure; she could decode tomorrow or next week. The hush evokes liminality and silence, supporting tone, but it doesn't constrain her pacing or force a choice. It's present and coherent but functionally replaceable with any quiet, liminal descriptor.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Marta's desire to unravel the ghost's code is set up early ("she'd been piecing it together, this message from someone who'd drowned here seventy years ago") and drives every beat: consulting the program, playing notes, interpreting stains, wading to the stage, photographing evidence. The motivation is dramatized through repeated action and culminates in the promise "I heard you" and the commitment to "tell them." Friction exists between patience (months of wordless conversation) and the urgency introduced by the flood's revelation. The cost is her future credibility staked against official history. Removing this motivation would leave no engine for her nightly returns or her final promise.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Wordless conversation" is introduced early ("a wordless conversation they'd been having for months") and recurs: cello notes answered by lantern flickers, silence between moves, and the final "wordless language they shared" when Marta plays Pachelbel. The tone is consistent—quiet, patient, mutual—and modulates subtly as pressure builds (lanterns blaze brighter, then dim peacefully). It charges the closure image by framing the entire arc as reciprocal communication without speech. However, it functions more as tonal coherence than a constraint that narrows options. Removing it would shift register but not break causality. Strong thematic presence, moderate causal pressure.</comment>
