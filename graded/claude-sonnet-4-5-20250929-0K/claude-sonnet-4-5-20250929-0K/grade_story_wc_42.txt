<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Kenji's interiority is concrete and his sensory training ("sound of a leaf falling") shapes his approach to the spinning hand. The micro-choice to follow rather than fight the mechanism is earned and embodied through his grandmother's teaching. Internal contradiction is present in his attempt to "capture moments before they fled" while accepting impermanence, though the arc leans philosophical. Chen remains functional but flat, serving as exposition conduit rather than pressure source.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Orientation anchors cleanly (who/where/when by paragraph two). The closure qualifies as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis variant): Kenji accepts the moon's departure and restructures instruments to witness change rather than preserve constancy, foreclosing the restorative path with the visible cost of abandoning fixed parameters. The causal lens holds—tremors prompt inspection, spinning hand resists stilling, orbital decay discovery forces recalibration choice—though the middle sags into extended reflection that delays the restructuring turn. Cost is legible in the line "Let it spin. Let everything reach for the velocity it needed."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The observatory setting pressures Kenji's choice by literalizing the foundation-shaking (tremors force urgency) and the telescope provides the discovery vehicle. The spinning clock hand, disassembled chronometer, and orrery gears become micro-setting that Kenji manipulates to redirect energy rather than suppress it—tools constrain and enable his solution. Sensory detail is selective (thin alpine light, silver glow, foundation tremors through bones) and filtered through his repair-trained attention. The moon's visual intensification charges the final image.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake (capture/measure celestial mechanics amid accelerating change) is signaled early and tightens when orbital decay discovery forces instrument restructure. The reversal from "restore old parameters" to "accept motion" narrows Kenji's options and costs him the restorative goal. However, the conflict lacks antagonistic pressure—Chen agrees immediately, no resistance complicates execution, and the restructuring succeeds without friction or visible tradeoff beyond philosophical acceptance. The final cost is felt but abstract: witnessing departure rather than preserving constancy.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme (impermanence, witnessing versus capturing, accepting escape velocity) emerges organically from the spinning hand's refusal to still and Kenji's decision to follow rather than fight. The grandmother's teaching and the clock hand/orrery form a resonant through-line without overt symbolism. The final image—"capturing light across the growing distance until even that ephemeral thread finally broke"—reweights the opening desire to "harness the ephemeral" with earned melancholy, offering a non-literal answer. No thematic statements intrude; the prose allows complexity (beauty in departure, loss in witnessing).</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Kenji; no head-hopping. Perceptual signature is consistent (repair-trained sensory attention, clockwork metaphors, attunement to tremor and spin). Diction is controlled and elevated but voice-appropriate for a contemplative technician. Dialogue is minimal and functional; Chen's lines advance plot without subtext. Filter verbs ("felt," "watched") appear frequently but fit the reflective register. Free indirect style is clean. The prose texture supports the meditative tone without losing clarity under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Rhythm varies purposefully; sentence openings shift between subject-verb and participial phrases without mechanical repetition. Information density is high in the restructuring sequence. However, figurative language clusters in high-pressure beats without always earning its space: "organs of a clockwork heart," "luminous ache," "grammar of precision instruments," "bittersweet recognition" stack metaphor and abstraction where concrete action would sharpen momentum. Minor paraphrase loop: "The old parameters are gone" followed immediately by restating the same insight. No major artifacts obscure closure, but the density of elevated diction in key beats nudges toward overwriting.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The synthesis of lunar observatory + orbital decay + clockwork repair + acceptance of impermanence is specific and coherent. The choice to restructure instruments to follow rather than resist change offers a fresh angle on the "scientist confronts cosmic shift" template. However, the emotional arc (struggling craftsman learns to accept motion) is familiar, and the lack of complication or failure in the restructuring sequence limits risk. The grandmother's teaching and the spinning hand motif provide texture but the resolution feels gentle and somewhat expected once the insight arrives.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Kenji (sage camera repairer) makes the key decision to restructure rather than restore, altering tactics and driving closure. His sensory training shapes his method (listening, following motion). Present in setup, middle choice, and ending. However, "sage" remains largely a label; the story shows skill but not wisdom earned through visible prior cost or mistake within these beats.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The clock hand appears in setup (spinning relentlessly, resisting Kenji's attempts), middle (he stops fighting it, redirects its energy through new pathways), and ending (placed back into the orrery where it belongs, still spinning). Its refusal to still forces the restructuring choice and its final placement charges the closure image. The hand's spinning state reweights from problem to acceptance. Strong causal role across three beats with closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>Escape velocity is present as metaphor (clock hand "pursuing its own escape velocity," moon "reaches for its own escape velocity") and frames the thematic stakes (everything beautiful eventually departs). It shapes Kenji's acceptance but does not mechanically constrain his actions—he could restructure instruments without invoking the concept. Functions as thematic lens more than tactical pressure. Present in setup and ending reprise with meaning shift, but lacks middle beat involvement.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Changelessly constant" describes the prior state of celestial mechanics ("observed changelessly constant for decades") but does not function as a character trait or constraint that enables/blocks action. It establishes contrast for the orbital decay discovery but remains descriptive rather than causally active. Mentioned once in setup without middle or ending participation.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Restructure is the pivotal action: Kenji restructures the tracking array, orrery gears, cameras, spectrographs, and telescope to accept motion rather than resist it. This choice resolves the conflict (instruments now record departure), alters Chen's understanding, and enables the closure effect (witnessing rather than capturing). Present in middle and ending with strong causal pressure. Swapping it (e.g., "recalibrate" alone) would weaken the thematic resonance of accepting fundamental change.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The method ("by the sound of a leaf falling") is seeded early as the grandmother's teaching and explicitly frames Kenji's approach: "to hear the whisper of a shutter blade settling into its groove," "to listen to what wanted to move." It shapes his decision to follow the spinning hand rather than force it still. However, the mechanics are not tested or demonstrated on the page—we don't see him use auditory precision during restructuring. Present in setup and invoked at the decision point, but lacks middle-beat dramatization.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>The lunar observatory provides the instruments Kenji restructures (telescope, orrery, cameras, spectrographs), the aperture through which lunar light streams, and the foundation that shakes with tremors—all pressure Kenji's choice. The "above the clouds" detail isolates the setting and amplifies the cosmic scale. The titanium struts and bedrock anchors literalize the "foundations shaking" theme. Present across all three gates and supplies resources that enable the restructuring solution.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The tremors ("when foundations shake") begin in the inciting beat, recur to escalate urgency ("Another tremor," "foundation trembled again"), and are reframed in the ending as "gentle, inexorable" rather than threatening—Kenji's acceptance reweights their meaning. They force the seismograph alert and discovery of accelerating orbital decay, tightening the timeline for restructuring. The timeframe is felt and constrains action across setup, middle, and ending with clear causal role.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The motivation "to harness the ephemeral" is stated explicitly ("That had always been his calling, whether repairing cameras that froze instants... or calibrating instruments that measured the moon's patient dance") and drives his initial attempt to still the clock hand. His final choice to witness rather than capture transforms the motivation with visible cost (abandoning the harnessing goal). However, the motivation is told more than dramatized—we don't see competing desires or friction between wanting to harness and needing to release until the decision point.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Tone ("luminous ache") is present from early ("Chen's face luminous with equal parts wonder and worry") through the ending ("luminous ache in his chest—the bittersweet recognition"). It coheres as melancholy wonder mixed with acceptance of loss and modulates appropriately (urgency in middle beats, meditative acceptance at closure). The tone charges the final image of witnessing departure. However, "luminous" and "ache" appear as overt labels rather than being fully embodied through sensation and action.</comment>
