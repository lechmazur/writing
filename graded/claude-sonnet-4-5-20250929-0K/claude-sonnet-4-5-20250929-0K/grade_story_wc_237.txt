<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's internal contradiction—scholarly training versus "small magics"—drives the crystallization crisis and resolution cleanly. The embodied fear response (hands turning to quartz) is specific and constrains action with visible cost. Grandmother's voice provides motivation without therapy-speak, and the final choice to trace runes is earned by the prior struggle. Minor slip: the scars-as-text metaphor edges toward over-articulation in the penultimate paragraph but doesn't flatten the closure.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Orientation anchors (floating platform, Mira, manuscript) land by the second paragraph. Causal lens holds: fear triggers crystallization, small magics reverse it, rune-work transforms scars into readable stories. The closure—Mira as "living text"—reweights the premise with felt cost (she now carries her history as meaning, not pain). One tightening (hands crystallize, she applies grandmother's teaching, regains control) narrows options and charges the final image. Cost is legible in the scars remaining visible yet transformed.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The floating platform constrains choice (Mira must stabilize her hands or fail), and sensory details—chains "turned silver with enchantment," tea as writing medium—are filtered through her scholarly lens. The environment evolves: pre-storm hush → rain → thunder, mirroring her internal shift. The crow quill and stone table recur with reweighted meaning at closure, charging the final image. Spatial choreography (kneeling, tracing, standing, walking toward chain-path) tracks cleanly.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Dominant stake (transform scars into stories) is signaled early and tested immediately when her hands crystallize. The tightening—must regain control before she can perform the ceremony—forecloses the passive option and forces micro-choices (knock, whisper, trace). Each rune inscribed narrows her relationship to trauma, and the final walk toward home with "steady, warm" hands confirms the trade-off: scars remain but no longer ache. Agency is decision and endurance; the cost (facing each memory) is visible on the page.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Theme emerges from concrete action: the Shedding Runes ceremony transforms wounds without erasing them, resisting tidy closure. The grandmother's small magics versus Academy knowledge tension avoids binary resolution—Mira synthesizes both. The final image ("living text, a story that had learned to read itself") reweights the premise non-literally. Minor slip: "everything—even fear, even loss—could be transformed if you knew the right symbols" edges toward thematic statement in the final paragraph, but the prior scene work earns it.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>POV remains stable third-limited on Mira; perceptual signature (scholarly precision, embodied fear, grandmother's voice) is consistent. Diction modulates under pressure: short syntax during crystallization, longer contemplative rhythms during rune-work. No head-hopping. The grandmother's voice is distinct from Mira's internal register. Free indirect style is clean ("She had dismissed those teachings…"). Minor template echo: "She was no longer afraid of storms" in the final paragraph is competent but slightly generic for the established texture.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>8.5</grade><comment>Sentence rhythm varies purposefully; no loops or paraphrase cycles. Information density is high: "crow quill trimmed tip" establishes mother's legacy and tool function in one phrase. Figurative language (frost on winter glass, liquid moonlight) is controlled and motivated. Action sequence is clear (dip quill → trace rune → see memory → move to next scar). Minor drag: "as she walked toward the chain-path leading home" could compress to "as she reached the chain-path," but the beat remains propulsive. Zero artifacts touch the closure image.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The synthesis of scholarly runes and folk magic is specific and non-obvious; the crystallization response is a fresh embodiment of fear. The floating platform and tea-as-ink ceremony avoid generic fantasy trappings through functional detail. The scars-into-text transformation resists surface novelty in favor of emotional specificity. Proximity check: the "living text" metaphor is well-worn but earned here through the rune-work specifics. Risk is moderate; the piece executes confidently within its lane without bold structural gambles.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Mira's scholar identity shapes her approach (three years at the Archives, manuscript study) and creates friction with grandmother's teachings. Her decision to apply small magics reverses the crystallization and enables the ceremony. She drives two beats (hand recovery, rune inscription) and the closure hinges on her synthesis of both knowledge systems. Cost is visible: she confronts each traumatic memory to complete the work.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The quill appears in three beats: introduction as mother's tool, dipping into tea, tracing runes. Its "precisely cut" tip serves function (holds ink without dripping), and it carries legacy weight. However, the quill could be replaced with any fine writing instrument without breaking story logic; its specificity charges the final image but doesn't constrain earlier choices. Lyric reprise (mother → final ceremony) reweights meaning but stops short of indispensability.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>8.7</grade><comment>"A breath between storms" is signaled in the opening paragraph, shapes the platform's atmospheric pressure (Mira must work before the storm breaks), and brackets the ceremony's timeframe. The hush intensifies her focus and the first raindrops mark completion, directly altering tactics (she must finish before weather disrupts the floating platform). The closing thunder confirms the breath has ended, reweighting the opening image. Removal would collapse the story's temporal stakes and tonal coherence.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>8.9</grade><comment>Crystallization triggers immediately when fear grips Mira, constraining her hands (the ceremony's essential tool) and forcing the core conflict. The trait appears in three beats: initial onset, reversal via small magics, and closure confirmation ("hands remained steady, warm, and blessedly human"). The cost is tangible—without reversing it, she cannot perform the runes. The attribute is irreplaceable; no near-synonym would carry the same embodied specificity or causal pressure.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>9.2</grade><comment>Shedding is the ceremony's core action, named in the manuscript and enacted across the middle third as Mira traces runes onto scars. Each rune "sheds the weight" while keeping wisdom, and the verb reappears in the resolution ("no longer afraid of storms"). The action defines the story's structure (preparation → shedding → transformation) and the closure logic (scars remain but no longer ache). Swapping "shed" for "release" or "cleanse" would require rewriting the manuscript and thematic through-line. Fully integrated with visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Youthful superstitions (knock three times, whisper to the wind, trace a circle) are signaled early via grandmother's voice, dismissed as pre-Academy naiveté, then applied under duress to reverse crystallization. The method shapes two beats: Mira's choice to try them and their success enabling the ceremony. The mechanics matter—each gesture has a specific function. Removal would erase the central tension (scholarly versus folk magic) and the means of overcoming the crystallization crisis.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The floating platform creates spatial pressure (isolation, exposure to weather, ancient chains implying precarity) and supplies the stone table for the knock and circle-tracing. It appears in four beats: opening description, table use, rain arrival signaling urgency, and departure via chain-path. The setting constrains Mira's options (she cannot flee mid-ceremony) and charges the closure image with elevation and threshold. A ground-level shrine could function, but the floating platform's exposure to storms and the chain-anchored verticality are tightly braided with the "breath between storms" timeframe.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>9.1</grade><comment>"A held breath" appears in the opening as atmospheric condition, governs the ceremony's pacing (Mira works within pre-storm stillness), and closes with "the breath between storms was ending" as rain begins. The timeframe tightens every choice: she must stabilize her hands and complete the runes before weather forces her off the platform. The final paragraph confirms time's passage ("behind her, thunder rolled") and the breath's release. Removal would erase the story's urgency and causal backbone; the entire narrative hinges on working within this compressed window.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>The desire to transform scars is dramatized in the opening (scars pulsing beneath sleeves, three years of study) and tested when crystallization threatens to prevent the ceremony. Mira's choice to apply grandmother's magics rather than abort the mission reveals hierarchy of values. The motivation drives the rune-tracing sequence and is fulfilled at closure when scars become "a text she could read." The friction between erasing versus transforming creates authentic tension. Cost is visible: she must face each traumatic memory to reweight it.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>8.8</grade><comment>"Saturated hush" is named in the second paragraph and sustained through the ceremony via sensory control (no extraneous sound, focus on Mira's breath and quill work) until the first raindrops break it. Tone modulates with pressure—tight syntax during crystallization, contemplative rhythm during rune inscription—without abandoning the hush. The closing thunder confirms the tone shift as Mira transitions from held breath to motion. The tone charges every beat and the final image; removing it would flatten the story's atmospheric coherence and thematic resonance.</comment>
