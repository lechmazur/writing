<question>1</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Cosima's motivation is clear and shapes her choices throughout—trading poems for repair lessons, capturing sounds, and giving the music box to Mrs. Chen. The interiority is concrete and character-particular, with embodied details like "ink-stained fingers" and the visceral tears at the lullaby. The final gift to Mrs. Chen forecloses the path of keeping the box, a visible cost that shifts from isolation to connection. Minor slip: the poverty-to-purpose arc feels slightly predictable, and some internal states ("heart jingled with purpose") edge toward abstraction rather than full embodiment.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The piece establishes a clear accumulative/textural lens: Cosima's collecting practice deepens through the music box repair and culminates in the public jar-opening and the gift exchange. Closure arrives as Resonant Reconfiguration (Charged Poise + micro Decisive Change): the gift forecloses ownership but reweights her poverty into purpose, with visible cost (coins, community recognition). Orientation anchors who/where/when by the second paragraph. The because/therefore linkage from finding the box → learning repair → capturing the lullaby → public performance → gift to Mrs. Chen is clean and motivated, with one meaningful tightening when Mrs. Chen's recognition validates the entire practice.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The feral loft is vividly anchored with "salt and wild roses threading through the floorboards" and "hundreds of glass jars lined the loft's walls," constraining Cosima's poverty and shaping her salvage practice. The music box discovery "where the dunes met the old boardwalk" grounds the inciting action in spatial logic. The setting charges the final image: descending "back toward her loft beneath the dunes" with "coins enough for bread" crystallizes her marginal survival and chosen purpose. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through her poet's eye.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—translating vanishing sounds for the community—is signaled early and tightens when Cosima risks public performance after three winters of exile. The music box repair deepens pressure by requiring skill acquisition (months of lessons traded for poems). Mrs. Chen's recognition and the gift exchange narrow options: Cosima gives away the object she labored to restore, foreclosing possession but earning communal validation. One meaningful tightening is clear; the accumulative lens supports this escalation pattern. Minor issue: the crowd's uniform response ("stood in lonesome splendor") flattens potential conflict or resistance.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Theme of "gleaned redemption" emerges through concrete particulars: salvaged furniture, captured sounds, and the music box gift. The final image—"purpose salvaged from the wreckage of her fall"—resonates without overt moralizing, reweighting her poverty as chosen vocation. The lullaby's inter-generational transmission ("teach it forward") answers the central question of bridging silence and memory with visible cost (the box changes hands). Subtext operates in the jar-opening ritual and Mrs. Chen's tears. Minor slip: "positively wistful" as meta-commentary feels slightly over-articulated, though it functions within the premise.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV remains stable and character-bound, with perceptual signature clear in "ink-stained fingers" and the poet's lens on "storm clouds" tarnish. Diction is largely controlled—"feral loft," "drift-treasures," "lonesome splendor"—creating a distinct texture. Brief dialogue from Mrs. Chen and Cosima carries goal and subtext without filter clutter. Minor issues: "positively wistful verses" and "gleaned redemption" edge toward authorial vocabulary rather than pure character idiom; "heart jingled with something richer" uses metaphor that feels slightly external to the established voice under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Prose is largely clean with strong specificity ("tarnished to the color of storm clouds," "breath expelled while reciting certain poems") and good information density. Rhythm varies purposefully, and the opening/closing frame the arc effectively. Two issues lower the score: "positively wistful" and "gleaned redemption" repeat as anchors but feel like template phrases from the prompt rather than organic narrative language; the phrase "lonesome splendor, together yet each alone" in the climax beat stacks modifiers in a way that slightly blurs immediacy. No paraphrase loops or major scaffold, but these pattern artifacts in high-pressure moments trigger the −0.6 deduction range and prevent 9+ eligibility globally.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>The sound-capturing premise is inventively rendered with the jar-sealing method and breath-as-medium specificity. The vagrant poet angle and inter-generational stakes offer a fresh inflection on memory/preservation themes. However, the core arc—outcast artist finds redemption through craft and communal gift—follows a recognizable template without fully transforming it; the emotional beats (exile, skill acquisition, public validation, generous gift) are executed well but predictable. The music box repair and jar ritual provide enough texture to lift above mid-band, but the closure feels anticipated rather than inevitable-in-hindsight.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Cosima's decisions drive all major turns: claiming the loft, finding the music box, trading for repair lessons, capturing the lullaby, performing publicly, and gifting the box to Mrs. Chen. Present in setup (paragraph one), middle (repair sequence), and closure (the gift). Causal pressure is strong; her choices narrow options and impose visible costs (time, labor, final possession). High irreplaceability—remove her agency and the story collapses.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>The music box appears early (paragraph two), drives the middle beat (repair until noon), and is causally active at closure (the gift to Mrs. Chen). Used across three distinct beats with evolving function: inciting discovery, repair challenge, and inter-generational bridge. Its specific lullaby payload reweights the ending. Strong integration with visible cost tied to its transfer.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The concept frames Cosima's motivation and the thematic question from the start ("gathering fragments from the edges of disappearance"). It shapes her tactics (salvaging, capturing, performing, gifting) and charges the closure when she gives the box away, redeeming her fall through communal service. Present across all three gates with cost. However, "gleaned redemption" appears as an overt label in the final paragraph, which lowers specificity and reads as prompt-echo rather than fully dramatized pressure.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>"Positively wistful" is named explicitly as the poetic method that "worked best" for sound-capturing, enabling the jar-sealing mechanic. It appears in setup (method explanation) and implicitly in the dawn-as-forgiveness poem she recites. The trait constrains technique but does not visibly shape a choice under pressure or impose a felt tradeoff. Functional but closer to label-only; middle development is thin.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"Sweeten" operates as the enabling verb for sound-capture ("sweeten the air inside the glass with the right longing") and recurs in the final paragraph ("sweeten absence into presence"). Present in setup (method teaching), active in the middle beat (poem recitation during capture), and charged at closure as thematic payoff. Drives the central mechanic and reweights the ending. Strong irreplaceability, though the closure use leans thematic rather than tactically urgent.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>The jar method is taught early (paragraph four), its mechanics detailed (breath + poem + open jar), and demonstrated on-page during the music box capture. It drives the middle beat (the capture sequence) and the climax (public jar-opening performance). Present across all three gates, with the method's social payoff (crowd response, Mrs. Chen's tears) supplying visible cost and validation. High causal pressure and irreplaceability.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>The loft is anchored early with vivid detail ("salt and wild roses," jars lining walls) and frames the opening and closing movements. It signals Cosima's poverty and marginal status, shaping her salvage practice. It participates in closure as the destination she returns to with earned purpose. However, the loft does not constrain a middle choice or supply a resource that alters tactics under pressure—it remains atmospheric rather than mechanically active. Two gates (setup, closure reprise) with lyric resonance lift it into mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"At dawn's earliest whistle" anchors the opening and sets tone, but time does not tighten decisions or track across the middle. The repair "took until noon," but elapsed hours do not create urgency or alter tactics. Closure occurs "that evening" without a live clock pressuring the final choice. Present in setup, absent in escalation, and passive at closure. Functional label but no causal work.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>The desire "to become the translator between generations" is stated early (paragraph three) and dramatized through the repair effort, the jar collection, and the public performance. It drives multiple beats and faces friction (poverty, exile, months of learning). The gift to Mrs. Chen enacts the motivation with visible cost (possession forfeited). Strong closure linkage and causal pressure across all three gates.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>"Lonesome splendor" appears explicitly in the climax ("the crowd stood in lonesome splendor") and implicitly charges the entire piece—Cosima's isolated purpose, the communal-yet-private grief ritual, the bittersweet gift exchange. Tone is coherent and modulates from solitary dawn to public performance to purposeful return. The phrase itself carries the exact emotional signature of the ending: beauty laced with isolation, community tinged with loss. Strong closure charge and thematic fit.</comment>
