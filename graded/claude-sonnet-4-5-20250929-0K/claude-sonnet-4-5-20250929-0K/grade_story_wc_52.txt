<question>1</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Margot's interiority is concrete and character-particular throughout, with embodied emotion in her handling of the wood and tools. The widow's decision to carve emerges from accumulated reflection on Roland's journals and her understanding of his paralysis, showing internal contradiction between preservation and acceptance. The final choice—to create an imperfect bowl rather than a memorial—demonstrates agency with visible cost (abandoning perfection, accepting incompleteness). Minor deduction: the reflection density is high, but it anchors in present stimuli (wood, kettle, rain) and the micro-choices (testing the knife, beginning to cut) tilt present stance sufficiently under the BRR expanded allowance.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>8.2</grade><comment>Closure lands on-page as Resonant Reconfiguration (Earned Stasis): Margot completes the carving into a deliberately imperfect bowl, forecloses the path of monument-making, and accepts incompleteness with visible cost ("finished and unfinished both"). The Accumulative/Textural lens holds: rain imagery, the kettle's progression, and wood-grain rings accumulate toward the final image of the bowl held to light, reweighting "here and gone" from loss to transformation. Orientation is clear by ~80 words (widow, loft, ash wood blank). One meaningful deepening occurs when she understands Roland's paralysis and begins cutting. Cost is legible in the final paragraph: she sits with something "that could hold, at last, the weight of everything it had been."</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The rain-beaded skylight functions as micro-setting that charges atmosphere and the final image ("Through the translucent ash wood, she could see the shadow of her own palm"). The loft, whips, scarred chairs, and ash blank anchor who/where early. The kettle's progression (whisper, murmur, scream) tracks time and pressure. Wood grain and tool constrain her carving choices (grain dictates form, knife reveals layers). Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Margot's circus-trained priorities. Minor cap consideration: while vivid, the setting does not force a tactical choice as strongly as in the highest band, but the recurring rain and skylight image do charge closure.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>7.9</grade><comment>Dominant stake signaled early: to complete what Roland started, understood as containing/making sense of loss. One meaningful tightening when Margot reads the journal entry and grasps Roland's paralysis, which narrows her options from monument to process-driven carving. The choice to cut "everything that wasn't essential" and create an imperfect bowl forecloses the path of preservation with felt cost (accepting transformation over permanence). Agency is clear; coincidence does not resolve. Pressure coheres under the Accumulative lens through the kettle's rising intensity and the carving's progression. Entering 8.0+ typically requires a trade-off that forecloses a live option; here the trade-off is present but the escalation is more a deepening than a sharp reversal.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>8.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from particulars: "here and gone" transforms from absence to presence-through-transformation via the wood's rings, the bowl's imperfection, and Roland's journals. The ending offers a resonant, non-literal answer—"making space for what's gone is how you hold what remains"—through the bowl's form rather than statement. Subtext operates in the uncarved bark patch, the uneven rim, and the kettles scream as punctuation. No moralizing; the rust-hued peace deepens without resolving into tidy binaries. One small deduction: "That making space for what's gone is how you hold what remains" skirts thematic articulation, though it remains image-adjacent and doesn't fully collapse into sermon.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>8.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and controlled; psychic distance modulates purposefully (close during carving, wider during reflection). Perceptual signature is distinct: circus-trained attention to presence, practical beauty, and tool use. Diction remains within Margot's plausible lexicon with purposeful compression ("rust-hued peace," "hauntingly practical"). Free indirect style is clean. The prose reflects the widow's mind under calm focus. Narrative certainty matches what she can know. Minor note: a few phrases trend slightly elevated ("crystallized time," "ambulatory through canvas") but remain voice-motivated and consistent.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>7.7</grade><comment>Rhythm varies naturally; sentence openings and paragraph lengths create visual cadence. Information density is high: most lines do multiple jobs (e.g., rain both anchors setting and mirrors loss/transformation). No paraphrase loops or synonym churn detected. Figurative language is purposeful but dense in the opening and middle ("aquarium of gray light," "rust-hued peace," "time made visible in rings"). Some metaphoric clustering in non-peak beats slightly elevates texture without obscuring clarity. The kettle's progression and the final bowl image land cleanly. One small artifact: "Here and gone" recurs as a structuring phrase, which is pattern-taught but edges toward insistence.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>The premise (widow completing deceased partner's unfinished work) is familiar, but the transformation is specific: circus life, lions as teachers of presence, the choice to carve an imperfect bowl rather than a memorial. Emotional specificity (Roland's absence even at breakfast, the wood's drought bands) avoids generic templates. The turn from monument to process-driven imperfection feels earned. Risk-taking is moderate: the accumulative structure and high reflection ratio are purposeful but not radical. The final image of the bowl held to light with the lifeline visible is a fresh synthesis. No close echoes of famous scenes detected.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>Margot (lion tamer's widow) is present throughout; her choice to complete the carving, to cut away rather than preserve, and to accept imperfection drive all key turns. She appears early, makes middle choices (reading journals, testing the knife, beginning to carve), and her final action (lifting the bowl to light) charges closure. Cost is visible: she forgoes monument-making and accepts incompleteness.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>8.6</grade><comment>Ash wood blank is present in paragraph one, handled in multiple beats (turning it over, testing the knife, cutting through grain), and its final form (the bowl) is the closure image. The wood's rings encode time ("here and gone"), grain dictates form, and the bark patch signals incompleteness. Irreplaceable: the specific wood and its history are load-bearing.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>"Here and gone" is seeded early (lions, Roland's presence), explicitly named in the journal entry, structures the carving passage ("Here: the year they married... Gone: the season he broke his shoulder"), and reweights at closure ("Here and gone meant not disappearing but transforming"). It shapes her understanding and thus her choice to carve process over product. Cost: she must accept transformation rather than preservation.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>"Hauntingly practical" appears twice: once as decision framing ("The carving would be hauntingly practical") and once retrospectively in the bowl's description ("Something to hold keys or coins or nothing at all"). It constrains her choice of form (useful, not merely decorative) but the trait itself is more a guiding aesthetic than a source of friction. Functional but closer to mid-band: it enables rather than complicates.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>"Contain" is the verb that defines Margot's goal ("She needed to contain something in this wood") and recurs at closure ("something that could hold, at last, the weight of everything it had been"). The bowl's purpose is to contain without preserving. This action redefines her understanding of the task and shapes the final form. High causal pressure; tied to closure image.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>5.9</grade><comment>"Crystallized time" appears in Roland's journal entry as his articulation of what the lions teach and what he sought to capture. It primes Margot's understanding but does not directly shape her carving method on the page. The wood rings ("time made visible in rings") operationalize the concept, but "crystallized time" itself is more thematic seed than mechanical method. Present in setup and echoed at closure, but mid-involvement.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Rain-beaded skylight loft is anchored early and recurs throughout (rain drumming, rain intensifies, "aquarium of gray light," rain's "patient instruction"). The final image uses the skylight ("lifted the bowl to the rain-beaded light"). The setting creates atmosphere and charges the ending but does not alter tactics or constrain a choice as strongly as in the highest band. Good lyric integration; functional participation in closure.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The kettle's progression (whisper, murmur, scream) tracks time across the carving sequence and adds urgency. Its scream punctuates the completion of the bowl, and Margot pours tea afterward. The timeframe tightens pacing but does not force a decision under live clock pressure. Solid two-beat presence with closure adjacency; functional but not indispensable.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>"To harvest lessons from loss" is stated as decision in paragraph two ("in the rust-hued peace of widowhood, that she would complete what he'd started") and again near the carving passage ("harvest the lessons from loss itself"). The desire drives her reading of the journals and her choice to carve understanding rather than monument. Friction between preservation and acceptance creates cost. Dramatized through micro-choices (testing the knife, beginning to cut). Strong setup and development; good closure linkage.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>"Rust-hued peace" appears three times: once in paragraph two as framing, once during carving reflection, and once in the final paragraph ("feeling the rust-hued peace settle deeper"). The tone modulates from grief-adjacent calm to deepening acceptance, coherent across turns. It charges the ending without static repetition. The tone supports rather than dominates, but its recurrence and final deepening are purposeful.</comment>
