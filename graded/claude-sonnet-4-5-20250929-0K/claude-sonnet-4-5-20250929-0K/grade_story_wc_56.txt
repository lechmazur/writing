<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Mira's motivations are clear and her expertise is established early, but interiority relies heavily on abstract philosophical musings rather than embodied contradiction. The passage "Logic was a tool that worked until it didn't. Intuition, sharpened by disappointment and refined by failure, had become her better compass" reads as label-speak that tells us her stance rather than showing it through micro-choices under pressure. The final acceptance feels more like intellectual comprehension than a costly renunciation or transformation—she sits "with the serene upheaval of understanding" in a way that flattens rather than embodies internal conflict. No on-page cost forecloses a path; she simply gains knowledge and plans to document it tomorrow.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>The lens is Accumulative/Textural: details accrete (sundial, canal glow, blueprints) toward a final image of understanding. Orientation is anchored adequately by ~120 words (barge canal, twilight, Viktor's journals). However, the closure unit lacks felt cost—Mira's realization that "Viktor had vanished" into his own architecture and that "lies weren't obstacles to truth but pathways toward it" is a Conceptual Repricing, but the conceptual cost remains abstract and unexplored. The ending tells us she "sat with the serene upheaval of understanding" without demonstrating what path this forecloses or what she must now give up. The piece teaches its pattern but the final reconfiguration feels more like arrival at an answer than a meaningful tightening with legible price.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The twilight canal setting is vivid and purposeful, with sensory details like "murky surface," "crystalline blue," and the sundial's warmth establishing atmosphere. The canal's glowing water and the sundial's role in revealing hidden blueprints give the environment a clear causal role. However, the setting's constraint on choice is mild—Mira observes more than she struggles against spatial or temporal pressure. The micro-setting (sundial, water, twilight angle) charges the final image adequately, lifting the score into the mid-7s, but the barge deck itself remains somewhat static as a platform for revelation rather than a crucible that forces tactical adaptation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>The dominant stake—understanding Viktor's hidden legacy—is signaled early and sustained. The sundial rotation and the canal's glow constitute one meaningful tightening that deepens Mira's understanding. However, escalation is driven more by environmental revelation than by protagonist agency or a choice that narrows options. Mira kneels, photographs, sketches, and documents—actions that feel more like passive reception than decisions under pressure. No on-page reversal forces a trade-off; the water glows, she observes, and the cost of this knowledge (if any) is deferred to "tomorrow." The accumulative lens permits gentler escalation, but visible price is absent at closure.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Theme emerges organically from the architecture-of-lies conceit: Viktor's genius lay in misdirection, negative space, and collective blindness. The final image—"secrets it held beneath its thoughtfully clear surface"—reweights the premise without overt moralizing. Subtext operates effectively in phrases like "architecture of lies he'd left behind wasn't about false buildings" and "frames that directed attention away." However, the epiphany feels somewhat announced rather than earned through a specific costly choice. Lines like "lies weren't obstacles to truth but pathways toward it" verge on thematic echo, though they stop short of sermonizing. The resonance is clear but leans toward intellectual satisfaction rather than embodied struggle.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Third-person limited POV is stable and the prose carries a distinct contemplative texture: "neither day nor night claiming dominion," "serene upheaval of understanding." Psychic distance is controlled and diction fits an educated, driven researcher. However, the voice occasionally drifts into exposition that abstracts rather than dramatizes—"The architecture of lies he'd left behind wasn't about false buildings or imaginary cities. It was about misdirection itself" reads more like essay than embodied perception under pressure. No dialogue is present to judge. The perceptual signature is consistent but leans toward philosophical summary rather than sensory-specific bias shaped by urgency.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Prose is generally clean with varied syntax and strong imagery ("crystalline blue," "liminal space," "negative architecture"). Information density is solid; most sentences advance understanding or atmosphere. However, several passages loop conceptually: "The architecture of lies... wasn't about false buildings... It was about misdirection itself" and the subsequent paragraph restate the same insight. The phrase "serene upheaval" appears twice (once in the final paragraph, once earlier) without meaningful evolution. Stock metaphors like "truth-seekers looked right through them" and "stepped sideways into the architecture of his own creation" are competent but not fresh. Minor template cadence in the middle third ("She had been looking... Searching for...") slightly dulls momentum.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>The premise—an architect who designed cities as misdirection, hiding truth in negative space—offers a fresh angle on the treasure-hunt archetype. The pocket sundial that works at twilight and the canal-as-frame concept show ingenuity. However, the emotional and plot beats follow a familiar discovery arc: protagonist arrives, finds clue, experiences revelation, plans next steps. The transformation test is borderline: swap Viktor for another vanished genius and the canal for another liminal site, and the core structure persists. The "architecture of lies" conceit is specific and well-executed but stops short of bold risk or a non-obvious moral calculus that would elevate originality into the high 7s or 8s.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Mira (errant legend seeker) is present throughout and her goal drives the narrative. She makes micro-choices—rotating the sundial, kneeling, photographing, sketching—that respond to the unfolding discovery. However, these choices are reactive and observational rather than decisive turns that narrow options or impose cost. The character is present in setup, middle, and ending, satisfying all three gates, but her agency is mild. She shapes one key beat (rotating the sundial triggers the glow) and participates in closure (sitting with understanding), which lifts the score into the mid-5s. Removing her specific seeker identity would require substantial edits, but her choices do not drive reversals or visible sacrifice.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>7.3</grade><comment>The antique pocket sundial appears early, is used in two distinct beats (examining it at opening, rotating it counterclockwise to trigger the canal's glow), and is present in the final paragraph ("closed her fingers around the sundial, feeling its residual warmth"). Its unique property—telling time after sunset, revealing hidden inscriptions—directly enables the discovery and charges the ending image. The sundial's warmth and the inscriptions that emerge under twilight create causal pressure and specificity. It is irreplaceable; a generic compass or map would not serve. However, the sundial does not constrain a difficult choice or impose visible cost; it functions more as key than crucible. This limits the score to the mid-7s rather than 8+.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.2</grade><comment>Hindsight clarity is thematically present in the final paragraphs: "every failed expedition had been preparing her for exactly this moment of hindsight clarity" and "knowing now what secrets it held." However, the concept is more stated than enacted. Mira's understanding arrives as revelation rather than through a pattern of misreadings corrected by costly on-page choices. The concept does not shape tactics or create friction in the middle; it is claimed at the end as a thematic label. It satisfies setup (past failures mentioned) and payoff (ending reflection), but lacks middle development where hindsight clarity would alter a present decision. This two-gate structure with thin middle integration places it in the low-mid band.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>3.1</grade><comment>"Thoughtfully clear" appears once in the final line ("beneath its thoughtfully clear surface") as a descriptor rather than a trait that constrains action. The attribute is ornamental, echoing the theme of misdirection and clarity but not shaping any on-page choice or imposing a trade-off. It is absent from setup and middle beats, appearing only at closure as a rhetorical flourish. With no development or causal pressure and only weak payoff presence, the score remains low. Swapping it for "deceptively calm" or "misleadingly simple" would require minimal edits and no structural change.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Salvage (the action) is signaled early in the title of a paragraph: "With serene determination, Mira began to salvage what she could from the revelation." She photographs, sketches, and documents—actions that constitute a beat of purposeful response. The action is present in setup (implied by her legend-seeking), middle (the salvage beat), and closure (plans to "document everything properly" tomorrow). However, the action does not drive a major turn or impose visible cost; it is methodical preservation rather than a high-stakes choice. It shapes one key beat but is not indispensable—"record" or "capture" would serve nearly as well. This two-to-three gate presence with moderate causal work places it in the mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Training instincts" is signaled in the passage "Through years of training her instincts in forgotten places, Mira had learned to trust the unreasonable." The method appears in setup and is referenced at closure ("the faithful emptiness of trained instincts"). However, its mechanics are vague—what does "training instincts" look like on the page? Mira rotates the sundial and observes, but we do not see her instincts constrain or enable a specific choice in the middle beats. The method is more told than shown and does not shape attempts or tactics under pressure. With setup and weak payoff but missing middle development, it satisfies two gates but remains replaceable and conceptually thin, placing it in the high 4s.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.6</grade><comment>The twilight barge canal is present from the opening line and anchors the entire narrative. The canal's glowing water provides causal pressure (the sundial only works at this specific angle of twilight), and the setting's liminal quality (neither day nor night) reinforces theme. The canal is used in setup, middle (the glow and blueprints appearing in the water), and closure (watching it return to ordinary darkness). It constrains Mira's timing and supplies the resource (water as medium for blueprints) that enables discovery. The setting is irreplaceable—move the scene to a rooftop or forest, and the logic breaks. Strong causal work and closure linkage justify mid-7s, though the setting does not impose a high-stakes tactical choice or visible cost.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>2.6</grade><comment>"The silence of morning radio" appears once early: "The morning radio in her boat cabin had offered only silence when she'd tried it at dawn—a technical failure that somehow felt prophetic." This timeframe marker is ornamental and does not tighten decisions or shape tactics. Morning is past; the scene unfolds at twilight. The silence does not recur or constrain choice. With only weak setup presence and no middle development or payoff, the element is largely absent from the story's causal structure. It could be removed with no impact on momentum or closure. The score reflects minimal integration, present but functionless.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Mira's desire to understand the architecture of lies is signaled in the opening ("She had spent three years chasing legends") and explicitly named in the middle ("The architecture of lies he'd left behind wasn't about false buildings"). The motivation drives her presence on the canal and her decision to rotate the sundial. It is present in setup, middle, and closure (the final reflection on Viktor's genius). However, the motivation is more intellectual than conflicted—there is no on-page friction between this want and a competing cost or fear. It shapes the narrative spine but lacks the dramatized collision of wants versus prices that would lift it into the high 7s. Solid integration with moderate causal work justifies mid-6s.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>"Serene upheaval" is signaled explicitly: "The upheaval in her understanding felt paradoxically calm" and "she simply sat with the serene upheaval of understanding." The tone is coherent throughout—contemplative yet charged, calm acceptance paired with revelation. The oxymoron captures the story's emotional register and modulates with pressure (the sundial warms, the water glows, Mira documents with "serene determination"). The tone charges the final image: sitting with quiet understanding as the canal returns to darkness. It appears in setup (half-light, murky stillness), middle (calm discovery amid glowing water), and closure (serene acceptance). Strong coherence and closure linkage justify high 7s, though the tone is maintained rather than dynamically tested under peak stress.</comment>
