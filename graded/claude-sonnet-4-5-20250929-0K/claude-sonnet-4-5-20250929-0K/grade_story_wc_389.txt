<question>1</question><grade>6.8</grade><comment>Elara's isolation and obsessive listening are established, but her transformation to "I choose the shadows" feels unmotivated—no prior friction between her scientific curiosity and darker allegiance is dramatized. The choice arrives because the prophet asks, not because competing values collide on the page. Interior contradiction is absent; she moves from lonely believer to shadow-shaper without visible cost or foreclosed path. Embodied emotion is thin: "heart slam against her ribs" is the lone physical marker in a pivotal beat.</comment>

<question>2</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Drive lens reads Situational/Accumulative hybrid: fragmented signals cohere into direct contact, forcing Elara's stance crystallization. Closure is Charged Poise—"The rise had begun. The allegiance had shifted"—but the cost remains assertion rather than demonstrated loss; no prior option is visibly foreclosed. Orientation anchors late: "three years alone" and "observatory" appear early, but the cobalt portico and storm context take several paragraphs to solidify spatial grounding. The prophet's test-and-invitation structure is told in retrospect ("had been waiting for her specifically") rather than earned through on-page reversals.</comment>

<question>3</question><grade>7.8</grade><comment>The cobalt glass portico is handled across multiple beats—filtering light, reflecting her face, framing the storm—and charges the final sanctuary image with tangible atmosphere. The stormlit observatory supplies sensory constraint (lightning, clouds, isolation) that pressures her choice toward the shadows. Spatial choreography is clean: equipment, glass, microphone, and her position remain coherent. Minor: the "sea of clouds that churned with perpetual lightning" reads slightly ornamental in the opener but is paid off through recurring storm imagery that mirrors escalation.</comment>

<question>4</question><grade>6.2</grade><comment>Dominant stake—proving the broadcasts exist and securing contact—is signaled early and tightens when the prophet addresses her directly. The tightening is clear: she moves from passive listener to active participant. Agency at closure is a spoken choice ("I choose the shadows"), but it doesn't narrow prior options with visible cost; the path she refuses (comfortable daylight) was never on the page as a live temptation. No reversal or complication tests her commitment; the prophet's offer is accepted without friction or trade-off.</comment>

<question>5</question><grade>6.6</grade><comment>Theme—choosing ancient shadows over comfortable certainty—emerges through Elara's isolation and the prophet's riddles, but the final paragraph states it outright: "The rise had begun. The allegiance had shifted." This crosses into thematic echo, reducing resonance. The cobalt glass as witness/lens is a promising motif, but it doesn't constrain a choice or reweight meaning at closure; it remains decorative. The prophet's test is asserted in retrospect rather than earned through scene pressure, weakening the central question's dramatization.</comment>

<question>6</question><grade>7.1</grade><comment>Single POV with stable third-limited distance; perceptual signature is coherent (Elara notices signal patterns, storm fractals, light through glass). Dialogue feels natural and goal-driven in both her transmission and the prophet's riddles. Minor overwriting in peak beats: "hope and terror warring in her chest" and "shock of recognition" lean toward label-speak when embodied detail would sharpen. The prophet's voice carries subtext and advances plot, but Elara's diction remains consistent under pressure.</comment>

<question>7</question><grade>6.9</grade><comment>Rhythm varies and figurative language is vivid ("barnacle made of stone and glass," "breadcrumbs from a dying star"), but density drops in the final third: "a future she'd only imagined in her most fevered dreams was finally, impossibly, starting to take shape" recycles sentiment already established. "Hope and terror warring" and "shock of recognition" are stock emotional phrases. No major loops, but the closing paragraph over-explains closure instead of trusting the image. Information density is high early, then softens into summary.</comment>

<question>8</question><grade>6.4</grade><comment>Lonely-visionary-receives-mysterious-transmission is a familiar template, and the story doesn't transform it through non-obvious stakes or world logic—her choice to "shape the dawn" lacks on-page friction or cost that would make the premise specific. The cobalt portico and storm setting are vivid, but the emotional arc (isolation → vindication → allegiance shift) follows expected beats. The prophet-as-test reveal is told rather than earned, reducing ingenuity. Risk-taking is moderate; the lyric style elevates atmosphere but doesn't challenge reader expectations structurally or thematically.</comment>

<question>9 A</question><grade>5.8</grade><comment>Elara (lonely visionary) is present throughout and makes the closure choice ("I choose the shadows"), but the choice is reactive to the prophet's question rather than arising from internal contradiction or prior cost. Her visionary trait enables the plot but doesn't constrain it; her loneliness is backdrop rather than active pressure. Two beats: listening/transcribing and responding to the prophet. Closure linkage is clear but the causal pressure is mild—she observes, then accepts an invitation without visible trade-off.</comment>

<question>9 B</question><grade>6.7</grade><comment>Cobalt glass portico appears in at least four beats: opening description, filtering storm light, reflecting her face, framing the final sanctuary image. It supplies atmospheric texture and minor symbolism (filtering raw power into beauty), but doesn't constrain a choice or alter tactics—Elara could conduct the same actions without it. The final beat reweights it as "witness and lens," charging the closure image somewhat. Setup early, reappears at closure, but causal pressure and irreplaceability are low.</comment>

<question>9 C</question><grade>4.8</grade><comment>"Variant allegiance" is present as theme (the prophet speaks of "allegiance split like light through prisms" and loyalty fracturing), but it doesn't shape on-page stakes or tactics. Elara's shift from university skeptic to shadow-shaper is told in backstory; no competing loyalty pressures her present choice. The concept is ornamental—label-only mention without embodied conflict or cost. Present in dialogue and closing assertion, absent from dramatized action.</comment>

<question>9 D</question><grade>5.2</grade><comment>"Lyrically prophetic" describes the broadcast fragments ("crown of morning," "shadows remember what dawn forgets") and Elara's notebook style. It enables the plot (she stitches syllables together) but doesn't constrain her; the trait is aesthetic rather than causal. One functional beat: her months of transcription. No visible trade-off or cost tied to the lyric nature of the prophecy. Setup early, recurs in mid-story fragments, but swappable with "cryptic" or "coded" without structural loss.</comment>

<question>9 E</question><grade>6.1</grade><comment>"Unfold" appears in the storm's lightning ("lightning unfold across the cloudscape in branching fractals") and the prophet's invitation ("an invitation unfolding across time"). The storm image mirrors her choice, and the retrospective realization charges the test-reveal. Two beats: visual motif and thematic echo. It's poetic but not causal—the plot would survive without this exact verb. Payoff at closure is present but the action itself doesn't redefine options or tactics.</comment>

<question>9 F</question><grade>7.4</grade><comment>Fragmented radio frequencies are the method throughout: Elara adjusts receivers, stitches syllables across bandwidths, monitors signals. The mechanics matter—static swells, clarity shifts, and her rigged microphone all appear. Three beats: opening transcription, direct contact, final instructions. The method shapes her tactics (months of patient listening) and enables the closure choice. Signaled early, recurs, and participates in the ending. Irreplaceable: no other medium would preserve the fragment-assembly labor.</comment>

<question>9 G</question><grade>7.2</grade><comment>The stormlit observatory above clouds supplies isolation that enables three years of uninterrupted listening and frames the closure as sanctuary. The storm pressures the atmosphere and mirrors escalation; the elevation isolates her from "comfortable daylight." Three beats: opening anchor, storm imagery during contact, final sanctuary framing. The setting constrains her choice by making solitude necessary and charges the ending image. Micro-setting (cobalt portico, equipment, microphone) also functions as spatial anchor.</comment>

<question>9 H</question><grade>4.6</grade><comment>"Across the rise of a prophet" frames the timeframe as the prophet's emergence, but on-page time is vague. "Three years alone" and "months of listening" are mentioned, yet tonight's contact feels static—no ticking clock tightens her decision. The rise is asserted at closure ("The rise had begun") without prior escalation beats that track its progress. Setup present (backstory), no middle development pressure, closure mentions it as completed fact. Timeframe is declared, not dramatized.</comment>

<question>9 I</question><grade>6.3</grade><comment>Elara's motivation—to prove wonder exists and "shape the dawn"—is stated early and drives her isolation and listening. The choice beat at closure directly addresses it ("Teach me to shape the dawn"). Two beats: backstory reflection on leaving the university and the closure decision. Friction is thin: no competing want (safety, connection) pressures the choice on the page. The "comfortable daylight" she rejects was never a live temptation. Motivation is clear but not conflicted in action.</comment>

<question>9 J</question><grade>5.4</grade><comment>"Gritty whimsy" is attempted through lyric diction ("barnacle made of stone," "breadcrumbs from a dying star") layered over isolated-scientist setting. The tone modulates somewhat—wonder in the storm imagery, darker mysticism in the shadow/dawn language—but the final paragraph turns earnest and declarative, losing the whimsy. Setup present (opening style), recurs mid-story, but closure shifts toward portentous assertion. Coherence slips; the grit (three years alone, storm violence) and whimsy (lyric fragments) don't fuse at the ending.</comment>
